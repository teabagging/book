I get it! If it's not easy to use, people will not enjoy my web site, and may not return. Steve Krug has watched how people use web sites, and the concepts in his book are smart and, well, common sense. When I go looking for something on the net, I too, don't want to think, until necessary. I just want to click on the obvious and get where I am going, much like scanning the newspaper until I find what interests me, then I focus. I wish that every site I visit was built around usability, because \\"clever and intricate\\" is usually not why I am there. This book spells it out in a quick-read that is very clear and concise, and I am very glad I found it before I built my web site."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Last term during graduate course of HCI (Human computer interaction), my professor made a WebCT forum thread called \\"HCI Resources\\". Students were to post entries ranging from web based HCI resources to newspaper articles and books which they've found useful. Krug's \\"Don't make me think\\" subtitled as \\"A common sense approach to web usability\\" has made quite a mark among the listings by multiple mentions and was highlighted in several other assignment posts. This is when I started reading it and despite the common belief that technical books are selective reads, \\"Don't make me think\\" is an addictive page turner in its right.Krug's book is generally based on KIS (Keep it simple) principle and is an easy read. Like the topic, book is aesthetically well designed and organized into distinct chapters addressing different topics of web usability and HCI in general. Chapter titles are not your-usual-everyday-headlines but rather Daily Onion style ones depicting the theme discussed in the chapter. Krug's laws of usability may seem like common sense to most of us but you'd be amazed to see how many websites around us don't follow these simple guidelines to enhance the user experience.This two hundred page book is divided into eleven chapters and definitely deserves to be called \\"an illustrated guide on making your web presence meaningful!\\" Steve Krug has worked hard in providing us concrete details and no-fluff advice on all things web usability. With gentle wit and humor, he emphasizes on web designing for scanning instead of reading, presenting simple mindless choices to user, providing meaningful and short text and realization of business requirements for frequent changes. Along with pertaining illustrations, author has provided the reader interesting scenarios, comments, usability testing advice and web accessibility measures. For a web designer, developer, an application development manager or a technology devout CTO, this is a mind-opener towards realization of HCI's importance in the business. \\"Don't make me think\\" makes you think how important it is to understand that usability is not the enemy of design and contrary to common belief, it augments a good design. Among several acclaimed HCI books (for instance \\"User Interface Design and Evaluation - Morgan Kaufmann 2005, ISBN: 0-12-088436-4\\") and ACM papers I have been through, I've found Krug's laws to be most relevant and practical. It's a highly recommended reading for web designers, content managers, web developers and all others who utilize web as core business tool or accessorize on it."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is an excellent book on web site usability.

It's not your usual boring industry-read."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Even if you have conducted usability testing and think you know what constitutes a usable web site, read this book! Krug has distilled years of experience into a few principles that are easy to grasp but not always so easy to implement. His insights are sometimes counterintuitive and often not what a designer would want to hear. (I know because I am a web designer!)For example, his characterization of how people really approach web pages is quite an eye-opener. The designer may think that the user will take an orderly approach and read each section of the page, but here's how Krug describes the reality:\\"Look around feverishly for anything that a) is interesting, or vaguely resembles what you're looking for, and b) is clickable. As soon as you find a halfway-decent match, click. If it doesn't pan out, click the Back button and try again.\\"If designers can swallow their pride and discard their preconceptions, they can learn here what it takes to make the web a more pleasant and usable experience for everyone."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is an expensive book (list price) for something less than 200 pages. Nonetheless the advice within it is worth every penny. I won't repeat what other reviewers have to say about the content. But please note that my copy fell apart before I'd finished the first read. The binding is awful. The pages fell out in ever increasing chunks until all I now have left is the cover and a bunch of sections that I have to keep stuffing back when I put the book away. And, it's a book that I refer to frequently."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I like to wait a week or 2 after reading a book to decide how much I really got out of it. The answer for this book was \\"not much\\". The main take-home messages were \\"don't use so many words\\" and \\"usability testing is important and easy to do yourself\\". I just didn't get much out of it. The look & feel of most of the examples were so dated it was painful at times. Most of the content was really shallow and I didn't think told me any more than I already knew. I guess I would recommend not getting this book if you have ANY previous experience reading web design journals or any other books on the subject. That being said, some of the examples in the book were worth seeing, and I liked the for-anyones-use letters to bosses who want you to do terrible things at the end of the book.I was also really interesting the the usability testing portion of the book - but it was also too shallow.

I've read many books on designing web sites and this one was the best."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"For those of us who do not design Web sites but must distill what makes them effective, this is a great resource. Design and usability expert Steve Krug has pulled together an easy-to-read book that is not only instructive but visually appealing and often amusing. His tenets are basic, but he is smart enough to recognize how everyone has an opinion on Web design and not necessarily a very informed one. Krug's philosophy is that the most effective Web sites come from solid, integrated design that addresses a need tangible to the user. He spends the bulk of the book proving just how valid his philosophy is.The author cites successful examples recognizable to even the most mundane surfer, for example, the tabular navigation structure of Amazon. But he doesn't shy away from those sites he finds lacking like the now-defunct Productopia site, which I agree had a confusing home page. Krug even presents site redesigns given his druthers, and the improvement is quite discernible. Using the helpful analogy of street signs, the author identifies the criticality of using persistent navigation, clear site sections and utilities and a search tool as components of a highly usable site. In order to engage the reader, Krug provides what he calls \\"trunk test\\" sites in which he tests us to identify missing elements and attempts to elicit site improvements. I particularly like this approach since it helps make Krug's guiding principles resonate more clearly.The last part of the book provides a precise overview of usability testing. He provides helpful examples of questions to ask users and even includes a session transcript he conducted himself. Krug strongly believes in not structuring the testing to the point where honest feedback cannot be attained. In fact, he feels that instead of placing the onus on one expensive scientific test that it makes far more sense to conduct many simple affordable tests from beginning to end. I agree with Krug that the value of testing does not come from the collection of quantitative data but rather the qualitative findings that lead toward better design decisions. Krug expresses some similarly strong opinions about home page design and the credibility of so-called subject matter experts. Fortunately, with a decade under his belt at leading Internet companies like Netscape and AOL, he is certainly someone that deserves your attention."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Excellent book.

Don't Make Me Think gets you thinking in the mind of the user about how best to present your site in order for users to get the most out of it.It's not a big book and you could probably summarise its contents in a few pages.

Now.It's great at explaining why usability needs to be the primary concern in developing any sort of interface. The way a user looks at a site is very different than the way a designer does, and \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" points these things out clearly and easily.Even the title is a lesson, one of the most important in the book; \\"Don't Make Me Think.\\" If the interface makes the user think when they don't need to, it's bad. Cartoons, short chapters, and plenty of illustrations make this a quick, light read that will leave you convinced to spent more time on usability.While the book's shortness is one of its strengths, I'd say it's also its only weakness. It convinces you to spend more time on usability, but doesn't go too much into how. But that's covered in many other books, and a few are even given at the end."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"As a graphic designer for over ten years I paid little attention to the conventions of web site design and definitely not the SEO end of it. Krug's book has opened my eyes to the importance of keeping it simple and identifiying the \\"visual rhythm\\" of a site and even more so the importance of a consistent structure.All too often designers want to do something different but if it's a product or service you're trying to sell, you're doing that business a disservice by making it difficult to process visually and intellectually. When using the web people \\"thin slice\\", (Malcolm Gladwell's book \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\" delves into this topic of the immediate perceptions of the brain) they know what it is that they're looking for, want the quickest route to it and know at a glance if they've found it.Today's website is \\"the new business card\\". That first impression is possibly the only one you'll make, so make it your best. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is creating websites or having one designed."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"As designers we are constantly struggling to please our bosses, who often don't agree with the way we design things and want it done their way, which, as any designer can tell you, is never a good way. There is a reason behind our madness. Everything else is just clutter on a page. Steve Krug's book \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" helped me put my frustrations into words that others could understand, so that when I explain, \\"Element A clashes with element B,\\" or \\"This design needs to be simplified because of X, Y, and Z,\\" I'm not met with a bunch of blank stares.This book is excellent in every way - well written, beautifully designed, visually interesting, fun to read, and/or - if you don't have a lot of time - easy to skim through just to pick up a few pointers (though it's well worth a good read... or two.) The author writes to the experienced designer and also to the layman who's just starting out. If you're new to web design, you'll learn TONS; if you're a seasoned pro, you'll get a solid refresher and maybe even pick up on a few new things.And although this book is geared toward web design, there is so much in it that is applicable to graphic design in general. The title alone is a resounding example: Don't make me think. If your designs - whether for internet marketing, billboards, magazines, or whatever - require people to look twice, or think too hard, you risk losing them."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Practicing what he preaches throughout his 2nd edition of \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" Krug gives the reader a quick yet deep change in perspective on how one perceives the web, in a book that can be completed on a short flight. Even the text layout itself is presented by Krug in a \`satisficable' format, as if in a branding effort similar to that of a site. The idea of \`satisficing' - scanning for the first reasonable option as opposed to taking the time to find the \`best option' before clicking, is one of the first major common senses Krug emphasizes. The conversational flow of content adds to the ease at which one absorbs these points, especially because as you read through, you feel as if you're sitting at a coffee shop with your favorite professor while he casually tells you how he really feels on the topic.While starting off, seemingly, as a broad overview of general usability, one questions whether or not this fun-to-read looking book will actually have anything other than fluff to offer - once you read a bit more, you realize that in its simplicity, major back-to-the-beginning lessons are going to become very salient points. This in itself is essentially his point. A website should be easy to understand, \`muddle through,' and should only have the absolute essential information on it. Krug demonstrates these overall points himself: he breaks everything down in plain English, organizes the ride in a way that makes sense, and keeps it to 200 pages. This is a major lesson: get rid of half of what is on the page, and then get rid of half of what is left. This of course seems impossible, but once you work through some of his examples, and review his interpretation a few pages later, you realize how obvious this actually is. Many of his points hit home in a similar vein.One of the major \`aha' moments for me happened after a few chapters of the baby boomer culture references Krug consistently makes use of (i.e. comparing some sites to a letter from Publisher's Clearing House, or comparing browsing to standing in Sears). These \`dated' references explain things in a way that my parents would understand, which made me realize, particularly after reading the testing chapter (which may be the best example of overlooked common sense), that designers completely forget to make their design appropriate for the older generation, and users with little web familiarity. Basically, if your mom, who still thinks yahoo is the internet, can understand your site, then you've got a winner. How easy is that?While Krug's lessons can be interpreted as classically Norman and Nielsen reminiscent in an underlying manner (i.e. his section on why tabs work), his points are always easy to understand immediately as a novice. It's sometimes as if you already knew all of this somewhere in the back of your head. This is a great introduction on usability and testing with minimal technical implications, which gives the reader a sense of what there is to learn about the subject as a whole, while providing the tools and recommended further reading to dig deeper once finished as added value.Posting this review on Amazon will hopefully greatly please Krug, who nearly gives the site a perfect usability score. Probably because it is the only site my mom would ever muddle through successfully to a review of any book."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"If you ever wanted to reach into your computer screen and throttle the jerk who made that annoying website, the author does it for you.

If your pages are easy to use and make sense to the average user, people are likely to stick around. If they do, you are more likely to influence them to buy and recommend you to others. He is interested in lowering your bounce rate and increasing the time people spend on your site.Your site does not have to be the most beautiful, but it has to be easy to navigate and functional. It also has to make sense. Don't frustrate your customers.He talks about usability testing as an early practice to find out how your site is coming along. Before investing too much effort creating a site that the development team loves, make sure consumers will love it also and be able to navigate it.He is not interested in SEO per se in his thinking. A search engine will be able to find you and rank you if your pages are well thought out and carry proper labels. In his mind, ranking high in a search is only useful if people actually stick around and use the site for its intended purpose.Steve gives enough information for you to do your own usability testing for very little expense.I highly recommend this book.I also recommend:The Truth About Search Engine OptimizationPhillip C.

While the examples in this edition are slightly outdated, the information remains. Similarly, it remains broadly applicable to other aspects of design, such as software or complex system user interfaces.I found this in certain fundamental ways to be quite basic, in that he doesn't expound on practical limitations of large site development.

Over 95% of web design is wasteful and just awful and this book highlights that fact. This book is not a How-To book but a What-Not-To-Do which brings home the point even better.

It's style is based on the principles Krug lays forth of simplicity, minimize textual content, and don't tax people's already overloaded brains. The way the book was designed, thus, has Krug practicing what he preaches, at all of our benefit.I have been in a position in corporate America to manage a corporate web site since December of 2006. After some precursory research on my favorite little book store: Amazon, I came up with Krug's web usabilty book on favorite listmania after favorite listmania. \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" made it on the top list for web designers, web page project managers, business owners, and average Joes and Jill like you and me. So I wanted to start my professional reading with a book that had some common collective wisdom behind it. Lo and behold, I was not disappointed.Krug's book is probably best read through practice. I have already spouted off several of his principles at our weekly web page project meetings and I can tell folks are looking at me a little different these days. It could be because I'm going through my mid-life crisis and started wearing a goatee and using all this metero hair product, but I don't think that's the reason alone. I suspect it's because I scanned Krug's cartoons and sent them out to the members of our working group and executive council. I love the frame that has the project manager getting caught up in a web page design \\"religious debate,\\" between a creative designer and a practical programmer with a thought bubble over her head saying, \\"I hate my life.\\" Funny stuff. You'll have to read this book and sit through one of the web page design meetings to see its true truth and wisdom.Though I've learned if you try to enact some of Krug's principles like having navigation tabs similar to those found on Amazon, you just may start some religious debates of your own. The book has a little something for everyone. For the web page design and management neophytes like myself, it has to be one of the best introductions to the ins and outs of what really works on web sites for engaging Internet users in such a way that keeps them coming back for more. For seasoned professionals in the industry, Krug's book will no doubt cause you to be challenged in your thinking, wrestle with how to gain control back from your overly-busy home page, and what can now be done with all that text you were stuffing your overly boring corporate site that no one really bothers to read.For me the book started to drag with the two sections of web site testing. But, we recently stood up a new functionality feature that was in sore need of troubleshooting testing before pushing it live. Believe it or not, designers and ad agency managers don't catch very many mistakes before letting their clients view the page. So I found myself referring back to Krug's book to see how best to approach testing. As it turned out our work team, and some family members, caught the majority of the mistakes and folks were very happy with the final product. Another thing to watch out for is that Krug is giving advice based on what works best for the user of web page sites. Some of his advice is contrary to what I've experienced in my professional life in regards to search engine optimization. Krug says to cut out extraneous and unneeded text which is all fine and good for your web page readers, but will not get your page optimized (when a person types in keywords to yahoo or google...your page hitting the top of the search results list). So, just watch for that if you are more interested in people finding your web site vs. having an optimally pleasant experience once they get there.So, Steve Krug is my new best friend and has helped me keep my job for another month. I think if you pick up a copy of, \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" you will be thinking Krug is your best friend too, with his egregious wit and practical knowledge of what works and doesn't on Internet web sites. He even does a minor overhaul of Amazon's site. You won't want to miss it. ...mmw"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Steve's book not only had some awesome usability concepts and practical advice and techniques, but I really liked the writing style as well and the examples given.

Thank you for a great book (it is actually more than a book, more of a philosophy and a methodology) and also for the inspiring writing and thinking style!

I use this philosophy for just about everything - the easy, repetitive stuff should be so easy you do not have to think about it while freeing up our brain power for life's challenges and the fun stuff. So it goes with good design and usability. That is the essence of this book, basic web design practices which will provide the user with a pleasant experience when visiting your website.Here are what I consider the highlights of this book:1. Usability - The author preaches good usability and this shines through in this book. The book is easy to read, has nice diagrams, and simple explanations and examples.2. Short - This book is short and to the point while providing a good overview of usability. The goal of the author was to write the book so a potential reader could finish within a long plane flight. After reading this book I consider myself much better versed in usability than prior to with minimal investment of time.3. Examples - There are some pretty solid examples here. One particularly memorable example was in the form of screen captures of what the Web designer designs and what the Web user sees. Point taken.4. Recommended Reading - The author provides some good recommendations in the form of books and websites. A good explanation is provided as to why each item is recommended.Here are what I consider the drawbacks of this book:1. Design Recommendations: This is a very subjective (and therefore heated) topic for many. Although there is some solid advice on basic design to ease the user experience I found some of the recommendations (and examples) to be a bit utilitarian for my liking. Fun design and ease of use is a tricky balancing act - so this is not necessarily a hit against the book but rather a note of difference in style. This is not a flashy design book, but more functional in nature.2. Humor: This is another subjective area. Although I prefer humorous treatment of otherwise potentially boring topics (Seth Godin is one of my favorite authors in the field of Marketing) I found the humor to be a bit dated and did not really appeal to me. This should not stop someone from purchasing the book, but worth noting nonetheless.Overall I found this book to be a good overview of the subject of website usability by a credible source. Given the short amount of time it will take to read the book, I believe it is worthwhile for those who create websites, are involved in the marketing function in a company who has a website, or an individual who is interested in learning about usability."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is a very useful introductory text on usability.

More particularly, the harder one has to work to figure out how to use something, the worse it's designed; web site use should be obvious (or at least self-explanatory). I say \\"seemingly\\" intuitive because it ought to be intuitive but a lot of programmers, especially inexperienced ones, forget that.While this book is geared towards entry-level people, it will serve as an important reminder to seasoned professionals of the basics of good design and user-friendliness.

While some design patterns stay the same, some evolve and become expected with the advent of newer technologies.Don't waste your time with this book, and buy a more recently written book for people who really want to know about usability."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I have said for many years that \\"there isn't one programmer who doesn't think he he can't do design, and there isn't one who can.\\" -- Steve Krug comes pretty close to proving that we can learn, though. This book is wonderful; it makes the essence of good design so clear that it seems obvious, seems like you've known it all along.This book should be read by anyone who has any intention of coming near a software development process. If you're going to be in the room, you need to have read this book. Otherwise, sit outside and stay very quiet."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"For me this is one of the more pointless books that I have bought. Years ago I think this would have been a great read. But these days there are so many great examples of clean,user friendly and consistent sites that reading a book like this is not really needed. Just take a look at the more popular sites these days to see what to do (Amazon.com was an example used in the book).If your still not sure what makes a clean, user friendly site I guess that you can buy this book. I mean there are a lot of terrible sites these days as well.

I agree with just about everything Krug says, and it's nice to hear him say it. Most of what he says is (or should be) common sense. However, there are so many web sites that violate his advice that it must not be common sense.Read the book, just don't expect any profound insights.

Steve Krug cuts through to the point on every page and it is the first book about my day job that I've finished in less than three (3!) days.The best part of this book is how it gives you the tools to start practicing Web Usability as soon as you've finished it and at such a low cost that you start to wonder why you didn't come up with this before!It is an easy read but the content is a gold mine for all you webdiggers out there.

The book discusses in very easy to read, non-technical terms what makes a good web design focusing on not how to create web pages but how users will view and use your site based upon specific criteria.The first chapter begins by giving a overiew of a high-level explanation of what users actually respond to in web layout and design. For instance, placement of text, type of buttons, graphical display, useage of drop-downs and navigation, etc.The next few chapters gives alot of detail in how users actually view a web page. From how people read web pages (actually scan them), to how designers and user see web pages, to the reasoning behind user choies.The middle part of the book focuses on describing what parts of a web page should like to get the desired results from visitors. The author gives great examples of page navigation techniques and what works and what doesn't. The authors description of navuigations techniques of professional desgined sites (Amazon, Gap, MSNBC, About.com) really make it believeable that his suggestions will work with your website too!The end of the book reviews the importance of usability testing and why overlooking this last aspect of web development can decide whether your site is sucessful or not.A great book, with lots of great information. A must buy!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"If you are interested in doing a good job at web design for your web viewers, you must read this book.

The book is full of good and easy-to-use advises."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Dealing with web designers and company owners can be a real problem because of their warped view of what creating a webpage means. Being an IT consultant, many of the purely technical arguments become nonsense to them, whereas debunking theirs becomes counterproductive. This book can be read by anyone who's involved in web design and deployment, to get a feel of the real issues faced by the end user, in a clear and practical way.I particularly like the self-assessment examples: they baffle designers and CEOs by showing how wrong are the models that they typically come up with, but also explain how to fix that and change their mindset. I also love the sample e-mails intended to persuade designers and CEOs on their bad ideas (\\"Help! My boss wants me to...\\")."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I am in the beginning of my web design and development journey, so i think this was perfect reading for my starting point. It was easy to read. The author's points and examples brought everything together for a good understanding of the concepts related to usability.

This information is a must-read for anyone in web design and development."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I just love this book!

Before you publish that next website, read this book. It's a quick read, only a few hours, but it'll save you days or weeks of headaches later on.

Krug provides great examples and makes the subject fun. Some of it is a tad dated, as I believe it was written in 2005. I assume a 3rd edition will include more recent examples and delve into social media sites, etc."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"That pretty much sums it up.The chapters are very well organized. Though this book covers a lot of material, it is done in a logical and concise manner. His points are reinforced through great examples that pick apart what is good and bad, or can be improved upon.And it made me laugh while I learned. This guy certainly must be top dog in web design if his book is any indication."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book does an excellent job explaining the fine science and art of good website usability.Even my experienced usability and design people say they learned something new in this book. Beyond learning new stuff, one of the best things about this book is that it gives us a new way to explain website usability to people. The many pictures help.I give this to clients all the time. It's good for everyone from CEO's to in-house dev people."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Superb advice on the design of any website, whether public-facing e-commerce site or internal-facing intranet site. It's a quick read that is written with humor and a light touch. The final section on usability testing, with guidlines and sample script, I think is especially valuable (because so often neglected). Krug makes these concepts seem achievable and within reach."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"The book is short by design which makes it an easy read. In the words of the author, \\"you can read it on a flight.\\" Although there are 12 chapters, most of them are fairly short, with only two chapters taking up more than 5 or 6 pages. The author writes with a style that is engaging and witty, which keeps you interested in the book.He starts out with a brief explanation of why he wrote a second edition and what has changed in this book compared to the first edition. Once he gets that out of the way, he dives right into \\"Krug's first law of usability\\" (hint: its the title). He talks about the way many sites implement the same type of features, and what makes one better over the other.Krug points out that there is a big difference between how most designers think users see their site, and how those users actually do see it. Designers tend to think that a visitor to their site will read through every single word on the page, taking in all this great copy and information that we spend so much time on. In reality, users scan pages rather than read them. They load a site and immediately begin looking for something that is close to what they think will let them complete the task they have in mind. After talking through these differences, Krug offers solutions to help a site cater more to the user that just scans.One thing that Krug does keep to a minimum is talk about the proper way to do this or the correct way to do that when building a site. What he does try to convey in this book are some guiding principles for better usability. He discusses proper navigation and sub-navigation techniques as well as arranging content so that it is clear what section of the site a user is in.The two chapters in the book that Krug commits the most time to covers what are probably two of the most important parts of any site: Navigation and the Home Page. He talks at length about navigation, specifically using the navigation to show a user where they currently are and where they have been. In both cases, real world sites are used to illustrate examples of good and bad navigation design. Krug also exalts the usefulness and importance of the breadcrumb.If you have been thinking of conducting usability testing, but wrote it off as a luxury that you or your client couldn't afford, Krug helps smash that myth. With as little as $300, you can run a simple usability test. He even goes as far as to provide details of how to set up the test and a script you can follow if you are unsure of exactly what to ask.All in all, this is a great book for web designers at any level. It helps put little nuggest of information in your head that you can pull out when designing and building a site to improve things as you build them. If you are new to usability, this book will help show you some simple solutions to common usability issues. The bottom line is that improving the usability of your site will improve your site overall, and this book offers the advice that will help you do that."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book came highly recommended by a few different speakers at a conference I attended. I kept hearing people praising it for its simple examples and no BS format. Its a quick read, but there is a lot of information on User Experience, Site Navigation, and User Testing.

A lot of it is obvious if you've given much thought to how people use computers, but most people haven't.This book is a great introduction to designing web pages or applications. You could stop here and build a completely functional piece of software. But really, for those interested in design and the details of typography, grids, color, etc. it's just the start."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Overall, a very good introduction to web site usability and navigation design. It is concise, with little of the \\"fluff\\" commonly found in \\"Dummies\\"-type books. Diagrams and illustrations are plentiful and very useful. Krug does not go into great depth on many of the topics covered, but I don't believe he was trying to. I believe that Krug was aiming for a simple and short introduction to the field, for people who have not been exposed to it yet, and he hit right on target. If you want a short introduction to web usability, this is the book for you.If you're looking for something more detailed, take a look at \\"Designing Web Navigation\\", by James Kalbach (O'Reilly, 2007), which is longer, more dense, with plenty of references to academic studies on usability."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Steve Krug's is one of the best written and most accurate books on web usability.

As more widgets and opportunities for visitor interaction demand page space, keeping it simple, so your visitors go where you want them to go, is even more important. \\"Don't make me think,\\" is not only a good web design practice but is applicable to any type of marketing material or even email communication - words to live by, and I do."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book was exactly what I needed.

Thank you Steve Krug."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a great book on web usability that is as entertaining as it is informative!Krug's first law of usability is the title of the book, \\"Don't make me think!\\" As his wife describes it, \\"If something is hard to use, I just don't use it much.\\" And I think that's true for a lot of us.He notes that most people just scan a page, so you need to act like you're designing billboards when you design your website. He then goes on to provide lots of tips on how to do that.He also emphasizes cutting out unnecessary words...or as he puts it, \\"happy talk must die.\\"This guy is really funny and he definitely knows his stuff.

The insights from this book into how people use a computer-based system allowed me to identify what was wrong with all of the proposed solutions -- such as software designed to handle references, like EndNote. The proposed solutions were too complex, requiring too much new learning and too many steps.In the end we saved thousands of dollars by developing a very simple set of rules for putting together an excel spreadsheet for gathering and sourcing qualitative information -- easy to open, easy to operate, everyone already knows how to use the software.The book was most useful because I was able to wave it in the air and announce \\"people won't use that feature\\" as we discussed different options. It was an antidote to the common tendency to feel that our co-workers \\"aught\\" or \\"should\\" do their work in a particular fashion. E.g. \\"Since documentation is important, people should be willing to spend some time doing it.\\""},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, It's not one that I probably would have purchased on my own, but I had some expense account money to spend and it looked good.

The only thing I can say is I can't believe I never researched usability until now. This book definitely opened my eyes to a whole new aspect of the world of web design.If you are new to web usability, or if you're a \\"one stop shop\\" or a \\"one-man show\\", I highly recommend this book. If you're new to web development, I HIGHLY recommend this book - I wish I had learned about usability from day one!If you're already familiar with web usability or work as part of a team, this book may not be as useful as some of the other books out there.The only thing that kept this book from getting five stars is that the first 40 or so pages fell out of the binding (but stayed together, thankfully.. I was sort of able to glue them back in) within the first few days. I did leave the book open which placed stress on the spine, but still... I've never had that happen to me with any book before. Hopefully a future version will solve this little problem."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to design websites. It is very important for usability. It was designed to be a quick read and is easy to understand. The title of the book even helps me when I'm designing because I think the user doesn't want to have to think about how to navagate through a website, they just want to do what they have to do and move on.This book mostly focuses on e-commerce sites but it still has some good tips that may apply to any website.This book doesn't teach you HTML or any programing it is strictly usability."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is very fun and easy to read.

If you are an advanced user looking to expand your knowledge of useability, etc., then this book may be less than useful. UNLESS...you are a designer with cantankerous clients trying to get you to do something you know is a bad idea. Then you can refer them to this book.This is also a great book for those in Marketing or other departments working with web designers.

I've transcribed the most important topics in the book and I have them hanging next to my computer.After reading this book, you will not look at anything the same. I immediately question Firefox's software updates that force me to click two buttons. I've noticed my DVR suffers from poor usability issues. Everything in my car is now questioned, as are house plans, kitchenware, highway layouts. Everything."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I've read a lot on usability, and this is the single-best source I've seen. Every site designer and developer has to read this book. In fact, everyone on the decision food chain in your organization at least needs to be aware of what Krug teaches us. I will forever use usability testing often and early in the process now. Remember, it doesn't matter how cool your application or website is--if people can't use it, they will get frustrated and leave.

Very cleanly and simply the author describes where are the problems customers/users encounter while browsing the web, and how web contents designers should avoid making users think (more than absolutely necessary) while trying to do something on one's pages (look for/report/buy/pay/etc). The best book I have read in years."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is one of the clearest books I have read related to the web.

This book provides an easy to read, simple approach on how users browse, search and use websites. A must have on any web developers, designers or project managers shelf."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I am taking a HCI (Human Computer Interaction) course, and this book really applies many of the basic principles that we are learning in the class. I picked it up because we are creating a website for our course project, and I wanted to have some details on web usability.Some of the stuff that Steve talks about seems obvious after you read it, but you may otherwise not think of it yourself. The book shows some great examples of what is broken, and how it can be fixed. While it didn't dive into tons of HCI stuff, it was a great introduction to web usability.This was one of the first \\"techie\\" books that I finished cover to cover. It's definitely an easy read. I finished it in a weekend, and I am the slowest reader in the world (ok...maybe not, but pretty close).I also plan on picking up Jakob Nielsen's new one when it comes out in March of 2006."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"The book only took about 3 hours to read, however, there was a lot of good information. I liked the conversational style of writing, and found that the book did a great job of hitting the major points of usability/UX Design. No real earth shattering concepts for those who are current professionals in the User Centered Design field, but could be very helpful for those who are not. Long story short, this book is worth your time, and it is also a good book for a short trip."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"One of the must have books on my reference shelf is \\"Don't Make Me Think, A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" by Steve Krug. I've recommended this book to many people, so I thought it was about time to give it a proper review.One of the things that first drew me to this book when it first appeared was the subtitle. I've said it again and again, but it bears repeating...much of the \\"science\\" of good UI design is just common sense. This begs the question as to why some people find it so hard, and I think the answer lies in the idea of common sense in our society. We are so busy being busy that oftentimes we don't slow down enough to really *think* about a problem and thus the common sense solution eludes us. A book like \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is a great way to make you put on the brakes a little and examine the fundamental principles of usability. For those of you that aren't web developers, don't be scared off. Although the focus of Mr. Krug's book is web design, most of the concepts are equally extensible to other software design workIf you've not read any books on interface design or usability before, this book provides the perfect intro into that world. As he mentions in the forward, this book is for those people or companies that don't have a usability professional on board or can't hire one for some reason or another. By taking the ideas introduced in \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" you can be on your way to doing this work yourself very quickly.The author's writing style is both casual and witty and he follows the advice of his title when explaining new concepts, breaking it down so you can understand the underlying psychology without getting bogged down in terminology or theory. Chapter 1 begins with an introduction to what the author calls \\"Krug's First Law of Usability\\": \\"Don't Make Me Think\\". Simply put, this means that your ultimate goal is to design your interface so that when you look at it, it is immediately evident what you can do and how you go about doing it. In this chapter, Krug explores some of the elements of design that put more cognitive load on us than is necessary and then demonstrates ways to reduce this load. This is done through both the narrative as well as excellent graphics which simply but elegantly display his point.Chapters 2 through 5 begin the exploration of how we really go about using an interface and set forth the guiding principles we need to be thinking about when designing. First, Krug talks about the difference in what we design for (reading, more reading and even more reading in a set pattern) vs. the reality of how people scan through an interface in a seemingly chaotic way. He then extends on the lessons learned here by helping you understand the techniques you can use to design interfaces for scanning rather than reading. He addresses five important things you can do to achieve the goal of capturing user eyeballs as much as possible: creating a clear visual hierarchy, breaking pages into clearly defined areas, minimizing ui noise, making clickable elements obviously clickable and taking advantage of established UI conventions. This first section wraps up with a discussion of why we like \\"mindless\\" choices and the importance of good copywriting and how you need to omit all but the essential words in your design.Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the elements that Krug believes you must get right in your design. Chapter 6 is concerned with laying out the fundamentals behind good navigation. Since this is an area I call a lot of bad designs out on, it's one that I really enjoyed. Krug discusses some of the basic concepts of navigation and why navigation is so important to a user. He deconstructs various navigation conventions and explains why they work or don't work effectively. He also addresses the good use of search, page names, breadcrumbs, and the tab metaphor. Chapter 6 ends with a number of great graphics which show several sites as they were designed and the author's analysis of what was wrong. He then shows a revised version based on what he would do and in some cases also shows the company's own effort at making some improvements. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so it would be good for the reader to spend some time pouring over these excellent examples. Chapter 7 is devoted to the design of the homepage and how to best design that important first impression. As in Chapter 6, there are a lot of great \\"before and after\\" examples to round out the theory.The next two chapters of \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" are concerned with how you make sure you did the right things in your design. That is, they focus on one of my favorite topics, the idea of usability testing. In particular, Krug wants the user to walk away after reading these chapters realizing that usability testing is within reach of every single developer out there. Sure, in the ideal world we'd all have a department of usability experts that are there to critique our designs and help us craft the most user-friendly interfaces possible, but we all know that our day to day jobs are far from the ideal world. Still, Krug argues, you can find value in any amount of testing you can do. Krug espouses some common sense thoughts about usability testing, such as the idea that it is an iterative process, that you should test early and often and that testing even one user is better than testing none. Once he convinces you of the importance of usability testing, he presents some simple to follow instructions on how you can carry out your own tests. As he points out, it doesn't have to be expensive or fancy. You really can do this stuff on a shoestring budget. Chapter 9 ends with a sample excerpt from a test session, which in my opinion is probably worth the cost of the book right there.Krug wraps up the final chapters of the book with a focus on the larger concerns of interface design, such as why usability should be considered a common courtesy, where accessibility comes into the picture and how to deal with a boss that \\"doesn't get it\\". If you just want to cut to the chase and start improving your designs right away you can skip these chapters, but they do a nice job of summarizing at a high level many of the salient points of the book.All in all, \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read and a very practical book for those that aspire to create better interfaces for their users. Coming in at just under 200 pages with lots of clear illustrations, you can probably read this book in a couple of evenings, which is great for those of us intimidated by the 1000 page tomes that populate the computer section in most bookstores. Probably the best part of \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is that it applicable to the work you are doing today. You can read a chapter or two and immediately start putting the concepts into practice and the value you'll get as you do so far exceeds the book's cover price. \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is highly recommended and I hope you make the decision to add it to your reading list today. You don't even have to think about it! :-)"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"If you're involved in developing (as myself) or designing web-sites (or any other software intended for actual people), this book will give you helpful insights in the usability issues you are bound to encounter.The book is very well written, and is fun to read."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"\\"Don't Make Me Think\\" refers to the way people tend to use the web: they don't read they scan. That means that your site needs to be organized to make identification and navigation as instinctive as possible. Having an efficient navigation system and laying out your content to clearly reveal the embedded hierarchy should go a long way towards achieving this goal. Don't forget a good search function.One of the main point the author want's you to get is that having external users to test your site will give you valuable insights on how you can make it work for them. He walks us through such a test scenario, which is quite useful.There is also a chapter on accessibility, which is nice and which gives us an easy way to make our site quite accessible to most. My favorite idea is to add a \\"skip to main content\\" link to the top of all pages. By styling it with a \\"display: none\\" it won't affect any layout would be very useful for blind people using screen readers. Food for hought.Classification is one topic on which I disagree with the author though it's only noted in a footnote. His view is that \\"things\\" should live in one place on your site and if necessary use cross-references to bring people there. I think that \\"things\\" should live in all the probable places a user might want to look for it. On one side you have a hierarchy on the other you have a tagging system. Given growing popularity and ubiquity of tags, I think that this won't be much of a stretch for anyone in the near future.This book was certainly worth reading. I have learnt quite a few things and I recommend it to all web developers."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I'm not a designer and I would by nature make many of the mistakes Krug points out in this great book.

The other day I was asked to review a print media item and I kept saying to the designer - \\"Don't Make Me Think!\\" The idea of designing easy to use, simple to understand websites is so simple that it is often overlooked. This is a fantastic read. I'm halfway through my second reading of it."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Others have said that Krug's book (2nd edition) is for those with little experience. That is exactly why I found it so useful. There are lots of concepts that are common sense, sure. But until they were pointed out I had not even considered them. His point about the usefulness of tabs was particularly useful to me. I am creating a site now and will incorporate them into my design.My only complaint is with the binding. The book was so poorly produced that pages began to loosen and fall out before I was finished with the first reading. I am now looking for a big rubber band to hold everything together. I just hate it when that happens."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Steve Krug's book is full of solid, easily understood advice on web usability. But even more than that, he covers a lot of ground, indirectly, on how to deal with clients (for web designers) and how to think about, plan, and execute a web project (for the rest of us). Add to that the clear layout and design of the book, the engaging writing and humor, and you have probably the best book on usability design on the market."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"This is the best book for beginners in user interface design; managers who don't understand usability and those who appreciate a superb exemplar of persuasive, informative, even entertaining technical communication.

He holds to his goal of being readable in a long plane trip!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Nowadays, most students are faced with the world of HTML and computer science at some point in their academic careers. For me, the first time was in CIS 101 in college. (Yes, there was a second time. It turns out grad school does not assume computer literacy). Although it isn't always part of the formal curriculum, usability is always an underlying theme in technology classes even if it is just a question of whether the HTML textbook is actually written in gibberish or not. Usability is also one of the few fields where anyone, even the computer illiterate, can be an expert.The idea behind usability is simple: Look at a given design and see how accessible it is for users. Anyone can have an opinion on usability and everyone can provide input. All it takes is a clear head and the patience to look at what works (or doesn't) and why. If you use it, you have information about its usability. To get back to the subjects of Computer Science and technology, usability has lately been applied to the world of Web design.Usability consultant Steve Krug lays out all of the basics about Web usability in his book Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability currently in its second edition, published in 2006 after the first edition sold nearly 100,000 copies.As far as titles go, there are few that offer as clear a picture of the book's content as this one. Krug's main point throughout his 185-page guide is that good Web sites don't make users think. Unlike college, Krug posits that using a conventional website should not be an intellectual exercise. It should be simple, it should be neat, and it should be self-evident. In other words, if a user cannot identify the site's purpose, and where to start on said site, just by viewing the homepage something has gone horribly wrong.Krug details how to fix such problems and how to avoid them with usability tests. That may sound self-serving save for the fact that Krug also explains how to conduct usability tests on the cheap without the benefit of a usability consultant such as himself.Written in short chapters packed with illustrations, this book is designed to be approachable and easy to read. Krug is serious about Web usability, but that in no way means his book is stodgy or dry. Examples of usability at work are littered with cartoons and the text maintains a sense of humor. My favorite chapter title (and subtitle) \\"Usability as common courtesy: Why your Web site should be a mensch\\" might offer some idea of what tone to expect from this book.Of course, taking a computer class to meet a core requirement in college doesn't always lead to work in the field of Web design in fact most of the time it leads to an entirely different career. But, in today's technology-driven culture, doesn't everything come back to the Internet eventually?It might just be working as an intern at an online magazine, or a starting position where duties include entering data into online spreadsheets, or it might just be writing your own blog on a site like WordPress or Blogger. Wherever your path leads, knowing something about Web usability and how good Web sites get that way can only help. As more and more information moves to cyberspace, with websites being created and updated all the time, it's important to be prepared by knowing how to analyze not only the information found online but also how it is presented. Don't Make Me Think is one tool that can assist Web users in that preparation."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book to supplement a class I am taking to update my web design skills (I've been involved in web design & content management for over ten years).I was a bit hazy on the \\"infrastructure\\" lesson, so I asked my teacher which book she recommended for extra information. She recommended this one.THANK GOODNESS she did!It's easy to read and understand and it's short so it did NOT end up in the pile o' books I have yet to read (I literally read half of it the day it arrived on my doorstep). It clarified all of my questions and doubts on how to organize a website and how to design for ease of use.This book is a BLESSING in every sense.Thank you so much, Steve, for a fantastic reference!"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I can think of very few sites that couldn't be improved by applying the principles in this book. It does what \\"Web Sites That Suck\\" attempts to do, but instead of giving examples of horrible web sites that are most likely beyond fixing, it uses examples of pretty decent sites that just need a little help. I assume the vast majority of sites fall into the latter category, which is why this book is so useful.The chapter on do-it-yourself usability testing is a real gem -- worth the price of the whole book and then some."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"The book is easy to read, has a lot of screen shots for illustration and writes about the most important usability issues."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Great book that appears simple but really is a great foundation of web principles that you can always go back and refer to.

His takeaways are straightforward, painless, and evergreen. Should be required reading for every design and production person joining your team."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"As the subtitle says, it is mostly common sense. But to have it reinforced like this turns judging web site designs into a much simpler task. I found myself feeling like I had confirmation for many thoughts I have on the subject, but it raised my awareness of different user view points to a higher level. One item that was quite new to me though was the subject of usability testing. He explains his approach quite well and makes it sound quite easy and very useful. If nothing else, it gives you a sense of empathy for various user experiences on the web. Which can only help you improve your design's ability to meet their needs.I highly recommend anyone who is involved with web development in any way to check out this very quick and easy read."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Absolutely brilliant book.

Steve's strategies seem so basic, but anyone who uses the web at all knows that most sites have at least some sort flaw when it comes to usability. Steve's recommendations are by no means a panacea for a site's problems, but they're a great start. Anyone who writes for, develops content for or administers a website at work or home needs to read (and re-read) this book.

The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.In short, there's no reason not to read this book if you're developing for the Web (writing content, programming, etcetera), or working with a team that does so."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"As an owner of two online businesses I found this book to clarify and outline what most owners and developers fail to understand...which is usability / navigation of their sites..this book nails it.

I've seen a couple people here comment that this book is only for beginners, but given the state of MOST sites that I find on the web (yes, this includes e-commerce sites and big brand sites that OUGHT to be very usable), I'd say this book is for ALL LEVELS OF WEB DESIGNERS. Consider it your basic reference for features that every site ought to have in order to be usable and marketable. Also, its a handy source to show to your boss/client when they want to do something silly with their site design-- it's highly quotable and is written to appeal to a business audience."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Steve walks the talk with this beautifully laid out and wonderfully structured book about usability.

Krug outlines the essentials regarding design, hierarchy, navigation, and usability testing (perhaps the most important part of the book). The new edition also includes material on accessibility - he sounds preachier here, but for a good cause.The format is attractive and easily digestible, and the book is short enough to be undaunting, with relevant and colorful illustrations.BTW, I've found a serious flaw in the Amazon reviewer rating system. It only counts \\"helpful\\" votes ... this means that reviews (esp. for controversial books) basically become shouting matches, where people vote \\"no\\" to reviews with points of view they don't like, and vice-versa - regardless of merit or content of the review.

It is a book about good design and making things simple and it does exactly that with a simple layout and clear narrative. This may seem like a small thing but it most definitely is not. Making things very clear and concise is much more difficult than just writing and rambling. This book was designed to be read in a single airplane ride so it is fairly light weight. But this does not mean that the content is not deep.As a web developer, the information in this book in invaluable when attempting to see your work though your user's eyes. Do youself a favor and take this book to heart. The chapter on how to do usability tests for cheap is worth more than the price of the book on its own."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"All in all, while there doesn't seem to be a ton of NEW information for web designers that have been in the field for a few years or more, Steve does a fantastic job of taking all of the bits of knowledge and tying them together in a cohesive, easily understandable structure, shedding new light and insight along the way. That's not to say there is NO new information. Everyone will find something in here that they didn't know before. More importantly, however, are Steve's perspectives into really making what you already know work for you.The book does a great job of breaking down the web design process in an easy to digest step-by-step process, calling out challenges, obstacles, and no-brainers along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed having lots of what I'd picked up over the years brought into focus and examined through new filters.The one thing that I wish this book had is a detachable checklist.

Usability has a lot to do with concise writing, intuitive structure, foolproof web forms, and the optimal blend of content and functionality. He covers many important topics including:* how to write for the web* the difference between usability testing and focus groups* the fierce politics of the home page* navigation structures that work well* usability testing on a shoestring budget* how to interpret test resultsEven if you don't have the resources for a usability test -- in fact, especially if you don't -- you should get this book and follow his simple rules to make your web site ten times more usable."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Desiging an interface is easy.

Chapter organization, page layout, typography, illustrations, paper stock, and use of color combine to make the content clear.Web and book design of course share many concepts.

Novice, intermediate, expert. No matter where you are on the scale, the book provides value to everyone - even managers, testers and project managers. Management likes to get their hands a little dirty when it comes to Web design projects and sharing this book may make the team's life easier.Anyone involved with Web design or usability will recognize most, if not all, of the concepts covered in the book. What makes Don't Make Me Think usable is that it's a great checklist to ensure you've covered all the basics.Krug provides many before and after examples to show how a few changes can enhance a Web site's usability. The illustrations reinforce the concepts covered as well as how visitors use and read a Web site.As for the differences between the first and second editions, the second addition has three new chapters while usability testing shrinks from two chapters to one and with good reason.The testing chapter breaks down the testing process into digestible steps; complete with a script between the tester (user) and the person watching the tester. Too often, we've seen testing get mangled or ignored. With this chapter, teams might find themselves empowered and eager to do testing.The chapter on \\"Usability as common courtesy\\" explores how a site can make or break the \\"reservoir of goodwill\\" as Krug puts it. We arrive at a Web site with some goodwill and depending on how well the site meets or misses our needs; the goodwill level goes up or down. It may only take one mistake to propel visitors to flee.Another new and short chapter is \\"Accessibility, Cascading Style Sheets and you.\\" Krug captures what developers and designers hear when it comes to accessibility and addresses what they fear. He lists five things designers and developers can do make a site accessible without a lot of effort.Finally, the book closes with \\"Help! My boss wants me to...\\" Krug has received plenty emails and questions on the topic to identify two questions that repeatedly come up. He provides email examples for free re-use, so no one has to explain it to the boss.It only takes about two hours or a plane trip to read. The writing is conversational, clear and packs a punch with a dash of humor thrown in. Reading the book is not much different than reading fiction because it flows well and the information sinks in without much effort.If you get this book and have the 1st edition, I recommend keeping both. You might find helpful stuff in the original material not found in the new edition."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Not much too add beyond what many of the other reviewers have said, except that it was a real pleasure to read such an approachable book, and get so many good ideas in such a short amount of time. Note: this isn't a book about theory. It's about what works and doesn't work in practice and that's it. Krug gets right to the heart of the matter on every point. If you're looking for detailed discussions of web design techniques and why they're good or bad, this is not the right book for that."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"First off, let me preface this by admitting that I am not a web designer or information architect expert by any means. I work in tech being a \\"jack of all trades\\" with internet applications where we are always strapped for resources (ie we don't have designers or web producers for this side project, all those resources are devoted to the cash cow at our company). At some times I'm an acting site product manager other times I'm a product marketer.Steve Krug distills \\"everything you need to know\\" into a short book that is written colloquially and deals with real-life web team scenarios, and gives some really simple exercises for reviewing a website.I especially appreciate his beginning most chapters with a real-life example (ie a designer vs a developer disagreeing about the use of a pulldown menu). This shows me he's been in the trenches before, and keeps me interested in what his solution is.His chapter on how to run usability tests on a shoestring budget will help not only me (who'll have to run the tests), but also will provide a lot of background on scenarios where usability efforts tend to not take off within a company. Additionally he provides solutions on how to mitigate these excuses -- he's about how to get things done, not about theorizing.Thanks Steve - another new fan has joined the fold."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"The overriding theme to the book is that anything on your web page that takes more than a fraction of a second of thought is bad. When I worked at the Internal Revenue Service, we were never allowed to post anything that took less than a day of thought.Sure - the topics in this book are obvious. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out yourself if you took the time to do so. But that's the point - Krug took the time to assemble these obvious but numerous issues for you, so you don't have to think through all of the potential problems your web site is likely to have. IRONICALLY, THE REAL VALUE OF THIS BOOK IS NOT IN ANY BRILLIANT INSIGHTS. THE VALUE IS THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN WEB SITE AS YOU READ. That is, simply by taking the time to drift through this light read, you can't help but to ponder how your own web site suffers from each of Krug's common web page problems. You'll undoubtedly end up making a number of improvements to your own site. Krug's small suggested improvements taken collectively really do end up making a big difference to your site. I made at least ten changes to the web site that hawks my own cheesy book (Web Service and SOA Technologies) based on Krug's very good advice.Weakness #1 - The book's pace slows down at the end. I can't help to wonder if Krug was a little concerned that he wasn't going to have enough pages. Do we really need an entire page that tells us that some people are naturally less patient than others? But even at his slower pace, there are still many sentences that make you think (errr....even if you're not supposed to).Weakness #2 - Why didn't Krug design a checklist of issues as the last page? You can't use his table of contents as that checklist since his style is to use titles that don't mean anything without reading each chapter. He needs a summary page like this:* Is it obvious where you can click and where you cannot? Are there \\"hotspots\\" on images that are not obvious?* If a user were to squint and look at your web page, could they discern what each area on the page was most likely about?* Does your search capability have confusing pulldowns?* If a user arrives at any random page on your web site (say, from a search engine), can they figure out what site they are on, what the page name is, what are the major sections of the site, what are the best options on the page, where they are relative to the other pages, and how they can search?* Do your user's eyes have to leap all over the page in order to figure it out?* Does any operation ever take more than a few seconds to figure out?* Does the reader ever have to read through instructions to figure something out? (They won't.)* Is information organized in a clear, visual hierarchy?* Do you violate any web page conventions?* Does your site have excessive images and flashy items on it?* Are your pages reasonably short? (that is, not too much scrolling required)* Does the page have any text on it that isn't absolutely necessary? (like this parenthetical note, for example)* Navigation on your site has to be crystal clear. If the user is \\"looking for a chainsaw\\", do they know if they should look in the \\"tools\\" section or in \\"lawn and garden\\"?* If the user makes a bad guess when navigating your site, is it easy to recover from the error?* Do any of your pages look so different from the others that the user might be confused if they've accidentally hyperlinked off your web site?* When you analyze your site, have you spent the majority of your time thinking only about the higher level pages (rather than the low down, leaf node pages)?* Does every page have a unique identifying name?* Is every page name prominent?* Does the page name ever not match the hyperlink that was used to arrive at that page?* Have you favored the use of navigation tabs? (Krug is a big proponent of tabs.)* Does your home page establish the site mission, hierarchy, and search method? Do users immediately know why they should be on your site and not someone else's?* What items appear \\"above the fold\\" on each page? (that is, without having to scroll down)* Does the site have any current references so users know they are not looking at an old, dead site?* Does the company have a good, descriptive tag line?* Is it clear where the user can search, browse, and find the best your company has to offer?* Are you aware that display space devoted to promoting one item implicitly detracts from other items on the page?* Have you ever observed a completely new user (with no introduction whatsoever) land on your site?* Have you made the mistake of doing no user testing at all because comprehensive testing is too expensive?* Did you perform usability testing very early in web development, like you should?* Did you make the mistake of giving help to your new test user during your usability test?* Does your site blatantly omit obvious information about your company because of embarrassment? Does it conceal information like contact phone numbers?* How quick and easy does your site service its most common request?* How kind is your site to the vision impaired? What happens if you change the browser font setting to \\"largest\\"? Anything?* Does every image have \\"alt text\\"?You may think you don't need to read the book now, but remember the real value of the book is to force you to stop and think a while about each issue. You can't do that blowing through this list in 10 seconds, especially without the examples in the book.Overall - Despite some minor weaknesses, the book is great and offers enormous value. Don't Make Me Think has been one of the best sellers in software books since August 2005 and for good reason. Krug's \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" really does warrant some thought. If you have a web site, there's no question that you should buy this book.Glenn HostetlerAuthor,Web Service and SOA Technologies"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"If I read a book on web design or web usability, the thing that will turn me off the quickest is the dogmatic rantings of a self-proclaimed \\"expert\\" on the subject. It's far too easy to call one's preferences \\"best practices\\" and think that everyone needs to conform to them. Hate it, hate it, hate it! So why did I pick up and read Don't Make Me Think : A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2nd Edition) by Steve Krug? Because it's one of those usability books that actually clicks with me and restores my faith in common sense design techniques.Contents:Guiding Principles: Don't make me think!; How we really use the Web; Billboard Design 101; Animal, vegetable, or mineral?; Omit needless wordsThings You Need To Get Right: Street signs and Breadcrumbs; The first step in recovery is admitting that the Home page is beyond your controlMaking Sure You Got Them Right: \\"The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends\\"; Usability testing on 10 cents a dayLarger Concerns And Outside Influences: Usability as common courtesy; Accessibility, Cascading Style Sheets; and you; Help! My boss wants me to ______.Recommended Reading; Acknowledgments; IndexFirst off, Steve Krug does this web design stuff for a living. So rather than live in the world of theory and stopwatches, he's actually seen and built things that both work and fail. Because of that, his common sense experience shines through in his writing. Couple that with some unique page design and entertaining graphics, and it's hard to not sit through and read the book from end to end in one sitting. In fact, that's *exactly* what he designed the book for! For those of us who have been working on the web for a very long time, it's amazing how much we take for granted and just \\"assume\\". But the audience of our site(s) may be far less sophisticated, and the only way to understand usable web design is to see things through fresh eyes. His pragmatic approach to usability testing is refreshing, and is something that you can easily do on any project without having to spend thousands for a full-blown lab. Those findings will drive much of your design and help you to realize what works and what doesn't. And it will probably surprise you what falls into which areas...This is one of those classic titles on a subject that needs to be read by everyone who makes their living doing web site design. There's absolutely no reason *not* to spend the three or so hours it will take to cover the material. I'm willing to bet it will make a positive impact on your design skills, and your audience will thank you profusely..."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"if you want a quick crash course in web usability, this is the book for you. it's an easy read, taking away all of the technical jargon and explaining it, instead, in every day terms. the book is appropriate for everyone from beginners to the advanced usability experts, but beware it is not an indepth how-to manual. full of examples and screen shots of real world, current examples. you can read the whole book in one sitting and never get bored. two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I've been working in the web industry for over 5 years now, and pretty much thought I had it all figured out, as far as usability is concerned.Wow, was I wrong.

But this was a great book on web design usability. I read it in about 3-4 days and it provided such a great approach to web design usability with so little effort that anybody doing any kind of web development needs to have this book on their shelf. Most of it is common sense ... but you don't realize it until after you read it. Once you read some of the chapters you kind of say to yourself ... \\"DUH! Why didn't I think of that before!\\" I wish all software development books could be written in such a fashion.

Steve Krug gives you some of the best experience he has as a usability expert for the bargain price of this book.It is easy to get wrapped up in debates about how to organize a website.

Someone with a lot of UI design and usability experience won't probably get anything new out of this one (except some perspective I guess).The book is covering only the basics and is very light on content. On the other hand once you've got those basic design principles you are ready to go. The book is also very fast and fun to read and the author definitely has his own humorous style of writing. I hope we'll see more web design books like this one in the future. Books that are easy to digest between more serious reading.Other related suggested reading could be theDesigning the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web Application Designby Robert Hoekman Jr. which is a bit more serious title but definitely good reading too."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"OverviewSteve Krug's first book - Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability - was an enjoyable read. The value of the book depends largely on experience and expectations of the reader. On the back cover, the book states that it's for Web Design/Web Development and the User Level of Beginning-Advanced. Hence, coming in as a QA engineer/manager, I didn't know if my expectations were going to be met. While the book was an enjoyable read, I only found a couple of sections that I could apply immediately to my work.Usability TestingSteve does a great job throughout the book of including images and analogies which help pull everything together - indeed, web design in many cases is no different than any other kind of design. All design should be clever enough to complete the task well, but simple enough that the task should be easily accomplished by anyone.Chapter 9 had the greatest impact on me as a QA manager. Chapter 9 is all about usability testing. Steve said a few interesting things about usability. Among my favorites was on pg. 132: \\"...the main thing (usability testing) ends up doing is revealing that the things they were arguing about aren't all that important. People often test to decide which color drapes are best, only to learn that they forgot to put windows in the room. For instance, they might discover that it doesn't make much difference whether you go with the horizontal navigation bar or the vertical menus if nobody understands the value proposition of your site. Sadly, this is how much usability testing gets done: too little, too late, and for all the wrong reasons.\\"Read more at - [...]"},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Krug gives a great deal of information on how a site needs to be designed for better usability.

After reading this book I have started devouring everything I can find on the subject.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has started learning about web design and is getting ready to take the training wheels off, or to anyone who is intimidated but the scope of the information architecture field.

I found it a fast read because the author writes in a down-to-earth, conversational way with lots of humorous and informative footnotes. He supplies the reader with loads of usable information and realistic examples. For once, I actually took a book to the computer to look up the author's website (and bookmarked it!) as well as other experts' sites and books referenced by Steve.

After I kept telling my husband bits of it, he decided to read it for himself."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"I don't know why this 200 page book receives such great reviews.The quality of writing is nothing to be marvelled at, somewhere around grade 3. The advice is O.K., but after the first 20 pages it feels like this seemingly short and condensed book is dragging on and on.The chapter on testing is so-so. However it could have been accomplished in 1/3 the space, without the silly examples.The chapter on usability is way outdated and the present browser zooming makes some of the concepts obsolete. Some advice is useful, but it's buried in words.From the usability perspective, this book on usability is not very \\"usable\\". The author tries to be funny (and sometimes succeeds) instead of conveying key-points. There are no main concepts or anything that you can take away from some parts of the book, except for a strange chapter titles like \\"Don't throw the baby out with the dishes\\" (which I think are meant to be funny).For a much better coverage of the importance of testing and rapid prototyping I would actually recommend \\"The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses\\". The book is not really about web-design, but it conveys the need for some of the things that \\"Don't make me think\\" glosses over in a much greater depth. The writing and jokes are also far superior to that of Steve Krug.For the programmers, CC2 should scratch all the right places to get the curious about the right things. I know it's a \\"bit\\" bigger but you would be a poor programmer if you did not read it anyway.For designers, a course/book in/on design/typography should be much more useful allocation of their time.My \\"test\\" of this book determined the following low hanging fruit:-Low level of writing-Too much wordiness-Not enough key-points/solid ideasIn the end I think this is an ok average book, for an average sit-at-home web-designer which will maybe improve your web-site. Sadly it does not leave you with any desire to pursue the subject, and you are left with a few \\"band-aid\\" solutions and no reasonable foundation or ideas of your own."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Yes this book is quick and easy to read but it could have been condensed to 1/3 of its size if it dispensed with the chatty talk that added no value. I expected more \\"meat\\".I really enjoyed the section on user-testing because it echoed my experience. Having it echoed in a book gives it validation to show to clients.I think this book is way overrated. It is practical common sense and the target audience is for management and marketers who don't have any practical experience in this area."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Its a good book, written well but is getting outdated with the changes happening all around in the internet space.

I'm not an IT person but have somehow managed to get involved in an IT development project that requires me to focus on the user experience for a new system we're developing. We all know - on some level - what annoys us when we're searching the internet, but we don't always know why it's annoying. Or we don't always recognise why some sites are almost a pleasure to browse. This book has helped me understand some of the fundamental, common sense practices that make the difference between a good browsing experience and an annoying (or downright bad) one.

It won't address specific issues that you may be dealing with on your site, but it will guide you on how to address them, and what process one should undertake throughout to produce results as easily, quickly, and cheaply as possible. The book is full of simple and very valuable facts that come from studies and Krug's experience as a consultant for both major companies and small home businesses. Following Krug's advice might not get you the perfect site for your purposes, but it won't be far off. There is a great list of suggested reading in the back as well for more specific guidance. For anyone who designs web sites, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"My first impression was that this book was way too basic...but then, on second thoughts, the problem with most UI designs is that the basics are ignored while we are in search of the holy grail. Steve Krug identifies the fundamental tenets of UI design (simplicity, self-explanatory, design for scanning, importance of navigational elements etc.) and reminds us to internalize them. All the points mentioned in the book should be self-evident and obvious; if we take enough time to step back and think about these things one will naturally come to these conclusions. The value I see in this book is not in any new ideas or techniques it introduces, but in identifying the basics and reminding us not to stray from them. In summary, the book reminds me the quote of an accomplished designer, \\"it is only by remaining as close as possible to the pure function of the object that beauty can be achieved\\""},{"Title":"Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition","review":"Don't Make Me Think, 2nd edition, is about building usability into websites from the start, not adding it on at the end. Thus, the author spends time on usability considerations during the design and development process.Having been working with websites for several years, I was already familiar with much of the material, but not all. I was happy for the coverage of user testing - that is something I will need to do more of when working on consulting projects.Admittedly, there was not much material here that I was not already aware of, and much of it is common-sense type stuff, but there were useful tidbits throughout. Plus it is nice to have all this information in a slim and concise volume.

The Northern Bride moved South to be with her planter husband and had her eyes opened to the truth of the peculiar institution. Readers today will have to see if they agree with her depictions of the life of the enslaved through the flowery 19th century language of this southern patriot.

The storytelling is crisp and detached. We are lucky to have so acute an observer of the passing scene. Universality is achieved through the careful attention paid to minute particulars. Reports of artistry and fidelity make points in understated fashion.A man is rewarded with a house for giving information. When the debriefing is over hardly anyone comes to see him. He was an ordinary colonial child. It was his fate to be detained for five weeks in a dirty cell for merely taking a picture. Later he joins the counter-revolutionary forces. Horror comes slowly. Debriefing doesn't describe methods and experience. His parents may have spoiled him when they let him use a parachute.A little boy dies on the barbed wire near his house playing a character from Sleeping Beauty. In another story the character doesn't know what day it is because the areas for services, churches and schools, have closed. With a mother gone and having undergone other losses, villagers and members of the family are going away from the land, carrying belongings. On the way through Kruger Park the grandfather, old and slow, is lost. The family does not hope to go back to Mozambique when the war is over. The people in the new village, it is fortunate, speak their language.A twice-married man goes to a resort. The place seems to glisten with women. He flings stones into the sea and finds a ring. After advertising it in a local paper, he ends up marrying the woman who comes to claim it. The moon in the southern hemisphere seems the wrong way around. A couple rents a room to a young man because their son is to be away for eighteen months. The lodger works in a restaurant. Vera, the daughter, tells her parents that Rad, the lodger, wants to make a meal for them. Vera and Rad become involved with each other. She carries a black box for him on an airplane trip and the plane explodes.A woman leaves a conference with four members of a youth delegation. She feeds them at her house. It seems their education was interrupted by two years detention. Those two years will never be regained, she surmises. Goats live on a shipwreck island and cause erosion. Through exogamous marriage the islanders change. They are moved. Afterwards the island is used as a weather station. A tour of duty on the island lasts a year. The personnel are subject to problems with insects and mice. Then there are cats on the island. The birds and turtles are disturbed. Young men from the university travel there. They are under orders to shoot the cats.An Afrikaner farmer shoots a black man. He carries the man in his bakkie to the police station and confesses to the shooting. He had ridden with Lucas, the victim, in a vehicle in which there was a loaded weapon. Driving over a pothole, the weapon had discharged. The ending of this story is a surprise. Teresa took a leave of absence from her job and slept away from home, away from her Swedish husband, in order to find out the circumstances of the jailing of her mother, brother and sister. The husband had suspected an affair. Houseguests at a lodge troop out to witness lions eating a zebra. In the night they see the cubs in the body of the zebra. In daylight scarabs are seen devouring the stomach leavings.A man, for reason of the indemnity process, is supposed to be free. He walks and takes buses. His friends help. The movement wants him to leave the country but he enjoys being home again. He notes a fellow bus passenger as being out of place. She is someone who would treat her servants well, but place her children in segregated schools. He is now living without consequences, being underground. He finds out the woman's husband is away in Japan and that they are drawn to each other as a couple. There is an interval of closeness in the absence of an exchange of personal identifying information. After several more moves the police find him and he is brought to take a seat in an ongoing trial."},{"Title":"Jump and Other Short Stories","review":"N. Gordimer writes with a very gripping style.

She never faulters in the truth about herself and the people who have been meaningful during her life, yet writes without rancor showing that Jesus has brought healing and reconciliation where her &quot;dragons&quot; are concerned. This was one of those great reads where I tried to sneak in 10 minutes here and there throughout the day so I could journey on with Sherrill. I was never disappointed; found myself underlining sentences and passages. Was sorry to see the book end."},{"Title":"All the Way to Heaven: A Surprising Faith Journey","review":"I've finally finished this book. But I didn't want to. As I neared the end I found myself reading slower and slower, savoring each thought. The early part of the book is the story of a woman's search for God-but in another sense it's God's search for her. And this is not an ordinary writer. Elizabeth Sherrill is a master storyteller who has told countless other people's stories-and told them well. Now she paints her own picture with depth and vivid colors. The last third of the book explores the topic of heaven, but it's not a lecture. Instead, reading it is like being one of a few students who get to be in a seminar with a master professor on the subject of her life work. Sitting around a table, she offers a choice quote, a key anecdote, a few comments. One thought leads to another, the subject is lively, and I end up learning the subject thoroughly, having made it my own. I've already given away one copy and have two more coming-but how to choose between all the people who need this book?"},{"Title":"All the Way to Heaven: A Surprising Faith Journey","review":"Many of the books that have been ghost written by Elizabeth Sherrill have been among my favorites. Her own writing of articles in Guideposts, plus her previous personal books have been sources of inspiration and encouragement to me through the years. I am thrilled to finally be able to read her own life journey. She is able to voice the inner thoughts of many of us in ways we are not able to put into words. I resonated with the lessons she has learned on her journey. Reading this book has been another step in my own spiritual journey. Truly Elizabeth Sherrill and the people whom she has known and written about have been mentors to me. I encourage others to read this excellently written book. It collaborates perfectly with my latest book, The Mentor Quest: Practical Ways to Find the Guidance You Need."},{"Title":"All the Way to Heaven: A Surprising Faith Journey","review":"All The Way to Heaven by Elizabeth Sherrill is a beautiful story of growth and compassion that involves the reader in every aspect of the journey and carries the reader from a child's struggle to understand until the complex and complete answer on the very last page. Every moment of loss, indecision or struggle is only a step closer to the truth. And do we ever and always need to hear that. The entire book is an insightful and uplifting masterpiece of human endeavor. Elizabeth Sherrill is a dynamic and intelligent person with understanding of all human frailties. Yet her courage, her tenderness and her compassion is a magnificent testimony to love and faith."},{"Title":"All the Way to Heaven: A Surprising Faith Journey","review":"...or any other from this era of writing, you will especially enjoy this book.

Elizabeth Sherrill has had a bit of practice writing about other people - but taking hard, honest looks in the mirror and typing away ain't easy.

I also loved the mini-profiles of the many people in her life - especially Mea."},{"Title":"All the Way to Heaven: A Surprising Faith Journey","review":"Even though Elizabeth Sherrill is nearly 50 years older than me, I feel so much identification when I read about her life. All The Way To Heaven has encouraged me to be who I am, to stop comparing myself to others, but walk the path set before me, trusting that my heavenly Father knows best. This not only a very HUMAN book, written by a human being of great human insight. This is also a very SPIRITUAL book of rich wisdom, which I will value just as much as Henri Nouwen's books have meant to my spiritual journey. I keep quoting and talking about the book... just ask my husband!

I would order from this bookseller again."},{"Title":"Philosophy Beside Itself: On Deconstruction and Modernism (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"In PHILOSOPHY BESIDE ITSELF, Stephen Melville begins innocently enough by noting the inner significance of Jacques Derrida's speech at Johns Hopkins in 1967 in which Derrida had seen an \\"event\\" that signaled a rupturing between the ages old certainty in the full meaning of commonly accepted truisms like God, love, and man and the post-structuralist opposition to that belief. This event was not a thin line demarcating the two; rather Derrida envisioned a gradual blending of the Enlightenment's criticizing of literature \\"from the outside\\" with the twentieth century's Modernism criticizing \\"from the inside.\\" Now, if one simply reads the remainder of this book as the working out of this thesis, then one would be left with judging it on two levels. The first level is the superficial analysis of who gets included in Melville's tracing of the evolution of post World War One Modernism to mid century deconstruction. The second level relates to who and what does not get mentioned in the same span. Both levels, alas, succeed only too well in showing that Modernism, as transmitted by and through Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and ultimately through Derrida and de Man, is little more than the prettied up underside of the grotesqueness that we today call the post-Auschwitz era.The problem with the first level of reading Melville's book lies in who gets the most ink. There is little doubt that Derrida and later de Man have collectively had an immense impact on the evolution of literary theory, however, for a book that includes \\"modernism\\" in the title, there is precious little that relates to anyone not named Derrida or de Man. The fragmentary insights garnered by the Imagist poets of the 20s are strikingly absent. The stream of consciousness prose of Joyce and Faulkner is similarly omitted. What Melville has written is a paean to the pantheonic duo of deconstruction with no regard for a contrary view.The issues with the second level are far more troubling than who gets to pass through the rope raised by Melville at a deconstruction nightclub. These issues strike at the very core of what deconstruction so deftly hides under a torrent of abstruse and arcane prose. Essentially, what Derrida and other deconstructionists have done was to banish humanity from the cosmic consciousness that used to be called a soul. All texts--and by implication--all life could be divided between a pair of polar binaries. A \\"man\\" in the past would have occupied the privileged left slot with a \\"woman\\" relegated to the subordinate right. Derrida convincingly proved that if even a smidgeon of the one could be transposed to the other, the result was a destabilization of both such that certainty was now replaced by indeterminacy. From this, he concluded, that there was literally nothing that man could count on as a potential clamp on his baser instincts. By the time that Melville published this book, Paul de Man's anti-Semitic writings from 1941 and 1942 had been in the public eye for nearly four years. One might think that Melville would have at least mentioned de Man's writings from then. One unfortunately would be wrong. One might also think that Melville might have similarly mentioned Heidegger's admitted Nazi past. He did not. What Melville does do is to discuss deconstruction solely in the context of a literary text with no need to see what its non-deconstructive uses might be. And right there is the main problem with deconstruction."},{"Title":"HAN MU DO : KOREAN INTELLECTUAL MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING MANUAL","review":"The book, \\"HanMuDo, Training Manual\\", is well illustrated and is written to go along with the video/dvd of the set. It is not a stand-alone book, it has only one or two excellent photos to demonstrate a technique, making the video/dvd necessary to see the complete technique. Both the manual and vidoe/dvd omit the detail of the Han Mu Do forms, empty-hand and weapon that are an important part of the HMD rank requirements.The HMD rank requirements listed in the manual are somewhat different from the books, \\"Han Mu Do\\" and \\"Hapkido II\\". More information may be obtained from the World Han Mu Do Association - Grandmaster He-Young Kimm.The manual and video/dvd set are highly recommended for the serious student of Korean martial arts."},{"Title":"Privileged Lives","review":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite books. It has a lot of everything. It's a kind of a Sunny Von Bulow thing, inasmuch as the heroine, Babe Devens wakes from a long coma and helps police detective, Vince Cardosa, solve the mystery. You'll love Vince. He travels through new territory as he begins to mingle in the world of the rich and famous to uncover the truth.I have always been surprised that this isn't a movie. It would be a great one. Vince also shows upin other books written by Stewart. Believe me, it's worth ordering. You won't be able to put it down until it's over."},{"Title":"Privileged Lives","review":"This story will remind you of the infamous Claus &amp; Sunny Von Bulow case back in the 80's. A real page turner, when it first came out years ago I breezed thru it then passed it on to friends, and if I was fortunate enough to have it returned it was usually falling apart &amp; I replaced it several times.

The twists and turns of his doomed affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, affectionately called \\"Bosie\\" in touching - and bitter - love notes from prison, are here to peruse. Reading them, you get a sense of Wilde's personal feelings at the time of his famed trial and arrest for sodomy, his anguish at losing Bosie and going to jail. It's fascinating, juicy stuff - made all the more touching by the fact that it all occurred without shame, in plain view, over 100 years ago.Wilde's a great character, a great author, a good role model for gay life and a hysterical wit. And this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde","review":"Edited by Richard Aldington. Stories include the picture of dorian gray, salome, the importance of being earnest, de profundis, many poems and the selfish giant."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde","review":"For the reader who has never experienced Oscar Wilde's work before, this collection serves as a fabulous in-depth introduction. Included are Wilde's most well-known works, including \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\" Both are absolutely superb pieces of literature. Also included are a fascinating letter written by Wilde while in prison, an essay on art and criticism, poetry, and personal letters and anecdotes. Serious students of Wilde might want to considering reading a more complete collection, but for a casual fan of classic literature, it's hard to beat this selection. Oscar Wilde should definitely be read by anyone who appreciates a sharp wit and profound intellect."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde","review":"The Penguin/Viking \\"Portable\\" series make for great intros to many of the world's finest writers, and this edition is no exception. Wilde was a tortured man, living a double life which ultimately led to his imprisonment and bankruptcy in Victorian England. His writings reflect the dichotomy he faced in both is personal life and artistic endeavors during that period.Beginning with a solid life intro, and discussion of the writings by the editors, the collection begins with his essay \\"The Critic as Artist\\", setting the stage for the follow on plays, prose and poetry that follow.The next work is \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" in its entirety. The novel reads reminds this reader of Dostoyevsky, and examines the duality of a life artificially lived, and the hiddenness of the soul and the effect of sin on the soul and visage of the man. Somewhat biographical to all men, Dorian Gray takes on even more poignancy when read against the backdrop of Wilde's own life.Also contained in the compilation are the plays \\"Solome\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", one a tragedy and the other a comedy. Included in the poetry is \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\", a haunting expose of the prison life and soul rending experience of Wilde while in prison. There are other short stories and a collection of letters as well, including a letter to his lover entitled \\"De Profundis\\".In all, this is a great intro to Wilde. I had never read any of his works prior to picking up this volume, and am now richer for the experience. A fine author, and a tragic figure - his tribulations come through in his work, and provide the reader with an appreciation of the man and his times."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde","review":"Oscar Wilde was a master of prose. No student of English literature should ignore him; they might not agree with him on a thousand things (even Wilde felt it was perfectly acceptable for him to disagree with himself) but his wit, his humor, and most importantly his love of beautiful things, must not be tossed aside. Wilde was a genius and a master of the English word."},{"Title":"The Battle of White Plains","review":"Their Sacrifice, Our Heritage: The Battle of White Plains by Renoda Hoffman is actually twenty pages not twenty-four. Pages 21 through 24 are notes, the birthplace of New York State, references, and a map of the Battle of White Plains. The book is more like a pamphlet and was distributed by the Battle of White Plains Monument Committee. Since it is only twenty pages it was written so the novice could enjoy the book as well. It does go into some detail about the battle, how the battle came about, and the key military figures of the battle: General William Howe for the British and General George Washington for the Continental Army. Even though the British won the battle it was also a victory of sort for the Continental Army as well. The Continental Army stood it ground against a much better equipped, better trained army, and against larger numbers. If you don't want to read a very thick book about the battle then this is for you. Their Sacrifice, Our Heritage: The Battle of White Plains gets an AAAAA+++++ for easy reading."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Andrew Murray is the master of devotional literature. In his devotional books he usually breaks a subject down into a month of daily lessons which require approximately 20-30 minutes of prayerful reading.One of the most difficult lessons of the Christian life is how to patiently wait on God. In 1993 I devoted 30 minutes a day for one month to studying this book. This altered my life. Since then waiting on God has been one of the greatest joys in my life! It doesn't get any better than this!Thank you, Andrew Murray and thank you, Jesus."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Few Christians today even grasp the concept of waiting: the true meaning of the aspects of the word. This book clearly delinates the concept of why we wait, what we wait for, what it means to wait, and the blessing of waiting. You absolutely have to read it."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Wow! I bought this book way back in the 90's. But my Christian life wasn't yet mature, (still isn't), so I couldn't grasp what Waiting on the Lord is all about. We have been trained to \\"do\\" things, to take on \\"action items\\", to \\"Just do it\\".I recently attended a winter conference by Forerunner Christian Church in Fremont, CA. They are a church that focuses on \\"waiting on the Lord\\" and to have an \\"inner life\\" with our Lord.After the conference, I picked up this book again on my bookshelves, and what a new revelation it is.In Isaiah 40:31, they that \\"hope or wait\\" on the Lord, shall renew their strength.... The Hebrew word of \\"hope or wait\\" also means to be bound together. After reading this book, I can better understand what it means to \\"wait on the Lord\\". It doesn't mean that we just Don't do it, but that we let God do thing His Way. If He along is the author of our salvation, could He not also master everything that we encounter in our lives?The insights offered in this book are so valuable one hardly hears this kind of teaching in sermons nowadays.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"\\"My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than watchmen for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning.\\"JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh: Pocket EditionIf I had to summarize this book in one word, it would be \\"RICH,\\" for every page contains so much of God's truth that it has been difficult to select from among the pages and chapters to determine what to include in this review.This pocket-sized book is arranged in a devotional format, in thirty-one short chapters, each about three pages long, each chapter covering a different facet of what it means to wait on God, which Murray sums thus, \\"What He asks of us, in the way of surrender, obedience, desire, and trust, is all comprised in this one word: waiting on Him, waiting for His salvation. It combines the deep sense of our entire helplessness and our perfect confidence that our God will work all in His divine power\\" (p. 16). Waiting on God, in turn, comprises both the active and passive elements of entering His blessed rest, the state into which He desires to bring all His children, not just in the hereafter, but in the here-and-now.Throughout the book, from a variety of perspectives, Murray draws the reader to consider and embrace the truth of just how good God is, how we are in Him, and He is in us. In Chapter 28, \\"For the Coming of His Son,\\" Murray writes, \\"Waiting on God in heaven, and waiting for His Son from heaven, these two God has joined together and no man may put them asunder\\" (p. 119). Murray goes on to describe the waiting of the Bride for the Bridegroom, not for expectation of the position or privilege she will gain, but because she loves the Bridegroom, the ecstasy of God's own love being a certain, inextricable part of that. And this is the sweet pleasure of waiting on Him, in tender love toward Him and toward each other, in true bridal spirit, even as He works in us to perfect His love toward, in and through us.In the spirit of love, Murray anguishes over the \\"tens of thousands of professing Christians, who live on in carelessness, and who, if no change come, must perish under God's hand\\" (for God is a righteous judge of all, deliverer, and faithful avenger of His chosen ones) and he implores that we who wait on God warn them, plead with and for them, for God's mercy (p.85).Every chapter ends with the refrain, \\"My soul, wait thou only upon God!\\" for waiting on God is never in vain, for He promises that \\"...they shall not be ashamed that wait for me\\" Isaiah 49:23.Sadly, only a few of Andrew Murray's books are available in our local library. Murray's works are now in the public domain, and Whitaker House is one of the publishing companies that produces this work. This company utilizes the proceeds from these sales to sustain the company and to invest in exclusively Christian charitable works, including missionary works (I took the time to contact the company and ask the question). They offer many such works at up to a seventy-five percent discount. There is a publisher's note in the front of this edition letting the reader know that \\"The text of this book... has been edited for the modern reader.\\" The full text (I assume of the original, unedited version) is available online, free, but possibly is not as convenient as a pocket book to carry around or as economical to give as a gift or use in group study.I read my first Andrew Murray bookAbide in Christsome thirty-six years ago, when I was a teenager and new believer. There was sound reason that book was required reading in the youth group I was involved with then, for Murray's exposition of what it means to abide in Christ had a profound impact on my walk from that time forward.Waiting on Godhas at least as much if not more potential to impact what remains of my life, for waiting on God is my rest and abiding joy, it is Christ in me, the hope of glory."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Murray is one of those authors I always wish I were reading at the computer, so I could file the inspiring quotes that pop off the page. For years I have turned to Andrew Murray for instructional revelation on deep matters of the Kingdom. \\"Waiting on God\\" is, of course, a classic. As a daily devotional or revisited old friend, this compact text is essential reading in any Christian library. How often are we taught to wait, much less to wait on God? Providing a definition and practical insights into methods of waiting, Murray offers invaluable help to seekers of serenity. This Whitaker House edition is pocketsize and portable. I give it as a gift to treasured friends. You will read it again and again."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"I recently learned about Andrew Murray. This is the second book I have read of his and I plan to read more. He has a gift to simply show God's teachings as they are written in the bible in a very simple way.

I like its short chapters and its daily-devotional style."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"To keep it short, I will say that God, through Andrew Murray's books, has brought me in to the most beautiful and personal place. He's really taken me and shown me who He REALY is, and that in turn has made me want to know Him even more intimately. The first book I ever read of Andrew Murray's was \\"Abide in Christ\\", and it changed my life forever. God has continued to call me in deeper, and has given me such a burning passion and closeness with Himself that I didn't know was posssible to have.I pray that God's Spirit would open the eyes of your heart and make every word a living reality in your life. That you would know Him, in the truest sense of the word, and that He would captivate you by His ferocious Love. May He bring you to the sweet surrender of heart and life, the beauty of His holiness (for it is surely yours to have), and Love everlasting. Grace to you and peace from Christ above. May He have the glory. [Read Ephesians 3:16-21] May His Beloved ones be made children of the burning heart.Amen"},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"I highly recommend this book to any person that is truly wanting to grow in their relationship with the Lord. Far to much of what is in publication today ministers only to self. This devotional however, puts the emphasis on self denial and patient waiting which runs so contrary to popular culture. I thank God for the impact this mans ministry continues to have far past his earthly life. Simply put, he puts the rudder back on the ship and into the hands of the only one capable of steering it. May you see Jesus in every page of this book."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Murray really helps you see God in such a reachable, intimate way through this daily devotional. I never knew what it meant to truly wait upon God...in holy reverence, patience, total trust, and joy, until reading this book. I can honestly say it made fall deeper in love, and brought me into a new dimension in my relationship with God. I've read it a few times, and still often refer back to it for encouragement and rejuvenation. Definite necessity for the Christian heart longing to go deeper and know God more intimately!"},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Someone gave me this book when I was 16.

Each thought is instructed and built on the scriptures of waiting on God.

HE has promised us that if we earnestly & sincerely seek HIM (and only Him & I know if I am) HE WILL be found. HE is in this book. WOW!Learning to &#34;wait&#34; on Him takes MUCH practice. We live in such a fast paced world. Most of us that will take the time to read this book have lived MANY years &#34;in&#34; this world. We've grown-up &#34;expecting&#34; things to come fast. That IS NOT so with God.Here's something to try to wrap you head around..God does not live in &#34;time.&#34; There is no time where HE is. Like the bible says, 1000yrs is like a minute to Him. So if we are to learn to wait on Him we must remind ourselves of this. I also was reminded that HIS timing is &#34;perfect.&#34; &#34;IF&#34; I truly trust HIM with my life, I will wait on HIM to move in HIS way & in HIS time. WOW! I LOVE our LIVING GOD!I encourage all that read this book to remind ourselves to Truly seek Him, with our WHOLE heart, ALL of our minds & ALL of our strength. HE will come to us as much as &#34;we&#34; FIRST come to HIM. Someone said. &#34;God is only as big in us as &#34;we&#34; confess HIM to be. That means outloud confession! Confess HIM more.

It gave me things to consider that I had not thought of before.Waiting on God"},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"Though this book is not labeled as a book on prayer, it definitely is. It does not teach you how to pray directly but leads you gently to an intimate relationship with G-d the Creator, the Father, and Jesus Christ Saviour, LORD and G-d. The first month I read it I had more questions than answers. The next month a little more light was shed. I have read it since March 2009 and It is now December of 2009. Each month it is new and fresh. To Wait on G-d is NOT a long line as depicted on the cover. THe artist did not read the book and understand it. Rather waiting on G-d is attending to Him and being restored to the Garden of Eden in the sense of humbly seeking G-d in every aspect of your life. The very habit of going to G-d to hear Him and let Him lead in the dance is restoration, peace, and transformation for the humble believer. I highly recommend this book. I have ordered sets of four to give to friends and they had the same reaction I did. If you are looking for a step by step guide to praying as someone dictates to you, then this is not the book for you. If you want to go to the deep intimate places of fellowship with G-d then this is indeed the book for you. If you cultivate this habit of continually waiting on G-d ( seeking Him, resting at His feet, trusting Him, refusing to be moved until he so directs, refusing to be sufficient in yourself without Him, then you will have a great peace and joy in His Presence. This book leads you to this good place of being in intimate communion with the One and Only Great and Good God Almighty and His son Jesus Christ, who is God of God and Light of Light."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"This book is something all spiritually minded people should read, it will guide you into a living personal relationship with God, that will satisfy the craving of a soul that wants the reality of His presence rather than the warm fuzzy feelings, the shallow mediocre messages of today that call themselves deeper life, when the only depth is the cost."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"If you have not read any of Andrew Murray's books, you might want to. The Lord has blessed this man with insight and spiritual understanding, that I don't hear any church or pastor speak about.

If you go through this devotion...you WILL understand what God is doing in your waiting time. Andrew Murray will take you deep in your understanding of God."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"I purchased this book to read when I was on a trip to Thailand last month. I wanted to study a different type of devotional-style book, and boy did I ever! This book could be used as a text book if it were printed in a different format, it's just THAT good.The author touches on learning to pray - not just having a &#34;git'r done&#34; attitude, but to actually kneel and wait for God to give you the things He wants you to pray about..Actually being still and quiet, and having a conversation with the Great I Am... He touches on getting through the painful times when you don't seem to get answers to your prayers and learning to wait upon God for all that is needed, all that is useful and all that is good.If read with an open heart, this book won't be able to not leave you at least a little bit altered. Andrew Murray may not look very interesting, but covers can be deceiving - the message God gave him to share is even more important in our world today where we actually need to be taught to sit still in the quiet and wait upon God."},{"Title":"Waiting on God","review":"In 1991 I read this book and was so impressed that I sought permission from the publisher to use it as a text book in our night school. EVERYONE who has taken this course has commented on the spiritual impact it has made in their lives. Mr. Murray, along with a number of other men of that age, may not have been &quot;giants&quot; in doctrinal materials, but they were way ahead of many today in their spiritual devotion to God and His Word. I HIGHLY recommend that every saint read and reread this book.

And, just to qualify, I have a college degree and read a book or two a week so I am used to different writing styles.Maybe I am just too used to Joyce's straight forward approach and expected more of the same. I stuck with the book through a couple of chapters but could not get one thing out of it because his writing style so obscured any wisdom he was trying to impart. So, I donated it to the library.Personally, I would not invest the money in buying this book and I am sorry I did."},{"Title":"The fairy-land of science","review":"For me, a researcher, this book is very inspiring, because (i) the author was not a scientist, but she can understand the topic so well that the book is attractive to me; (ii) the book tells me many pieces of basic knowledge around our daily life, which honestly I do not know well; (iii) this book re-makes me be interested in popular scientific books, which I once loved to read when I was young."},{"Title":"The fairy-land of science","review":"This book needs tags: Waldorf education, Waldorf methods, Waldorf science elementary, Waldorf nature storiesA classic of children's science teaching published in 1882 apparently. On a very cursory first glance in Google books, Buckley voices the exact tone desirable in Waldorf education; that is, an imaginative approach to science facts, based in reality but cognizant of etheric, fairy and spiritual forces. In a phrase we call this \\"making science come alive.\\"Whole-child method elementary teachers who do all their lower elementary science teaching thru storytelling, will appreciate this.

For example, Buckley writes, \\"We shall not have gone many yards before we see impressions of plants in the shale, like those in this specimen (Fig. 47)...\\" There is no Figure 47, nor are there any of the Figures to which she refers. Oddly enough, it appears that nobody involved in the printing of this book even bothered to read it. Perhaps the Figures were left out intentionally, but being a science book, the illustrations are hardly optional details, and in that case, one would think the references to them would also be removed. \\"Book jungle\\" appears to be the printer responsible for this version. Every book on their order form, at the back of the book, as far as my knowledge extends, is a public domain book (as is Fairy-Land of Science).

The only negative comment I could make is that the explanation of photosynthesis is not very detailed **compared to** other topics.

The kiss is passed from animal to animal until Little Bear receives his gandmothers kiss via the Hen. The story is cute, the illustrations are great and the kids love it. What more could you want. JUST A NOTE: I almost never refer to the review by another reviewer. In this case I will make an exception. There are Kisses and there are Kisses. I kiss my grandchildern all the time. I kiss cats and dogs and have even kissed a frog in my time. I can assure you there is nothing inappropriate in these kisses. It is an action as old as the human race. As to the skunks kissing, just what is so bad about that. You have a girl skunk that kisses a boy skunk, they enjoy it, they enjoy each other and then they get married. And this is bad? I can remember years ago first kissing my wife. We were all of fifteen years old at the time. We kissed for several more years, got married, had wonderful children and now have wonderful grandchildren and hope soon to have wonderfulgreat-grandchildren. This is bad?

The pieces are very personal and autoethnographic in approach(Richardson mentions both Carolyn Ellis and Norman K. Denzen in her acknowledgments).What I appreciated most in this book is that Richardson spells out the politics and unspoken undercurrents of academic hierarchies and rivalries. Richardson is brave and forthright in speaking openly about things that are usually unspoken. She shares her feelings of failure, shame, anger, rage. Richardson describes the personal effect of the changes that occurred in universities with the introduction of a business management model, and for this reason alone I think the book should be essential reading for anyone contemplating an academic career who doesn't realise what a tense, bitter minefield a university faculty truly can be.It was interesting that I found it hard to be open to Richardson's sociological plays and poetry. I have no experience with reading poetry, or with academic prose forms other than traditional texts, so I had no frame of reference with which to approach her work. However, I enjoyed 'Louisa May's Story of Her Life' enormously: more than enough to continue to work towards a better appreciation of other texts such the script representation of the 1990 Postmodernism and Cultural Studies discussion (even 19 years later it seems unconventional).I recommend this book to anyone interested in autoethnography, sociology, cultural studies, or who is considering a career as an academic ."},{"Title":"Fields of Play: Constructing an Academic Life","review":"What a woman!

(The cowboy for instance.) All advance climbing necessary to reach comfortable rock to lean against while reading &quot;Fool's Progress&quot;. Since &quot;Jonathan Troy&quot; is long out of print, fried salted mutton and beans over juniper coals at dawn is not a bad place to begin. Abbey, in this story, dives into the great and growing conflict between the wilderness and the coming of the machine, the struggle of those living between the reality and the romance. Or maybe just two realities. Abbey's comment back in the early 50&quot;s on big brother and the BS rings true today."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"Jack Burns is a cowboy on a mission. He wants to break his friend out of jail, a punishment doled out for failure to register for the draft. Burns gets himself thrown in jail, finds his friend, escapes, and leads the local sheriff and others on a chase.But nothing in the previous three sentences is exactly as it sounds. Burns isn't just a cowboy. The sheriff isn't just a redneck buffoon. His friend has other ideas about jail. Escape has a price.Edward Abbey develops the character of Jack Burns in great detail, and Burns returns in Abbey's later post-apocalypse novel,Good News.This is Abbey's second novel, and you can envision the train of thoughts that lead to some of his later works, includingDesert SolitaireandThe Monkey Wrench Gang:\\"The great cliffs leaned up against the flowing sky, falling through space as the earth revolved, turning amber as whiskey in the long-reaching lakes of light from the evening sun. But the light had no power to soften the jagged edges and rough-spalled planes of the granite; in that clear air each angle and crack cast a shadow as harsh, clean, sharp, real, as the rock itself - so that though they had endured as they were for ten million years, the cliffs held the illusion of a terrible violence suddenly arrested, paralyzed in time, latent with power\\" (p. 189).This particular edition (University of New Mexico Press, tenth printing, 1990) has an afterward written by Neal E. Lambert. Lambert notes \\"For this new edition, Abbey requested that the lines announcing Burn's death be dropped. Broken as he is, the cowboy must be allowed to continue\\" (p. 285). This makes a lot of sense, given that Abbey himself resurrects Burns for his later works.An entertaining yarn. People who dislike Abbey's politics may still enjoy his stories. This is one they should try."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"I seriously considered not finishing this read. The story line was not really believable, and nearly the entire book was descriptive text, overdone."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"In Brave Cowboy, Abbey captures the spirit of an antiquated cowboy born in the wrong century, bouncing around the desert of the southwest like tumbleweed; making his way the only way he knows how. Although set in the mid-twentieth century, the tight plot and character relationships are reminiscent of a western of a hundred years earlier. As expected, Abbey's prose and distinctive description did not disappoint as the story coalesces around the cowboy, his grievances with government, and his loyalty to a friend. The climax of the story takes the reader on a chase that ends abruptly and unexpectedly, I thought. With this story, I believe Abbey illustrated the constant struggle between progress, growth, and those who oppose it.Edward Abbey's writing style is wonderful, as is his plot and character development. It is my understanding that, while his style, prose, and themes remain constant throughout his career, his talent is polished and refined with each novel. Brave Cowboy, being his first widely published fictional work, leaves the reader with a taste of things to come in his later writings."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"The philisophic dichotomies Abbey establishes with Bondi and Burns shows the two sides of a consciousness (cuate). This book inspires me to want to teach it to high school students. It shows how both philosophies of cultural acceptance of the established narrative and an acceptance of creating one's own narrative are just as viable and valid and can even be friends with one another. This is my second book by Abbey and my enjoyment of it is only marred by the fact that I have to keep a dictionary (English and Spanish) nearby."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"Whisky, the horse is a key figure in this story of principle.

For me it was interesting to see how far he came in his writing style. But this is a good story just the same. Although it moves very slowly and takes a while to develop it is quite good. You will recognize that the speed of the story is very similiar to the speed of life in desert towns and countryside if you have ever spent any time in either. Much of his message is transparent from the beginning of the book but it still an enjoyable read.

I kept hoping this wholly out of touch cowboy was going to deliver a message of \\"the old days and ways were better\\".

NOT!"},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"I am a great fan of Abbey. But after reading several of his books, I am almost convinced that he was a far better essayist than a novelist. This book takes a laboriously long time to develop, and it isn't until the end that the reader even begins to comprehend what Abbey is getting at. (In fact, I'm not sure I get it now.) One possible explaination is that he was trying to draw a parallel between Thoreau and Emmerson. Abbey was a great admirer of Thoreau, and, I believe, took great pride in being compared to him. In this novel Bondi (Emmerson) is the high-browed educated thinker, and Burns (Thoreau) the simpler, more admirable, doer of the word. The story progressively exposes more and more of the differences between the two. But Abbey's prose is incredibly long winded, almost as if he is writing this book to show off how many literary tricks he can use, at the expense of the reader and the story. But it is not until the end of the work (almost as difficult to arrive at as the top of the mountain for Jack Burns) that the reader will feel truly ripped off and cheated. My advice is to stick to Abbey's essay collections, although I truly enjoyed &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang.&quot;"},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"After reading &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and his opus &quot;A Fool's Progress&quot;, I was let down by this particular Abbey effort. The cliched character of Burns, the beleaguered cowboy, riding out of the purple-hazed past to rescue an old buddy from the perils of modern times, is shopworn at best. Abbey's prose, usually spectacular, just doesn't seem up to his standards here. Missing, too, were the pyrotechnic polemics that make Abbey so much fun to read. The ending was so thoroughly telegraphed, I felt slightly insulted. Avoid this book, and read &quot;A Fool's Progress&quot;, Abbey at his finest."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"It was one of Edward Abbey's regrets that he was appreciated more for his nature writing (\\"Desert Solitaire\\") than his fiction. And it was another regret that he was mostly forgotten as the author of the story on which the movie \\"Lonely are the Brave\\" was based. However, after reading \\"The Brave Cowboy,\\" I'd have to vote with those who find his nonfiction far more inspiring and satisfying. It's a novel that still rewards the reading, but almost 50 years after its publication in 1956, it seems somewhat dated, while \\"Desert Solitaire\\" remains as fresh and relevant as if it were written yesterday.Abbey was still in his twenties when he wrote this novel, and its point of view is that of a young man full contradictory passions and attitudes. The brave cowboy of the title, a prototypical figure on horseback, is the central character in maybe half the pages of the novel. A younger college friend, imprisoned for refusing to register for the draft, is another character. The local sheriff gets a large section to himself. The novel also follows the progress of a long-haul truck driver across the country. The lives of these four characters intersect in the narrative, while each of them also represents a different perspective. And they don't all quite converge in a single point of view. But that was Abbey, an outspoken man who wasn't afraid to contradict himself.To its credit, the novel can be read on more than one level. It uses the cowboy to represent free-spirited, libertarian ideas set in conflict with brute ignorance and repression. It decries urbanization and celebrates the limitless, stark beauty of the mountains and desert (the novel is set in northern New Mexico). It's also a prison drama, and it tells a satirical yet gripping story of heavily armed but mostly inept law officers in pursuit of a fugitive. A reader interested in a 1950s view of the West and its people in post-war transition will find much to enjoy in Abbey's youthful book about a mythic cowboy's adventure and the lives it disrupts.As a companion volume, I'd also recommend James Galvin's \\"Fencing the Sky,\\" which tells a similar story about a cowboy pursued across a Western landscape by the law."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"When Jack Burns encounters a barbed-wire fence as he comes across the West Mesa (Albuquerque)on horseback he scans in both directions for a gate before he clips the wire to ride through. He wouldn't have cut it if it wasn't in his way, or if there'd been a gate nearby. Thus begins the book with a scene that tells much about the main character.Burns is a man who doesn't merely cling to ideals of loyalty, privacy and individual freedom. His internal machinery accepts no alternative at any level. Jack Burns is a man who won't cut a fence unless it stands in the way of where he wants to go. He recognizes the existence of the creeping encroachments and compromises to his choices and ignores them. The modern acquiescence by the rest of society is foreign to him.Burns descends the mesa into Albuquerque, encounters modern city life and is battered by it without 'losing' in the usual sense of the word, and leaves on the run from the legal instruments intended to keep us all on the straight and narrow. The end is inevitable.Readers who know Albuquerque will enjoy the ride across the 'Volcans', the places in the Rio Grande Valley still recognizable despite the years since Abbey wrote the book, the harrowing climb up the Sandias pursued by the military and law enforcement community. Those who don't know Albuquerque or New Mexico will appreciate the type of individual Burns portrays: a man born too late, unable to compromise.I haven't seen the movie mentioned by other reviewers. I also didn't see the shortcomings of the book mentioned by several. I saw only a writer who created a character much as Abbey saw himself, as many people today see themselves, and a plot that carried those traits through to the end. No one, I imagine Abbey would say, can dodge the steamroller."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"This is a novel about a man born into the wrong era. Jack Burns is a cowboy through and through--unaccustomed to having his freedom restricted and driven by a strong sense of loyalty and honor. The problem is he lives in post World War II America, and his old-fashioned values and desire to roam the country freely often clash with the modern society in which he lives. This causes many problems for Burns, some simple, some complicated: he has a hard time getting his horse to cross the highway, people don't respect him, he doesn't register for the draft (which was compulsory then). He is put in jail trying to help a friend, and it is here that the conflict of old and new really begins to unfold.Without revealing too much of the plot, Burns tries to beat modern society with his old-fashioned ways. The final section of the book deals with the physical conflict between old and new, between horse and horsepower, and it is clear that Jack Burns simply does not belong in the era into which he was born. This novel details the struggle for disappearing values, the desperate attempt to hold on to the past (and the consequences this sometimes brings). Edward Abbey is an excellent writer, and his prose is vivid and descriptive. The Brave Cowboy is a classic work of American Western fiction."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"Q: What's your occupation? A: Cowhand, sheepherder; game poacher.Q: Where's your papers?...Your I.D.--draft card, social security, driver's license? A: Don't have none. Don't need none. I already know who I am.Edward Abbey is one of the patron saints of the modern Environmental movement; right up there with Rachel Carson. Desert Solitaire, his memoir of working in a National Park, is an impassioned statement of preservationist principles and his comic novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang, is a virtual primer for ecoterrorism. But my personal favorite of his books is the little remembered Brave Cowboy, the basis for the excellent but equally forgotten Kirk Douglas film, Lonely Are the Brave. It belongs on the shelf with the other uniquely American paens to independence and rugged individualism: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest(read Orrin's review), Cool Hand Luke, From Here to Eternity (read Orrin's review), All the Pretty Horses (read Orrin's review), etc.Set in the mid 1950's, the novel tells the story of Jack Burns, a latter day cowboy, now reduced to working as a hand on a sheep ranch, who gets himself thrown into prison so that he can help his draft dodging friend escape. But when his buddy refuses to compromise the moral purity of his concientious objector status, Burns is forced to break out on his own, assuming that a vicious Mexican prison guard he has aggravated doesn't kill him first. In the meantime the authorities have realized that Jack too is unregistered and that while they were in college together, he helped his friend with some radical causes, however ineffectual. So when he does manage to escape, Jack ends up being treated as a dangerous fugitive, instead of as the fairly harmless eccentric that he is. Pursued by locals, feds, the military and the sadistic guard, he takes off into the desert, his only allies a high spirited horse, who's as much trouble as help, and a phlegmatic local sherriff named Morlin Johnson.In a broader sense though, what the book is really about is the clash between the values of the old West and the bureaucratic, mechanized, regimented and federalized modern West. Though it lacks the memorable set-pieces that distinguish the other books cited above and is admittedly none too subtle in portraying the menace of modern life, it succeeds nonetheless because the character of Jack Burns evokes such nostalgia in the reader and like Don Quixote, we find the mental world that he lives in more attractive than the reality that has begun to crowd in on him. I like the novel very much and especially recommend the movie.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"Edward Abbey's first published novel is a modern-day western set in New Mexico. Its hero, Jack Burns, is a man unable to come to terms with an increasingly civilized west, who becomes a fugitive from the law after he attempts to help his friend break out of jail. Hunted by the authorities, he complicates his escape by refusing to leave his skittish horse behind. Despite the awful title, it is a well-written, entertaining novel that explores the tension between personal freedom and modern civilization against a backdrop of stark natural beauty. Made into an even better film under the title Lonely Are the Brave. Coincidentally, I read this book after finishing Rand Johnson's excellent new novel &quot;Arcadia Falls&quot;, which tho set in the suburban east, is thematically very similar."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"Edward Abbey's first-best book is, of course, \\"Desert Solitaire,\\" that fictionalized non-fiction work that so eloquently celebrates the pristine Southwest wilderness and mourns its destruction at the hands of industry and politics.\\"The Brave Cowboy\\" is known to many through its filmization with Kirk Douglas. Despite the inane title, \\"Lonely Are the Brave,\\" it is an excellent movie. But the book is even more excellent.If you see this work purely as social commentary -- the individual at odds with society -- you miss the point. That aspect of the book, while it is an impassioned message from one of this country's best nature writers, is almost too obvious to deserve mention. The message -- and the beautifully detailed setting of Western plains and mountains -- is the background.The foreground is a character study of Jack Burns, a man in perpetual rebellion against authority and incapable of commitment to anything outside of himself. He is generous and caring, but he allows no one to penetrate his stubborn exterior. He refuses to be vulnerable to love or to any of the normal compromises that permit even the most hardened of us individualists to survive in the real world.He is inevitably doomed by his own intransigence, and that is what makes the story more than just \\"sad\\": it is a genuine tragedy. And like all successful tragedies, it is uplifting. The book's triumph is that, even while we know the outcome, we envy Jack Burns.This book is a youthful work. You won't find a Hemingway or a Fitzgerald in the writing style, or even a Jack London. It is a popular book, more like a best-seller than \\"literature.\\" Nevertheless, the excellence of its story raises it above the main. It is simply a great, and greatly affecting, read."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"While other reviews will give you a plot synopsis and their reaction to the book, or a comparison with the movie, \\"Lonely Are The Brave,\\" I will limit my review to a few off the wall observations. First, I liked this book a lot and believe the adaptation by Dalton Trumbo to be one of the most faithful by any screenwriter. Often it is difficult not to think of the movie a book is based on while reading it (if you've seen the movie first). But Abbey is so good he made me forget I'd seen the movie and allowed me to lose myself in his words and story. So, a great book, well written, that didn't back away from some of the political hot potatoes most writers and publishers would rather avoid (draft dodging, property rights, etc.).Few books have made me cry at the end -- usually it's when I think of the time and money wasted on them. This one left me in tears because of a profound sense of loss of another kind, the loss of men such as John W. Burns, the loss of the maverick, the loss of a true voice of the west, and the loss of a west that we will never know except through books and movies.But one thing impressed me as much as the contents of the book -- its binding. Rarely does anyone discuss this, but I have to say that this edition is the best bound I've ever read. The spine was not stiff and the pages were very flexible allowing me to read one handed almost anywhere. If all paperbacks used this same binding, I wouldn't have to replace my often-read books every eight or nine years. So, from this perspective, the publisher is allowing Abbey's work a much longer life in one edition. Possibly a tribute to Abbey's philosophy, or merely a coincidence, either way I remain impressed by this. This may be the only paperback I own that I can pass to my grandson, as is, for his enjoyment in the future."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"This book has been in my bookcase for sometime and I am not clear where it came from. Perhaps a Christmas present. Perhaps an impulse purchase as I enjoy this author, even though we are politically poles apart.Regardless, I noticed it a few days ago and started reading it and was once again immersed in Edward Abbey's view of life from fifty-two years ago.Jack Burn's and Paul Bondi are friends that go way back although they have drifted apart. Burn's rides back into the Bondi's life on the back of a fractious young horse he has named Whiskey only to find that his friend is in the County Jail awaiting transfer to a federal penitentary for failing to register for the draft.Burns has an idea that if he can get into the jail, he can break his friend out and they can though go live in the mountains until the law gets tired of looking for them. He manages to get himself arrested and it looks as though his screwball plan may in fact work...except Bondi will have no part of it. He has two years to serve and a wife and child to return to. His days of protesting and supporting anarchy are over.Burns and a couple of others manage the escape and part their seperate ways. It has come to the attention of the authorities that Burns, like Bondi has protested the Draft Registration Law and are interested in interrogating him. But first they have to find him.The balance of the book is taken over with the search for Burns by the authorities which allows Abbey to trot out many of his political views in an entertaining way in the point and counterpoint action between the hunters and the hunted.Even fifty-six years after it's original publication this is a book still worth reading notwithstanding the preface that Abbey writes:\\"This is only a story. None of it really happened. How could it? How could such people be? The prisoner is probably a professor. The sheriff loses the next election. The truckdriver died of emphysema. And as for the cowboy, that character, why nobody even knows where he is anymore. Or even, to be honest, if he ever really was.\\"Right. Only a story. But, there are stories, and there are stories. This is one you will remember."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"If you're a fan of Ed Abbey, you really ought to read this book. It's not his best work, because his views are presented with a very thin plot. The image of the cowboy riding down the freeway was lovely, however and it doesn't feel too preachy. I would recommend Monkey Wrench Gang or Desert Solitaire to anyone just breaking into Abbey's work. They're simply better peices and frankly, they appear to have been written for a more educated audience than Brave Cowboy.Brave Cowboy is a quick, easy read that will entertain you and will help clarify Abbey's views on freedom, men and women. It's unlikely you'll agree with him, but the subtext of the book will make you think more than the plot itself."},{"Title":"BRAVE COWBOY","review":"I liked Edward Abbey long before I read his work as I saw the movie adaptation of this book \\"Lonely Are The Brave\\" back in the Sixties. Abbey&#8217;s protagonist, Jack Burns, the uncompromising rebel from another America, is as free spirited as his creator. Constantly at odds with modern life, he eventally violates enough of its ways to become sought by the law. Hunted relentlessly he chooses to stay with his horse and chance his escape across rugged mountains rather than abandoning him and fleeing on foot.... Burns is not your typical cowboy hero; he is a reminder that the individual is sometimes far grander than the shackles he creates by the imposed rules of society."},{"Title":"Slocum's Good Deed (Slocum #75)","review":"From the back cover: Slocum has his hands full in boom-town L.A. with money-hungry bandits, knife-wielding pimps and gunslinging debtors on his back.

A beautiful witness from the Rialto whorehouse and a prospersous family lead Slocum on a trail that stretches twenty years into the past.... his own!There's really not much going on in this Slocum. The plot and action are confined. I kept waiting for something to \\"happen,\\" but nothing really did. Repetive. Slocum, himself, seemed wimpy and overly-concerned. He even takes on the part of a spur-of-the-moment defense attorney, which I found unbelievable. Slocum is at his best when he's tough, a little self-centered, and down-right mean. None of that here. 187 pages. Not recommended. *"},{"Title":"Our Name is Melancholy: The Complete Books of Azrael","review":"I am a huge fan of raw channeled work. But even this one raised my brows more than a few times. The poetry in this book is nice, the art work gothic and dark which I liked as well, but it's a hard read at best. There are a LOT of grammar errors in this book. It appears to be self edited by Leilah Wendell AKA Westgate Press, but I have to give her an A for the effort there.This is a hard read, even for someone like me who holds several doctrines. It is an intimate portrayal of the author and the \\"Death Angels\\" relationship. I could have found it plausible had she given some form of validating information, but she did not. You would think that \\"Azrael\\" would have given her at least one outstanding futuristic validation, but atlas there are none. I also found the rituals in the back for Necromancy a bit unnerving. This certainly isn't a book for the weak hearted or closed minded :P .With that said I am giving this book three stars for it's poetry and art work. I would buy at least one future work from this author if she could provide some form of validation in it."},{"Title":"Our Name is Melancholy: The Complete Books of Azrael","review":"Our Name is Melancholy is a strange book, because it's more than just a book. In one sense it's a declaration of love from Leilah Wendell to Azrael, the angel of Death. On the other hand it's a declaration of love from Azrael to Wendell. It's also a biography of Wendell's life and childhood, how and why she founded Westgate and opened the House of Death in New Orleans. Furthermore, it has attributions from Wendell's husband Daniel Kemp. And, it's filled with spiritual discussions about the true nature of Death and what happens when our lives on earth finally come to an end.Does this confuse you? Good, because it really IS confusing. Put shortly, Wendell's relation with the angel of Death, which she has met both physically and spiritually (whatever that means) is quite unusual. Azrael is her one true love; but in this life in this body she's married to Daniel Kemp, who she lives with in the House of Death.Not surprisingly, Wendell isn't afraid of death - after all, she and it shares something so special that she's unable to really describe it in words - but still, Our Name is Melancholy is definitely not a pro-suicide book. What Wendell tries to explain is that we don't really have any real reason to fear death, since it's not an evil thing in itself. Whether or not one chooses to believe in this is up to the reader, but the message isn't very much different from other books of the New Age that all talk about how this particular life on earth is but one of many lives).Hmm... Well, that might be, but the truth is that in case you don't really care much about the New Age in general and spirituality in particular, then Our Name is Melancholy probably isn't the right book for you.However, the declarations of love that appear throughout the book are written in very beautiful English. The words chosen by Wendell, Azrael (through Wendell) and Kemp are all very delicate and exquisite, and most of the time it feels as if one is reading a collection of love poems. The authors are very skilled in what they're doing, no doubt about that, but is this enough for anyone to invest in the book? Maybe, maybe not. Westgate has published other works that are real collections of poems, and if it's poems you want, than maybe these books are a better choice (for instance Eros in Exile). But in case you want to learn more about Wendell, Kemp, their view of Death, and the House of Death, then the book can be worth looking up."},{"Title":"Our Name is Melancholy: The Complete Books of Azrael","review":"This is one of the very first books that I ever bought regarding Azrael when it was first published! The vast information that graces the pages is invaluable, and the purest knowledge behind the writing is unbeatable.

Their hauntingly penned words gracefully intertwine allowing one to see past their deepest fears surrounding the mystery of Death as we know it. This is truly a compelling book and unlike any I've ever before encountered.

With a truly open-mind, and a desire to know know more of Azrael, one will certainly enjoy this wonderful writing. Those who are not into the \\"Darker Side\\" of life will most likely not appreiate, nor even understand the writings.

The content? Well, Leilah Wendell has enshrined herself in the glorified role of the messenger of a messenger. Amusing. Her divine identity, Na' Haliel (haliel is just Leilah spelled backwards), does not seem to offer much. And her soul-mate doesn't seem to have much to add.

The first novel was set in New York City, the second in Oahu, and the third is set on a huge cattle ranch on Maui. Like the second novel, the third is centered on the conflict between the native-born Hawaiians (whose lands were expropriated and whose culture is being obliterated) and the haoles who have taken over the islands for profit.In this story the recently married Leslie Farnham returns to Hawaii but is not met by her husband, Don Farnham. In fact, Don, owner of the huge Maui cattle ranch, is missing and presumed dead. More than presumed -- declared dead by his cousins, who have moved into Leslie's home, announcing that they have inherited the ranch and will sell it to developers, to be turned into a dude ranch (thus putting many Hawaiian cowboys out of work).Enter Janice Cameron, who knew Don Farnham when she was a child. Enter also Lily Wu, who has connections to any and every person of Chinese origin on the Islands. The scenes between Lily and Hong, the Chinese cook, are wonderful windows into class differences as well as into how Chinese who speak different dialects might communicate when they don't understand one another.In this third novel, Sheridan has improved as a mystery writer, using more scenes and more dialogue, hiding clues, springing the killer on the reader at the end. The one weakness of this book is the pacing. Everything that happens seems to happen at an even pace: there seem to be few highs or lows. In reality, there are both highs and lows, but the way Sheridan chooses to tell the story evens everything out."},{"Title":"The Mamo murders","review":"Although nominally a mystery story this book works also as a historical period piece of sorts. The setting is post war, pre-statehood Hawaii. Sheridan lived in Hawaii for extended periods and obviously developed a deep seated affection for the islands and its inhabitants...at least its first inhabitants. Like her other works set in Hawaii the plot revolves completely around various aspects of native Hawaiian culture.The mystery itself is quite competent but takes too long to get into high gear. In 150 odd pages the first 100 are largely expository. The last 50 bring everything to a satisfying conclusion at a rapid, can't put the book down, pace.The detectives in this book are Hawaiian-born, but not native Hawaiian Janice Cameron and Chinese American Lily Wu. Wu is very much the brains of the outfit and it would be nice if this scene stealing character had received more page time than she actually gets. The book is told from reader surrogate Cameron's viewpoint but the character isn't quite up to carrying the book for the long stretches required.Recommended, but I think the book's reputation mainly rests on its authentic Hawaiian setting and its then novel use of strong female (and in Wu's case Asian) leads than the brilliance of the plot."},{"Title":"The Mamo murders","review":"Postwar view of Honolulu as seen through the eyes of Janice Cameron and Lily Wu, a pair of female sleuths. Nice glimpses of Honolulu in its heyday. Of the 4 Lily Wu stories this is the longest and possibly the best."},{"Title":"Rock Bottom","review":"Pamela Des Barres is apparently torn between writing a \\"respectable\\" rock book, and another collection of groupie memories. Because \\"Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon\\" is merely another tepid recounting of rock'n'roll's worst moments, and it isn't elevated by Des Barres' own recollections.The theme is addiction, jail time and death -- most world-famous rockers have encountered at least one of the above. Des Barres explores the lives (and often deaths) of famed rockers like the doomed Jim Morrison, Queen's Freddie Mercury, the cruel Rick James, wild man John Bonham, equally wild Keith Moon, and many others. Her tales stretch from the early days of rock'n'roll to the early 1990s, but few things actually change.Sadly, Des Barres doesn't add anything to the telling of rock'n'roll's tale. Her recountings are mostly compressed biographies, with no new revelations or insights. Okay, we know Morrison could be a boor. We know Sid Vicious descended into heroin addiction. Yada yada -- it reads like a collection of magazine tributes.She also tries to inject herself into the book, which only unbalances it. It's a bit weird to hear distant third-person accounts, then hear detailed \\"I\\" accounts. Her accounts aren't terribly interesting either -- somehow hearing about her peeping-tammy antics, watching Brian Jones with two girls, is creepy rather than enlightening.Des Barres' writing does not make up for the lack of new information. At best, it's ordinary. At worst, it includes lines like \\"I could feel my own swelling love-pump pressing against my rib cage.\\" Too many chapters are filled with unwarranted hero-worship, no matter how deteriorated, depraved or deranged the stars were. Apparently it's in line with Des Barres' idea that a REAL rock star must be arrested, addicted and cause headlines with weird antics.A lack of new info and a tepid writing style bog down \\"Rock Bottom: Dark Moments In Music Babylon,\\" a failed attempt at a serious rock'n'roll book. Definitely to be missed."},{"Title":"Endless Chain (Shenandoah Album)","review":"I am an Emilie Richards fan. I have read just about all of her books and this one is definitely one of the best ones in her collection. I am really happy to see that the characters that I love so much in The Wedding Ring have been reintroduced in this book even though they are just supporting characters. Nancy, Helen and Tessa are back only this time, the story revolves around Rev. Sam Kinkade and Elisa Martinez. Sam Kinkade is the young reverend that has taken over the small community church. He has also set up the parsonage house to be an afterschool tutoring program to help teach English to the Hispanic children in the community. Elisa is a young Hispanic woman who is hired to be the church's sexton. She also works at the local nursing home.They both have histories that neither are willing to share but have baggage in which neither could trust the other just yet. Sam is also engaged to a lovely woman named Christine who lives in Atlanta. However, he could feel an intense attraction to Elisa who is also surrounded by mysteries of her own. And this novel is their story.This is perhaps one of the most intense-written novels in awhile that is from Richards' collection. This one has another story written into Elisa's story ~~ there is a story of a runaway slave tied to Elisa's past ~~ and Elisa's life runs parallel to it. Elisa is also a runaway but from a different sort of circumstances. Richards really writes more intensely of a political nature that is surprising as well ~~ she writes intimately of a civil right that most Americans have taken for granted, freedom from being perscuted by the government.This is a compelling book ~~ one that you will not be able to put down. I cannot believe that other readers have not discovered Emilie Richards ~~ I have always found her books readable and likable and just wonderfully written. This book is much better than a lot of her earlier works ~~ and more enticing too. It may be about two people who meet each other and fall in love ~~ but it also had other stories tied up in that romance. It is about people and dreams and memories and where they have been before they met their soulmate and what is going to happen next. It is a book that keeps you interested in what is going to happen with the characters long after the last page has been turned. It is a book about life.If you haven't read Richards' books yet, I highly recommend that you start with this one. It is the second book in the Shenandoah Album series (the first one would be The Wedding Ring) ~~ but you can start with this one as her books are not written in a sequel ~~ just of familiar characters introduced in Wedding Ring.2-18-06"},{"Title":"Endless Chain (Shenandoah Album)","review":"In Toms Brook, Virginia, Minister Sam Kinkade enjoys working with the congregation of the Shenandoah Valley Community Church until his programs to help the growing Latino population adjust runs into strong opposition including nasty vandalism. On the plus side he hires Elisa Martinez to serve as liaison between the communities that Sam represents.Though engaged to a social climber, Sam is intrigued by Elisa who remains a mystery but is terrific as a sexton. Unbeknownst to Sam, Elise is on the run changing locations, jobs, and names often so as to hide her identity and insuring she stays detached. However, first the congregation's quilting circle, then the rest of the members and finally Sam have gotten inside her heart so that this time vanishing into the night will leave her scarred forever with memories of what could have been if only. However, as she lingers, Elise' past arrives in town forcing decisions by one and all.ENDLESS CHAIN is an intriguing community drama that will have the audience wondering what or who is Elisa running from and what will happen to her and her beloved Sam when the past catches up to her. This work is inspirational although the well written story line does not offer miracle clean ups but provides a miraculous tale of redemption, and second chances with a congregation coming together with the nurturing healing of love, which is the miracle. Emilie Richards provides her audience with a beautiful and wonderful character driven contemporary romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Endless Chain (Shenandoah Album)","review":"I picked up this book after reading the first of the Shenandoah series.

But as the story progresses we see that everyone has a secret, including the pre-Cival War home that houses the school.With precise storytelling, Emilie Richards unwinds a wonderful addition to her Shenandoah Album series that brings the residents of Toms Brook into our homes and makes the reader a wonderful addition to the close knit community that cares for one another in a way that now seems foreign to most of us."},{"Title":"Endless Chain (Shenandoah Album)","review":"This book is also in the Shenandoah Album series so I enjoyed reading it and could not wait to get to the next one.

If he was a Catholic priest this would play out better. As a liberal (sex when engaged) pastor of a \\"community\\" church it falls flat.

Rather than just discussing each feature in the software (as Microsoft Press' book does), FP2000 Unleashed walks the reader through hard-to-grasp concepts like ASP programming and database connectivity.Our knowledge in terms of these subjects is limited, but FP2000 Unleashed has helped immensely in showing us how to set up an online database that connects using ODBC technolgy and active server pages (which was all Greek to us before we received the FP2000 Unleashed book).The important thing to know about this book: It walks the reader through the processes.

The key phrase here is &quot;complete overview&quot;, as the in-depth detail that many of the new features of FP 2000 has over its predecessors is not there.This is a good overview of FP 2000 for the intermediate user who has used other versions of FP. I would recommend that beginners or advanced users look elsewhere. If you are looking for detailed descriptions or examples of FP 2000's new features, look elsewhere. If you plan on using database integration, ASP, DHTML or CSS and you buy this book -- budget to buy at least one more book to cover these advanced features.In sum, I feel this is a good book for a book report about FP 2000 for a high school class; as a &quot;hands-on&quot; guide for real users, this book is not it."},{"Title":"Microsoft FrontPage 2000 Unleashed, w.

It has 2 chapters designed as quick lessons to FrontPage 2000. Everything after this moves increasingly to intermediate, advanced and expert areas.Part II of the book covers the essentials of multimedia, tables, frames and image maps. I found the design advice to be sound and helpful. No other Frontpage book I read had these kinds of design tips. Most others focussed on how to point and click.Part III of the book covers all the core features of Frontpage 2000 from themes to style sheets to GIF animation. Again, I found the focus not only on Frontpage use but on sound design refreshing. Chapter 9 on dynamic HTML and Chapter 13 on GIF animation had tips I found nowhere else.Part IV has 5 chapters on forms and form handling that takes you through intermediate, advanced and expert areas. Wonderful! No other book I found had such in depth coverage of forms.Part V covers templates, wizards and webbots. This is pretty basic and beginning. The only chapter I found useful was 24 covering user registration and restricted webs.Part VI covers integration with Office. You'll find separate chapters on integrating Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Access. Chapters 26 and 28 on Excel and Access were the most useful to me personally. I learned several good tricks and just one of these is worth the price of the book.And that's only half the book.

Joel Hecker's Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals is not just an introduction to issues of food preparation and eating in Medieval Kabbalah, it opens the door to a wider, carefully studied understanding of one segment of Jewish mysticism. Dr. Hecker has been well-trained in academic appreciation of the relationship between bodily and mystical adventures. After a prologue dealing with food and food-laws in pre-medieval Judaism, he shows how much of Kabbalah, especially the Zohar, is effected by dining. Idealized foods, mystical satiation, and etiquette are among the issues of focus; the conversations of the Zoharic companions, and their eating practices, are the data from which generalizations are drawn.The study became more interesting and clearer for me as he approached the possibility of exerting influence on the Creator, as it were. Following the quotation \\"Blessing does not rest on an empty place\\", he investigates that possibility, known as theurgy. Dr. Hecker suggests that talismanic theurgy, the use of a material object to bring Divine energies into the world, is most relevant in the study of pre-, para-, and post-prandial Zoharic meetings, conversations, and illuminations.Since it is possible to prepare and eat food only for the sake of the body, the author is careful to differentiate this approach from the mystical intentions described in the Zohar and other sources, and yet to show how important the body is for an understanding of the mystical mission. It has been argued by Gershon Scholem, and others, that, in mystical pursuits, the \\"craving for food and sleep or anything else is annihilated.\\" Again, this book shows how that concept is not entirely, or perhaps not even generally true in Jewish mysticism. Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals is not for the absolute beginner; one would want to be already comfortable with medieval studies, or with cultural approaches to food and meals, or with mysticism generally, or, more helpfully, with Jewish mysticism particularly. Given that, however, and a willingness to dig deeply into what becomes a fascinating, careful review, the book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals: Eating And Embodiment In Medieval Kabbalah (Raphael Patai Series in Jewish Folklore and Anthropology)","review":"In \\"Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals,\\" Joel Hecker has written a fascinating work on eating in Medieval Kabbalah. Since the uninitiated may not be aware of the central role played by food in the Kabbalah, it suffices to point out that the Zohar itself opens by drawing an analogy between Knesset Yisrael and the Kiddush cup. So Hecker's book goes to the very heart of the Kabbalah.The book is meant primarily as a meticulous work of academic scholarship, and so the novice reader may find it difficult going at first; in this case it would be helpful to consult an introduction to the Kabbalah, such as that found in Daniel Matt's \\"Zohar: The Book of Enlightenment.\\"And yet the charm of this book is that its theme - food - makes it accessible to all. For example, as an observant Jew, I found that the insights of the Kabbalah into common practices deeply enriched my own observance. To cite just one example - the somewhat perplexing practice of eating a festive meal on the eve of the Yom Kippur fast - the book quotes the Zohar as suggesting that this may have the function of making the fast more challenging - enabling us to better fulfill the Torah's admonition to \\"afflict your souls\\".In short, this book is to be heartily recommended, not just for the scholar of the Kabbalah, but also for all those who are interested in the role of food in Jewish practice and thought."},{"Title":"History of Carroll County New Hampshire","review":"Written in 1889, this is an excellent account of the life as well history of the area.

I was surprised by many of the facts of their private lives that seemed to have escaped the history books. If you believe in reincarnation or not, this book will give you insight into two amazing lives or should I say; one remarkable soul."},{"Title":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh: Revealing the Mysteries of Karma and Rebirth","review":"A simple premise: the 19th century soul of Abraham Lincoln reincarnated on earth as 20th century Charles Lindbergh. While the thesis of this book could be considered a marginal, \\"unscientific\\" one within the realm of pure academia, I hope that at least a few serious scholars give this book a look. This is a brilliant work not just of metaphysics, but of U.S. history. Salva presents the true heart and soul of these two giants in a highly readable anecdoctal style that cuts through all confusion and gets right to the heart of the men. The view of Lincoln given here is probably unique and also probably more accurate than portrayed to date. Portions of the Civil War section are devastating: Lincoln was wracked with guilt over the war, yet compelled by duty to defend the Union. A very powerful, well-researched, and perceptive view of the President at war.For those like myself who knew almost nothing about Charles Lindbergh other than the stock cliches of \\"famous pilot\\" and of \\"Nazi-lover,\\" (the prevailing view within \\"The Nation\\" magazine) this is a brilliant well-balanced introduction to the man. I wish I had read this book before I had read other negative accounts regarding Lindbergh, because what emerges from these pages is a clear picture of a great American. A man, I should say, who clearly is not an anti-Semite or a Nazi-lover, despite the frequency of those charges. Salva also does an excellent job at explaining the mysterious, almost frightening, worldwide fame that came to Lindbergh very suddenly after that first transatlantic flight.This is a creative and soulful, but serious work of history. The author has succeeded in his quest to \\"prove\\" the intuitive statement of the great yogi Paramhansa Yogananda that inspired this book. The book could be improved with a bibliography that included more information on sources, such as year of publication and publisher. Other than that, there is not really any other way that this work could be better. I recommend it highly to those interested in reincarnation and history alike."},{"Title":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh: Revealing the Mysteries of Karma and Rebirth","review":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh is very difficult to put down!

Author Richard Salva offers an entertaining and well-researched narrative of both of these famous lives, giving unparalleled insight into the past as well as hope for the future.As a believer in reincarnation, I have always felt that John F. Kennedy was the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln. But, Richard Salva does make some very thought-provoking points in his book that will make the reader sit up and take notice.Both believers and non-believers in reincarnation will find this book completely enthralling. Richard Salva is a talented and compelling writer and I would love to see more from this author."},{"Title":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh: Revealing the Mysteries of Karma and Rebirth","review":"Many fascinating books have been written about reincarnation, but none with such an intriguing premise as this one. Reams of historical fact back up the thesis that the same spirit inhabited both bodies. A marvelous mystery, meticulously researched, intelligently written, utterly entertaining.

Soul Journey From Lincoln To Lindbergh presents hundreds of similarities in the personalities, character, and life circumstances between Lincoln and Lindbergh, presenting an articulate, documented, persuasively iconoclastic argument that offers a unique and compelling reassessment of their lives, accomplishments, and coincidences.

Yes, it's unique: how many other folks that we know well did a God-realized master (like Yogananda in this case) say had reincarnated as another famous person? ...and in recent history, with volumes of information and photos about each to prove the point? But beyond that, I was pleasantly surprised by two things: First, by Richard Salva's writing style, very enjoyable; second and most importantly, by the insights I was left with about the implications of reincarnation, and how they apply to my own life. I found I had taken on the \\"long view\\" of my life and its lessons, and as a result had a profoundly wiser, lighter and more joyful attitude. Thank you, Richard!"},{"Title":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh: Revealing the Mysteries of Karma and Rebirth","review":"I was very pleased with the clear and thought-provoking presentation of this book. On one level it encapsulated the true essence of both men in a thorough and beautiful way. And for those who are interested in the mysterious workings of reincarnation on a soul level, it offers profound new insights. Each chapter flows with facts about each man mirrored together, so that you can actually follow the current of soul development in these two great lives. I could see how the quirks and turns of one's life actually follows a harmonious plan; and karma as our great teacher, gives us the perfect lessons we need for our highest good."},{"Title":"Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh: Revealing the Mysteries of Karma and Rebirth","review":"With artful and scientific detail, Mr. Salva has woven a compelling parallel between the lives of Lincoln and Lindburgh.

Beautifully designed by an array of talented artists, including Maurice Sendak, specialists in pop-up engineering and all the pieces lovingly put together in Ecuador. My favorite? Two pages topped with old postcard letters-- &quot;CONEY ISLAND.&quot; The beach front is covered with mini-bathers frolicking in and out of the water while the rollercoaster rolls by and the ferris wheel spins. There's a great boardwalk and everything that you could want at Coney Island. The only thing missing from the scene is Nathan's. There's an amazing Brooklyn Bridge, and lots of information for all ages about the history of that special borough...."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Pops Up","review":"It is really nice to see a resurgence of such childhood favorites as the &quot;pop-up&quot; book. Truly the first multimedia toys, these books add a new dimension (pun most certainly intended) to the written word.What a wonderful way to introduce children and adults alike to the cultural Mecca that is Brooklyn. I loved this book so much, not only did I buy it for my library's children's collection, but I also bought a copy for myself.Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Brooklyn Pops Up","review":"Each foldout page in this book was designed by a different person. Sometimes they're disappointing as pop-ups, but there are some bright moments. The cover by Maurice Sendak allows you to see behind it into how the movements are made. The brownstones page is silly, with stupid bug cartoons everywhere. The library is really disappointing, with no real focus and no real view of what the building looks like. The art museum is just lovely, and is probably the best -- but then, it's by Sabuda (my favorite pop-up artist)! The botanic garden could have been the most colorful and beautiful page -- instead, it's childish and dull. The carousel is fun, with horses popping out at you. The Brooklyn Bridge is nice, but the flavors of Brooklyn are worthless. Coney Island is fun, with a rotating Ferris wheel. The book comes in a handy-dandy re-sealable plastic cover. So if you're fond of Brooklyn this will be a really nice memento. But I do NOT recommend it for reading out loud to children."},{"Title":"Brooklyn Pops Up","review":"I bought this book for my young nephew, so he would see where his Auntie was from, even if he couldn't come visit. At 2-1/2, he is a bit young/brutal for the fragility of a pop-up book (even though this one is decently strong). I'm confident that if my nephew was a bit older, he might be able to appreciate the sentimental purpose with which I gave him this book.The pop-ups bring Brooklyn to life, highlighting the Botanic Gardens, Grand Army Plaza, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island, and more. We played \\"peekaboo\\" with the kids hiding in the Gardens. We counted the ships sailing beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, and we pretended to eat the Coney Island hotdog before giving the ferris wheel a spin. Really cute book for a kid, or an adult who likes pop-up books!"},{"Title":"Brooklyn Pops Up","review":"An excellent, albeit silliy, addition to the library or coffee table of Brooklynites of any age.

Green is very insightful and shows the beginnings of conducting from an old master like Malko.I would reccommend buying the Max Rudolf text (used by most major conservatories and universities) for a more substantial basis. Then read this book and get a whole new perspective on several different baton techniques, rehearsal techniques, and conducting in general.My only problem is that I don't think this book is worth the 68 dollars that the publisher is asking. First get the Rudolf (much thicker, more info for a basis, and cheaper) and get this book. It's great despite the price and somewhat limited explanation."},{"Title":"Modern Conductor, The","review":"The Modern Conductor is an amazingly straight-forward book. Its directions are constructive and clear, and by following Elizabeth Green's suggested exercises and drills, you will develop great conducting &quot;grammar.&quot; Arm motions become second-nature, and the aspiring conductor can focus instead on expressing musical ideas clearly to the orchestra.I was Elizabeth Green's last student before she died in 1995. This book brought me to this wonderful musical sage. Nothing can replace the lessons I had with her as senior in high school, but the Modern Conductor encapsulates her method and primary teachings. It is an essential book for any conductor who wants to speak clearly with the hands."},{"Title":"Modern Conductor, The","review":"I have the fifth edition of this book, which I bought on Amazon.com for $15. I don't believe the 7th edition is THAT radically different to pay $68.The book is concise and clear but comparing to \\"The Technique of Conducting\\" by Ilya Musin (another pupil of Nikolai Malko) is rather scimpy and informationally insufficient. Max Rudolf definitely covers much more territory than E. Green, 5th or 7th edition notwithstanding. No one, so far, did a better job explaining the intricacies of manual technique than Musin.Green's book would be of much more value if it came with a DVD, demonstrating all that is said in the book. It's better one time to see than a hundred times to hear about.There is one book (and a small one) that might serve a better purpose. A student of Ilya Musin came up with his own pedagogical book:Ennio Nicotra, Introduction to the orchestral conducting technique in accordance to Ilya Musin's school. This one is in three languages (English, Italian, Spanish) and it comes with a DVD, in which all the techniques and manual tricks are shown sequentially. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Modern Conductor, The","review":"This is an excellent and comprehensive text. Everything a budding conductor might need or find valuable about the art of conducting the modern orchestra.

Recommended to anyone who loves classical music."},{"Title":"Modern Conductor, The","review":"My professor is in love with Elizabeth Green, he has met her, and swears by her teachings.

It is not a book that you read but rather you are read by. If you understand the difference you might begin to understand the message of the author. Although every insight is explained in a conceptual way, Kadowaki-san continually reminds the reader at each stage that if you are satisfied with just that much you are missing the real import of the Bible message. He is very much in line with the mystical side of Christianity and indeed most religious mystical traditions. If you come to this book full of your beliefs, whatever they are, Christian or Zen Buddhist they will keep you from experiencing the Path. If you are ready to empty your cup and just read and be open, great abundance awaits you. Just as it always has. This is a book you can experience again and again. A fine source for meditative practice even if you're not Catholic as the author is. My poor paperback is now getting worn out and I'm looking for a hardback to replace it. A little known gem that everyone serious about living the life of Christ instead of just being \\"churched\\" should make part of their everyday mind.

In zazen one needs to remain erect, regulating one's breath and ordering the mind. It is not enough to remain in a lazy state, without any thoughts in order to transcend the world. What matters is the so-called DOKUSAN, or personal chat with one's teacher. What is being sought is KENSHO, which consists in being able to see into one's nature. One needs to transcend dualistic mentality. Koans cannot be solved through discursive reasoning. In Zen koans are foundational. The author cites 5 types of koan, the solution of which generates a great inner calm and happiness. They are like a sword that kills and that gives life. One needs to experience the MU which is the Original Face (true Self). MU must not be understood in a nihilist way, nor in a dualist way. It is the Buddha-nature.GONSEN: a koan that studies the words of the patriarchs, leading the student to understand its deep meaning, which he then needs to render in his own words.HOSSHIN: (dharma-kaya) koans that help one see with greater clarity into the un-differentiated world of his substantial being, which he has understood in the enlightenment.KIKAN: a koan concerning the bonds of differentiation. The student looks into the un-differentiated world of his true self and then comes back to understand the differentiated everyday world.We need to listen to Jesus' words with our HaraPractitioners must:1)Meditate 5 hours a day2)Pray even when they don't feel like it (agere contra) and especially in every unfavorable circumstanceWhat I found interesting was the comparison between a sesshin and a week of Ignatian exercises."},{"Title":"Keeping Your Kids Awake! during Family Home Evening--Book One","review":"I have used the ideas in this book when my children were smaller and now that they are teenagers.

People exist there and they are independent, so where is the problem to form a new state-nation as the author implies?The problems mainly arose from the fact that their ex-leader, Marhsal Tito, wanted to ethically cleanse the newly founded nation from the albanian minority. In order to do so, Tito and the \\"new macedonian nation\\" created a number of new problems.Their claims that they were Greeks (descentant of ancient macedonians) obviously made Greece react since they still use the name macedonia in their 4,000 old province and they didn't want acts like ethnic cleansing to get related to their history (even by the use of the greek name). Modern-Macedonians became \\"thiefs of history\\" for the Greeks, and the two nations almost get to war 10 years ago.Also, their claims that their language is the ancient macedonian language - although ridiculous since ancient macedonia conquered half the world and was using the Greek \\"koine\\" language - created a new problem with Bulgaria. Their language is a Bulgarian dialect, and clearly bulgaria does not like the fact that a foreign state is trying to redefine it. They know that modern linguists will not get influenced by a political statement that it will arbitrary rename bulgarian to macedonian, yet they worry of what common people will think.This book does not present the source of these problems, i.e. the declaration by marshal Tito and his communist-facist regime in 1945 of the \\"modern macedonian nation\\", and the support he got from Stalin. Hidding info about the post-WWII balkans and the cold-war, will not help modern-macedonians understand why they face these problems today. The name \\"macedonia\\" was not a name that Tito and Stalin selected without knowing the consequenses. They were strong then and they did it as an aggreessive move. The world order changed and the previous aggressor, \\"the new macedonian nation\\", became the defender. As most balkan experts believe, the situation will get worse since modern-macedonia will have to face now the \\"revenge\\" of it's neighbors. Nationalist movements in most balkan states are already stating that they have claims on territories of modern-macedonia. There are greeks now that present the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom) as occupied Greek territory, there are Bulgarians screaming that modern-macedonians speak Bulgarian and thus they are Bulgarians, there are Albanians crying about the supperssion their people get in modern-macedonia and the refuse of the \\"macedonian\\" government to recognize them (40% of the population) as \\"macedonians\\".I could draw a parallel between this book and the explanations for the WWI proposed by some books 85 years ago. No, the problems in modern-macedonia didn't arose from the struggle of some people to define themselves, as the WWI wasn't cause by the murder of Prince Karagiorgevitc in Yugoslavia 85 years ago.If you want to understand the past of Balkans, and 'predict' what will happen in the near future, search for a better book.I was completely disappointed."},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"The most important thing to remember about the &quot;Macedonian conflict&quot; is that the Greek position has changed dramatically over the past decade. Official Greek government policy was that Macedonia did not exist. When Greece took over Aegean Macedonia in 1913, they killed, tortured and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Macedonians. They changed the names of people, villages, and landmarks from Macedonian to Greek in their attempts to eradicate the Macedonian name. Two things to remember:1. It is ironic that Greeks now &quot;love Macedonia&quot; when they tried to eradicate its very existence.2. If Macedonia has always been Greek, why did the Greek government deny its existence until the 1980's?"},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"John Shea's book is an easy to read, concise analysis of the political situation in Macedonia. John Shea analyses the relationship between Macedonia and Greece from earliest times to today and how that relationship affects the complicated politics currently affecting the two nations.The book details Macedonia's current position from the perspective of the Macedonian's. It provides a great insight into the current issues facing Macedonia (externally and internally). It is quite clear that Macedonia faces significant cultural hostility from its neighbours (as can be observed from some of the other reviews on this book).I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone interested in a macedonian viewpoint on today's Macedonia."},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"THE ONLY THINK THEY ACHIEVE BY WRITING \\"BOOKS\\" OF THIS KIND IS TO REVEAL THEIR ENVY FOR THE HELLENIC HISTORY."},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"Recent events in the Balkans have shown that due to the ethnological, geopolitical and historical complexity of the region, serious in depth analysis is of paramount importance in understanding the truth. Apart from the thousands that have died as a result of the break up of Yugoslavia in the 1990's, another victim has been the truth, as is the case in most wars, especially in the 20th century.The truth is based on undisputed facts (dates, events etc), and in relation to opinion, the truth always lies somewhere in the middle. The author along with several \\"reviewers,\\" offer a valuable primary source of the beliefs of those who wish to distort History in order to further their own goals and political agendas at the expense of the historical truth; in this case it is an attempt at convincing the world of the existence of a fictitious Macedonian nationality i.e. a continuation of Yugoslav communist policies from 1945 to the present aiming to create a \\"socialist\\" state in the heart of the Balkans at the expense mostly of NATO member Greece. It is, therefore, a prime example of what should be avoided when in search of the truth. Most of the information included in this book, which is one of numerous that have sprouted in the last ten years with the sole aim of \\"giving birth\\" to a \\"Macedonian nation\\", has been either purposely taken out of context or is irrelevant and unsupported material from unknown origins.One of these \\"reviewers\\" states: \\"If Macedonia has always been Greek, why did the Greek government deny its existence until the 1980's\\". The question is how can Greece, of all countries, deny the existence of her own history? A rather childish and yet dangerous reaction coming as a result of Yugoslav communist propaganda and indoctrination aiming at conditioning the majority Bulgarian-Slavic population of South Serbia into believing they belong to a fictitious \\"Macedonian\\" nationality.There is no bigger crime one can commit against history and human-kind in general, especially the younger generations, than distorting history itself. The undisputed fact is that the \\"Greeks\\" or \\"Hellenes\\", as is more correct, are made up of a mosaic of different peoples with common characteristics. The Macedonians, just like the Spartans, Athenians, Corinthians, and the citizens of Argos, Thebes, Phokis, Eretria and dozens of other regions, spoke and wrote the Greek language, had Greek names, believed in the Greek gods, used Greek architecture and most of all considered THEMSELVES to be Greek, thus setting themselves apart from all others whom they viewed as \\"Barbarians\\". The unification of Greece took place under the hegemony of Macedonia and lead to the downfall of the Persian Empire and the establishment of the mighty Empire of Alexander the Great, through which the Greeks avenged themselves for the Persian Wars and spread Hellenism across the \\"Known World\\" and into the far reaches of uncharted lands in Asia.With this ongoing communist-style propaganda one cannot help, but wonder what's next? Did the Vikings build the Parthenon, were the Spartans African spearmen or was Alexander the Great a Slav?Let's be serious. In a democracy all voices should be heard instead of being immediately disregarded on the basis of their origin. One cannot and should not silence another just because they disagree with them! At the same time, however, the truth should be protected at all cost and not be left to be sacrificed in pursuit of political agendas.This book provides a fictitious insight in the study of Macedonia. It is a \\"must\\" for anybody interested either in fiction or the study of the use of communist/nationalist propaganda in History."},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"Before I begin my review id like to point out some inaccuracies from previous reviews listed here..First, there was no Greek nation in ancient times but Greek city-states...Athens Sparta Thebes Corinth and yes Macedonia...Ive read previous reviews where the authors claim that the the Greeks revolted under Macedoanian rule which is true...Greek city states greatly valued their independence even from other Greek city states..Such is the case between Athens and Sparta when they tried to dominate each other leading to the Peloponnesian War..It is natural that they would revolt..Claiming that because the other Greek city-states revolted against Macedonia as proof of Macedonians being a non-Greek people is false!!Id like to ask or suggest some food for though to my FYROM readers(Former YugoSLAV Republic Of Macedonia) or disbelievers that the MAcedonians were Greek these FACTS:1)Why is there no evidence of a non-Greek Macedonian language?the ancient Macedonians spoke Greek and had Greek names..2)Where is this non-Greek Macedonian culture hiding?All ancient Macedonian artifacts are GreekAre we suppose to believe the that the ancient Macedoanians were not Greek and then one day out of the blue they said the hell with it let's be Greek?

Romans never adopted Greek names ( cicero ceasar aurelias are not greek)and most of all you can clearly see a distinction between Roman literature and Greek..3)Why did Alexander idolize Greek heroes such as Achilles, why did he keep a copy of the Illiad around as if it were his bible written by another Greek Homer..How is Aristotle his tutor Greek and Alexander isnt when they are both Macedonians?4) Why would the ancient Greeks place the home of their gods( Zeus Athena Poseidon etc) on MT OLYMPUS which is located in ancient Macedonia??Does it make sense for a people to place their holy sites in a foreign land???

Borza, American historian, has written multiple works on ancient Macedon and is regarded an expert on the overall subject:Modern Slavs Macedonians, cannot establish a link with antiquity, as the Slavs entered the Balkans centuries after the demise of the ancient Macedonian kingdom. Only the most radical Slavic factions--mostly &eacute;migr&eacute;s in the United States, Canada, and Australia--even attempt to establish a connection to antiquity. The twentieth-century development of a Macedonian ethnicity, and its recent evolution into independent statehood following the collapse of the Yugoslav state in 1991, has followed a rocky road. In order to survive the vicissitudes of Balkan history and politics, the Macedonians, who have had no history, need one. They reside in a territory once part of a famous ancient kingdom, which has borne the Macedonian name as a region ever since and was called \\"Macedonia\\" for nearly half a century as part of Yugoslavia. And they speak a language now recognized by most linguists outside Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece as a south Slavic language separate from Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian. Their own so-called Macedonian ethnicity had evolved for more than a century, and thus it seemed natural and appropriate for them to call the new nation \\"Macedonia\\" and to attempt to provide some cultural references to bolster ethnic survival.(\\"Macedonia Redux\\", in \\"The Eye Expanded: life and the arts in Greco-Roman Antiquity\\", ed. Frances B Tichener & Richard F. Moorton, University of California Press, 1999)T.J. Winnifrith, British academic:Macedonia (FYROM) was also an attempt at a multicultural society. Here the fragments are just about holding together, although the cement that binds them is an unreliable mixture of propaganda and myth. The 'Macedonian' language has been created, some rather misty history involving Tsar Samuel, probably a Bulgarian, and Alexander the Great, almost certainly a Greek, has been invented, and the name Macedonia has been adopted.

NOTHING.Greece does not recognize a &quot;Macedonian&quot; minority because there was never such an ethnic group. Macedonia has always been a region and not an ethnicity.

According to the author, the Ancient Makedonians did not speak a Hellenic dialect and Alexander the Great's tutor, Aristotle, taught him a slavic dialect.In a Socratic dialogue, that makes Aristotle a slav too since he was born in Ancient Makedonia and returned there when in exile.(I need to burn my history books.)Furthermore, if the ancient Makedonians were slavs, why then was Alexander I, the king of Makedonia, named Philhellene(lover of Hellas)? This title is bestowed only to foreigners.Unfortunately, the author doesn't mention that the king of Makedonia, Alexander I, was named Philhellene by the Theban poet Pindaros for the same reason Jason of Pherrai and Euagoras of Cyprus were called Philhellenes (Isocrates 107A, 199A). The title Philhellene in ancient times meant Philopatris (lover of the homeland) or simply put \\"a patriot\\" (Plato, Politics, 470E; Xenophon, Agesilaus, 7, 4), which is why Alexander the Great did not touch the traditional house of Pindaros when he ordered his soldiers to burn Thebes.I think that the book is poorly written because the author does not take into consideration the 4000 year history of Makedonia and only focuses on the recent 2000 years and especially the cold war period.This being the case and enlighted by the author, I recommend to all Global Hellenes to uprise. How would the Australian Author feel, if 600 years from now, the Hellenic Australian community claims that Australia wasn't an english speaking country because there were Hellenes living in Australia? So, Australia is Hellenic although we came to Australia 170 years after the Anglo-Saxons.Based on his book,I guess the author would agree with the Hellenic Australians since he agrees with the slavs who entered Makedonia in the 6th and 8th century(800 years after Alexander the Great's death). Apotheosis.Claiming, that the inhabitants of The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia(The FYROM) are ethnic Macedonians, direct descendants of, or related to the ancient Macedonians the author contradicts some testimonies from The FYROM's officials:The inhabitants of The FYROM are mostly Slavs, Bulgarians and Albanians. They have nothing in common with the ancient Makedonians.a. The former President of The FYROM, Kiro Gligorov said:\\"We are Slavs who came to this area in the sixth century ... we are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians\\" (Foreign Information Service Daily Report, Eastern Europe, February 26, 1992, p. 35).b. Also, Mr Gligorov declared:\\"We are Macedonians but we are Slav Macedonians. That's who we are! We have no connection to Alexander the Greek and his Macedonia... Our ancestors came here in the 6th and 8th century\\" (Toronto Star, March 15, 1992).c. On 22 January 1999, Ambassador of the FYROM to USA, Ljubica Achevska gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans. In answering questions at the end of her speech Mrs. Acevshka said: \\"We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great ... Greece is Macedonia's second largest trading partner, and its number one investor. Instead of opting for war, we have chosen the mediation of the United Nations, with talks on the ambassadorial level under Mr. Vance and Mr. Nemitz.\\" In reply to another question about the ethnic origin of the people of FYROM, Ambassador Achevska stated that \\"we are Slavs and we speak a Slav language.\\"d. On 24 February 1999, in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen, Gyordan Veselinov, FYROM'S Ambassador to Canada, admitted, \\"We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian.\\" He also commented, \\"There is some confusion about the identity of the people of my country.\\"e. Moreover, the Foreign Minister of the FYROM, Slobodan Casule, in an interview to Utrinski Vesnik of Skopje on December 29, 2001, said that he mentioned to the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, Solomon Pasi, that they \\"belong to the same Slav people.\\""},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"The greatest falsification of history is finnaly demystified.By reading this book,everybody can learn truth about glorious history of Macedonians and painfull aspects of their denial by Athens.Ancient Macedonians were not Greeks-it is adoption of certain Greek customs that was cherished by Hellenophilic historians as prove of their Greek belonging,but that is just as logical as saying that James Joyce was Greek because he is author of book named &quot;Ullisius&quot;.Here,all important aspects of Macedonian History are blended into coherent and extremely well documentated essay-this book will leave speachless anybody who dares to falsify Macedonian history with its power of arguments."},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"Rubbish - the word that best sums up this work of fiction that is masquerading as research"},{"Title":"Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation","review":"No other book manages to expose Greek falsification of Macedonian history with such argumentated foundations.Synthesising the origin of Greek sudden &quot;macedonistic renessance&quot; author displayed incontroversial evidence:archaeologic,linguistic,historical-from antiquity up to modern times-that Macedonia had no ties whatsoever with Hellenism,thus distroying every claim Athens has made toward this territory.

During the new romantic era of the 80's, Tony reached stardom as frontman for Spandau Ballet with his distinctive voice and adoring fans. But as the 80's were coming to a close so were Spandau Ballet. I was quite interested to see how Tony and guitar player Gary Kemp's friendship tunred sour and eventually landed in court over royalties. This book tells the story of how Tony had it all then lost it all.I was almost disillusioned to read how relentless Gary Kemp was in not only to stop paying royalites on Spandau Ballet's material, but to keep his former bandmates, Tony, John Keeble, and Steve Norman at bay not even allowing them to use the words &quot;ex-Spandau Ballet&quot; members during their tours. It was this conflict with Gary Kemp that caused Tony's downward spiral.But the book goes through the many highs and lows of Tony's life both in Spandau Ballet and in personal life, which kind of serves as a lesson for all of us. After reading this book, you will see that no matter what gets in your way of succees, or people that want to bring you down, or even if you make mistakes, don't ever give up on your dreams. Life is an adventure, take it day by day; that's Tony's philosopohy.

But as it goes on, with the band and Tony's financial security going off the rails, the anecdotes get a bit better (Spandau having out-drunk one of the Beasties Boys in Montreaux, plus a not-very-successful effort by Spandau to save money by getting rid of orange juice and nuts -- but not cheese -- from the band's backstage rider). His rift with Gary is the most interesting part of the book and it's easy to sympathize with Tony's position. He comes across as a decent man and it's no wonder he didn't want a reunion or fell off speaking terms with Gary.

But in the midst of her dignity and class and Ethel's forthright personality, there is Joan, now ex-wife of Sen. Ted. This 1970's-era bio is certainly aptly titled: this unKennedy-esque wife was, during most of her marriage, in the background, tormented in silence by her own insecurity and her husband's philandering and its most publicized tragedy in 1969. &quot;Joan, the Reluctant Kennedy&quot; delves more into that part of the woman who never quite felt a part of the clan, but does something of a disservice by glossing over the years-long battle with alcoholism, her slips and relapses and the lessons she might provide that might spare other sufferers her elongated torment. Stunningly beautiful, certainly, but Joan Kennedy was and remains a person of substance, in many respects emotionally fragile but, despite that, a fighter who broke from her general anonymity as another Kennedy wife and established her own identity in music and poetry. While this book doesn't cover the last 30 years of Mrs. Kennedy's life, it does take us up to her son's cancer surgery and her turmoils before. This bio is an admirable effort, and it's somewhat disappointing that other biographers apparently haven't deemed this lady interesting enough for an updated portrait. But this is a worthy start."},{"Title":"The tough-minded optimist","review":"If life has beaten you down, please order this book. It's like sitting down with a wise and kindly friend -- the kind of person who has a way of making us see ourselves and our situation (no matter what it may be) in a fresh and hopeful light. Norman Vincent Peale genuinely cared about his fellow human beings -- and tried to help them with simple, down-to-earth wisdom that has changed countless lives for the better. No matter where you are in life, or what has happened to you, this book can help"},{"Title":"The tough-minded optimist","review":"Dr. Peale talks about his internal struggle before he adopted the truths of &quot;tough minded optimism.&quot; It was through observation that he discovered philosophy and generalizations didn't work in the real world of problems. The authentic faith as taught by Jesus Christ works! It doesn't ignore problems, it looks beyond them to solutions.Odd that the same two philosophies that were around in the 1940s-1960s when Dr. Peale came to his conclusion are still in the arena today. Those of us who continue to benefit from Dr. Peale's excellent insight are grateful he made the right (and I mean that literally) choice. What he teaches works!"},{"Title":"The tough-minded optimist","review":"This book gives the account of Dr. Peale's conversion experience to a vital relationship with Jesus Christ. His wife led him to the Lord, even though he was already a Methodist pastor. Many people claim that he was New Age and an evil perpetrator of false religion. The truth is that he was a master at applying Christianity to real life situations, when others were only interested in doctrinal correctness.This is a great book and the title says it all: you have to be and remain tough-minded to shield yourself from all the negativity around you. Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any virtue or praise, thing on these things. You are not going to help anybody if you have a sad, bad, negative attitude. The world needs radically consistent happy and positive optimistic people or we'll go down the tubes.Have a happy day!"},{"Title":"The tough-minded optimist","review":"I own all books written by Dr Peale.

I didn't care for this book too much at all."},{"Title":"Decision Analysis for the Professional","review":"This book is an excellent intermediate-level text on decision analysis that deals with both uncertainty and risk. It uses realistic examples that working professionals will appreciate and to which they can relate.It's written as a tutorial that uses two tools, Sensitivity, which is used with the chapters dealing with decisions under uncertainty, and Supertree for developing decision trees related to risk analysis. Instructions on obtaining the student versions of these programs are included in the book. Note that the student version of Supertree accommodates trees with up to 250 endpoints, and the student version of Sensitivity performs sensitivity for up to 12 variables.My most used text on decision analysis is Making Hard Decisions by Robert T. Clemen. Where that book is more comprehensive, it's also less suitable for the working professional who needs a refresher and a desk reference. Therein lies the main value of this book - it's more aligned to real world problems that you'll find in the workplace and is written to be both a tutorial and a reference."},{"Title":"Decision Analysis for the Professional","review":"This book started life as a manual for the SuperTree decision analysis software package. The 3rd edition has been rewritten to be software-neutral and now incorporates the dialogue decision process (DDP) and the concepts of decision quality.Between this andMaking Hard Decisionsby Robert Clemen, DAftP is the more practical, and hence better, book for the ordinary professional working with a decision analyst, or as a first text for a trainee decision analyst wanting to learn about decision diagrams and decision trees, and how these tools should be used in real-world consulting engagements. Mathematical theory is nicely relegated to the \\"Advanced Topics\\" section and well written for those with a non-advanced mathematical education.I would have liked at least some mention of Monte Carlo simulation as an alternative to decision trees, but then it is only in the last year or so (DAftP was last updated in 2001) that Monte Carlo simulation has become a realistic alternative to simple decision tree analysis, largely abetted by the development by Sam Savage of the DIST standard for encoding probability distributions."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"For those who know \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" only from the justly famous movie starring Gregory Peck and David Niven, Alistair MacLean's novel will be an enjoyable surprise. \\"Navarone\\" is, with \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", the Scottish-born MacLean's best known work in the United States. His story of a daring British commando raid against the fictional German-held island of Navarone is loosely based on a failed British expedition to the eastern Aegean Sea during the Second World War. The commandos must silence the guns of the title to permit the evacuation by sea of British troops trapped on a nearby island. The novel traces the commandos' dangerous journey by sea to Navarone and their struggles to survive and outwit the Nazi occupation force long enough to carry out their mission.A strength of this novel is MacLean's portrayal of well-developed and nuanced characters. Captain Mallory, a New Zealander and pre-war mountain climber, is the leader; his deputy is Andrea, a taciturn and dangerous, yet compassionate Greek. Others are Miller, the cynical and world-weary American explosives expert, and young Stevenson, the insecure subaltern and backup climber. We are given enough of the background and voice of each of the major characters to understand why they are the way they are. MacLean took care to populate the story with an interesting supporting cast of British and German military personnel and Greek villagers. In the process, he conveys a sense of the desperately bitter partisan warfare that must have taken place in Nazi-occupied Greece.A second strength is MacLean's ability to weave a complicated yet compelling story. The opening chapter sets the tone with almost brilliantly concise description and dialogue. Mallory, obstensibly spirited out from a behind the lines mission in Crete for a rest, discovers that his boss has a more important mission for him. Mallory's hastily put-together team must surmount a series of hair-raising challenges and make some tough choices along the way. In precise, often understated prose, we experience with the commandos the physical and mental fatigue of a dangerous and morally ambiguous mission. MacLean vividly portrays a harsh world of war and betrayal, in which even the best choices have brutal consequences.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking for an enthralling adventure story, one told with style and substance. This is no mindless summer beach read. \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" is MacLean at his best, a pure pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"MacLean is unbeatable when depicting men simultaneously facing dangerous assignments and horrendous weather conditions. (In addition to &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; do read &quot;Ice-Station Zebra&quot; and &quot;Night Without End,&quot; for example). This undeniable talent makes for a riveting and enjoyable read. Indeed, these books can and should be reread numerous times over the years. This, despite the fact that MacLean stinks in all other writing aspects.His preposterous and one-dimensional characters are easily interchangeable from book to book (by the way, the same is true of his awful and tedious dialogue). In particular, his protagonists share the same characteristics, most of them unattractive, regardless of which book you pick up. To be sure, they are all courageous and resourceful (and why shouldn't they be?), but they also are self-righteous, sickeningly sentimental, and not very bright. Worst of all is their artifical (or at least badly portrayed, sledge hammer) world-weariness. Is this what MacLean was like? Is that why he imprints these undesirable traits on his characters? I don't know. What I do know is that, despite it all, he's an irresistible read."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"My first contact with The Guns of Navarone was the 1961 movie staring Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn. My first contact with the book upon which the movie was based was the Kindle edition, and it is that which I now review.I must say right out of the gate that those who loved the movie will find that while the overall objective remains the same - to destroy The Guns - there are many differences between the movie and the book. For example, \\"Butcher\\" Brown in the movie is not a butcher in the book, Cpl Miller is not the whineing brat that the movie protrays him as, Major Roy Franklin in the movie is a very young Lt. Andy Stevens in the book, etc. Also, there is no female spy or traitor in the book and no \\"born\\" killer from the bronx, and neither Quinn's character, Andrea Stavros, nor Pecks character Capt. Keith Mallory, are quite the hard nosed bastards that the movie protrays them to be. And finally, the movie producers altered some scenes significantly and left others out completelyBut these are minor points compared to the places where the book seems to have trouble making a transition between two different thoughts and story lines. I don't know if it was the author or the conversion from print to electronic format that is to blame, but it appears at times that MacLean is talking about one thing for several pages and then, without warning or pause, from one paragraph to the next, he is talking about something entirely different, leaving the reader lost and trying to figure out what just happened, what s/he just missed. I also had a difficulty accepting MacLean's descriptions of some of his characters, because he seems to provide contradictory descriptions at different points in the book.Still, all-in-all, these are small things that do not make one bit of difference to the overall story. The book still presents some high adventure, pitting a small handful of brave men against seemingly impossible odds.As for those who say the story line is predictable, don't worry about them. I expect it is somewhat predictable when you've had 50 years in which to see the movie or have your friends tell you about it. Just buy the book (or this Kindle version) and enjoy it the way the author meant it to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I have to smile when I see people make so much of MacLean's lack of writing syle or prose or some predictability of the story. Come on folks, this is plain old action entertainment.....never meant to win literature awards. Just enjoy yourself like you do when you read Harry Potter. You're not reading great literature, you're reading a fine story that keeps you interested, is fast moving and often keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is why so many of MacLean's novels have made it to the screen. It's simply entertainment. You want great prose with your action? Step up to Stevenson, Dumas, Cooper or Sabatini.\\"The Guns\\" is a great action story that moves quickly and keeps you interested all the way through. Despite some predictability and weaknessess in the writing style, just enjoy it for what it is.....a 20th century, WWII action story. Read it and have fun!"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I read this book when I was in my early teens and I became an immediate fan of Alstair MacLean. His books waste little time before you get right into the action and then there's action all the way through to the end. I can't remember how many of his books I eventually read; there was &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;, &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;, etc. etc. etc.. About the time I was reading &quot;River of Death&quot; I realized that all the excitement in his books didn't always make up for the hasty way in which he seemed to write them. The tough guy with no personality eventually lost my interest. In my opinion, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; was his best work. Maybe it was the World War II setting that gave it added appeal. He didn't have to waste any paragraphs establishing the cause or who were the good guys and who were the bad. Whatever it was, I remember feeling like I needed to take a deep breath when I was finished with it.It's too bad that literature and spellbinding adventure rarely come together in one book. I remember reading Henry James's &quot;thriller&quot; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; when I was a teenager. That book put me to sleep trying to drag myself through it. Action has no time for character development. Some books make you want to stop and think while others make you want to keep turning the pages. I used to enjoy Alstair MacLean's novels. I would heartily recommend them to any young man who's looking for excitement in a paperback."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Like many others, I first read this one for English in 8th or 9th grade.

Read the book then see the movie... they're both first rate!"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Alastair Maclean was possibly the best adventure writer ever (although I am very fond of Desmond Bagley).This is his second book and maybe his best. The Guns of Navarone concerns the almost suicide mission of a small group of men to Navarone to destroy a set of German guns that are impregnable.It is a solid story and there are the usual Maclean traits throughout the book (questionable dialogue, red herrings, traitors etc) but it is a solid read and far better than so many of the more recent fare of adventure writing we see."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"To all of you who are bad-mouthing this book, stuff it. It's not modern writing but if you read it to read it, not because you have a book report due, you'll like it. I picked it up and could'nt put it down except for a breif exception where I thought my bladder would explode, but then I picked it back up again. I would definitely rate this as a classic and, although some of it is a tad unrealistic, almost all of it is believable. I would highly suggest that if you have a few spare hours, you should immeadietly pick it up and if not, wait for a weekend (or a better time) and then do it. This book is Awesome!"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I got hooked on MacLean twenty years ago, reading everything he ever wrote. The action in the Guns of Navarone is riveting from start to finish, with the right touch of light humor to keep the tension from becoming overwhelming. As the characters make their way through the story,the reader is right there with them. Dusty Miller is a particular favorite. MacLean excels at the World War II stories, and this is among his best."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Sir, I do not know where you went to school but your appaling spelling doesn't exactly support your claim that \\"The Guns of Naverone\\" has poor sentence structure etc. How would you know?

This is the exact reason I love these reviews, they are hilarious!"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"From a military viewpoint, this story is not even close to believable. From a liturature viewpoint, this book has simple sentence structure, simple character development, and very basic dialog. This novel seams to have been thought of and written on a weekend holiday. Previous reviews mentioned this book as a freshman level read and that is a good description of the subject content."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; was an amazing display of creativity in a &quot;war based&quot; novel. The drama behind &quot;the guns&quot;. Those darn guns were the only thing stopping forward progress in the war. The only other reasonable attempt would be a suicide mission up the giant cliffs and into the heart of the enemy stronghold. The way each character had his own trait and how it fit into the plot completed the comprehensive make-up of their actions. They each provided a specific and vital part to the mission. I do not want to get into any detail as to not ruin the story for any interested readers, but I will say to the fans of Tom Clancy pieces, you will be happy reading this Alistair MacLean novel."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"This is a Critical I did for my english classThe book The Guns of Navarone by Alistar Maclean is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Everything in this book is golden from the characters to the setting. The book is filled with lots of thrills and some of the pages leave you hanging and it just makes want to read on. The author describes everything well and doesn't heavily describe anything. The book contains many strengths they include the following: a well developed story, good characters, simple descriptions and lots of thrills. The story is set in World War II where five men are on a mission to destroy the guns of Navarone. Navarone is a greek island that is currently under the control of the Germans. The guns themselves are massive machines that could wipe out a whole navy. The characters are very well described and each has their own talents. Keith Mallory is the main character and the captain of the team. He is the best rock climber in the world. Andrea is a buff soldier and has survived the roughest conditions. Dusty Miller is an American and was in the British airforce. Andy Stevens is an expert at sailing and is an alpinist. Casey Brown was an engineer. The descriptions of every thing in the book are fairly simple so they don't make confused trying to find out what the author is talking about. There are a lot of thrills in the book. In every chapter there is always an obstacle the five men have to try and win. Some parts in the book put the men in impossible situations, which leave you wanting to read more. There's a bunch of action in this book with guns blazing and characters doing the unthinkable. Even though the book seems flawless it does have a weakness. Some of the obstacles the characters must accomplish seem too impossible. For example there is a scene where the men are at sea and the Germans pull up to the five men and their boat and force them to lower the sails and get inspected. The Germans board the ship and the characters kill the soldiers and blow up the Germans boat by tossing two boxes of explosives over. This causes the boat to sink and the five men move on with their mission. Overall this is a good book to read. If I would grade it on a scale of 1-10 I would give the book a 9. This book is fairly old but it is still a good book even today. I would recommend this book to high school students and up. I don't think anyone under 9th grade should read it because the book contains violence and profanity. I would recommend this book to be read by males because most females don't like books based on war and contain violence and profanity. The vocabulary isn't insanely difficult to understand, as is the same with the descriptions. If you like a action thriller with guns and war pick up this book right now and read it."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Some British sailors are shipwrecked on a Greek island called Kheros. Preventing their rescue are a pair of powerful German guns located on the neighboring island of Navarone. Any attempt to rescue the stranded men results in the rescue ship being sunk, and efforts to destroy the guns by air have failed because they can be retracted inside of a protective cave.With time running out for the men on Kheros, Captain James Jensen of the Royal Navy brings in Captain Keith Mallory, a British undercover agent from New Zealand, pulling him away from another mission in Crete in the process. Mallory is a mountain-climbing expert, and Jensen assigns him the task of getting a commando team led by Lieutenant Andy Stevens onto Navarone by scaling the sheer cliffs of the island, which the Germans don't guard very closely.Mallory takes the mission, provided he can bring his Greek friend Andrea along. Then it's time to meet the team. In addition to Mallory, Andrea and team leader Stevens, there are two others: American explosives expert Corporal Dusty Miller and engineer Casey Brown. Once on Navarone, however, Stevens injures his leg during the climb, forcing Mallory to take over command of the group. They link up with two Greek resistance members, Louki and Panayis, who help guide them across the island towards the German fortress. But there's danger at every turn; the Germans seem to know the Allied commando team are coming, which means someone sold them out. But who? Can Mallory learn who the traitor or traitors are before it's too late? Can they hope to succeed in destroying the guns of Navarone...?This was a great read. I'd seen the film first, obviously, as I'm sure most people have, so I was surprised I liked the novel as much as I did. It's definitely one of author Alistair MacLean's finest. I really like the Dusty Miller character. He may be nothing like David Niven's acerbic character from the film, but he's still enjoyable. Missing is the conflict between the Mallory and Andrea characters, something that was added to the film. I don't mind its absence. Anyway, if you liked the film, you'll probably like the novel, too, so I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Love the movie, book is even better. Wish I could get it as a kindle download. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I read this book many years ago as a teenager, and after having purchased a Kindle I decided to revisit it, as it has been a very long time. As then, I am enjoying this book immensely, it's a great war time action story, with characters larger than life (the way we like them), but able to hold your interest. The characterization is brilliantly done and you would swear that if you ever met these characters on the street you would know them just like that, introductions un-necessary.It's a classic British versus Germans war time yarn, with a seemingly mismatched band of extremely competent soldiers sent into an occupied Island to silence some big German guns and thus effect the rescue of many trapped allied soldiers.The story is gripping, forcing to you to always be wanting to turn the page, even when it's well and truely past bedtime! What more can we want from an action book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"The way the book is written takes the reader along with Captain Keith Mallory and his crew: you are with them climbing the mountain, freezing to death... You want to go to the last page in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Quite by accident I picked this up and started reading. From the first page, the esteemed war thriller author, Alistair MacLean, engages his reader. Off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea the Germans and Italians control a cluster of islands and the area shipping lanes. On one island 1200 British soldiers are trapped and will soon be attacked by the Axis Alliance. The destruction of the mighty Guns of Navarone is the only hope these Brits have. It is a suicide mission. The guns are protected by both nature and man in their fortress. But a savvy military strategist may have found the how and who to silence these great guns.Captain Keith Mallory is legendary. The New Zealander is a renowned rock climber and knows how to survive behind enemy lines. His faithful friend (and his good luck charm) Andreas is a Greek resistance fighter has no qualms killing Germans. The young Stevens is proficient in German and Greek is also a great climber, but is afraid of his fear. American Corporal Miller is a demolitions specialist and Brown is known for his saboteur skills. They have 3 days to scale the sheer 400 foot cliffs on the southern side of Navarone, destroy the guns, and get out before the British fleet sails into the Aegean channel to fortify the trapped soldiers. After the climb that almost killed them, the team believes the hardest part of the mission is behind them. But the Navarone fortress proves to be as great of a challenge as the cliffs. They have to choice but to destroy those guns. Many men's lives are dependent upon their success. And they will die trying to accomplish the mission.MacLean is a master story teller with intimate knowledge of the military. He served on a cruiser in WWII while serving in the Royal Navy. His writing is fast paced with a great detail that does not bough down the story line. His twists are like gentle waves. They don't jar the reader. The twists and turns just seem part of the story as its natural progression. Mallory and his team are well characterized. This reader liked and cared about them. Often I caught myself holding my breath as I read the book. In my opinion, the 1961 movie Guns of Navarone just put faces to these wonderful characters. The drama is in the book. Though the film is dramatic and viewers are reminded of the tight time line Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn have, the book is deeper. The drama and action is more complete due to MacLean's wonderful writing."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"The Guns of Navarone...The Guns of Navarone...The Guns of Navarone. Repeat that over and over, and you will soon be thinking that Tom Cruise can't even top it. This is the mother of all Mission: Impossible scenarios. Alistair MacLean, as always, pens a thrilling war novel, and he makes death as real as possible in The Guns of Navarone. There are surprises littered throughout the story. However, I give the book a weak 4 out of 5 for two reasons. It is predictable as it gets because obviously the mission will be accomplished. Secondly, I just cannot believe the commando group went through all of that without a single drop of water but only to drink lotsa of wine! All in all, The Guns of Navarone is simply this: \\"An entire navy had tried to silence the guns of Navarone and failed. Full-scale attacks had been driven back. Now they were sending in just five men, each one a specialist in dealing death.\\""},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Strong points: A largely fast-paced adventure story---not bad for something written 52 years ago---with a lot of excellent local color and rich information about WWII. MacLean's passion and talent as a writer make this book a worthwhile read.The weaknesses: The book gets over-the-top in grandiosity at points. His band of main characters read almost like cardboard cutout superheroes, with their BRILLIANCE, and STRENGTH, and COURAGE, and PERSEVERANCE, and HUMANITY, and ETHICS, and SACRIFICE, etc., etc. The effect worked at first---as it's fun to project one's own desire to be a hero onto these folks---but when their perfection gets repeated fifty times it gets a little old. Also, the book is essentially an endlessly repeating series of impossible situations from which the main characters narrowly escape (from the not-so-clever Germans). This effect also worked at first, but loses its tension as the book goes on..."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"The Guns of Navarone by Alastair MacLean, in the Unabridged Audiobook version narrated by Steven Pacey, is a brilliant multi-voiced rendering of a gripping story of a WW II commando raid on an German gun.

I believe he had two reasons that summer for doing so; one was because he himself owned about 13 of MacLean's thrillers and he enjoyed them, and the other was because I had become quite obsessed that year with anything related to WWII.I ended up reading about 15 of MacLean's books over the next year, but my favorite remained The Guns of Navarone. I liked the characters, the terrain, and the fact that there was such limited time to turn the tides in the Allied troops' favor. I think the fact that the main characters had to go without sleep for a long period of time while still functioning in top form influenced me as well; I ended up working 11 years on night-shift as an RN and was constantly sleep-deprived despite the adrenaline that kept me alert. I often thought of \\"my mates\\" from the Guns of Navarone at 4AM as I sat charting at the Nurses Station with my endless cup of coffee!While I eventually got tired of this type of adventure story and moved on to other authors and books, I highly recommend this author and particularly this book for teens and young adults who enjoy action.

It is one of the best-written, most intricately plotted novels I know: action-packed from beginning to end, loaded with interesting, complex characters. It is the first novel I remember where I was conscious of the writing itself - the long, involved sentences, the better-than-average vocabulary - and years later, as a professional writer, I look back to this book as one which helped me understand just what good writing is. A superior book."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I just finished this book for a book report in my tenth grade English class. I loved every page of this book. The characters were very well built, and the plot was first rate. I think this is an excellent book for anyone who is willing to drop themself into a good story of the second world war."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"The book, Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean, is a good book with simple descriptions, interesting characters, and an exciting plot which holds you till the end. The characters are easy to relate to. The plot is riddled with crosses and double crosses which the author gives faint clues of throughout the story. The descriptions are brief but good and you imagine yourself there in the middle of the action. All in all, Guns of Navarone is a book I recommend reading."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I thought it was a good book because it had a intriguing plot.And you did not know what would happen next . I would highly recommend this book ."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"I thought that the 'Guns of Navarone' was ok. This is only the second MacLean book that I have read. But already I have to say that it is not the best Maclean book that I could recommend. In my opinion\` When Eight Bells Toll' was a more engrossing tale in that the plot constantly shifted directions. \`Navarone' on the other hand is very linear, from point A to point B without a deviation along the way.The characters in Navarone are not very well pieced together. If you take a good hard look at them, they are very generic. But this is besides the point because MacLean is writing a thriller, and one rarely ever sees the protagonist in more a superficial light in any thriller. After all this is not high literature but instead an escapist bit of fluff.So if we were to judge this book merely on the merits of the story, you will have to admit that it is very predictable in all ways except where the main characters just barely sneak out with their skins. Maybe this book is very dated and one can feel undercurrents of unintended humor sliding into the pages as our preconceived notions come to war with the idiotic blind luck the team has upon occasion."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Of all the war novels that I have read, this one seems the most implausible and yet realistic. The story involves an unusual team of men who are chosen to attempt a nearly impossible task, destroying the inaccessible but super-accurate German gun fortress on the island of Navarone. With the lives of thousands of men hanging in the balance, the team lives with constant hardship and the threat of a traitor in their midst. Mr. Maclean uses every nuance to make the reader stand beside the characters. When melting snow drips on someones face, you want to wipe it away. This book is well into the category \\"older novel\\", but a new publication would certainly be well recieved."},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","review":"Arrived in time...pages a little yellow, but that was to be expected! No problems..."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I loved that there were pictures for every recipe. A good book to have so I can make many of these recipes for my loved ones who lived there for a time and can enjoy this food once again."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"Recipes inconsistent with their website, which would be fine, if they worked. Completely different time/temperatures that lead to the food not being cooked anywhere near what it should be. The amount of ingredients are also different, but not proportionally so, leading to a completely different product than what you expect. Stay away from the cookbook, and just use their free website, because you'll actually get decent food instead of wasting your money."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I always wanted to have a Dominican cookbook in English, none were to be found. If you are proficient in Spanish you were lucky, but if your Spanish had got rusty after arriving in the States at an early age (like my eldest child), or your children couldn't follow simple directions in Spanish - let alone follow a recipe - (like my younger ones) well, sorry, no cookbook for you!And then, I came across this book. I have bad and good things to say about this book. Luckily mostly good or I would be US$49.99-short and a disappointed customer.The good news: The book is absolutely faithful to Dominican cookery. No made-up recipes like many other \\"Caribbean\\" cookbooks that promised authentic recipes and delivered none. The recipes are also very simple and don't call for fancy ingredients. The dishes that I have prepared taste exactly like the ones my \\"mami\\" prepared. Every recipe has a picture! That was the selling point for me. What point is there in a cookbook that doesn't show you how the dishes are supposed to look at the end? The pictures are fantastic. The book is filled with much more than just recipes and is seasoned with good humor, you can actually enjoy reading it.My complaints: How comes they had enough money to fill the book with photos but couldn't make it a hardback? This is the kind of book destined to become a family heirloom, it should be a hardback. I hope they make a hardback edition in the future. And second, although the authors give each recipe in its original Spanish name and also in English, I don't agree on how they translated some of the names (perhaps they did it into British English?). But the last one is a minor nitpick really."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I love Dominican comida (food). Whilst I can prepare a few dishes, my husband does most of the cooking. Every traditional Dominican recipe I can think of, I have found in this book. In my opinion, the authors couldn't have done a better job. The photos are beautiful, and throughout the book, there a wonderful stories for the reader's enjoyment. A traditional Dominican cookbook made in English has been long-awaited. I plan to pass one down as a treasured family heirloom to each of my children.Thanks for a wonderful idea that has finally come to fruition."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"When I saw the price of this book I figured I would get a nice hardback with tons of wonderful recipes...instead I received a cheaply printed paperback with no \\"wow\\" recipes in it. In fact, there are some recipes that call for certain ingredients which aren't even mentioned in the directions! I would suggest getting the other Dominican cookbook which is half the price and offers the same recipes, this one is not worth the money."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I too would have liked to see a hardback version of the book for the price. I like how the book has pictures of every dish. I'm just happy to see more cookbooks in english--and in measurements that are easy to follow."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I've only had the cookbook for about a week, but I have tried a few of the recipes and read through a few more. Overall, I really like it, even if it is a little pricey. The pictures and layout are great, and the recipes look really enticing.My only complaint is that I wish the directions were a little more clear; sometimes they are downright ambiguous. This is probably fine for someone who is more familiar with the food, especially if they have seen it prepared before, but for a gringo like me, I am often left questioning what I am supposed to do.One examples is the recipe for Pera Pina doesn't ever say how much water you are supposed to use, and although sugar is called for in the directions, it isn't listed in the ingredient list. Like I said, if you have made or have seen Pera Pina made before, this wouldn't phase you, but for someone like me, it made it hard to figure out what I was doing.I think the cookbook could benefit greatly from another editing and a run through in a test kitchen by cooks unfamiliar with Dominican cooking."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"The first day I got the book I cooked from it. They have amazing recipes. Everything I have cooked from that book has come out perfect. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I love this book, it doesn't get any better than this, I highly recommend it if you want to try a dominican recipe, there's no way going wrong with this book!!!"},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"My husband is Dominican and this cookbook has brought back many memories for him. It may not be easy finding all the ingredients, but the food sure is good!"},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I agree with the second reviewer. I also bought this book (4 of them actually) thinking I would get nice hardcover books; instead it is slim book with medium quality photos. I praise the effort to compile Dominican recipes in English, since there are few available. But the quality of the book does not justify the price at all."},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","review":"I recently purchased this cookbook and so far I'm very satisfied with it. All the recipes are easy to follow true Dominican recipes. The book itself is very entertaining and inspiring. I tried making \\"Pastelon de Berenjenas\\" or Eggplant Torte (which at first sight seems kinda weird if you've never made it before) but it was delicious. It tastes like the one my Mom used to make. I normally substitute regular salt for Goya season salt with pepper and add some Sofrito and Sazon here and there to make the recipe my own. If you know how to cook then you know exactly what I'm saying. It tastes great!Being Dominican myself I am very familiar with most if not all the recipes in this book. I wish the authors would have incorporated more meat recipes. I also would've liked to see the book on paperback but it's not a big deal. This book gets a 5 star regardless.Aunt's Clara Dominican Cookbook is well worth buying. I will definitely pass it on to my children. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Says Who?: A Pop Up Book of Animals Sounds","review":"This is a wonderful book for children just learning their animal sounds.

Its ok overall, but it differs from the Hobbit to much. Characters die that should'nt, plot twists occur that should'nt. In places it felt as though the author was trying to re-write the story. instead of concentrating on comedy, like a parody should, it seemed to take itself a bit too seriously."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"Swapping names like \\"Bilbo Baggins\\" for \\"Bingo 'Sac' Grabbings\\", you'd expect A.R.R.R. Roberts' 'The Soddit' to be an enjoyable romp and an entertaining parody of Tolkien's classic novel. Instead, the author settles for mediocrity and offers the reader very little in the way of humour. Saying this though, 'The Soddit' wasn't a terrible read, but it was a disappointing one.Loan it from your local library instead."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"The book is so terrible, I cannot believe someone can write such a gibberish. It looks like an author has never been told that his sense of humor is unacceptable. It reminds me of a hopeless guy who cannot master an art of telling a joke and make others laugh. Whenever he tells a joke, other people would smile and nod their heads politely, but never tell the joker how really bad he is. The book lacks everything. It is not funny, it is utterly boring and its so called humor is anything but something you would like to read for an entertainment. Avoid it at any cost."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"I had high hopes for this parody when I saw the cover with the line, \\"If we likess it, then we putss a ring on it\\". Unfortunately that is probably the best line in (on) the book.Oh, there are chuckle-worthy moments. But mostly it's rather lame. I get the feeling that the author really wasn't in the mood to really let loose with the silliness and was trying too hard to meet a contract deadline. And I agree with the other reviews that said he changed the storyline far too much for a good parody.\\"The Soddit\\" is not comparable to National Lampoon's 1969 \\"Bored of the Rings\\". Even though a lot of \\"Bored\\"'s references are dated, it's still pretty hysterical. I was hoping for that level of humor, updated to the 21st century."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"Being a fan of Bored of the Rings and Doon I decided to get this book. I really love a good parody. The book starts out pretty funny if a tad gross. Maybe that's just the English in the English humor. As you follow the characters it starts to change, becoming somewhat serious, which starts to draw away the humor. Drop by drop the book starts to develop a serious theme, a theme about trust and understanding.Now, how can you be a parody if you start changing the book into something meaningful and good? A parody can't have a serious bone in the whole body.That is why I had to take away a few points."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"This book is a parody of The Hobbit, incase you couldnt tell from the book's title. This book focuses on comedy rather than following along with Tolkien's original classic, there is a feeling that Tolkien provided the insparation for this novel but, the characters and the story arent like those in the Hobbit, which is the the norm for a parody. The humor, though a bit weak at times, was virtually non-stop. This was the only reason reason that this book earned five stars from me. The humor was the main reason I purchased this book, there were laughs and many puns. The characters were well developed and there were many details. This book is worth its money and it should be read with, not instead of, the Hobbit. The Hobbit gives you the background for the tale and you can distinguish between characters far more easily, but, nontheless, this is a very entertaining book, thats it. There isnt any true literary value other than the fact that it makes fun of a great book and will make you laugh yourself to sleep. Buy it, or at least, borrow it from your local &quot;hobbit-hole&quot; library."},{"Title":"Soddit","review":"Like every Soddit Bingo Grabbins enjoys a comfortable life and violently attacks anyone who dares to endanger this goal, as long as the opposition is much smaller than him, that is. Indeed Bingo can be a real pain in a dark cave, certainly when one treads on his extremely painful feet. So it is no wonder that when Gandef and his company of brainless Welsh dwarves force him to go on a long and tedious adventure that Bingo is far from happy and never misses an opportunity to make this very clear. And wouldn't one agree that he has reasons enough: wasn't it indeed Gandef who completely ruined Bingo's front door with a magical spell gone haywire? And by the way, the dwarves claim that they are on mission to find enormous amounts of free gold. Well, Bingo does not believe this to be the real purpose of their quest. They are probably out just to get in some real painful trouble and how Bingo pities his painful feet.Although The Soddit hints at being a parody of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, it basically only uses the characters of that masterpiece of fantasy and tells a completely different story. True, Gandef and Bingo do go on a quest (although no one knows what the real purpose is), but that is about where the similarities end. In a way not following the original story has been a good decision, because it gives the reader the enjoyment of not knowing what will happen next. On the other side it also reveals that the author while writing the story never really had an ending in mind and just went along to see what the story would turn out to be. But then again, this kind of book is made by its puns and jokes, and The Soddit is really packed full with them. Of course not all of them are as funny as they were intended, but on average it has enough successful ones to make this book an enjoyable and hilarious read."},{"Title":"Operation rhino","review":"An amazing true story of the brave men who live-capture and moved rhinos out of a poacher-infected area. The story is easy and fun to read and I really hated to put it down. The book gives the reader a wonderful insider look at the animals behavior &amp; habitat, as well as the hard work that goes into capturing these powerful and aggressive beast alive. Also an interesting look into the poaching techinques that are used."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Lakes Sierra;: A handbook for roadside and trail,","review":"Kills eggs as well as the critters.You can spray on bedding, carpets but I keep my dogs out for about 3-4 hrs. until it's dry."},{"Title":"The heroes of the Greeks (Myth and man)","review":"This book is packed with material to delight the serious student or enthusiast of Greek myth. Kerenyi had vast academic knowledge of the field and was also a key figure in the \\"psychological\\" approach to the Greek Gods in terms of archetypes (He worked and corresponded with Jung). In this and GODS OF THE GREEKS he seeks to lay out the basic raw material of the mythology as it's come down to us. The text may come across as dry or even obscure to some modern readers, but this is also its strength. In many other presentations of Greek myth it's often hard to tell where the original material ends and the scholarly interpolation begins (I'm looking at YOU, Robert Graves)... In sum, if you want an entertaining storyteller, Kerenyi might not be your guy (try Gustav Schwab maybe); but if you want to get close to the original mythology this and GODS OF THE GREEKS should be among your primary resources."},{"Title":"The heroes of the Greeks (Myth and man)","review":"This is a great story which help to understand about the Greek gods.

This one, \\"Great Women Masters\\" may be the best, since a large number of the artists here are not well known. Sure, there are Cassett, O'Keefe, and a few other very famous names, but perhaps the best descriptions and paintings are by pre-20th Century Artists,some from the 1500's,and especially some English Pre-Raphaelites. There are many,many color reproductions, descriptions of the lives of the artists, even very small color pictures at the book page corners, all which makes this a very special series, this being my favorite. Also, the size is rectangular and portable, not too heavy..All in all, just about perfect!"},{"Title":"Great Women Masters of Art (Great Masters of Art)","review":"Great Women Masters of Art (Great Masters of Art)This book is helping me so much with retention of necessary information regarding works of art by women for my Women and Art class.

The author here has selected a large number of woman artists both known and unknown to me with reasonable biographies, maybe 4 to 8 representative works, each reproduced with high-quality illustrations and these generally with reasonable texts concerning these works.Some might seek to add or subtract some artists, but I would contend that one is not likely to find any work that is superior to this one."},{"Title":"Great Women Masters of Art (Great Masters of Art)","review":"I originally read this book from the library.

It is quite technical, with a very detailed and mathematically-oriented exposition. More suitable for a classroom teaching or for a GIS software developer/expert analyst than for the average user. Contains great chapters on representation of spatial objects and concepts, and computational geometry algorithms.A must have for a GIS software developer or a GIS analyst trying to gain a deeper understanding of GIS database organization and optimal query algorithms. Too deep for beginners and occasional GIS users."},{"Title":"Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"Last summer, when I was asked to present an \\"Advanced GIS\\" course for some of grad students in Geomatics, I was fortunate enough to find this book on my first round of serach. It is a great book with deep technical explanation of the subject and its applications. It is more a type of textbook than a book can be used by general public. However, public users may still find some chapters informative. I recommend this book as a grad textbook for those who need technical undetrstanding of spatial databases in GIS."},{"Title":"Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"This textbook is an excellent resource for people specifically interested in the theoretical nuts and bolts of spatial databases. The book covers a lot of ground in just over 400 pages. It would be an excellent text for an advanced GIS programming course for either geography students or computer science students. For the geography student, the text provides an excellent coverage of database concepts while drawing on familiar topics. For the computer science student, the book extends basic knowledge of DBMS for spatial applications.The book is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter is completed with an excellent bibliographical review of relevant publications. This review, alone, is worth the price of the book.Chapter 1: Introduction to Spatial Database: Covers basic concepts of SQL, DBMS and spatial data.Chapter 2: Representation of Spatial Objects: This chapter should be familiar to anyone with a GIS background but would fill in the gaps for computer science students. The section on formats and standards is a bit dated but provides a nice theoretical background - especially for the Census TIGER data.Chapter 3: Logical Models and Query Languages: Opposite of Chapter 2, this chapter will challenge the Geography student while further grounding the Computer Science student in GIS data types.Chapter 4: The Constraint Data Model: Here the authors choose to introduce some unique material in the form of the constraint data model. The model is designed specifically to encode spatial data in a basic relational model. The chapter even breaks down the model into relational algebra statements. For most teaching purposes, this chapter can be skipped.Chapter 5: Computational Geometry: An odd gem in a text on spatial databases. This chapter provides a basic introduction to computation geometry techniques and their application to spatial data. One of the most significant aspects of a spatial databases is that it encodes geometric representations of geographic phenomena. Basic computational geometry is a necessary extension for a database to truly support spatial data. Pseudo-code is given but I would recommend the classicComputational Geometry in C (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science)for detailed implementations. This chapter will be challenging for Geography students but simple for Computer Science students.Chapter 6: Spatial Access Methods: The biggest challenge for spatial databases is spatial indexing - adding a true sense of \\"where\\" to SELECT...WHERE! The chapter focuses mostly on classical index structures - B-tree, R-Tree, etc. This would be a good chapter for a \\"short week\\" as it is either a research focus or matter of \\"it just works\\". Students who desire to research spatial indexing will find the chapter lacking. Others will find it overwhelming.Chapter 7: Query Processing: Like Chapter 6, this chapter delves into details that only a student truly interested in researching spatial indexes or developing new databases would be concerned with. The chapter presents how the spatial index is utilized for joins and relates.Chapter 8: Commercial Systems: Any book that attempts to survey existing software is always out of date. This chapter might be of historical interest but is hardly worth covering. The section of PostgreSQL is interesting but better material exists on the web.Overall, the book is well written and clearly presents the material. The coverage is focused on applications to spatial databases. My favorite advanced GIS textbook isGIS: A Computing Perspective, Second Edition."},{"Title":"Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"I have been in GIS and graphics research and development for more than 10 years. GIS is a area that is mixed with technical and management issues greatly; therefore, there is very few truly technical books that is focus on computing issues in GIS.I am really excited to see this book because it compiles tons of research materials into 1 place. My 2 boxes full of research papers can go into basement while I am having this book as the constant reference. The book got a very coherent presentation of the large scale data management issues with GIS. Thier description is very accessible. They have tried their best to minimize the amount of mathematics that could be involved.If you are a beginner, this is a definite starting point to learn about various techniques and issues about spatial data management and computing. I wish I have this book at the start of my career. Much of my headaches to run through all of those research papers can be eliminated.If you want to implement a spatial data management system, this book alone is not enough. You may need to add few other graphics books and database books to acquire enough background to do so.Well, you can only ask for so much coverage for a single book."},{"Title":"Voices Under One Sky: Contemporary Native Literature","review":"I thought this was a very enjoyable book.

The authors have drawn from their own life experiences and decades of professional involvement to produce a volume that should be required reading for every parent.Protecting Your Child sounds the alarm on an issue that should be alarming to every parent. The authors point out that there has been a 500% increase in rape over the 19-year period from 1980 to 1999, the decades during which the U. S. porn industry grew from a $4 billion annual business to a $10 billion dollar business. Worldwide, it is estimated that pornographers profit $56 billion a year.York and LaRue document countless law enforcement records that tie pornography to sex offenses. Other disturbing statistics add to the cause for concern. For example, the authors write, \\"A report in the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1993 noted that nearly half of the nation's child molesters were children. In addition, in 1983 there were only 22 juvenile sex offender programs nationwide; in 1993 that number had grown to 755. Today there are more than 1,200.\\"Readers should not overwhelmed by the barrage of statistics and tragic stories told in the opening pages. LaRue and York always provide an antidote including concrete steps for action.Both authors are honest and straightforward in sharing how they were themselves victims of pornography at a young age.\\"I am fighting pornography for the sake of our nation's children who are becoming the primary consumers of pornography,\\" says LaRue. The book documents how children are, indeed, being exposed to hard-core pornography at younger and younger ages.York was first exposed to pornography as an 11-year-old in 1955 when a local drugstore began carrying the brand new Playboy magazine. \\"Pornography was not widely accessible in those days,\\" he says, \\"or I might have become a seriously addicted child.\\" Today York is editorial director of Traditional Values Coalition.In Part 1, York and LaRue detail why pornography is a danger to families, then take a look at its pervasiveness. They illustrate how it has infiltrated even our homes, public schools and libraries largely via the Internet.Part 2 gives practical responses for the challenge to stop pornography from destroying our children and communities. The chapters on how to keep it out of your home, and how to help the child who has already been exposed to porn are invaluable resources for parents.Protecting Your Child may paint a scary picture of the present, but it also offers a vision of hope for the future."},{"Title":"Protecting Your Child in an X-rated World","review":"This is an excellant book to equip parents with up-to-date information on how to protect our children from pornography.

Pornography violates that, and parents need to know how pervasive pornography is: sex-ed materials in public schools, dial-a-porn, the Internet, magazines, comic books, videos. If children don't learn about good sex from their parents, they'll learn about bad sex somewhere else. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Protecting Your Child in an X-rated World","review":"York and LaRue's book presented interesting arguements of reasons to protect children in the so-called \\"X-Rated World\\". However, the book also shared opinions and social commentary with serious religious biases. It was difficult to concentrate on the topic when the authors often digress onto religious topics of which I do not agree. The authors address the issue of premarital sex and homosexuality with complete intolerance for those of alternative lifestyles. When they accused Planned Parenthood of \\"promoting traditional-values-free sex for teens\\" and of having a \\"radical agenda\\" I grew frustrated and abandoned the book. The authors, while presenting accurate information about the pervasiveness and danger of children accessing information via the Internet, they also presented their own \\"radical agenda\\"s with Christian biases and promoting wholly the intolerance of homosexuals."},{"Title":"Protecting Your Child in an X-rated World","review":"Jan LaRue is one of the most narrow-minded, accusatory, and ugly (I mean on the inside) women I've ever heard speak (or read) and you'd be better off following the guidance of someone who truly cares about your children, not just about her own narrow agenda."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"I received this book quickly and just as it had been described. I am very happy with everything."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"I have used Pasajes: Lengua and Pasajes: Cultura for two years now for Intermediate Spanish and have found it quite difficult to use and to appeal to the interest of the students. Tons of vocabulary words are presented at the beginning of each chapter in Pasajes: Lengua with some weird pictures and no follow-up dialogue to reinforce or recycle the vocabulary. Then quite a few difficult grammatical concepts are presented in each chapter and often mixed together into several confusing exercises which don't allow the student to sort out the usage of one concept before being bombarded with another one. I would use this approach if I purposely wanted to confuse and lose my students. Often the students are at a loss as to how to react to the exercises and instructions. Sometimes out of frustration, I have to simply change the instructions of the exercises or bring in my own exercises to supplement the text. I have noticed a decline in the proficiency of our students after using this text and a definite lack of interest in the material. After over twenty years of teaching, I am no newcomer to teaching languages and only continue to use the text because some faculty who are recent graduates have latched onto it. The bottom line for me is that in order to do a good job using this text, the instructor must basically rewrite the text and bring in a lot of original material to achieve the desired results with students. A class that used to be a lot of fun for me with wonderful interactions with my students, now is often drudgery."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"Before I bought the Pasajes series, I was relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews. However, I really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very, very misleading. I would not, in good faith, be able to recommend this series of books for learning Spanish.This series of books was VERY confusing and EXTREMELY difficult to work with. Some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish:1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a \\"new\\" english word for one) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them.2) Frequently, new words, phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else, via a footnote, with no further explaination provided!! This is SUPER frustrating and distracting!3) Using this series of books is very cumbersome, the books are not well coordinated with one another, and do not appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary.I'm very sorry, but these books are just terrible, and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books... Using this series of books has taken ALL the fun out of learning Spanish, which I used to enjoy. If you have the option to use different books, take it!"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"I finished up 2nd year college Spanish with this series and found the format a bit confusing. And using three books for one class is not very convenient. Although the vocabulary and language structures progress together in all three books, their format is not very conducive to learning unless you really enjoy just curling up with a good textbook and reading it over and over again. However, there are a couple of positive features. The lengua book has a section in every chapter called \\"Ojo!\\" which helps with commonly confused words and concepts. The Cultura book has a few interesting readings that introduced some history and political issues in Spanish-speaking countries that I didn't know about, but now want to found out more about."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"I've had my experiences with a wide variety of Spanish language learning materials, and out of the textbooks I've used, the Pasajes series (especially when used as a series, including the Literatura and Cultura components) ranks as the best. Pasajes strikes the perfect balance between a text for rank beginners and advanced students.It is abundantly clear to me that the authors of this wonderful work are acutely aware of the difficulties the student of Spanish -- especially intermediate Spanish -- is likely to face. As such, the text reads as more of a &quot;conversation&quot; between &quot;teacher&quot; and student, then a stern, authoratative text handing down the received wisdom to your unworthy soul. A real pleasure to work through.Although one is more likely to encounter this text as part of a college Spanish program, I would highly recommend it to any serious Spanish student intent on reaching a higher level of accomplishment."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"This book was confusing - Too much similiar information packed into the same chapter, very confusing for students....."},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"although not my favorite book I rate it as ok cause I would like to have seen them explain the words a little more so we can understand what some of the passages are saying; However I did learn alot about Spanish culture and I loved it!"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Literatura","review":"I was very happy with the quickness that this order was filled and shipped.

Jaik Rosenstein was one of these guys and, in the 1940s, he worked for one of Hollywood's biggest: Hedda Hopper of the L.A. Times (and later became a columnist himself for a movie rag called \\"Hollywood Close-Up.\\") Given that he was running around town doing all the leg work for one of the biggest columnists during Hollywood's golden era, I was kind of expecting/hoping for deeper dish behind-the-scenes gossip than Rosenstein provides in this memoir. It's interesting enough reading, but not likely to stake a claim on anyone's go-to list of must-read Hollywood books."},{"Title":"Seal Morning (Grey Arrow Books)","review":"I came across Seal Morning many years ago, even then I had it with me for a long time before I read it. I found it by fate, when I was going through old unused lockers in my old school. I didn't know why I kept it but after DEFINITELY more than 2 yrs then was I compelled to read it. It is a book that brought joy &amp; sadness all the same. It appeals to all of us who love animals. The way it was written without any chronological contraint, is refreshing. It comes across as an account, or maybe as a documentation but rarely is it anonymous as there're many poignant moments Rowena shares with us. Her animals were her friends &amp; she was theirs, &amp; in the solitude of the hills this couldn't be more true !!"},{"Title":"Seal Morning (Grey Arrow Books)","review":"I loved this book! It gives the reader a wonderful taste of the wilds of Scotland and of &quot;croft life.&quot; I like to imagine living like this. Though this book tends to jump around, that makes it more interesting. It is a perfect gift for the animal or nature lover: the descriptions of the landscape and Rowena's relationship with the animals she cares for are beautiful and touching."},{"Title":"Seal Morning (Grey Arrow Books)","review":"I loved the book. I read it many years ago and found I could order it. And I did. This is a story of moving back to nature,back to the earth. Rowena Farre and her Aunt Miriam moved from near London to a small croft located in Sutherland, Scotland. Their closest neighbor is nine miles away. The mail is delivered every two weeks. The only people the pair come into contact are an elderly, single man living by himself, an older couple, plus the mailman. But there are plenty of animals. The retired school teacher and the young girl loved animals. The birds loved Miriam since she was a small child. From her early childhood, birds flocked around her, recognizing her as a friend. Rowena was ten years old when she moved to Sutherland. She did her schoolwork at the croft, and seemed to do quite well. She was seventeen when she left. The winters in Sutherland are long and cold; during winter most of the day is dark. But summers are nice, but short. The pair live on what they can grow, can, preserve much like American pioneers. They made do. Every two weeks they went to the store for a large amount of groceries. They had two goats to provide milk, a pony to pull the little cart, two squirrels, a rat, two otters and Rowen's favorite, Lora, her seal, who was the best pet and friend Rowena would ever have. There were other animals who came to, then left the croft.Rowena begins studying animals, their likes and dislikes, their abilities. Lora is very musical. Miriam supported herself by painting and decorating wooden bowls and plates. The unadorned dishware was shipped in, Miriam painted and decorated them, and sent them south to be sold. Rowena's father, who lived in India, sent Miriam money for Rowena's support. In both cases, both could live on what they were given, but it seems a strange way to live, especially in an area that is treeless, bleak, cold, unihabited, dark. Both loved this lifestyle and stayed in Sutherland for seven years. In part of the book, Rowena takes a walking trip across the land. She carried meager provisions. But then, both lived on not much and different food.Limited diets, but healthy. Parafin lamps were not turned on until later in the long dark nights. During winter, the two stayed in bed until nine thirty, then went to bed at nine o'clock.There is a lake on the property, Rowena loves to row her boat, Lora and the otters love to swim. Rowena and Miriam would have picnics. Once in a long while people would visit the croft.During the winter, there is much winter, the birds would roost in bird houses provided by the pair. There is always food left for them. Miriam would take those that were sick from the cold and doctor them much like a veteranian.Rowena had a different childhood than most children. Interesting book."},{"Title":"Seal Morning (Grey Arrow Books)","review":"This is a wonderful read for anyone and at any age. Ms Farre is something of an obscure character now and it's true that some authorities have claimed parts of this autobiography are somewhat fanciful but this reviewer says 'so what?'

That is a wonderful edition, but this one is the first, 19th-century bowdlerized version, which in particular glosses over Pepys's entertaining sexeual escapades. A modern reader should wait for something better to come along."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"When I started reading the diary, I expected it to be extremely boring and very old fashioned (seeing how it was written in the 1600's) - how wrong I was!!!Samuel Pepys (pronounced 'peeps') is a human, funny, moody man who has his ups and downs like the rest of us. His narrative during the plague records his concern about neighbors, and his real sorrow when people he knows succumb to it. He also records his experiences during the great fire of London in 1666 and his first mention of it strikes me as entirely human - he says that his maids wake him as they have heard of the fire and as it is not near his doorstep he simply goes back to bed as he's tired. He has arguments with his wife, and has cast a lusty eye upon the kings mistress for years! He also has, what I call 'mini affairs' where he kisses and fondles women quite regularly, (including his own maids) and seems to have no guilt about this whatsoever. Most mornings he 'drinks' his breakfast and at one point is outraged that his new wig is teeming with nits! An historical and very human read. Makes me realise that after 450 years we are all no different at all........"},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"This book is said to be \\"The Diary of Samuel Pepys\\" and true it is...however it is only part 2 of a 10 part diary but you wouldnt know that unless you bought it and saw that the book starts with the end of a sentence from the previous volume. very sad."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"There are on the Amazon site two excellent, informative reviews of the Pepys' diaries. They say far more than my own contribution.I have read in and out of the Pepys' diary more than once. I did this in part because I have read many times that they are the ' best diaries' ever written. Without contending with that I found that they were not for me the most interesting. This probably shows more about my own shortcomings than it does about the work of Pepys.Pepys' work is filled with description of the life of the time. It is rich in perception of the great city of London in Restoration times. It is filled with personal anecdote, gossip including that relating to his prodigious sexual appetite and activity. It is a busy, businesslike work. And it tells more about a world outside than a world in.In the diaries I most love there is the quest of the soul to deeply understand itself and its relation to other people, and God. I find that the flurry of activity in the life of Pepys does not lead to this kind of reflectiveness. And thus for me the 'diary' is not a highly significant work personally."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"Reading Samuel Pepys diary is an extraordinary experience because it blends the intimate personal details of this very public man of the 17th century with some of the most dramatic moments in London history. Pepys moves back and forth in successive daily entries between recording his marital ups and downs , his personal struggles with temptations of the flesh and career successes and the tumultuous events that he witnessed first hand. His descriptions of the Plague of 1665 and the Great London fire of 1666 are unequaled. As an influential minister in the Royal Navy he had access to and was acquainted with much of the aristocracy in the England of his day and had direct knowledge and access to King Charles II during the restoration years. This edition of his diary is abridged and contains the years 1660 thru 1669. From the coronation and return to the monarchy through the Dutch-English war Pepys' perpective is enlightening and entertaining. I can't think of another book that I've read that places the reader in such intimate contact with a time and place so far removed. By the time you are finished with this you will have learned much and become acquainted with a pretty interesting and engaging character in Mr. Pepys. Highly recommended to anyone interested in this period and would enjoy an insiders view of restoration London."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"I ordered this diary because I am teaching history to undergraduates. When it arrived I was surprised that the edition had no publisher, no editor, did not contain the complete diary and had no explanation of why edits were made. The book is surprisingly large and formatted unprofessionally. I returned it to Amazon. I am certain there are better editions out there, and I would be embarrassed to have this one on my shelf."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"Ever since I found a circa 1950's diary in an old attic rummage sale on a vacation in Maine when I was about 8, I've been fascinated by old diaries. It also helps that I'm fascinated by history in general. So bring together great historical periods (ie the Great Fire of London) with diaries (and such honest ones as this are rare) and you have a classic. The language was a bit challenging at first - but like reading Shakespeare, if you just get used to it, it suddenly seems normal (reading it out loud also helped me get in the 17th century zone). It was interesting to see so much history witnessed by a normal person (albeit one of the upper class). His personal life was quite \\"colorful\\" too, which added some flavor to it, too. Definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"Very entertaining and enlightening. Pepys gives us a glimpse of what life was like in that period before the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" in England which was so important in the developement of democracy in England and the United States. Pepys was on the wrong side of that revolution - a loyalist to King Charles II, although he was never convicted of treason. Good thing, since there seemed to be a lot of beheadings, etc. in that era. Occasionally, it is not absolutely clear what Pepys is talking about, and sometimes the vocabulary is not easily understood,as language and customs have changed, but that is to be expected."},{"Title":"Diary of Samuel Pepys","review":"I purchased the audiobook read by Kenneth Branagh.

The only minor flaw that I found with this book was in the cake decorating chapter, where I felt that the measurements of how to cut the cake was not detailed enough. Other cake decorating books have a diagram of how to cut the cake according to inches. This book did not. However, I feel that this is still an excellent purchase.

I can't wait till it arrives!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Annie Hayes' view of Italy is far from the dappled, sensuous quality that has defined that &quot;other&quot; book about newcomers (and subsequent converts) to the beauty of Italy. Mayes' books excel in recalling the fabulous foods, landscapes, neighbors and gossamer days of Tuscany. Extra Virgin does that, too, but here's the difference -- Hayes' book goes deeper. She and her sister make mistakes. A lot of them. They don't instantly assimilate. The farmlands of Liguria are a far cry from the rolling and tourist-friendly hills of Tuscany, and the townsfolk, puzzled by these seemingly naive English girls, give them hard-knock lessons on the road to becoming honorary Italians. Whereas the Mayes series focus on the earthly pleasures of Italy, Extra Virgin is about character -- from the social protocol amid the local gentry at the village coffee shop to the laughs the sisters endure when they take another helping of antipasti or primi (shame on them!) Here is an outsider's honest, non-academic attempt to dissect the prejudices between Northern &amp; Southern Italians -- to probe their grudges and prejudices -- and maybe even bend the rules a little (never too much!) Yet the reader never gets the sense that the Italians aren't warm to the author -- on the contrary, despite the occasional playful ridicule they are portrayed as kind, generous, resourceful, rugged, and hardworking. Hayes conveys the idea that Italy and Italian culture can be as foreign and oftentimes preposterous as our own culture appears to us. I'm half Italian and found this book very valuable in showing me the character of my forefathers (and my Italian-American mother!) It also serves as a terrific and necessary guidebook cloaked in a travelogue -- it has the fantasy aspect of moving to Italy, but it's done with a heaping dose of reality. I would recommend Extra Virgin to anyone intending to visit Italy -- to grasp what it means to be fully immersed in things Italian. Haye's recipe? Go with a healthy dose of respect, a lot of humor and keep on hand the odd dash of scepticism wherever necessary. That's Italian!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Don't let the soppy title fool you - Extra Virgin is an excellent memoir of the author's life in small-town Italy. Annie Hawes has created a down-to-earth (and back-to-the-earth) book that, in addition to an excellent description of life in Liguria, gives a close up look at topics we can all relate to: learning to maintain and improve that first house, fitting in to a new place, adjusting to new customs.Probably the main strength of the book, though, is Hawes' portrait of her adopted home town and its changes through the years. She has lived at least half the year in Diano San Pietro for 20 years; she's become at least as Ligurian as English, while her town has become more modern and continental - but only a bit. Reading about Hawes' transformation, I learned along with her - about the excellent reasons behind some of the strange peasant beliefs, about the culture and society of rural Northern Italy, and about the everyday life of a small Italian town.In the background are other stories, equally involving: the small gossips, scandals, and events of 20 years in one place. One of Hawes' virtues is to make her neighbors and friends seem real, with real-person traits and flaws, rather than merely colorful characters, especially as time progresses within the book.The book itself is a pleasant, fun read. Hawes writes with a lot of gentle and mostly self-directed humor, and her style is breezy and light. It's easy to identify with her, also, both because of the style and because of the life she describes; I felt less a spectator and more a sympathizer in her struggles and delights.All in all, Extra Virgin is one of the most enjoyable and knowledgeable living-in-Italy books I've read to date, and it lacks the self-conscious, overblown prose stylings that have rendered some similar books less engaging. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Italy or travel; it's a book worth reading and owning."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Readers might miss this book solely because of its silly title. \\"Extra Virgin\\" has really nothing to do with the story except that olive oil is made in the region. And that ridiculous subtitle--\\"A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted\\"--suggests the kind of soft-centered, caramel-dipped, high-fructose prose found in Harlequin Romances...This is not a gooey romance written by a birdbrain but a consistently engaging tale of a young Brit and her sister who take seasonal work harvesting olives in a little-known peasant village in a lesser-known region of Italy--and end up buying a houdse there.The opening drags a bit. The author struggles with her pose as the bright young thing taking the traditional Brit's view of benighted foreign peasantry. Too pert by half, frankly. But what makes this book work is that the author observes closely, learns, and grows--grows up, too.She began by thinking of her neighbors as jolly but backward folk who just love to feed people--and keep on feeding them. So typically Italian! Well, she gets over this; she begins to understand that these people actually know a thing or two and even know things she doesn't. As a result her prose calms down and her story moves along pretty briskly. There's humor and passion as she and her neighbors come to terms with each other--and as she increasingly becomes not merely a summer visitor but a person who comes to have some standing as a genuine member of her community.The change occurs gradually through innumerable small steps (steps too small to mean much if taken out of context in a review) and one large event that can't be discussed because it would give away far too much. Look at it this way: We've had the sugary stuff of \\"Enchanted April\\" and the cold and cynical exploitation of \\"A Year in Provence.\\" Annie Hawes's story is different; it might even be what would happen to you or me."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Over the course of the past couple of years several of my friends have moved to Italy. One is an expat returning to Italy and the other is an american transplant.Annie Hawes story of her time in Liguria is probably one of the most &quot;real&quot; expats in Italy stories I have ever read. She isn't rich and doesn't have 1/2 a million to pour into creating a showpiece. She buys a ramshackle farm house and to this day its still pretty ramshackle (course if this book hits the best seller list who knows?).Anne Hawes is living my dream. She writes of her day to day experiences. Some of the same things that she experiences have happened to my friends. I feel like she is doing just what I would do. I'd go exploring broken down houses. If somebody offered me a smoking deal I'd probably buy it and then try to work out how to live there at least part of the year.Anne Hawes writes with affection and consideration for her friends and neighbors. Her Italy life and her Italy house are built on this foundation of respect and affection. I only hope that when my &quot;Italy life&quot; happens it is half as full as Anne's."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"If you're a fan of Peter Mayle, Frances Mayes, and Chris Stewart, add Annie Hawes to your reading list. At first skeptical about the subject (&quot;Not ANOTHER book about moving abroad and fixing up an old house in the country!&quot;), I was immediately enchanted by Hawes's take on it. Her style is closer to Mayle than Mayes, mostly because of her wonderful British wit and turning of a phrase, so Italy is described in a different way; and her rendering of the rural landscape and its inhabitants match Stewart's in detail and affection. Even if you've read a lot of books on Italy and expats living in sunny Mediterranean climes, crack &quot;Extra Virgin&quot;. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is NOT your typical story about foreigners buying a house and restoring it. Unlike Frances Mayes, who seems to only visit during the summer, these two plucky girls actually live in the rustico all year round, living like a peasant and learning their ways. It almost seems like an anthropological survey.Hawe's writing is witty and sharp, and spares nothing in the minutiae of their daily life. This is a refreshing change from the typical fare from the genre where everything is bathed in some orange glow, everything is perfect, ripe and bursting with life. Hawes will have none of this shilly-shally, and throws in broken marriages, drugs, Aids and even death, amongst the endless feasting, olive oil, sunshine and beaches. Hawes also writes with surprisingly little emotion, letting little of her own feelings into the book, (unlike the rollercoaster account of Carol Drinkwater in the Olive Farm)However, some little things, like her excessive use of Capital Letters, and sarcasm gets under your skin.On the whole, a real-life, satisfying and wholesome read, just like the peasants in the book."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I bought it on a whim, and I can't think of the last time I've been so entertained. I've laughed out loud at numerous points. I'm recommending it all over the place, but am unwilling to lend out my copy as I intend to read it again."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"What an enjoyable book -- warm and not too condescending as can be Peter Mayle and others who write this genre.Initially off to a slow start, I felt, once I was a chapter or two into it I was hooked, and toward the end I didn't want it to end. Now I'm off to the UK version of amazon (amazon.co.uk) to buy the followup by Annie Hawes called Ripe for the Picking, which apparently hasn't been published in the U.S. just yet.FOLLOWUP: I've now read the sequel, Ripe for the Picking, and I'm happy to report the writing and good humor just gets better and better. Of all the books in this genre of \\"travel memoir\\" that I've read, I believe I've enjoyed Extra Virgin and Ripe for the Picking the most. Great humor, an affectionate look at the locals, and a healthy dose of wish fulfillment for us all. Under the Tuscan Sun has nothing on this. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I stumbled across Extra Virgin 3 years ago. I have now bought at least 9 copies and given away 8 as well as recommending it to all and sundry. And sent away to the UK for the sequel.Ms. Hawes pulls up the timeless Italy that has - and probably will - outlast all change and fads and fashion. My parents spent their early married years stationed on the other coast of Italy, yet when my mother read Extra Virgin, she said she laughed to the point of tears, because it brought back so many memories - right down to Ms. Hawes' dissertation on the various methods of tying a hankie into a headcovering.But, most importantly, she also avoids the standard \\"aren't the peasants so quaint\\" mode - the book is much more about discovering how much smarter those peasant ways are than breakneck modern city life, tasteless tomatoes and rushed meals.Anyone who can read this and NOT have at least one fantasy about living in an old stone house 2 kilometers along the mule track just past the third hairpin bend - well, they have no adventure, no romance, no idealism in their soul."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"If ever you've dreamed of establishing residence in a foreign country, but have never had the nerve to actually do it, then EXTRA VIRGIN is a delightful escape for you, the armchair expatriate.In 1983, Annie Hawes and her sister Lucy, two young, single English lasses, accept employment as rose grafters on the Italian Riviera in the small town of Diano San Pietro. The fact that the author, Annie, knew nothing about rose grafting possibly reflects youth's eternal optimism. In any case, the rose season over, the two sisters are gently maneuvered by a crafty local into purchasing a derelict farmhouse amidst the olive groves above the town.The book spans at least a decade's worth of memories, and it's not always clear when in that timespan a particular incident occurred. However, it doesn't matter. One of the delights of EXTRA VIRGIN is the personality of Annie. She comes across as a genuinely Nice Person, and with that dry British wit that I personally find so engaging. The reader is invited into her life as she and Lucy labor to refurbish their new home and tidy up - an understatement - their neglected garden and terraced olive groves. And, all the while, coping with the eccentricities, prejudices and habits of their Ligurian neighbors, and vice versa, as the two cultures meet and meld. By the end of the book, Annie and Lucy have successfully become an accepted part of their adopted community.The book may drag a little in the last couple of chapters. Beforehand, however, we learn from Annie how olives are harvested and olive oil produced, as well as how local wine is made and mushrooms gathered. (The Italian love of food, in gargantuan quantities, is well portrayed.) And let's not forget the tales of the abandoned Morris, the matchless benefits of powdered lime, the water tank, and, during the tidying-up of the garden, ...the Snake:\\"This horrible thing appeared to me as I was sitting under the lemon tree ... gazing focused and abstracted at the foliage below me moving gently in the sea breeze... One tall stalk that seemed oddly out of rhythm with the rest gradually drew my attention... Some sinister kind of long skinny snake was sitting among the tall grass, waving its top half around, cunningly camouflaged as a bit of plant life and hoping, I suppose, to catch some unwary plump insect... not just a concealed snake, but an actively duplicitous snake. We didn't need any of that sort of behavior so close to home... We set off a-sickling with renewed vim and mild hysteria, stamping about heavily to scare off serpent life as we went.\\"I wish I could meet Annie. I think I'm a little in love with her."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This story excels in telling about two young women and their encounters of people, culture, and adventures in the Italian Riveria. The reader travels along w Annie on an innocent, enchanting adventure. I would like to read another novel in this same genre and style, but this story is inntriguing and unique in its approach. Excellent work! Thank you for the vicarious vacation!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I liked this book , though I craved more intimate thoughts and and experiences about these two young women. The Author hints vaguely about men and partying. The story of all the people in her village and their moral's , value's and everyday life was wonderful. I just wish I could have to know more about Annie Hawes."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I enjoyed this book but found that it got bogged down at times; hence, the four stars rather than five. The author captured the essence of country/rural Italians, aka \\"peasants.\\" And the descriptions of the wonderful meals reinforce the Italian notion, and here I will translate, \\"at the table one grows old.\\"When reading the book, if you've ever been to Italy or have lived with an Italian family in the U.S., both of which I have experienced, you can almost hear the loud voices of everyone talking at once to get a point across. That's one essence of being Italian, imo. The book is really an enjoyable read but needed tighter editing."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"My family is actually from a small village in Liguria - not Diano San Pietro, but pretty close - and this memoir made me feel right at home again! Granted, when this story began in 1983, I was a mere 2 years old, and comfortably living in the United States, but snippets of her book rang amazingly true and brought me back to my youth and of visiting my family who still lives there! Hawes' account is so accurate that I found myself laughing out loud and relating to the ridiculousness of some of the old wives' tales that she encountered as I've also experienced them first hand myself.\\"Euh!\\" which is a phrase often used in this text is something that you will still hear repeatedly in this region of Italy. More often than not, it is more like a \\"Euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!\\" but none the less, I was hysterical with laughter with each use of it in the story. Her descriptions of the meals are also spot-on accurate. Even when visiting now, I have to prepare myself for the numerous courses you are expected to ingest at each meal. I also remember specifically being warned of the \\"colpo d'aria\\" by an old lady while riding in a compartment train in insane heat in July one summer. At the time, there was no air conditioning on the train and since we were all sweaty, I was yelled at for trying to open the window to circulate the air, and told I would for sure catch pneumonia - much in the same way the author was told that was bound to happen if you went swimming in the sea outside the months of July and August. But I must say the part that had me laughing the most was the section on the panettone. I've never cared for panettone, yet every time I visit, my family feels to need to purchase numerous panettone in those huge boxes. It's sort of like the dreaded fruit-cake that just seems to get re-gifted every Christmas back at home in the U.S.This memoir was beautifully and accurately written. The author really nailed the culture of this region in Italy - a gorgeous region on the Italian Riviera that for one reason or another, never gets as much hype as the hills of Tuscany - despite it's rich culture. If you want to read an honest, true account of living in a small farming village in Italy, THIS book is perfect."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. The writing is clever and fast paced, making it easy to read. Hawes has a sharp wit that caused me to laugh out loud on more than one occasion. A great read for those who enjoy a less poetic (i.e., Frances Mayes) look at life in rural Italy."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This book made my mouth water for our next trip to Italy. Liguria is an area we haven't explored much but Hawes' descriptive and loving narrative made me feel like I'll be returning home. Not only was the imagery delightful, but she explained much of the social and gender customs which are often puzzling among Italians. Tales of the rehabbing of a rustico which she and her sister turned into a year round home also delved into traditional techniques for dealing with clearing wells, whitewashing walls, cooking outdoors, and the real true way of making homemade wine. The book moves a little slowly at times, but then, it's Italy! I highly recommend this book for anyone who has been or will be visiting Italy. I wish I had read it before my first trip; it took me several to figure out when was the proper time to order espresso!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is a delightful tale of time spent in place and time near but far away from the stilish and popular Cotta Azura. I know this area well from time spent rebuilding the Italian Steel Industry in Cornigliano under the Marshall Plan. The author has a keen eye and ear for detail."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I have read a number of Italy travelogues, from folks who are just traveling through to expats and those who choose to live there part time. The most enjoyable aspect of this book is that the author choses to focus on the people who live there. Most of the other books on this topic that I've read are rather ego-centric and reveal more on the topic of their authors than on the country or its people. But this book is centered on the stories of the Italians whose community she has joined and whose customs and conventions she is learning. Her delightfully dry wit and British sense of humor are a plus."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Wonderful book for anyone who loves Italy, Italian culture, Italian cuisine and Italians! Complimenti a Annie Hawes!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"A real gem, interestingly written. I cannot wait to read the sequel, \\"Ripe For The Picking,\\" unfortunately not on amazon in the US but from amazon.uk!I'll be ordering three or four additional copies of \\"Extra Virgin\\" to fill stockings this Christmas. Terrific little book, very highly recommended. You will want to up and move to the village she describes no more than 100 pages into the book."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a casual acquaintance and, despite the book's slow start, I'm glad I hung in there and gave it a chance.The beginning of the book shows Annie Hawes and her sister being swept along by the customs of daily Ligurian life. They bumble around amiably, and before long, they find themselves buying a broken-down house.The book starts to get interesting once the women are settled in the house and begin to cultivate relationships with the townspeople, Ligurian peasants who are charming and maddening by turns. Much is made of farming and food -- particularly the growing of olives and the process by which olive oil is made.The sisters' house is up a treacherous pathway, and we're told stories of years' worth of struggle to find a decent car, build a staircase connecting the floors of the house, hook up running water. These stories are told not with &quot;money pit&quot;-like out-and-out humor, but with a lightheartedness and a unique respect for preserving the rustic condition and context of the sisters' home.Even after the women have been living in Liguria for years, they are still regarded somewhat as _stranieri_, strangers, foreigners with odd ways. Yet they are trusted enough to be welcomed into homes all over the village. They learn the ways of the &quot;hanky-headed&quot; olive-farming men and get used to being mourned over for not having any husbands to work in the fields for them.The book takes place over a long period of time and, in that expanse, we see the Ligurian village go from a backwater to a flourishing center of olive oil production. We see Italian politics change, though not easily. We see the womens' friends grow old, move on, pass away.The dry English humor (I loved the Capital Letters that another reviewer found annoying) and heartfelt storytelling made me feel as though I had been welcomed into the village."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is a fantastic book. Anyone who has ever lived in Italy will love Hawes honest rendering of Italian life and all of its complexities. Having lived in Rome for several years myself, I was overjoyed to finally find a book that portrays Italian life as it really is."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"It's difficult to stand out in such a crowded milieu, that of the British expat finding paradise in a foreign land and writing a book about it. This book is head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd. Annie Hawes is at the same time self-deprecating, respectful and most of all insightful. The descriptions of the food are mouthwatering, and the characters and anecdotes both funny and moving."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I bought this book after a quick trip through the book store while on a vacation that needed a book. I was so excited to discover how much I loved this book! Not only was the story fun and exciting (&amp; true), but I learned so much about the customs in italy and a lot about food. More than once I jumped off the couch and ran to the garden to gather basil and tomatoes. This book has been back and forth across the country more than once and deserves a second read."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is a book that I savored, like fine chocolate, and insteadof my typical immersion and finish, I read this one littleby little, because I didn't want it to end.If you are at all interested in Italians, living with Italians,or just Italy in general, this book will captivate you.After spending 3 weeks in Italy with my husband, it was hardto resist reading anecdote after anecdote aloud to my husband,or just giggling again and again while reading it.Great fun read..!Does she get married to Ciccio???"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I think my title says it all: this book is tons better than that book about the lady who restores some pile of rubble in Tuscany.Unlike that book, Ms. Hawes spends a bit less time sharing some mis-placed sense of entitlement and a bit more time examing the cultural differences which make integration into a new culture so difficult and eye-opening. I am amazed at her ability to get to know these people who are so different from her and her ability to depict their differences with out putting the Ligurians down or making fun of their culture. I found it ended too soon. And having read it just as I was heading to Liguria for vacation made it even better. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I was lucky enough to pick up this book before setting off for two weeks in Liguria. Not only was I entertained by Extra Virgin, but the unfolding of her characters and their history was an wonderful way of learning about the food, culture and sense of community around us. We resisted the temptation to go looking for San Pietro village but understood more of what was happening in the village we were in. A fabulous, funny and realistic read. Fortunately the edition we bought didn't have that terrible subtitle!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Many excellent reviews have been written for this book and quite frankly I can add little more. But I cannot resist writing a few words after reading and tremendously enjoying this rather charming memoir.The author chronicled her somewhat adventurous settling in the Italian Riviera through (almost impulsively) buying a very old farmhouse - with a few dozen olive trees to go with it, and struggling to make it a home, and herself and her sister part of the community. San Pietro was not exactly known for being hospitable to outsiders, how did this pair of foreign females (extra virgins) manage to get accepted as part of the community - in fact, practically as everyone's darlings? Well, they were friendly, respectful, open-minded, conscientious, and armed with a tremendous sense of humor.Besides learning a good deal about the life style and food fares of the Northern Italian peasantry, the landscape and climate of the place, and the folklores and sentiment of the locals - all through a gracious style of writing, with wit and humor in good measure, I must say I also learn from the author much wisdom for getting to know and live with strangers in a strange place.If you have not read this book, you should not wait any longer."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"It was a true pleasure to read Hawes, &quot;Extra Virgin.&quot; She is capable of clearly describing people of Italian heritage and their ways, which I found surprising not being of Italian descent herself. I felt as though I was in Liguria, her accounts so detailed and clear. A true work of art. A must-read story for those who enjoy creative non-fiction."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"On a wet, cold, typically gloomy day in England in 1983, Annie Hawes (broke and out of work) and her sister Lucy (bored and lusting for adventure) decide that enough is enough. Clutching a job description offering ten weeks work grafting roses on the Italian Riviera, room and board included, Lucy assures Annie that they can lie their way into the job and fake their way through it. Off they go to San Pietro, Liguria, quaint, sun-kissed village on the Mediterranean to live among the hankie-heads (men's knotted at the corners, women's tied at the nape of the neck). Although the sky and sea are blue and beautiful, the hoped-for handsome, tanned young men and wild night life of the Riviera are non-existent. It seems that their village is undiscovered by tourists, and the inhabitants have very strict ideas about proper behavior for young women and the correct way to do just about everything--\\"Never drink cappuccino after twelve noon. Italian is only spoken by policemen and tax collectors. Women do not speak to men in a bar, even if they are close friends. Swimming in the ocean before July will make you ill--no matter how hot it is.\\"Unexpectedly, Annie and Lucy fall in love with the little town and all its peculiar, lovable inhabitants. They even find a delerict old farmhouse on a lovely hillside overlooking the ocean--a real fixer-upper with no toilet or running water. They could buy it for a couple of thousand dollars, but they have no permanent job or savings. How they manage to make a home for themselves in San Pietro is a delightful tale, full of laughter, local color, and amazing information about olive trees. And in case you are so enchanted that you think perhaps you will just move there yourself, the last chapter is a helpful recent update on San Pietro.A wonderful book written by a woman who turned her fantasy into reality with humor, determination, and a few bald-faced lies.by Carolyn Blankenshipfor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This book was so boring!

I've given the book as a gift to my mother and various friends, and everyone unanimously loved it."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is a delightful book. Ms. Hawes does a terrific job of bringing the reader into her experience of living in the rural Italian culture as a non-Italian--the confusion, the complications, the hard work, the education and the fun. The characters of her life are not romanticized, but portrayed with both honesty and affection adding an authentic feel often missing in memoirs such as these. Her sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek view of many situations are laugh out loud funny and enhance the pleasure of the read. The cultural misunderstandings between the Italian way and the English way are finely drawn and leave the reader feeling that differences are not only okay, but happy coexistence is all the more interesting because of them.I loved this book and highly recommend it to others who enjoy Italy and maybe don't have the opportunity to get off the beaten track and really absorb it as they would like. Worth a first read, and a second, too."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I have read a whole slew of books on living in northern Italy. I have enjoyed them all (well, all except for A Summer in Tuscany by Sandra Swanson). This one is a bit different from the rest, and not for a single reason or two. First off, the book is based on the Riviera, not in Tuscany. Second, it starts with a story of how they are working in Italy for a season, but then becomes a story of living there. Third, there is a more complex attitude toward Italy revealed here by the writer, not a blind love, not cynicism, but a realistic combination of those approaches, and one that I think changes slightly over the course of the book. Fourth, a single woman living with her sister seems to lead to different experiences and therefore make the book a bit different from the others about couples. The authors have some opportunities to interact with the locals but are also given a bit wider berth as might be the case with bringing a single person to a party consisting entirely of married couples. Either because of or in spite of these differences the book succeeds. It was a much slower read than the other were, but also very enjoyable. I recommend it, though the ending does seems a bit rushed and compressed."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I have yet to read a book that hit home like this book did. Being married to an Italian for 16 years and visiting in-laws 8 times, I related to this book as if I wrote myself. It was delightful, funny, truthful, in such a loving way to the wonderful people of Italy. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has ever visited Italy, has Italian relatives or good friends. If you've been there, it's a wonderful connective experience, if you have relatives, it's a wonderful explanation for why things are as they are. I love this book and have recommended it to every Italian and non-Italian I know. Great Job, Annie!"},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"This is the most interesting story I have seen in a long time. The experiences of these two young women adjusting to life in the hills of Italy are written in a very entertaining way which keeps your interest.

Hawes' writing style is incredibly enjoyable to read, full of the detailed and lively descriptions you'd expect. She does not romanticize with sugary sweet language as many other authors do. Instead, this book goes beyond the typical travel essay in a number of ways, not the least of which is Hawes' dry sense of humor that made me laugh aloud dozens of times."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"Seeking a change of scenery, author Annie Hawes and her sister travel from London to rural Liguria, Italy, for a temporary job grafting roses. What the author lacks in knowledge of roses she more than makes up for with storytelling skills as she describes how she and her sister began their 20-year relationship with Liguria and its inhabitants. She conveys the mutual bemusement between the tradition-bound villagers and the naive British interlopers, and shows how she learned the hard way to respect their traditions while earning a measure of acceptance herself. Hawes' keen observations, wry sense of humor, and distinctive turn of phrase place this book a cut above the usual travel memoir."},{"Title":"Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted","review":"I enjoyed this book written about their living experience on the Italian Riveria. I loved reading about the &quot;hanky-head&quot; characters of this town. I could almost taste the food they ate when they described it. This book also explained a lot to me about the way Italians eat. I visited Italy [Rome, Florence] in 2001 and could not understand whey the waiter gave me a strange look when I asked for more cream/milk for my American coffee after I had just finished eating dinner. Now I understand about the digestio system here. If I ever go back to Italy, I will be sure to get an espresso instead after dinner. I wish I could visit a small down like the one the sisters live in and experience the olive harvest. There were so many episodes in this book that were so funny and some that were very serious.

The Lord does not want His children to be covetous. Nor does He want them to be lacking for those things they need and want for their lives and for His work. \\"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.\\"The children of the king are not beggars. But there is one who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. Over the enemy the Lord has already provided victory - triumph! Hagin declares war on the enemy of our souls, our families, and our God. So do we as believers and make a claim of faith in the goodness, graciousness, and mercy of our God.All of heaven and the riches in Christ Jesus are at the disposal of the believer. What a change this knowledge will make in the lives of the faithful!Hagin is not indulging in some private interpretation but is illuminating the Word of God in truth and in power for all who would believe."},{"Title":"How God Taught Me About Prosperity","review":"Thank God for this Prophet's insights and understanding concerning God's will to prosper his people.

I had not told anyone at church what we were praying for. On the internet I had seen a beautiful red Cadillac that was customized with a white coach top, but sadly it was not for sale. I prayed that July night, \\"Oh God, if I could ever find a car like that, I'd surely buy it!\\" On Sept. 3, 2009, our pastor's wife led the ladies prayer group and she walked us through these 4 steps in Kenneth Hagin's minibook, How God Taught Me About Prosperity. We ladies didn't share with each other what each had specifically spoken out and believed for.11 days later my \\"dream car\\" shows up on my husband's ebay page. He asked me if I'd like this car. I was astounded that there was even another car like the one that was still not for sale, just a show car. I jumped at the chance.

Kenneth Hagin, as usual, writes clearly and accurately to establish the truth and dispell the falsehoods.\\"Prosperity\\" in scriptural terms is not just about finances - although certainly finances is a part of prosperity - but being blessed means to prosper in all things. Blessed means to be empowered to prosper. That includes prospering in your personal life and family life as well as in your profession. The \\"prosperity gospel\\" is not materialism under a spiritual cover. Not at all.If you have any questions about this area of Christianity, read this excellent book.

However, it does cover some very important fundamental truths. In it, Hagin clearly states from scripture that Jesus is not the bad guy holding back money from ministries in &quot;prospering&quot; from the work that God has called them to do, its the Devil. We know from scripture that the Devil is the one who is the thief, but we some still have the thinking that Jesus robbed us. The book denies the unbiblical theology that the devil is in &quot;gloryland&quot;, and that our riches in Jesus are not withheld here on this earth, as so many claim Jesus as the thief. No, this book shows us what we must do, to receive what the devil has stolen; not &quot;Jesus the thief&quot;. This book is a good intro into coming out of the anti-bible theology that God hates us so much, that he doesn't want us prospering, to the Biblical truth that it is the Devil that is robbing us."},{"Title":"How God Taught Me About Prosperity","review":"This is a tremendous mini-book with great revelation that the Lord gave Kenneth E.

Her story is charming to read and yes, perhaps unrealistic. But that is its secret.

You will hear and feel and smell the Limberlost and its secrets."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I have just finished reading the 75 reviews that precede mine and am amazed to hear the excessive praise--almost adulation--for this book. I do understand why rediscovering a book that meant so much to one as a child can be an emotional coming-home experience. That may account for some of the passion undergirding many of the reviews. I am 64, love \\"old-fashioned\\" books, admire greatly the writing of Montgomery (Anne of Green Gables) and Wilder (Little House on the Prairie), and am tired of gratuitous sex and violence in much contemporary fiction. Yet, having said that, I fail to see how Girl of the Limberlost meets the same standard of other period/regional literature about admirable young heroines. It is true that some aspects of characterization were good (especially of the mother, Katherine Comstock) and details of the setting memorable (especially of the description of the Limberlost swamp), but the disjointed plot was a core weakness I couldn't get beyond. Characters fade in and fade out, and scenes switch abruptly with little or no transition. In fact, the book seems to have two distinct \\"halves\\" that are only loosely connected. Rather than \\"sweet,\\" I would describe the book as \\"saccharine\\"; rather than \\"simple,\\" I'd say \\"simplistic.\\"I found the book interesting in the same way that I do old 1930's silent movies. Both have the kind of charm and innocence that allows us to step into another time and place. But just as I smile when I see that an old \\"movie classic\\" has \\"four stars\\"--probably only out of reverence for its age, I can only commend Girl of the Limberlost as a snapshot of a bygone era, and a relatively poor snapshot at that."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I ADORE the book (which gets five stars, in my opinion!), but the editing of the free Kindle edition was absolutely horrible. Someone (likely the \\"volunteer\\") must have simply scanned the book, \\"read\\" it with very poor text recognition software, and then formatted it for Kindle with absolutely no edits. Many of the words are positively unintelligible because of the way the software \\"read\\" them and it seems that entire sections are left out. The paragraph formatting is awful, when present at all, ditto the dialogue quotation marks, even punctuation. And the chapter titles, presumably at the head of each page in the hard copy book, show up in the middle of the text in the Kindle edition.This is one of the most poorly transcribed Kindle editions I've ever seen, and I've seen a great plenty. Thankfully, I already knew the book when I \\"purchased\\" the free Kindle edition, so I got through it, but it would be intensely annoying to anyone who'd never read it before.I hope another volunteer or Amazon fixes the Kindle edition. It's just so awful. Thank goodness it was free or I would feel I had totally wasted my money, however small the amount. Moral of the story?

Her aunt and uncle give her the love, attention, and encouragement to continue when her mother attempts to thwart her every step of the way. There are many others who help Elnora - the school principle and the Bird Lady to mention a couple. She, in turn, helps many along the way who return the \\"favor\\" when she needs it most.

The story isn't extremely complicated or extremely drab, so you can understand it and won't fall asleep. When I'm really stressed out, I pull my will worn copy off my shelf, sink into my chair, and float into the world of Elnora. Gene Sratton-Porter presents a riveting plot including money problems, fights between Elnora and her mother, Love, and true friendships.

She pays for her schooling with the help of a job with the &quot;Birdwoman&quot; -- she collects moths from the Limberlost. Her mother's continual grieving over an unfaithful and dead husband isolate Elnora from the other girls her age and hurts her deeply.

I saw the movie a few years ago done by Wonder Works and hated it though, so if you saw only the movie and was disapointed, please check out the book.It is about a girl named Elnora who has to deal with her verbally and emotionally abusive mother and the absence of her father. She is very poor and is seen as an outcast by her peers. One of her few friends is the \\"Bird Woman\\" a woman who collects moths from the Limberlost.

My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there. This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I will not review the story but want to comment on the quality of this edition.

It cannot be passed along to others to read because it is literally in 217 separate pieces. The print is small"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This novel was promising at the outset, and there were parts of it that I enjoyed reading. However, I became more and more dissatisfied as the story progressed. The pacing was extremely erratic, and some of the important events seemed ill placed. The author often led me to think that certain characters and events were significant when they were not -- so many side plots were opened and never closed. I felt it difficult to feel sympathetic toward the characters that the author clearly wanted her audience to sympathize with.It truly would have been a satisfying novel if it weren't so crowded and disjointed."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

It is full of lessons of life and entertaining events."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I've lost track of the number of times I've read this book, thirty at least. I have worn out two copies and am on my third. Elnora's courage in the face of adversity and humiliation, her unfaltering pursuit of her goals, her love of nature and music, and her unflinching honesty all inspired me. Elnora's rocky relationship with her difficult mother got me through my own teenaged years with a much nicer mother I was equally convinced didn't understand me. I read this aloud to my own young daughters, determinded they would not miss this experience so fundamental to my own life.Please do not judge this book by the inferior WonderWorks production of it on public TV. They missed the entire flavor of the story. An extra bonus of the Library of Indiana Classics edition is the original illustrations."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This is one of my favorite books and my grandmother's too. It is just a great story with great characters that a person can really admire. The way Elnora overcomes her problems and always has hope is wonderful and inspiring.

The kindness and generosity of the characters is something we should all try to carry into our own lives. It is a gentle, old fashioned book with a happy ending."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it at least once a year and it is a pure delight every time."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This novel, published in 1909, stands out from other \\"Victorian\\" novels. It was interesting to see what's changed about public high school since then- tuition, daily Bible readings, and what hasn't- snobby girls and the importance of having the \\"right\\" clothes. There is definitely an element of realism in this novel which makes it timeless. In the details, it indirectly provides an account of how America was changing at the turn of the last century. The heroine and her mother live on the edge of the Limberlost Swamp, earning their livelihood through farming. All around them, their neighbors have sold their land to oil drilling companies; you know that the agricultural lifestyle will disappear in the area, even though we don't see it happen in the novel.There are a few subplots in this novel that don't seem to go anywhere, and it makes me wonder if it was initially printed as a serial. The first is the story of Billy, the neglected boy who becomes orphaned and then adopted. The other is the terrifying brief saga of the man who seems to be stalking Elnora in the swamp. Both of the plots seem to build up, and then not really go anywhere. I'm not sure what purpose they have in the novel.The last part of the novel deals with the love story, which is very sweet and is probably more like a typical novel of the time period. Still, it's an excellent story and does not detract from the rest of the novel.Dover Publications is marketing this as a \\"children's book\\" and although there is nothing offensive in it and it would be fine for children, I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult. As far as reading level goes, I would say that if your child can read the Anne of Green Gables series, then she can read this."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I received this book originally from my favorite aunt many years ago when I was about 11 or 12 yrs old. I am now in my 50's so I have had it for some time. It had been hers when she was young. I have tried to preserve this particular book from damage through the years but still wanting to reread it and let my daughters read it also, subjected it to some damage that could not be helped. When I found that through Amazon I could get a new copy and in larger print I immediately ordered it. You do not know the joy I felt when it arrived.I love this book I guess more because it is about a girl very similar to myself. One who loves nature and education and had found a way to be able to get the education she wanted through her love of nature and the knowledge she had that not only helped her financially to get that education. But also helped to reunite her with a mother that she had been estranged from for so long. It helped her mother become a better person and take pride in herself and in her daughter's achievements with very little help from others, other than the Lady of the Bird's. (Called the Bird Lady in the book).I am still in awe that all this took place in an area that is very familiar to my family, as at one time more than a hundred years ago now, they owned land around the Limberlost Swamp. That is why this is so dear to my heart.I would reccomend this book to everyone, not just to children or teenagers. It really gives you a different perspective on life and how to deal with adversity and make the best of what you have available to you."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"It's hard not to fall in love with Elnora. Not only is her character development a journey of delight, you are allowed into the lives of the other characters of the book and feel their joys as well as pain. The story line is simple although deeply moving and best of all...REAL.Elnora's bitter mother does worse than MIStreats her, she barely treats her with any reagard AT ALL! Kindly neighbors know the real truth about her father's death and do their best to love this sensitive and bright girl. The mother goes through a life-changing series of events that transform her from a hard, compassionless shell of a woman into a truly repentant softened heart eager to love her estranged daughter. Her change is so heart-wrenching, I usually have a gut-ache by the end of those chapters.If you have a love for nature and boast a colorful imagination, Porter lays before you a smorgasboard of descriptions of Limberlost life in the woods. I have been to Porter's Limbelost cabin in Geneva. It's lovely. And there's actually a mounted specimen of the Yellow Emperor! (Read this book and that last statement will thrill you!)This book can help teach you the meaning of self-respect, determination, perseverance and love. Elnora does not throw herself at her boyfriend, rather allows him to persue and woo her after he discovers his fiancee is a manipulative shallow child he has only worshiped and not loved. The story flows with honor and respect.Please read you will not be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"My Grandfather, Dr. Henry Wingblade, a former college English professor and president of Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota, purchased Freckles for me when I was 10 years old and shared that it was his favorite children's book. That was 47 years ago and this past spring I purchased a copy on-line to read it again. Enjoying it immersely, I decided to read more of Gene Stratton-Porter's work, choosing to read A Girl of the Limberlost. The incredible way Gene describes the life of Elnora, the main character, is both delightful and intriguing. Gene has a unique way of allowing the reader to actually live the story as one reads it.

The story I find charming though Victorian in the respect of its following a trite pattern of &quot;poor, good girl meets prince and lives happily ever after.&quot; Sweet and charming but perhaps encouraging a less than realistic view of the real world. The writer does know flora and fauna, however: behavior of the moths spoiling themselves when confined; collecting moths at night as they lit on her dress; the mother's fright at finding moths emerging on the kitchen curtain in the night. The first chapters of the book, with the woodlands and swamps described in such a manner draws the reader into those fern-filled leafy bowers--and into the young girl's life, empty and loveless save for the joy of nature. As the story draws to a close in the final chapter, I am left to wonder what kind of life she finds, marrying into a social set so far removed from her own."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I read this book after discussing it with an elderly woman who had read it when she was 12 and still delights in it.

This is a book for ALL ages! While my grandmother read it to me, and I have read it to both my daughter, and granddaughter, my mother and grandmother both read it themselves as adults, and I have read and re-read this book many, many times since childhood. It is sad that whenever a story is clean, heartwarming, and has familly values, that it is deemed to be just for children.The story is a wonderful and timeless story. Elnora is like an old friend that I love to visit every few years. My mother has worn her copy out and at the age of 80 has requested this book for her 81st birthday, along with a few other Ms. Stratton has written. This book is a timeless story, and was made into a movie (by the same name) a long time ago, however the movie does not cover the entire book.These books by Ms. Porter sell for over $40 for the original copy in the antique stores! If you want a great read, and a story that you will want to read over and over, buy this book, and any other Ms. Porter has written! I also love Her Father's Daughter, Laddie, Freckles, etc. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"When I was a child an old copy of A Girl of the Limberlost landed in our house; I think neighbors were housecleaning and got rid of some books. We lived in a fairly rural area and when my mother read that book to me (one chapter every night) I identified with it SO much. It still means a great deal to me.By the way, DO read Freckles too. Probably it was intended to be read first, but if you read it after it works well as a \\"prequel\\" to A Girl of the Limberlost..."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Elnora Comstock, the plucky, resourceful heroine of this classic novel, first published in 1909, is a character who is still relevant and fascinating for today's readers. \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" was one of my favorite books as a girl, and it was one of my mother's and my grandmother's favorites. Like other timeless literary heroines who overcome great odds to achieve happiness (such as Anne of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and Jo of \\"Little Women\\"), Elnora is eternally fiesty, admirable and loveable.When the novel opens, Elnora is determined to attend the high school in a nearby township. Her neglectful, sometimes abusive mother, Katharine, is equally determined to discourage her and ruin her dreams. Elnora and Katharine live in a cabin on the edge of the great Limberlost swamp, a place of wonder and danger, located three miles from the township where Elnora wants to go to school. The hard, cold Katharine is haunted by the death of her husband on the very day Elnora was born. She blames her only child for the death of her beloved husband because her birth kept Katharine from having the strength to aid her husband when he was drowning in the swamp.On the first day of high school, Elnora's tacky clothes and inability to fit in with the snooty mean girls, along with the fact that she learns she will needs an unexpected amount of money for books and tuition leads her to brief despair. But her own ingenuity, along with the help of a loving neighbor couple, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, solve some of Elnora's problems.I love the many intricate details in this book about Elnora's life in a rural early twentieth century world. For instance, the Sintons purchase clothing and accessories so that Elnora can fit in with her classmates. One article is a wonderful leather lunchbox which contains lidded dishes to hold small sandwiches, salad, condiments, dessert, milk, utensils and a cloth napkin. The descriptions of the different foods which are used to fill this lunchbox, and how Elnora's lunches eventually play a part in her meeting some destitute children whom she ultimately aides, are just fascinating.Elnora is able to earn her way through school by her mastery of the natural world around her. She collects moths, butterflies, old Indian relics, bird's nests, specimens of tree leaves, flowers and grasses, and then either sells them or uses them to teach classes in natural history to grade school children. Her forays into the Limberlost, and what she finds there are described in loving detail.The characters in the book are also memorable. How Katharine Comstock comes to change her outlook on life, and learn some hard lessons about the importance of motherhood and the real character of her dead husband is told with great depth of feeling. But this is not a cloying or overly sentimental book. These characters are very real and hold up very well to a twenty-first century reader's more sophisticated tastes.Even the romance at the end of the novel, between Elnora and a handsome lawyer from Chicago, who are brought together by their love of the outdoors, is believable by today's standards. A deliciously malevolent and spoiled ex-fiancee who seeks to ruin Elnora's chance at true love is introduced, but all ends happily for everyone.I recommend this novel highly. Gene Stratton-Porter was an important, prolific writer, and if you like this book, you should seek some other titles, especially \\"Freckles\\". \\"Freckles\\" is the prequel to \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" and is also a wonderful story about a young man overcoming adversity and finding love.This review is for the Library of Indiana Classics paperback edition of the novel. This edition contains the complete text, but does not contain any essays or criticism. The Library of Indiana Classics also issues a hardback edition of the novel. You can also get the complete text of the novel at no cost for your Kindle, as the text for the novel has entered public domain. The same is true for \\"Freckles.\\""},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I received this book for Christmas in 1962. My mother had read it as girl. I am always in search of books to give as gifts to the children in the family. I was thrilled to find this in paperback form.I purchase it as a Christmas gift for a niece who is 15.

It was too long, too natural-sy looking and seemed too boring for me to read for a long time. When I did read it, it became part of me but I could never guess at how important it would become to me until some twenty years later.A couple of years ago I decided to write an honours thesis in my chosen area of English Literature. And what was the most valuable book I'd ever read and that was more worthy of academic study than any other? A Girl of the Limberlost. It is the flagship book for my studies in American nature writing. Although I'm currently journeying through all the big guns - Thoreau. Whitman, Abbey etc., none as yet hold a candle to the Limberlost, an intriguing mix of swampland and some of the tallest timber in the United States. Admittedly, the plot is trite, the ending disappointing, the characters slightly unbelievable, but there is something that lifts this book above its own flaws and I really think that's the nature writing sequences. And the way people are incorporated into that nature.It's also the deeply rooted sense of Americana in the story. From the descriptions of food and clothes to the long, unsealed roads, I think this book is the best introduction for young female readers into American ethics, style and enterprise in the early twentieth-century. It certainly gave me, an Australian, a taste of Americana which has proved more useful and comforting than I could have ever imagined. I recommend it without reserve for any reader, but particularly young girls. I just wish I could remember who gave it to me. I'd love to say thanks."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"For anyone who thought they weren't perfect and worried how they looked, where they came from or how they appeared to others, this book will warm your soul and show that all can triumph as long as you persevere.

I can't believe I found this book still available in print on Amazon. This was one of my mother's favorite books as a child. She gave it to me to read when I was a girl. I read it several times and was fascinated with the strange but beautiful evolution of the relationship between the mother and daughter in the story. I will also never forget the parts about how the girl collected bugs against a white sheet at night or how her mother went to the hair salon and had them style her hair several times so she could learn how to do it herself. I cannot wait to get my copy and read it again. I never thought I would find it. But if this story stayed with me all these years and with my mother before me, it must have an extraordinary magic that transcends space and time.

I believe it was also made into a family movie which I am going to find and buy!"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Elnora, the title character of A Girl of the Limberlost has captured my heart and will be one of my favorite heroines. The book reflects so many wonderful values that are as true today as when they were written. I have often found in historical fiction that the qualities for which women are praised are subservience and obedience. Elnora is a kind, gving and humble girl - but she wins her respect from herself and others by excelling in every way possible. She craves education - and is first in her class in many subjects. She loves nature and persues samples of it in the swamp where she lives with the heart of a true tomboy. When she encounters obstacles, she thinks for herself and works to achieve what she wants - going into business for herself in a number of different ways. She master's the violin and composes her own pieces. She is also quite capable of behaving in society, wearing fashionable cloths and making friends with city girls. At the turn of the century she has already appreciated the threat to nature that mankind's rapid progress makes and lives a green lifestyle. She is a heroine that any modern girl could look up to.Many other characters of the book are well fleshed out and well written. Her mother overcomes great grief to rejoin life. A young semi-starved orphan Billy finds a loving home and begins to learn responsibility. A rich society man learns the values that are important in life and in a wife.I can't recommend the book enough. It's wonderful and an excellent read for both adults and young women."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"My daughter had to read books by Gene Stratton-Porter for a school project. This was a sweet story - not so simple that it was boring, but not too involved so she couldn't finish it easily. She enjoyed it thoroughly; the book describes many aspects of nature in the Limberlost swamp area of IN."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Certainly a period piece, yet there is a reason that A Girl of the Limberlost has been made into a movie more than once, with varying success. The story is a straightforward and wonderfully American one, of a young lady gentle, intelligent and lovely, who succeeds in work, life and love despite difficult circumstances.I have this copy, a hard cover with a flower design imprinted on the cover and several lovely period illustrations within. You may have seen this copy at a grandparent's house or a used book store. It is also still in print in modern paperback editions. I think that it is pleasant to read the old story from an older book with sympathetic illustrations.The Limberlost is a swamp, a real swamp in Indiana. You can Google it and find out where it is and how it got its name. The girl of the story is Elnora Comstock, who lives with her cranky, widowed mother near the edge of the swamp. Elnora is bright, and undeterred by her mother's scorn of her desire to further her education -- but they have no money (supposedly) to pay for the clothes and books and other expenses, and the high school is miles away. Elnora raises and captures moths, which fly at night, to sell to collectors, in order to meet her fees. She finds and sells many natural objects, such as moss and bird's nests. This was at the turn of the (20th) century, remember, when people did collect such things, and when they were used for instruction and the illustration of books. Perhaps you have been to an old museum or study, or even a relative's house that still reflects Victorian and Edwardian culture, and you can see how there would have to have been these woodsy entrepreneurs.I don't want to give away too much of the story itself, but more the style and sense of it, to help a person decide about reading it. There is constant description of Elnora's grace, beauty, gentleness, etc., and it can get a little thick, but it is in keeping with the genre of the time. Her mother is a real piece of work, but she has her story and her tragedy also, and she grows in the tale. There are neighbors, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, who are like a second family to Elnora, and a young rascal named Billy, and the handsome young man from town, Philip Ammon, and his shallow fiancee Edith, and the stalwart Henderson, and many others. With the beauty of the Limberlost, described in brilliant colors as by one who knows and loves nature, and the incredible variety of the moths (ditto), this story is a romance of civilized persons at the frontier. From time to time the writer veers off into bursts of purple prose about the hand of the Almighty in nature, but at other times her steady insistence of the triumph of gentleness and good influences over contrariness and shallowness seem truly classic.It is, as I said, a period piece, no doubt about it. But it is a good period piece, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"The book is a wonderful classic book but the reprinting of it was not too great.

A much smaller amount still remains as a state park.The characters come to life and seem almost real. The young girl and her mother and friends search the woods and marshes for moths butterfly and other nature items. Little Billy made me laugh right out loud at some of his boyish games.As I was reading I wondered why would my father have enjoyed such a book?

It's a sweet story of a very strong young woman who wants to attend college but is met with many obstacles along the way."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Think of it as a Midwestern Cinderella story, but with no glass slipper and plenty of moths. Gene Stratton Porter was at the peak of her skills when she wrote \\"A Girl of the Limberlost,\\" which starts off as a young girl's struggle against her mother's virulent hatred -- and soon evolves into an enchanting little romance.Elnora Comstock has barely signed up for college when she discovers that she can't afford it -- tuition and textbooks cost too much, and her shabby clothes are mocked by her classmates. Even worse, her half-crazy, malicious mother refuses to cough up any money.But she soon finds that she can pay another way -- a strange lady called the Bird Woman is willing to pay money for moths, butterflies, caterpillars and chrysalids, which Elnora can easily find in a vast dangerous swamp called the Limberlost. And her friends Margaret and Wesley are happy to help her in any way they can -- clothes, a violin -- until the day when Mrs. Comstock comes to a shocking realization about her daughter.Then Elnora encounters a wealthy young man named Philip Ammon, who has the same love of nature that she has -- as well as a wealthy socialite fiancee named Edith. But when a party in honor of Edith and Philip's engagement is wrecked by a butterfly and a fit of jealousy, he begins to realize what his true feelings for Elnora are...\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" can be divided into two sections -- the first is a Cinderellaesque story about a strong, intelligent young girl who is pursing her music and education, despite her nasty old mother's loathing of her. But once that storyline is wrapped up, the second half of the book becomes a haunting, passionate love story.Stratton-Porter was at her peak when she wrote this -- her prose is overflowing with natural beauty (\\"the whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets\\") and some very tough personal situations, such as when Margaret and Wesley take in a badly-abused young boy. And both halves of \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.But the romance is also really adorable, especially since it's based on friendship and both parties only realize it belatedly. And Stratton-Porter adds in a touch of romance for other characters, including old married couples and snotty socialites.Elnora is a likable, realistic girl that you'd like as a friend -- kind, charitable and hardworking, but has flashes of temper. And Philip Ammon is a rather sweet if clueless guy. Mrs. Comstock starts out as a crazy old lady who wallows in her grief and obsession with her dead husband, but Stratton-Porter rebuilds her into a character you can like and respect; Edith also starts off as a nasty snotty rich girl who cares more about social status than love, but the author puts her through the grinder and makes her more likable.\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is both a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a lush little romance, set against an epic backdrop of natural beauty.

It starts out in the Limberlost with this girl, Elnora who lives with her Mom, Her Father was killed by a drowning in the swamp near their house. A few houses down live a man and wife named Wesley and Margaret Sinton. They had two little girls who both got sick and passed away. They end up adopting a little boy named Billy. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton were always like family to Elnora.Elnora decided that she wanted to go to high school. She had always been a curious little girl, and now she wanted to go to the city and go to high school. Her mother, who never had liked her very much and blamed her for her Father's death, said she did not care if she went to high school but not to ask for any financial help from her. So Elnora went off to school. The first day she was made fun of terribly and she was not sure that she wanted to return. She talked to Mr. Sinton and he told her to tell her Mom about everything. So she went home to tell her. That day Elnora had found out that she had to pay a $20.00 fee because she was a city girl. She also had to pay for her own books, which she did not know about. Well Elnora was a very poor girl and would not accept anything as a gift from anybody. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton went to town and asked some girls Elnora's age how they did their hair and who made their clothes and what kind of lunch box should Elnora have. They got her all of these things plus and umbrella, boots, new shoes, and a coat. They went to take it to Elnora and when they got there they had a wonderful surprise. Elnora had gone to town to figure out a way for her to pay for her school. She went to the bird woman because all Elnora's life she had collected moths and other insects. The bird woman said she would pay her for everything she could collect for her. Well, Elnora's second day of school was a little better. She got to wear her hair like all the other girls, and had on a nice dress just like all the other girls. Also, nobody pointed her out because she was different. They all liked her and she began to make a lot of friends. Also, she was able to pay her tuition and one of the teachers called up a sophmore and asked her to bring in her used books so that Elnora could have them to study with. So things started to look up for Elnora. The only thing was that her Mom did not know how great of a person Elnora was turning out to be or how hard she was working and how much she needed her Mothers love. For four years Elnora had kept this life pretty much a secret. She had learned to play the violin, she had taught other students about science, and she had earned all the money to pay for whatever she wanted. When she graduated Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sinton who had been there all along to support her, made her Mother go to town to see her daughter graduate. When Elnora played the violin her Mother was so proud and realized how wrong she had been in treating her daughter. She then began to love and do things with Elnora and they lived on as friends instead of strangers.Elnora had met a man named, Ammon. He at once fell in love with Elnora, but it took Elnora awhile to come around to liking him. He was engaged to a girl named Edith, who was very self-centered and did not care about anyone but herself. They were definitely a wrong fit. Elnora told Ammon that she could not be with him until she was positive that he was not in love with Edith. So, he went back to Illinois and Elnora went to a secret place where nobody would know where she was. Ammon soon realized that there was no future for him and Edith, and got very sick because he could not find Elnora and did not know what to do. His best friend, Phillip found Elnora in a country side house not far from where Ammon was. When Ammon found Elnora she decided to marry him. First their was a surprise visit from Edith. She swore on her life that she could get Ammon back and that he was hers, but it did not work. Ammon proved to Elnora that she was the one and they were going to get married."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Taking when the book was written into consideration, I suppose this was at one time \\"good reading\\". However, I found a lot of the narrative to be loquacious while being completely void of dialogue that actually flowed. I thought a lot of the conversation was very choppy, and I can't imagine one human conversing with another in the manner that is done throughout the book. The idea behind the story was interesting, but the manner in which the author decided to communicate this to the reader left something to be desired. I didn't feel the author developed the characters sufficiently enough to engage the reader beyond a very surface level. Overall, it wasn't the worst book I've ever read. But it was definitely not one of the best. My rating is a C-."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"It is easy to criticize this novel for young people from any number of angles. The language is stilted, the style is flat, the dialogue stagy, and the characters' psychology don't quite ring true. Even the source of Elnora's income seems implausible. Collecting butterflies for the kinds of sums she is ultimately able to acquire should bring in hoards of competitors. We should see whole species extinct by the end of the book, along with plenty of human violence and thievery, but perhaps I am reading too much modernity into this simple tale of almost a century ago, a story that remains appealing and affecting for its innocence, not its realism.At root, the story is the conflict between Elnora Comstock and her psychologically unwell mother (Kate, whom the author wisely does not try to make likable, though he does attempt to make her sympathetic) and how Elnora's intelligence, determination, and all around decency and goodness triumph in the end. Elnora in fact turns out to be quite a formidable foe of anyone who stands in her way, as her rival in love Edith Carr will discover. Yet despite her power, she struggles to grow in wisdom and humanity, never letting bitterness overcome her essential decency.Modern readers may roll their eyes at the sensibilities and sensitivities exhibited. At times, it seems that Elnora and her friends are living next door to where the pyramids are being built. But surely, that is part of the book's charm. Young girls of the time (pre-WWI) no doubt hoped for such a happily married life, as Elnora seems destined to have. And it is refreshing to see the young men portrayed as intelligent as well as romantic and caring. Characters grow, even mean, monstrous ones (e.g. Kate), and they grow for the better. One always wishes the best for Elnora and despite the book's faults that is a real accomplishment on by the author. They don't write books like this one any more."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Think of it as a Midwestern Cinderella story, but with no glass slipper and plenty of moths. Gene Stratton Porter was at the peak of her skills when she wrote \\"A Girl of the Limberlost,\\" which starts off as a young girl's struggle against her mother's virulent hatred -- and soon evolves into an enchanting little romance.Elnora Comstock has barely signed up for college when she discovers that she can't afford it -- tuition and textbooks cost too much, and her shabby clothes are mocked by her classmates. Even worse, her half-crazy, malicious mother refuses to cough up any money.But she soon finds that she can pay another way -- a strange lady called the Bird Woman is willing to pay money for moths, butterflies, caterpillars and chrysalids, which Elnora can easily find in a vast dangerous swamp called the Limberlost. And her friends Margaret and Wesley are happy to help her in any way they can -- clothes, a violin -- until the day when Mrs. Comstock comes to a shocking realization about her daughter.Then Elnora encounters a wealthy young man named Philip Ammon, who has the same love of nature that she has -- as well as a wealthy socialite fiancee named Edith. But when a party in honor of Edith and Philip's engagement is wrecked by a butterfly and a fit of jealousy, he begins to realize what his true feelings for Elnora are...\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" can be divided into two sections -- the first is a Cinderellaesque story about a strong, intelligent young girl who is pursing her music and education, despite her nasty old mother's loathing of her. But once that storyline is wrapped up, the second half of the book becomes a haunting, passionate love story.Stratton-Porter was at her peak when she wrote this -- her prose is overflowing with natural beauty (\\"the whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets\\") and some very tough personal situations, such as when Margaret and Wesley take in a badly-abused young boy. And both halves of \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.But the romance is also really adorable, especially since it's based on friendship and both parties only realize it belatedly. And Stratton-Porter adds in a touch of romance for other characters, including old married couples and snotty socialites.Elnora is a likable, realistic girl that you'd like as a friend -- kind, charitable and hardworking, but has flashes of temper. And Philip Ammon is a rather sweet if clueless guy. Mrs. Comstock starts out as a crazy old lady who wallows in her grief and obsession with her dead husband, but Stratton-Porter rebuilds her into a character you can like and respect; Edith also starts off as a nasty snotty rich girl who cares more about social status than love, but the author puts her through the grinder and makes her more likable.\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is both a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a lush little romance, set against an epic backdrop of natural beauty. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"A lovely early 20th century book about a girl who lives in a rural area, catching rare moths to put herself through high school. This book is perfect for a girl in her young teens- an innocently romantic tale that focuses a on girl's growing understanding of her own role in the world. While the book's language and setting might seem outdated to some, the theme and plot are timeless classics.This is a book that I have loved reading and re-reading for the past 20 years, since I was about 13 years old."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I've read this book every few years or so since I was 10(I'm now 60) the first copy being my grandmother's. One is transported into a different world, one where goals were clearer . Elnora's struggles can be related to by any girl today, and her triumph is purely her own. A lovely theme in the book allows each character to come to life as a caterpillar, spend a time in a cocoon, them emerge finally as a beautiful moth. Elnora's mother's transformation is particularly splendid. The ecological concerns of the novel convince the reader that our &quot;modern&quot; problems are mere variations on a theme. The reverence for hard work, creativity, and strict moral standards are refreshing."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Elnora Comstock, the plucky, resourceful heroine of this classic novel, first published in 1909, is a character who is still relevant and fascinating for today's readers. \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" was one of my favorite books as a girl, and it was one of my mother's and my grandmother's favorites. Like other timeless literary heroines who overcome great odds to achieve happiness (such as Anne of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and Jo of \\"Little Women\\"), Elnora is eternally fiesty, admirable and loveable.When the novel opens, Elnora is determined to attend the high school in a nearby township. Her neglectful, sometimes abusive mother, Katharine, is equally determined to discourage her and ruin her dreams. Elnora and Katharine live in a cabin on the edge of the great Limberlost swamp, a place of wonder and danger, located three miles from the township where Elnora wants to go to school. The hard, cold Katharine is haunted by the death of her husband on the very day Elnora was born. She blames her only child for the death of her beloved husband because her birth kept Katharine from having the strength to aid her husband when he was drowning in the swamp.On the first day of high school, Elnora's tacky clothes and inability to fit in with the snooty mean girls, along with the fact that she learns she will needs an unexpected amount of money for books and tuition leads her to brief despair. But her own ingenuity, along with the help of a loving neighbor couple, Margaret and Wesley Sinton, solve some of Elnora's problems.I love the many intricate details in this book about Elnora's life in a rural early twentieth century world. For instance, the Sintons purchase clothing and accessories so that Elnora can fit in with her classmates. One article is a wonderful leather lunchbox which contains lidded dishes to hold small sandwiches, salad, condiments, dessert, milk, utensils and a cloth napkin. The descriptions of the different foods which are used to fill this lunchbox, and how Elnora's lunches eventually play a part in her meeting some destitute children whom she ultimately aides, are just fascinating.Elnora is able to earn her way through school by her mastery of the natural world around her. She collects moths, butterflies, old Indian relics, bird's nests, specimens of tree leaves, flowers and grasses, and then either sells them or uses them to teach classes in natural history to grade school children. Her forays into the Limberlost, and what she finds there are described in loving detail.The characters in the book are also memorable. How Katharine Comstock comes to change her outlook on life, and learn some hard lessons about the importance of motherhood and the real character of her dead husband is told with great depth of feeling. But this is not a cloying or overly sentimental book. These characters are very real and hold up very well to a twenty-first century reader's more sophisticated tastes.Even the romance at the end of the novel, between Elnora and a handsome lawyer from Chicago, who are brought together by their love of the outdoors, is believable by today's standards. A deliciously malevolent and spoiled ex-fiancee who seeks to ruin Elnora's chance at true love is introduced, but all ends happily for everyone.I recommend this novel highly. Gene Stratton-Porter was an important, prolific writer, and if you like this book, you should seek some other titles, especially \\"Freckles\\". \\"Freckles\\" is the prequel to \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" and is also a wonderful story about a young man overcoming adversity and finding love.This review is for the Kindle edition of the novel, which contains the complete text and is available free for download to your Kindle, as the novel has entered public domain. The novel is also available in paperback and hardback editions, some of which contain copyrighted essays and criticism."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Elnora Comstock , despite country schooling, lack of money, and a mother who despises her, uses her wits and character to get an education. Her absolute understanding of right and wrong may seem quaint to a reader today, but it earns her education, money, and the love of all who meet her. The moral values exemplified by Elnora are refreshing to read about. She blames no one for her hardships, but works with all possible verve to overcome them. The ecological issues, which were emphasized in the very inferior made for tv movie, seem to presage our present day concerns. The Bird Woman is even then trying to preserve nature for the city folk who cannot enjoy it. I first read by grandmother's falling apart copy about 55 years ago. Once a decade I would locate the book somehow. Once I got it from a high school student who had inherited it from her great grandmother. Recently it showed up in the public library, but ABRIDGED.I was delighted when I discovered it had been reprinted in its original form. This book casts a strange spell over me. Edith Carr's final act of graciousness is a masterpiece of imagery."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I loved this book! Considering its age, I was expecting thick, dragging description and stilted dialog that would drive me crazy. However, there was neither--I haven't been so pleasantly surprised by a book in quite a long time! The characters immediately play with our sympathies; I even felt sorry for Kate Comstock, after all she had done to Elnora, when she learns the truth about her husband. Some of the plot twists were quite contrived (for instance, Elnora searches for how many pages for a single Yellow Emperor, and then her mother, an inexperienced moth hunter at best, finds a PAIR the first time she goes looking?), but it really didn't bother me. &quot;Suspension of disbelief&quot; is an easy mode to get into when the characters are this interesting. I also just loved the &quot;test&quot; Elnora puts forth at the end of the book. She really is a true lady, never compromising her standards and keeping her feelings for Philip in check EVEN when he comes to her a free man. It would have been very easy to throw herself into his arms for the final kiss of the book (it was what they both wanted, after all) at least fifty pages before the end, but that would have been too easy. So to those who would gripe that the book is too long, I wouldn't take out a single event. Give it a zealous four stars if you don't consider the age of the book. But grading on a curve with other books I've read from this era, five stars isn't enough!"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This book makes you feel like you are there. When you read about Edith's ball, you can totally picture her dress. When Gene Porter talks about Elnora's gifts for graduation, you feel like jumping in there and seeing them for yourself, she descirbes them so well. This is a great story for someone who loves the outdoors and a little bit of romance and a tiny bit of suspense. That comes when you are finding out about Elnora's father. I just love the descriptions in this book! I cannot say it enough. I feel like I'm there, back in the time period with Elnora and experiencing everything that she experiences. With this book you can get a little bit of a lot of different types of writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves old stories. (Now, if you want me to tell what the story is about, here it goes.) Elnora is a girl who is growing up on the edge of a forest/swamp called the Limberlost. There she lives with her unattentive mother who has never really forgiven her husband (Elnora's father) for dieing and leaving her with a child to raise. This book follows Elnora through high school and her experiences with the &quot;city people&quot; and her struggles to become accepted and to earn her way through school and on to college. It also tells of her summers spent with Philip Ammon, a young man who is engaged to the most spoiled young woman one can imagine in my opinion. At the end, things are almost opposite from what they were at the beginning. At least with her mother and Philip. This story is a sort-of take off from &quot;Freckles&quot;, which is another book by Gene Stratton Porter. &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; continues Porter's great talent for placing the reader in the world of the characters and using great passages telling about different kinds of flowers, ferns, mosses, and moths and butterflys. I would definetly recommend this book to a nature lover. This is a great book"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Everyone who loves books should read this story!This is a VERY old Book! I am 58 years old, and I remember my Mother giving me her well read and tattered copy when I was quite young. I read it MANY times over the years, until it just fell apart!

Try it, you'll like it! Jenny Martin, Springville, Alabama"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"There are few books as readable, time after time, as this one by Gene Stratton-Porter. Its themes are as relevant today as they were when they were written at the turn of the century - overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges; fitting in; challenging relationships; the value of friends and family; grief; belonging; honesty; education - formal, informal and the school of hard knocks; the wonder and beauty of the natural world - moths, woods, and swamps in particular; the ecological impact of development; love; patience; creative thinking; jealousy; and commitment.First read at age 12 and later shared with my husband and daughters, we are enriched with every reading. Its lucid prose draws us deep into the northeastern Indiana woods, and we can't help but relish life, moths, and Elnora. Gene Stratton-Porter was once asked why she wrote such positive stories when more sensational, raw novels would probably sell more books. She said something to the effect that there is enough sordidness in the world, what we all need to be reminded of is that goodness is also there, and that she preferred writing stories which allow us to be uplifted and guided by that goodness!Now a grandmother, I still appreciate the good fortune of having had a grandmother introduced Gene Stratton-Porter's books to me. This and should be on Oprah's Book Club and a feature film!"},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"Everyone knows that teenage girls are supposed to experience extreme mood swings, be obsessed with their appearance and have romantic notions filling their remaining thoughts. As Henry Higgins says, their minds are full of \\"cotton, hay and rags.\\" At least that is the popular stereotype, reinforced by the shallow portrayals of young girls in movies and television, who, when they aren't preoccupied with the mirror are busy trying to save the earth. That is why this book's heroine is a refreshing example of a young woman whose real attractiveness lies with her courage and intelligence, especially in the face of suffering, while she still has a healthy concern about how she is \\"carpentered.\\" She also embraces a deep love for God's creation without being a rabid environmentalist.Elnora Comstock is a 16-year-old girl who lives on the edge of a swamp called the Limberlost with her widowed mother. Elnora's life is difficult because her mother has retreated from the world since the tragic death of her beloved husband when Elnora was only a baby. Mrs. Comstock has become hardened and unloving, and Elnora's only affection is from a neighboring couple who have no children of their own. In this cold atmosphere, Elnora blossoms into a rare jewel of a person; rather than becoming embittered like her mother, she returns love for her mother's negligence and shows remarkable resourcefulness in meeting the challenges of pursuing her dreams while trying to remeain faithful to her mother's commands.Gene Stratton Porter has written several popular novels which were bestsellers in the time they were first published in the early part of the 20th century. Freckles was somewhat of a prequel to A Girl of the Limberlost, and both books are full of accurate natural history, especially about moths and butterflies in the Limberlost Swamp in Indiana, while asserting that the wonders of nature could only have come from God's creative Hand (the author was actually married to someone named Charles Darwin Porter!)Elnora is remarkably patient and loving while undergoing difficult trials, but rather than being an unbelievable, sickeningly-sweet character, she exhibits temper, anguish and sometimes walks a fine line between being obedient to her mother and justifying hiding certain things from her. Yet as Elnora grows into graceful maturity, her mother softens, and the reconciliation between mother and daughter is a touching reminder of how God would have us respond to providential trials. Even though we can't presently know the outcome of our daily battles, we can trust that He is lovingly guiding us to a wonderful end."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This story is so beautiful, you'll want to read it over and over.

But this is a wonderful, decidedly old-fashioned, feel-good book. In my mid teens, a big barrel arrived at our house one evening. It contained all the books that my mother read as a child and was storing at my grandparents house. Among them were Freckles, The Harvester and A Girl of the Limberlost. I don't know what possessed me, being a guy and all, but I started with Limberlost. This is about me. The wild child bare-footing his way through the southwest Ohio woods, studying everything that caught his attention, collecting cocoons every winter experiencing whatever ecstasy is available to a 13-year-old when they emerged in June. And there I was, too, plotting, planning, and conniving to get into college. So, in my dotage, or maybe half-dotage, when I require myself to re-read a book that really impressed me earlier in life from time to time, I decided to re-read Limberlost. It's still wonderful. I'm a little wiser. I can see some of the formal seams in the writing, now. But that's fine. This is a good read. Now to buy The Harvester again and let it guilt me from my bookshelf until I re-read it too."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I can't improve much on the prior 5 star comments.

I received this book over 15 years ago and it continues to rank #1 through the hundreds of others. The writer is clear and concise about settings and people. I truly care for all of them (I wish they would make a movie, true to the full book). While many perceive \\"Oh geesh.. moths?\\" I see it as the literal metaphor for Elnora's life in the book. Her transformation from 16 through 20 is wonderful. Moths and butterflies can be beautiful, if you know what to look for, and not only does the book teach us this directly - it teaches us this with people as well."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"I loved every page of this book.

It is wonderfully written, and one of those stories that just leave you feeling good. This time around, I took the time to check out what/where the Limberlost was, the history of Gene Stratton Porter, etc., and it added to the enjoyment. Sometimes you really can't beat the old classics."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"The flaws in this book fall into two categories.(1) General style and structure: The book is written in a very sentimental and cloying style. People speak in long paragraphs in a way that's very unrealistic; writing dialogue is not the author's strong point (describing nature is more her thing). The explanations for the way Mrs Comstock acts make no sense. Also, sometimes characters appear, with all kinds of foreshadowing implied, and then are never mentioned again.(2) Historical issues: I understand that this book was written over a hundred years ago and is, as my edition states, \\"a product of its time.\\" But by the standards of our time, there are some troubling attitudes expressed in the work about race (specifically Native Americans/Indians) and gender. My edition notes that \\"views on race have changed\\" but is tellingly silent on the question of gender. On the plus side, the main character Elnora is not just a pretty face, she is brave and smart and has interests and ambitions. However, it is taken for granted that once she marries, all of that will take a back seat to keeping a home and rearing children. I'm not blaming the author for this, that wouldn't be fair (especially since we haven't really moved on so very much--vide Pretty Woman, etc). But younger readers, who are after all the intended audience of this book, may benefit from discussions challenging these ideas.Having said that, there is a cozy sort of feel to the world of this book. One gets a glimpse (albeit in rosy soft focus) of what life was like in another time and place, and some interesting ethical dilemmas are raised concerning nature conservation.P.S. Anne Of Green Gables, while published a year earlier, is far ahead in terms of gender equality."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"The book was as good as I remember it when I read it as a child.

One thing that was super annoying though was that Elnora was collecting caterpillars and moths from the swamps to sell. Then it says that every year, there are less and less moths. And who's fault do you think that is? It's Elnora who's capturing and killing them. Though I don't blame her; she has to earn money some way. Also, the book talked about God in a very annoying way.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"The story of Elanora and her travels as she comes of age is a true gem from an era known for serial offerings of young male adventurers as heroes. This thoughtful novel by Gene Stratton-Porter stands apart from the rest due to the following characteristics and more:- TGotL takes the reader on several absorbing tours of an Indiana swamp ecosystem. Smart kids will have fun researching moths, birds, and perhaps even some long ago-forgotten terms circa 1909, if they can overlook the prerequisite eye dialect so popular in American fiction at the time. No surprise that there are several Twain references in this story.- Elanora is a brave, intelligent heroine, who finds ways to achieve her goals in spite of her situation. Although her rewards always seem to be tempered with more challenges, she does not give up. Stratton-Porter wasn't the greatest writer, even she would admit that; but she did know how to develop characters to an extent, and she did a fine job with Elanora. One can't but root for her as she struggles to learn, grow, and fit in.- The characters are human. They are not perfect (except for our dear Elanora), but those who are not always good are also not always bad. Just like us, they undergo changes in personality and feeling over the some ten years we catch a glimpse of.This book provides an escape to another Secret Garden as had not yet been described. Enjoy it while reading outdoors in the fresh air. You might even recognize a butterfly or two after awhile."},{"Title":"A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST","review":"This was a book My mother spoke about in the 1930S This is the first time I ever saw it. I found it very interesting ."},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"This edition focuses primarily upon William Morris' influential utopian romance News from Nowhere, and contains some useful notes for the reading of the text together with several other of his pieces relating to the themes of Earthly Paradise, the arts and crafts and the nature of work.If News from Nowhere seems unfamiliar to most people now, it is perhaps not so much due to its age than to the many successful novels written since that warn of the perils of striving blindly toward some Brave New World ideal. Yet News from Nowhere was itself written partly as a reaction to one such industrial utopia, namely Edward Bellamy's \`Looking Backward', and is perhaps more relevant today than at any time since its original publication in 1890. William Morris offers here a prophetic anticipation of the concerns of today's growing environmental and \`anti-globalisation' movements.Although others have presented Morris' ideas as backward and Luddite, such labelling imparts a misleading picture of his views. Indeed, far from being a 'Luddite' Morris was quick to embrace the innovative Jacquard loom in his own workshops - a programmable punch-card system for automated weaving, and one of the precursors of modern computing. The irony inherent in such a label will not be lost on those familiar with the history of the Luddites.Rather than denouncing technology News from Nowhere sees a world so technologically and socially advanced that it has surpassed any need for the industrial technology of Capital, ably providing for its own happiness and wellbeing without it. Progressive and sustainable technology is woven so seamlessly into its idyllic tapestry that if you were to blink you would easily miss it. And this is exactly the point Morris was making about the appropriate use of technology. Unpolluting, smokeless furnaces and silently powered barges drift by almost unnoticed as a group of friends make their way gently along the Thames by rowing boat - another technology perfectly suited to their own immediate needs and fancies.The power and beauty of Morris' novel does not lie simply in the descriptions of the material environment of its imaginary society. Morris' vision is never so shallow. He is concerned above all with the quality of life of its inhabitants and the forms of social organisation that bequeath them its benefits, and how this contrasts so starkly with the forces of coercion and seduction that govern our own society. The inhabitants that Morris describes with such convincing lucidity are nurtured in a social environment founded upon a resurgence of vernacular values and an abandonment of institutionalised forms of control and exploitation. The fire of Morris' polemic being eloquently voiced through the dialogues of old Hammond in the heart of the novel.If you are interested in a serious and profound analysis of our own society and the development of a saner view of the world then News from Nowhere will provide you with many pertinent insights. A testimony to the prescience of his vision, written as it was almost one hundred years before the environmental revolution in thinking that swept the world in the late 1980's and beyond, Morris provides us here with a very timely view of an alternative future to that promised by our own society, leading us as it is towards the brink of ruinous global turmoil.This long neglected novel won't fail to move the hearts of a new generation of readers who may be disillusioned with a life of stifling employment and meaningless industrial consumption."},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"\\"News from Nowhere\\" is a Utopian fantasy in strong reaction against the Industrial (factory) Capitalism of the time (1890s England).It's like a cross between \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"Gulliver's Travels.\\" William, the hero, goes to sleep in 1890s England (the powerhouse of rapacious Industrialism and Imperialism) and wakes up in a post-2000 England, where Industrialism is gone, and life is like heaven.How has all this happened? Simple. People have given up the Ethic of Scarcity mentality, which says \\"Let him who does not work not eat\\"--which turns life into never-ending toil. And they have turned to an Ethic of \\"Follow Your Bliss.\\"This, naturally, has destroyed Industrial (factory) capitalism.Morris believed that Industrial (factory) Capitalism, with its fierce division of labor and assembly-line techniques--although very efficient--was grotesque and dehumanizing. Like Marx, he believed that such a system turned workers into mere components of the machine--mechanical and highly expendable.For workers, it made life repetitive and soul-killing (and body-killing) drudgery. And for consumers, it turned out floods of shoddy assembly-line trash--\\"goods\\" that were hardly good at all but unesthetic, cheap, throwaways.Morris realized that Industrialism had traded quality for quantity, and it had given the wrong answer to Jesus' question, \\"What profiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\"(Sound familiar? It is precisely what we have now.)He wanted to change all that. And unlike the Marxian socialists, Morris did not see the factory system as inevitable.He favored a more anarchist type of socialism.In \\"News from Nowhere\\"--in the TRULY brave new world he envisions--there is no government (because people are quite capable of governing themselves and reaching mature agreements), there are no schools (because people instinctively learn what is useful and what interests them), and most of all there is no work, in the sense of toil and drudgery (because people do what they like, out of their own artistic gifts and interests).As a result, people like their lives and they like other people. They are happy, and as a consequence healthy. They make things and do things not for profit but because they like doing them--and in the grand scheme of things, all necessary and beautiful things get done.This is a marvelously charming book, and presents the (quite achievable) Anarchist Paradise in simple and concrete terms."},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"Yes, I mean that with a capital S. The title story, \\"News from Nowhere\\", is a Socialist Utopia like Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward.\\" In fact, Morris wrote an intro to Bellamy's brief book, and criticized it (gently) for not going far enough.Morris' view of that happy future occupies about half of this thick compilation. It is an incredible Eden, where hale, hearty, and lovely people swing into everything with the greatest gusto. Morris' character, the Guest, arrives just when everyone is falling over themselves to row upstream for the privelege of baling hay. Through some Socialist magic, everyone has become beautiful, intelligent, and youthful. In fact Ellen, who takes a shine to the Guest, has such \\"beauty and cleverness and brightness\\" (her own words, p.223) that she lives out of town to avoid causing a ruckus among the young bucks there.Outside of everyone's passion for good, hard labor (with the fear of some future shortage of sweaty work to go around), 'Nowhere' is most notable for the changes it has wrought on the English countryside. Since government no longer serves a Socialist need, the old trappings of power have been torn down. The one exception is the old Parliament building, which now serves as the transfer station between the producers of manure and its consumers - with a clear implication that little has changed.Exchange of manure is about the most sophisticated social interaction, since Morris declares that \\"this is not an age of inventions. The last epoch did all that for us,\\" (p.192) and they let more of the old knowledge slip away every year. Instead, his healthy and pastoral people work for love of work, and infuse some vague sense of art into whatever it was they were going on about. Issues of medical care are waved away under their general shiny health, despite the fact that pastoral, non-technological people filled their graveyards with women dying in childbirth.The other half of this book is divided between a number of essays and lectures, most of which extol the Socialist ethos. About 120 pages of \\"Lectures\\" discuss design, and some few - with gritted teeth - acknowledge that science may deserve to exist. Yes, he tolerates those people in whom the desire to know burns most brightly. Mostly, however, \\"science\\" is something good for cleaning flue gas so the rural colors may shine more brightly.Morris was a visionary. He was also a brilliant and driven man, a skilled artisan, and eloquent writer. Unfortunately, he was born into a good-sized estate, so never had to pay all that much attention to the fussy bits of how people put the bread on their tables. The disconnect between his plenty and the majority's need is painfully apparent, but not to himself.The best-reasoned essay of the lot was the last, on the founding philosophy of his Kelmscott Press. He explained, in concrete terms, how he decided on the principles of artisanship of printing, and goes into some detail about how well-made text should appear. Much of what he said made sense, and much of the rest could be confirmed or denied by printing up a few pages and seeing what worked - the essence of his reviled \\"science.\\"Morris had a fine and wide-ranging mind. This book shows many of its aspects, but also shows many of its failings. I was happier thinking of him only as the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"I suspect that many people who come across this book will be art lovers, specifically admirers of Art Noveau and perhaps even recent visitors to the exhibition of this particular form of turn-of-the-century expression at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. And this is, notwithstanding the prominence of the title story and Clive Wilmer's introduction, which focuses on the political aspects of Morris's writing, a book about the author's vision of beauty, of craftsmanship not for its own sake, but with the aim of producing work of skill and magnificence, and, as a secondary but vital consideration, the satisfaction of the artist. Morris comes across as a brilliant man, devoted to his many crafts (he taught himself thirteen) and passionate about human equality, though the impression from his writing is that the quality of the artist's skill, and particularly in the field of the decorative (what he calls the 'lesser') arts, matters more to him than the egalitarianism he trumpets. The political pieces, such as the title story, which comprises almost half the book and portrays Morris's vision of an ideal society in the year 2102, are the weakest, speculating as they do about a population of uniform mind in its espousal of the superiority of the Mediaeval ideal of art and its fanatical rejection of progress and technology. Genetics, the evolutionary territorial imperative, the diversity of human imagination which has since spawned the Information Age, are all swept aside by the juggernaut of Morris's Luddite, Gothic world-view (and although I accept the context in which he writes, namely late-Victorian London, I can't ignore his failure to mention the benefits of the industrialisation he despises, such as the increased life-expectancy, the majesty of the scientific leaps within his lifetime). Nonetheless, Morris is an inspiring polemicist: his rejection of the State, his fierce and uncompromising belief in his ideas, his utterly convincing support for the rightness of the individual's potential for common-sense and ability to recognise what is good, what is true, in the face of the pronouncements of authority, mark him as a defender of freedom quite apart from many of his orthodox Marxist contemporaries."},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"Morris' dream was that the divisions between work, life and art would blur. He believed that industrial consumerism led to toil, inequality, environmental destruction and inferior products. He also insisted--in contradistinction to Edward Bellamy--that \\"the true incentive to useful and happy labour is and must be pleasure in the work itself\\" and that a free society is one where \\"the unit of administration [is] small enough for every citizen to feel himself responsible for its details, and be interested in them; that individual men cannot shuffle off the business of life on to the shoulders of an abstraction called the State, but must deal with it in conscious association with each other\\". I think his ideas are as important today as they were at the end of the 19th century."},{"Title":"News From Nowhere and Other Writings","review":"It is easy to find great dystopian novels, but I wanted to read an utopian novel. I was a bit disappointed. It fell a little flat and it probably had to do with it being written in 1890. William Morris was disgusted by the industrial revolution and the poor social and environmental ills that manifested from it, so he attempted to write about a world that reverted back to an agrarian life. I just thought it was a bit of a cop out. I would rather read about a utopian novel where the people achieved some sort of enlightenment and learned moderation or something than to completely do away with technology all together. I don't see modernization as evil it is the people and how they choose to use it that creates the problem. I think my favorite utopian novel remains a book I read as a child, The 21 Balloons by William P&egrave;ne du Bois."},{"Title":"Spend Game (Lovejoy Mystery)","review":"Having read three other Lovejoy mysteries, Spend Game is far superior to the others (which are still quite good). The English physician who writes under the pen name of Jonathan Gash is a potent combination of having a vast knowledge of antiques and English life. Writing in the first person, as all Lovejoy mysteries are, is challenging, yet &quot;Gash&quot; does it so well. Spend Game starts with lots of action (Lovejoy sees a friend murdered in a staged car crash) and never lags a bit. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spend Game (Lovejoy Mystery)","review":"I sometimes think of Lovejoy, Gash's antiques-cum-detective, as the larcenous equivalent of Angela Lansbury's Murder She Wrote character. Which is to say that were either of them real, I wouldn't want to be a friend or relative for fear of being murdered or suspected of being a murderer. The problem is symptomatic of any mystery series in which the detective is anything but that by trade, as the writer tries to consistently involve the character in skullduggery.In this episode, an old war-buddy fellow dealer is bumped off only slightly before the book opens, and while Lovejoy witnesses the act, his tendency for self-preservation and the fact that he was currently involved in an adulterous tryst, prevents him from coming forward with what little information he could glean to the police. Of course, Lovejoy wouldn't trust the local constable to sneeze without some peppery remarks from his corner, and the rest of the book goes on like the usual, with Lovejoy achieving vengeance and satisfying his greed in roughly the same equal mixture.It's not so much Gash's plots that keep me reading these, but the pleasure of reading his undeniable joy in describing antiques and their history. I like to think of these books as much of an education in a subject that I know nothing about as much as pure entertainment."},{"Title":"Spend Game (Lovejoy Mystery)","review":"In this tale, our lovable scoundrel is on the hunt for a precious model of a Victorian steam engine, although he doesn't know that that is what he will find at the end of this particular rainbow. Along the way we, the readers, are exposed to some more Lovejoy cheek. What a lovable villain he is! The description of his past experience in a tunnel is very realistic, and we also discover why tunnels are a main phobia with him. The more we learn about Lovejoy, the better, I think. We know how much he loves his antiques and women, but there is more to the man than that. This is an exciting story, and we find Lovejoy up against some pretty shady characters in his unending pursuit of the perfect piece. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Spend Game (Lovejoy Mystery)","review":"When lovable rogue and slightly shifty antiques dealer, Lovejoy, hears of the model of a 19th century train, crafted by silversmiths, he decides that he must have it at all costs. The model is supposedly buried under tons of earth and rubble, following a huge cave-in in 1847 but Lovejoy's biggest problem is that he suffers from an acute terror of being buried alive, following a near miss experience in his army days, so the thought of having to burrow underground is as bad a situation that he can imagine. As usual, Lovejoy is in a fine old mess with all of his lady friends, and uses them, one against the other in his quest for the engine. He is also even more embattled than usual by crooks and paid thugs and takes a severe hiding, pursued as ever by the local police. It's a real action story, full of fun and dodgy escapades but one which will be irresistible to Lovejoy's many fans."},{"Title":"The Trail To Tranquility","review":"This is really a great book.

It lends itself so well to introspection, discussion and practical application. All of us have benefited tremendously. Our self-awareness and our anger management skills have grown to the point where we all have experienced significant behavioral change and, equally important, a change in the way we react emotionally to the stresses and triggers in our lives. Rabbi Brody tells stories to offer graphic metaphors and images to the reader, making each point that much more accessible. He clearly links emotional management to spiritual development, showing the reader how to reach higher levels of inner peace that will ultimately be reflected in calmer behavior. It's important to read the book slowly and really absorb what he is saying, aiming to apply it to ones own thoughts, feelings and actions. I particularly appreciate the depth of spirituality in this book.

I must admit that I had not heard of most of the names. I was surprised to read of how many black men had served as deputy United States Marshals in this region before statehood.The author seems to have done extensive research on the subjet, and quotes regularly from newspaper articles and other writings from the late 1800's and early 1900's."},{"Title":"Black, Red and Deadly: Black and Indian Gunfighters of the Indian Territory, 1870-1907","review":"I first read this book when I was doing graduate work at the University of Central Oklahoma.

The four appendices alone (transaction cost economics, game theory, agency theory and market signaling) are worth the price of the book.Third, they avoid the trap of &quot;best practice&quot;, where an author looks at a few successful firms (GE? PepsiCo? 3M?) and encourages others to imitate them. In contrast, this book offers clues to creating real and inimitable competitive advantage from a company's human resource management.The entire treatment is readable and rich in cases."},{"Title":"Strategic Human Resources: Frameworks for General Managers","review":"Baron &amp; Kreps write with wit &amp; grace, pulling together a vast amount of literature to make their point that human resource management is critical to a firm's success. In every chapter, they get to the point quickly, writing for students in a way that faculty will appreciate. They retain the essence of the academic research on which their principles are based, while focusing on what it all means for managers. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Strategic Human Resources: Frameworks for General Managers","review":"To get an idea what this text is about if you are an economist, or an economics student, start your reading in chapter 4 Employment and Economics. There you will realise that almost nothing you learned as an undergrad in economics - demand and supply, consumer optimization, neoclassical cost functions, monopoly oligopoly and competitive industries - will prepare you for understanding employment relationships. But the economics for which Oliver Williamson just got his Nobel prize will matter - and Kreps and Baron are wonderful expositors of this sort of economic theory....not in the abstract, but applied to employment relationships/transactions.Employment is often an open-ended transaction, with the detail specified only as time passes (after the transaction has been entered into) and relevant contingencies arise - salaries/commissions in years ahead, future promotion prospects, future job assignments, etc. Just how these details are filled in depends on a system of interlocking factors and behaviors: decision making rights and privileges specified in law (common law or legislation or both), by explicit, but incomplete, contractual details, and most importantly by tradition and common practices that have evolved with some history. But why do these customs have any force? Why does anyone believe them? Well one problem in an employment relationship, on either or both employer and employee sides, is that as time passes and the relationship matures both parties may face large costs of switching to alternatives - alternative jobs, or alternative workers. Replacing and retraining skilled knowledgeable workers may be costly, especially if it has to be done quickly in a time of high product demand - and those workers may know that; Finding alternative jobs with comparable pay and with comparable skills in alternative locations may be costly for workers - and employers may know that. So each is very aware that the other party to the transaction might act opportunistically to extract something from them - either or both parties can get very worried about \\"hold-ups\\". So how does one protect against hold-ups when efficiency in employment depends on being able to adapt flexibly as well as to have workers and employers invest specifically in one another - ie in the joint enterprise - since this makes you even more exposed to hold-ups. The answer - ie the needed protections - lie in the phenomena of \\"reputations\\". These reputation systems rely on history, culture (internal and external), customs, traditions, and shared beliefs expectations. Kreps and Baron are masterful analysts of the conditions under which reputations can, can't, and might be relied upon to offer guarantees.A long way from demand and supply , non? And much more interesting.So in the res t of the book your are going to have some amazing new insights - and examples - about internal promotion ladders, recruitment , retention, incentives, performance evaluation, performance pay, job design, unions, etc...all based on this new transactions costs theory of behaviour, and all richly and amply illustrated by many fascinating examples.

Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you or me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good- natured faces, and a laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).Many people say they prefer the hobbit to the Lord Of The Rings for two simple reasons.1) It is easier to read and a lot less complicated.2) It has a better story line.The hobbit is absoulutely fantastic!

The illustrations are wonderful, representing interpretations of Tolkien's text from a wide variety of cultures, and the annotations, while not providing knowledge vital to understanding \\"The Hobbit,\\" are interesting.Before reading &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; those fresh from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" should know in advance, the tone here is much lighter than the \`trilogy.' The writing is very much meant for children. That doesn't mean an adult can't enjoy this - adults read Harry Potter, after all - just that this is not cut from the same mold as \\"Rings.\\" Be prepared to read a children's book, because that's what this is.For those willing to plunge into children's fantasy, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a pure delight. Bilbo Baggins, a homebody of a hobbit (a small humanlike creature), is pulled into an adventure with a wizard, Gandalf, and a group of dwarves. Their quest is to venture across dangerous mountains and dark forests to reclaim treasure stolen by a terrible dragon, Smaug.What follows is a series of adventures that have our heroes meeting trolls, goblins, wolves, giant spiders, elves and more. Each encounter is an adventure unto itself, with a thrilling climax that leads us to the next. The adventure is nonstop. Each chapter brings a new discovery.Fans of Middle Earth will find plenty to enjoy here. We see our first glimpses of Gollum and the One Ring. Elrond appears in Rivendell. We hear about Middle Earth's ancient lore, see the origins of famous swords like Sting, and meet dwarves who play a part in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The cross references will bring a smile to your face and will enhance your enjoyment of the famous trilogy. Just be prepared for the light, brisk tone.For those looking to explore Tolkien's world or simply looking for a good children's fantasy, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a no brainer. This Annotated Edition would make an especially nice gift for ardent Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent book.

If you have a kid in third grade, you MUST buy them this book (paperback, though, cause I wouldn't trust them to haul around an e-reader). Every kid deserves to have The Hobbit as part of their childhood."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the introduction to the brilliance of Tolkien and the wonderful world of Middle Earth. The development of Bilbo, and his supporting cast, draw the reader into their lives and adventures like no other fantasy ever written. With the addition of the Lord of the Rings, often mistakenly listed as a trilogy (it was originally written as one book with three parts), the world of Middle Earth continues to evolve and grow, and fall into greater turmoil. Tolkien creates characters and societies with real prejudices, fears, mistrust, and needs that the perceptive reader can readily identify with and understand. If I was to own but two works of fiction, the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings would comprise my collection."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien paints a very colorful picture of the Shire in this first book. I think (and if you read Tolkien's biography), that Tolkein started this prequil to the Lord of the Rings triliogy in a state of lymbo. Tolkien wanted to write this book (or story as it started out) in a manner so that his children could enjoy it. Nevertheless, when this story was started, many read it and were impressed by the imaginative descriptions that are in the book. People took interest, and the rest, they say, is history. Tolkien's character developments of both Bilbo and Gandalf seemed to be in this book, quite a bit more shallow then they later appeared in the following Lord of the Rings books. Tolkein had no idea where he was going with these books, and probably didn't even slightly consider the probility of continuing the Middle-Earth saga after the advent of the first book. Thus, as a result, Tolkein takes each character in the rest of the trilogy, and delves deep into the workings of their minds. Thus, the overall story turns into something epic, rather than your average fight-the-dragon-and-go-home-with-the-gold-later type of story. Tolkien was surely a master wordsmith, and will probably be considered for the rest of time. And only through Tolkien's imignation and variety do we get a great work like that of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have noticed that the people who have given this book a bad name have either had the book forced upon them by a teacher or just simply tried to be smart-asses. Like them, I guess you could say I too had the book 'forced' upon me by a teacher, but unlike them I thought that it was a god damn MASTERPIECE. I cannot believe how cold some people can be. It makes the rest of us, who have worshipped this book, feel really down to see people sink to such deph's. I hope they realize that The Hobbit was written by one of the greatest writers of our time. It is a book that will be rememberd for generations to come and all the people who spat on J.R.R Tolkiens work will be long forgotten. To anyone who is reading this message, pay no attention to those kind of people. Do not let them make you think differently about The Hobbit.

High adventure for readers of any age awaits in these pages. An example, from my dog eared copy: While seeking shelter in a cave from a storm, Bilbo &quot;dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping--beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to. At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size. Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say 'rocks and blocks.' There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two for Bilbo; and they were grabbed and carried through the crack before you could yell 'tinder and flint.'&quot; The Hobbit is unparalleled as a fantasy children's book, and is adored by adults as well.

He intends fully on fullfilling this lifestyle, until one day a party of treasure hunters show up at his door and he is pulled into the adventure of a lifetime. This is an absolute fabulous fantasy book! Bilbo is one of the most likeable, (yet unlikely) heroes of all times! There are also many other fun characters, like Smog the dragon, Gollum and his &quot;precious&quot;, and the dwarf treasure seekers. J.R.R. Tolkien is truly the master of the old time fantasy"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Nice version of the story. It was difficult to find the basic Hobbit book since most of the selections revolved around the recent movie. We must remember to keep the classics available to readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With Peter Jackson's movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, due to hit the theaters next weekend, I thought I'd do some homework and re-read the book.Normally I don't re-read books, because there's so many other stories I have yet to discover. Until now, I've only re-read two other tales, which were also in response to upcoming movie buzz: Starship Troopers and Lord of the Rings (which I count as one story).In this case, the version I chose to read was Douglas A. Anderson's The Annotated Hobbit, my sister gave me years ago. I first read The Hobbit way-back-when in junior high school and it was my first introduction to high fantasy literature. While I remembered the basic plot and all the major characters, there were a lot of details I've forgotten.Like The Hobbit was written for children in the UK back in 1937 (and was published a year later in the US). While the book is narrated as if it is being read aloud to children, the storyline is certainly one adults of all ages have enjoyed through the years--and continue to do so.This annotated version is especially interesting and helpful. There is a 28-page Introduction, which includes a short bio of J.R.R. Tolkien and a publishing history of the book (which makes up the bulk of the intro), along with some anecdotes on such things as runes and other mythological reference material.The narrative of The Hobbit itself is sandwiched between Anderson's copius footnotes. These sidebars contain information ranging from 1-sentence definitions to historical, literary and philological information, which can run for two or more pages.At first I was determined to read every footnote, so I could later brag about my scholarly knowledge of Middle Earth lore and Real Earth publishing history. But alas; I grew weary of having to step out of the story to read the sidebar stuff. So I limited my note-reading to only those items that interested me--and were a few sentences long. If I really need to know a piece of Tolkien trivia, I can look it up later."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased The Hobbit for Kindle since the movie is coming out, and it's been years since I've read it.

Take the Hobbit with you wherever you go."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"SummaryBilbo Baggins is comfortable in his snug, happy hobbit-hole in the side of a hill where he has lived all his life. One morning after a hearty breakfast, the wizard Gandalf arrives, and that's when the trouble begins. Gandalf ends up inviting a flummoxing total of twelve dwarves over for tea the next day. The dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the glory and riches once held by their forefathers, but they need a \\"burglar\\" to help, and hobbits are small, stealthy creatures.Bilbo joins their party on a whim after being teased by the dwarves and praised by Gandalf for his yet-unknown abilities. He soon regrets his decision when the rolling fields past his home turn into a dark, foreign country, and he doubts that he has what it takes to carry out an adventure of this magnitude.As Bilbo meets (and is captured by) trolls, goblins, wolves, spiders, and wood-elves, he begins to use his practicality to his advantage; when engaged in riddles with Gollum under the mountain, for instance, his wit saves him from a very unfortunate end. And he puts his riddling skill to use with Smaug the Dragon as well, using their conversation as a chance to scope out the dragon's weakness.Happy scenes are interspersed throughout the tale to keep Bilbo from despairing entirely; they rest at the Last Homely House as the guest of a friendly elf, the noble eagles of the mountain come to their rescue more than once; they find a faithful friend in Beorn, who is usually gruff and wary of visitors; and the men of Lake-town herald their arrival to oust Smaug the Dragon from the dwarves' ancestral mountain.But more often than not--and certainly more than he would like!--it is small, hearth-loving Bilbo who ends up saving the day, when he and his friends are faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Bilbo grows from a homebody to a hero with \\"a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck.\\"AnalysisThe Hobbit is one of the best books I've read all year.I know. I know! People have told me all my life that I need to read The Hobbit. But I always protested, claiming that I didn't like fantasy because there wasn't enough reality in it to \\"connect\\" to. Where I got this idea, I don't know--possibly from my brothers' fantastical explanations of Tolkien's books, which sounded far too removed from me to be interesting.As it turns out, The Hobbit is so widely regarded by readers of all stripes because of its humanity, its down-to-earth humor, and its realism. Who would've thought? (Everyone but me, I suppose.)As Michael D.C. Drout explains in The Modern Scholar: Rings, Swords, and Monsters: Exploring Fantasy Literature, applying Marxist theory to the story helps to understand its appeal: Bilbo represents the bourgeoisie, the trolls are members of the Cockney-accented working class, and Smaug the Dragon is the ruling class, literally rolling in riches. Tolkien himself was certainly no stranger to literature and theory, with a history of Anglo-Saxon epic poem translation under his belt. He incorporates themes common to Middle Age conquests while also sprinkling the book with a healthy dose of modern-day humor.Bilbo is an unexpected hero, the everyman who saves the day more than once. Though often he seems primarily occupied with eating breakfast, maintaining a tidy appearance, and yearning for his soft bed far from these dangerous adventures, he keeps a cool head when he and the dwarves seemed faced with certain doom. In fact, Bilbo's practical considerations are often what save them; while the dwarves stubbornly refuse to tell the Elf-King the purpose of their quest, which leads to their imprisonment, Bilbo cleverly rescues them, though his unorthodox methods produce more than a few grumbles among the dwarves.Bilbo is an incredibly likeable character with whom I can closely identify; who doesn't love a second breakfast? On a deeper level, Bilbo's moral ambiguity makes him a realistic hero; when he is bargaining with the men and the elves that are preparing to battle against the dwarves, who have become offensively greedy, he begins by complaining that the entire matter has made him uncomfortable and cranky, and he offers goods stolen from the dwarves to appease the other side.The Hobbit originated as a story Tolkien told his children, and the excellent narrative style and the thrilling twists and turns took me back to the days when my parents would read me bedtime stories. I felt like running from the hulking, humped figures of the goblins, and I shivered at the enormous hairy spiders of Milkwood Forest.Because of its intensely imaginative plot and Tolkien's masterful literary execution, The Hobbit is one of those few books that are equally attractive to kids and adults alike. But you probably already knew that!For more reviews like this one, please visit [...]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My son(9) received this as a gift from my best friend when he starred as Bilbo (the hobbit) in a dramatic version of this book.

I recommend this book to \\"kids\\" of all ages, especially boys. I recommend this edition to anyone wanting a special copy of this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I hadn't read the Hobbit since sometime in the mid 80's. After watching the Peter Jackson LOTR films, and reading news about Guilermo Del Toro filming the Hobbit I felt the need to re connect with Mr Baggins. I picked up THIS version of a beloved classic. I should mention, that to re read the Hobbit I bought THIS version, leaving my old paperback on the shelf in the closet. This book is simply a treasure, and easily is the perfect adventure story. This is the reason why I wanted to read this anniversary edition of the story, I thought it deserved special attention.The story is great adventure, with Tolkiens ideas layed out in fantastic detail. There are parts of this book, that made me laugh out loud (such as when the Dwarfs yell out at giants playing 'ball' by throwing rocks back and forth during a thunderstorm) and tender moments such as (when Bilbo takes a final look at the lonely mountain to say farewell to the final resting place of three of the dwarfs ) this also marks the end of Bilbo's adventure.Other fantasy characters seemed influenced by Tolkiens writings. Beorn who is a shape shifting wood dweller, more than reminds me of Hagrid from Harry Potter. Hagrid size and nature of how he lives is very similar to Beorn. I cant go on about alot of things in The Hobbit, this review could be as long as the book.Anyway I give the highest recommendation to The Hobbit. A great story by a great writer. Sit down and enjoy the writing of a brilliant author, and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read quite a few reviews here that seem to assume that you (the reader), are well versed in the Lord of the Rings series.Simply put, this book, when compaired to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, almost seem like they were written by two entirely different authors. Perhaps that's why this book is one of my favorites.The Hobbit is a children/young adult novel telling the tale of a small, unlikely hero named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo, known as a \\"Hobbit\\", is elected to play the role of burgler and help a hand full of bearded dwarves reclaim there stolen treasure from the dreaded dragon, Smaug.There are a few things to keep in mind. For one, this book was written well over half a centry ago. The english language has changed a bit over the ages it seems, and perhaps the age range it had been intended for then, will have a little trouble getting through it in our day and age.The second, as mentioned above, is that this book is not wholy in the theme of the Lord of the Rings trilogies. The narration is much more light hearted, even humerous at times. Personally, I argue that this is where the Lord of the Rings failed, with its dry, history text like narration. With the Hobbit, we get the feel of sitting around an old arm chair, while Old man Tolkien gets into his adventure, playing out the roles of the characters, and making the sound effects himself. Simply put... it \\"READS\\" a lot more fun.The Hobbit is also a little different from the Lord of the Rings as it takes the world around it at face value. A few things are explained in great detail, while most of the world at large is only breifly explained. Some people would prefer a greater detail into the world that Tolkien has created. Not all people, however, want a 4 page description on ever characters lineage, or every cities history. For those people, good new, tolkien has a near unlimited amount of text on his invention. For every one else, this book flows a little smoother than some of his other works.I will say that a lot of new readers are turned off by the first chapter. There is a lot of exposition, and it containt a lot of information that won't really make sense to new tolkien readers. My advice, is to push through. The book really picks up, and is one of the most magical, wonderful reads you'll ever get through."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In case this review gets listed for other editions (which sometimes happens) the aisn of the book I am reviewing is 0395177111.This book has a sturdy dark green slipcase with a stylized illustration on the front that looks like one of Tolkien's own drawings of a mountain in the background of a forest. The book cover is slightly fancier than the slipcase and has red and gold letters/language symbols surrounding the illustration repeated from the slipcase. The spine also has beautiful lettering. The book is very substantial and large (1.5 x 7 x 9.5). The text is not too small. The edges of the pages are a mottled green and white color. The book include maps in both front and back, front is a journey/adventure map, back is a geographic map. This is a lovely addition to my Tolkien collection and I am thrilled to have it. The red collectible The Lord of the Rings book is a nice companion to this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not a literary review, this is about the edition/printing only.This is a great paperback. I bought it because it was economical, but ended up enjoying it because it is of exceptional quality. This is NOT a mass-market, stiff as a board, tiny font, drug-store printing. This is a book with sturdy binding and thick matte paper with pleasantly large font type. While it doesn't lay flat on a table when open, it is very easy to hold open in one hand. I love hardbacks, but this paperback was a purchase I do not regret.GREAT BOOK, MEMORABLE JOURNEY WITH UNIQUE CHARACTERS, AND A TOTALLY RECOMMENDED EDITION."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by Tolkien is most definitely one of the best books ever. My Dad first read it to me when I was probably only 7, and I know I will still love it when I'm 100.The edition itself is amazing. The illustrations are by Tolkien, as they should be. The best illustrations in any book are either by the author or by someone the author personally chooses, because the reader can be sure that everything is illustrated as the author imagined it. Many times when an author illustrates his own book, the art is not the best quality, but not in this case. Tolkien was a great and creative artist in addition to being one of the best authors of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our 10 year old and 7 year old sons and their mum are really enjoying this recording every time we get in the car.

Tolkien is one of the great writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Got this for my Xoom. I love being able to read one of my favorite childhood books again.

I was never really familliar with his work and didn't become interested in it until the movie releases of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Tolkien originally intended this to be a children's book, but it can easily be enjoyed by readers of any age. I have heard some people say they find it hard to read, but I've never had any trouble with it. As for this particular version of the book, it is easily my favorite. The gold inscription around the front cover is a very nice touch and it goes well with the green. It contains 8 illustrations and two maps which are all colored in black and green rather then the original black and white illustrations. There are also four color plates (colored illustrations) that are in full color. The binding is nice and sturdy and the printing is perfectly clear. It comes with a slip case that compliments the already great look of the book.

A Great Product at a Great Price!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dragons, elves, wizards, and dwarves are just a few of the magical creatures you will meet in J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit. Like all hobbits, he has a passion for clothes, food, bright colors (chiefly yellow and green), and second breakfast. And like all hobbits, he wants to be left alone in quiet comfort, not bothered by great, big, stupid people like you or me. However, one good morning Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf who is accompanied by thirteen homeless dwarves. The dwarves have been informed by the clever Gandalf that Bilbo is a burglar and that he can prove extremely useful on an adventure they have undertaken to recover their stolen gold and homes from the evil dragon, Smaug. Through their perilous journey they face blood thirsty wargs (wolves), horrible orcs (goblins), giant spiders, and many other unknown dangers in the dreary, mysterious forest of Mirkwood. Bilbo does end up making a spanking good burglar and despite his reluctantly nervous behavior at times, he saves his companions on more than one occasion. Finally, the fourteen companions make it to the Lonely Mountain, and it is Bilbo, unaided and on his own, who confronts Smaug, \\"the terror of a countryside\\". After the dwarves have regained their treasure, they become slightly greedy and refuse to share it with anyone else. This greed leads to the tragic demise of the Dwarf Lord and the beginning of The Fellowship of the Rings. As the Dwarf Lord dies, his dying words to Bilbo are very significant to note as they are the theme of the book-\\"There is more in you of good than you know...If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story was written by J.R.R.Tolkein as merely a bedtime story for children. But then he wrote further, resulting into one of the great epic of the world, The Lord of the Rings.The story tells us about the very first adventure of Bilbo Baggins out of shire and he got the Ring. After reading LoTR, I thought this story wont impress me much, but I was wrong. I was totally lost in this story as I was in LoTR's. It is a part of LoTR and a standalone story both. I loved Bilbo as much as I loved Frodo, infact, more than Frodo.The difference between other authors and Tolkein is that Tolkein wrote like he was actually telling the story himself and didnt write it just as a book or novel. You're sure to get lost in his world and feel yourself with the characters.Making a journey to Middle-Earth is one of the few good things you'll do in your life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you seen the movies called The Lord Of The Rings Parts 1-3? Well, then you would like The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit is where The Lord Of The Rings all began. In the fantasy world of The Hobbit the reader gets attached to the crazy characters through the eye of the narrator.The Hobbit's time period is the ancient time between the age of the faerie and the time of men. The Hobbits are little people with brown curly hair who wear bright colors. They live in hills and green lands and live near water. Bilbo Baggins was a respected member of the Hobbits.The story began when Bilbo is craving for adventure. Bilbo gets along with people and he has a funny side to him. Bilbo is a good character who is very nice to the people around him.Here are some reasons why you would enjoy The Hobbit. The book's characters are lively and funny. There are goblins who are not smart. There is adventure and mystery in the book. There are dark caves and different types of people like elves, Hobbits, and goblins. This book is a fantasy book that is a good fantasy book.J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the best twentieth century authors. Tolkien's writing is funny and his charters seem to have a real life. Some of his quotes are funny like\\"Don't be a fool Mr.Baggins if you can help it.\\" I thought that the book was enjoyable and funny. I would recommend this book to fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"for me, this is a very enjoyable dramatization indeed. True, elderly, humorless, die hard Tolkein fans will probably find it corny - it was, a bit. Sometimes the sound effects are strange and laughable, but what's wrong with laughing? Given that it was recorded nearly 20 years ago you have to give it some leeway for less than perfect sound affects. For the most part I thought the acting was brilliant (save Gandalf, perhaps, whose voice might have better belonged to a man hawking fake Rolexes in central park), especially Bilbo. So, take my advice and give this recording a chance. My guess is you'll have more fun listening to this than listening to a bland but accurate unabridged reading of The Hobbit. Btw, if you have children and want to introduce them to Tolkein, but are reluctant to lay the whole epic at their feet quite yet, this would ideal for them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's hard to say why I never read the Hobbit before the age of 36. I was a sci-fi fan that dabbled in fantasy. I even played Dungeons and Dragons, but did so with an ignorance of its Tolkien roots. And no surprise, I had friends that were heavily into Tolkien as well.And then I saw Lord of the Rings...The Hobbit is an amazing read, telling the tale of a Mr. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire who cares little for adventures until Gandalf...Gandalf! ...arrives at his door. Soon Bilbo is swarmed by dwarves, and battles the uncertainty about his thieving skills by committing to join them and steal the treasure of the deadly Dragon Smaug.From this point we are launched into a fascinating tale filled with wondrous creatures and places, including the finding of the Ring, and end up with a multi-race epic battle.The Hobbit is a classic...there is no doubt, but what kept me from reading it all these years? I think the fact that many from my generation equated the Hobbit with the (often) geeky Dungeons and Dragons crowd.Whatever your reason for not reading the Hobbit, I ask you to reconsider. No avid reader, no matter what genre they favor, should have a book collection devoid of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The clarity of this audio version was absolutely wonderful.

The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins and we follow his adventures as he journeys to the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves.It is a tale where Bilbo discovers that adventures aren't so bad after all, and the Dwarves discover that there is more to Mr. Baggins than meets the eye. Although the Lord of the Rings is a sequel of sorts to the Hobbit, the Hobbit is a children's book and is written in a much different style than LOTR."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just got done reading this. I loved this book! It's got moments when it's adventurous (?), funny, sad, and moments when these elements are mixed. Some people complain about how 'bilbo gets out of stuff to easy'. They obviously zoned out some when they missed Tolkien reminding us that Bilbo's luck was very high. Very interesting. Pulls you in once they actually begin their adventure.An interesting read. Five outta five! :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are looking for a good Fantasy story for the kids this Christmas, you would do very well in choosing The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Mostly, this is because of the way in which details are presented and built into the proceedings in a clever yet uncomplicated fashion, which adds a lot of variety to the reading experience.The start of the book is somewhat simplistic because of the writing style, but this passes after the first couple of chapters, and develops into writing as sophisticated as the best of those writing Fantasy today. And it is surprising how much of the book is used by others for their own creations.The Hobbit is also a good choice for those intending to read the Lord of the Rings, since Ganadalf and Bilbo feature extensively in both books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I found the Hobbit and Trilogy of the Rings to be the most fantastic books I have read.

The Hobbit itself is a great read-aloud story and some of the annotations are surprising and interesting... but the mundane and boring annotations really weigh the book down compared to the annotations in Alice or Fairy Tales."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" by JRR TOLKIENTolkien never lived to see the glorious acceptance of his labor of love, but it is as though the story poured forth directly from his heart into the hearts of a public much in need in a reaffirmation of the values we all share with his little people of the Shire: Food, presents, pipe and bowl, and tales of adventures to warm cozy evenings by a fire with tea and cakes. Somewhere, in Tolkien's heaven, his heart has rest, for all of this joy given cannot go unrewarded.I feel that Tolkien showed us, through various races which peopled his Middle Earth, the various phases of human development. The races are earthy, airy, watery, and finally, fiery. The amazing Hobbits seemed to hold the balance necessary. They valued gold without greed, friends without demanding power over others, and family lineage, wherein even those of a \\"Tookish\\" nature could find acceptance in a neighborhood. Fundamentally, they were farm folk and tradesmen. One cannot help but observe there was a minimum of financiers in the Shire. Everybody works in the Shire, and elsewhere in Middle-Earth, soldiering is seen.Only a children's story? A book for children of all ages is more the case. Though the story originated in the childhood imagination of Tolkien on the foggy downs of England, it shows us a very subtle construction, a woven fabric of esotericism. At the pinnacle of the weave is the great advancement of the Wizards. Wizards have every opportunity to develop as Gandalf, full of fiery power, yet ever-vigilant and self-sacrificing; yet, as we are later to learn, sometimes they become susceptible to selfishness, self-centeredness, and a megalomanical preoccupatin with EGO and power. Wizards can fall from the grace which elevated them.Essential to all understanding of the adventures of the Hobbit is the fact that Bilbo Baggins does not like adventures at all. When Gandalf chooses Bilbo to host Thorin Oakenshield's party of Dwarves, Bilbo gives his opinion of Adventures thusly:\\"Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\"The excitement is infectious as the troop encounters many dangers, for not all problems can be solved by the powerful axes of the dwarves. Sometimes, only the peculiar stubborn courage of the little Hobbit can get the troop out of harm's way. All along the journey, wondrous creatures are met; Elves, Men, and dangerous things of darkness and shadow, ending with an encounter with a dragon.****So How Does Tolkien Write So Magically?****Tolkien compresses TIME. Alternatively, he decompresses TIME. He does this by presenting history, events, and other characters through a very childlike perception of time. Sometimes vast epochs are explained in a single paragraph, or several generations of Hobbit, Dwarf, Elven or Human history are presented in a blur. Chronological events and occurrances are alternatively slowed or speeded up in the telling. TIME is magical for Tolkien. The reader is captured and fascinated, led along a narrative path like a child, sometimes fully awake, observing a blur of rapid action. Other times, it is though the reader is in a half-sleep, a \\"dreamtime\\" and unsure of the measurements of minutes, hours, days, years and epochs of time.This \\"child-time\\" is the distinct voice Tolkien achieves, causing many readers to view the Hobbit as a children's story, distinct from Lord of the Rings. It is not a different story. It is that the Hobbit represents the psyche before it awakens. It's primary concerns are creature comforts, rather than adventures.In the Hobbit adventure, it is far too early to present the power of Tolkien's purpose in its full revelation. Tolkien must allow us to wake up gradually. That is the adventure he invites us to take. The fullness of the truth is not yet shown. Tolken needs for the reader to develop an adventurous spirit.This shows itself by comparing the Hobbits. First is Bilbo Baggins, who grows by every adventure; but for Bilbo, the Shire can still be a home, at least, for many more years. Second, Frodo never expects to return to the Shire. Frodo lives, believing that only death awaits him, but his childlike psyche is now transformed into that of a fully-developed spiritual identity. Now he knows. The childlike dreamworld is gone. If Frodo fails, he knows Middle Earth will fall into despair. Frodo knows, what Gandalf and Aragorn knows. Bilbo had the assurance that the Shire would always be there. Frodo sees that if he fails his quest, all of Middle Earth will literally fall under the Shadow. Frodo's is not the psyche of the child-like Hobbit.Tolkien's masterpiece has much in common with C. S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". In both, martyrdom of self is very real. In LOTR, Frodo willingly marches to his own death, obeying the call to duty which bound the Fellowship. This compels him to an ultimate act of self-sacrifice, just as Aslan in the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" orchestrates his own martyrdom, to save a Son of Adam.The same device may be found in the tale of \\"Peter Pan\\" who claimed that he never wanted to grow up, and yet he fought a very real evil in Captain Hook.Tolkien & Lewis seem to have offered a clarion call to man, inviting us to transcend the mere pursuit of comfort, and to enter into the conflict between Good and Evil. It is nearly impossible to claim either author as superior. They are both exceedingly good.With childlike wonder we learn in this dear tale a simple truth that we find in other literature; the simple fact that conflict is seldom far, and Evil is always to be countered with courage. The reader may not remember the name of he who slays the dragon Smaug, but does it matter? A little reflection upon the character GANDALF will reveal much. --Bruce Bain"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone and I am thrilled with it!

It gave a lot of insight to how the events surrounding the Lord Of The Rings novels came about. Having read those novels first, 'The Hobbit' answered alot of questions I had. For example; how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, how the red dragon was involved, the trolls and how they turned to stone. Confusion is gone, and there is more understanding about certain events and situations which take place.I feel it is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoyed the 'LOTR' novels and wish to discover more of the journeys which lead to those events taking place.

Gandalf is all knowing and knows that Bilbo is the hobbit for the job. Bilbo is reluctant but decides to go. He and Gandalf set out with thirteen dwarfs to retrieve an enormous treasure from the dragon Smaug which he stole from the dwarfs long ago. Bilbo faces many dangers along the way such as goblins, trolls, the infamous Gollum, and a couple of overgrown spiders. I have always enjoyed prequels because they show how everything got started. In this story, readers discover where Gandalf gets his magical sword Glamdring and Bilbo's, soon to be Frodo's, glowing dagger Sting. The most obvious is the bit about Bilbo and Gollum and how Bilbo obtained the one ring to rule them all. The narrator gives the story fairly light heartedly, so take it that way.

The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have \\"a really hard time proving themselves\\".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was the fist book that I read on my own as a child and it therefore holds a very special place in my heart. The story is not just an adventure story filled with magic and strange and wonderous creatures. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the gang of dwarves (Thorin Oakenshield, Kili, and Fili to mention a few) and their amazing journey to find the treasure guarded by the evil and selfish dragon Smaug. The story is a tale of self discovery, maturity and shows how much Bilbo Baggins changes as a man from the start till the finish. The descriptions used in the book are splendid and the small songs included add allot to the story (something I did not appreciate or understand as a child). I love the narration and I would recommend this splendid tale to not just fantasy fans but to anyone that fancies a good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the hobbit is one of the best books i've ever read. It was the first book that ever got me in to fantasy and i just loved it. I have read it many many times and it just gets better every time. I think everyone should read this book. So much happens in it and the story just keeps developing and going on. Its great!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is perhaps the best book of fantasy ever written. It combines timeless characters with an engaging plot to keep the reader interested at every point of the story. Many, if not all, fantasy books now published draw off of Tolkien's classic in one way or another. You will follow Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, and Thorin Oakenshield's band of dwarves on a journey through trolls, elves, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders, and a dragon not to be fooled with, to regain what is rightfully theirs (treasure beyond your imagination). Tolkien's wonderful descriptions of his characters and setting will suck you into the book, and the action/adventure will help you breeze through it (of course, limited use of Tolkien's fifteen invented languages helps too) Simply put: this book is great! No... better than great, superb! outstanding! Stupendous! Buy it! Rent it! Borrow it! JUST READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are between the ages of 12 and 3000 and you have not read this book you must do so now! This is for a variety of reasons. Even if you have no plans on reading the Lord of the Rings series (shame on you!) you should read this book. It is not long at all, roughly 300 pages, and every single one of those pages should be cherished for the rest of your life. All the characters will be loved all the way until the unexpected conclusion. The description is excellent. It doesn't spend 30 pages describing the way a rock has shine in the sun, (such as the owrks of T. Goodkind) but instead takes a surrounding as a whole and polishes it to shine like that rock.The bottom line: Read this now! If you plan on reading Lord of the Rings, you will need to or you won't understand much at all. Also, it is a great book on its own too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. I would recommend it to anyone form age 7 to 107.

If I were an artist, I would try to recapture the magic on canvas. Alas, I am a writer, and a mediocre one at that. Therefore, I can only try to tell you how delightful this tale is. As an adult who loves fantasy and science fiction, I was shocked when I realized that I had not yet read this tale. When I learned that a dear friend was reading it at bedtime to her first grader, I realized that I was long overdue. This is an amazingly delightful story. Aside from its tale, it looks at beings of different backgrounds and their conflicts. Not everything works out perfectly, and the ends don't always justify the means. However, the characters' characters grow, even when their stature does not. This story was written in the 1930s. Other than the lack of female characters, it is absolutely timeless and will still be popular a hundred or five hundred years from now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The introduction to the best story ever written, Lord of the Rings.

It had lots of those parts were you just can't stop reading the book. It has a really good ending. The author put a lot of surprising things in it that I don't want to give away. Mr. Blibo Bagens is my favorite person because he is a really kind hohbit. There is a movie on the hobbit at the library but the book is still a lot more detailed. Have fun reading! !"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first read The Hobbit I was 13 and although I did not fully understand everything and the language was not easy I loved it and finished it in a day. I could not put it down. Now I am older and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a must-read. This book appeals to a wide range of readers, whether they like a good cultural work, a story with lots of poetry, an action-packed novel, or even a novel that pays exclusive attention to details and character personalities! &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is all of those things, and much, much more. Whatever you pay for this book, it will still be a good buy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read The Hobbit about five times. Every time I read it I enjoy it tremendously and I take a deeper meaning from it. I've just finished reading it again and I think (if there is a message at all) that it is a message against vanity. Thorin immediately tells Bilbo he never wants to talk to him again when he finds out that he gave the Arkenstone to the other side. On his death bed, however, Thorin says Bilbo is as worthy of the treasure as he is. Bilbo and the Shire represent, in my mind, a happy people whose minds and desires have not been corrupted by the lure of wealth for its own sake. There are valuables within the Shire, sure, and people obviously want the nice things, but the main theme of the book to me seems to be that the Shire folk are not willing to risk their lives or dignity to get material things that they do not need.I've read hundreds of books and this is one of my all time favorites. If you have not yet read it I envy you for the experience you will have when you do."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, I very much liked the different style from the Lord of the Rings, and think that Tolkien did a great job of introducing the finding of the ring, and middle earth.The kindle version of this book is well done including the occasional images, and flow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent children's story, probably one of the finest ever written, and never condescending to the reader. Now, if this were intended as a story for adults, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but being that it was written as a children's book it warrants a 5 (and then some). If I had read this at a younger age I probably would have been moved to tears; as things go I first read it at 21 and still greatly enjoyed it, which should speak volumes as to its quality. There's much adventure, peril, and perseverance through camaraderie, and it's a treat to witness to Bilbo's slow transformation from timid homebody to valiant hero.Highly recommended. If you enjoy fantasy at all then this is a must-read. Of course, it's also a prequel of sorts to the darker, longer, and more mature \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but even judged on its own merits is still classic fantasy and deserving of a spot in every personal library."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is awesome.

A year later, something happened when I picked up the book again. It was magic. Either a certain maturity level or a certain sophistication is necessary to appreciate J.R. Tolkein's writing. When I was ready, the book was wonderful. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to teens, but I might caution them that even though it might not be for them a this moment, they should keep it in mind for a second try as they get older. That alone can pique their interest.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I LOVE The Hobbit. I can't emphasize that enough. Love love love it! Now that I have my over-exuberance out of the way, I'll get down to it. This is a great book for all ages, though most of the younger children might have difficulty understanding it. I read it by myself and thoroughly enjoyed it, and I later read it to my 10, 8, and 6 year old nieces and nephew. They all enjoyed it immensely, and my oldest niece and nephew read it on their own as well. This is the edition I bought for myself and the edition I bought for them as well, and I didn't see any problems with it. However, like I recommended on the Lord of the Rings trilogy I wrote a review on, if different editions are of concern to you, since there are so many editions, I recommend looking at it in a bookstore where you can feel it and look at it and see which edition you prefer, then buy it on Amazon as you are likely to get a better deal on here. And of course on the off chance it's a better deal in the bookstore, you're right there with it. But chances are you'll get it cheaper here. Still, if you're picky about binding, typeface, maps, glossaries, and yada yada, you should physically look at it first. If not, buy this one. I like the feel of the pages. They aren't all slick and smooth where you can't separate the pages well. They have a warm feel to them, which I love! And the pages are easy to turn."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As opposed to go on about different versions of The Hobbit publication, like some reviews obviously do, I am actually going to review The Hobbit book that includes illustrations from the 1977 animated movie, The Hobbit, by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass.Make note: this includes all the original text from Tolkien's wonderful book. It is not a publication of the Rankin-Bass film with its script and meager screen caps. And while this edition of The Hobbit does include some shots from the Rankin-Bass film, it is so much richer. This book includes concept art, art from the story boards and story treatments, character treatments. It even includes illustrations from the chapter \\"Queer Lodgings\\" and Bilbo's surrender of the Arkenstone, scenes which did not make it into the final cut of the Rankin-Bass film.Even if die-hard Tolkien fans had a grudge against the Rankin-Bass adaptation - and heaven knows, they and Tolkien himself have always been squeamish about talk of adaptations - I still highly recommend this edition as a must for any library and especially for aspiring illustrators and animators. Rankin-Bass Productions, Inc. were behind The Thundercats and the adaptations of The Last Unicorn and The Flight of Dragons. Their style is unique in an industry where nearly everyone, from DreamWorks to Warner Brothers, just can't shake that Disney style, even though Rankin-Bass did work under Disney's subsidiaries.In summation, Tolkien's text is happily preserved, and fans will get a behind-the-scenes view into the animated version of The Hobbit. This book is worth its weight in hoarded Dwarf gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have a few students who need this to help them read the novel.

I especially loved the drawings in the book which I am under the impression Tolkien did himself.Now I am reading The Lord of the Rings and I'll read the Silmarillian next.I am also going to look for other versions of The Hobbit that give more detailed explanations of the book's content and further insight into the story.

For those who read &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; in their English classes and were bored, I feel pity. It is obvious that these young readers did not understand a word that Tolkien wrote. &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; was the vehicle that launched the entire genre of fantasy, and when viewed with that in mind, it becomes evident as to why &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; has a great deal in common with many other works of fantasy. To put it plainly, other writers have taken Tolkien's ideas, and put them to their own use. For those who had difficulty with the place names, just remember that Tolkien was a master of the English language -- don't expect yourself to understand everything he wrote, especially if you're still learning about the language. If you are one of those who thought Tolkien's grammar poor, then... well, you're just wrong. You have to know the rules in order to break them well, and Tolkien most certainly knew the rules. Finally, for those who simply found &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; boring, I would suggest that you read it when you are older; perhaps then you will begin to fathom the depth and richness of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful tale which occurs before the \\"Lord of The Rings\\" trilogy begins. Beautiful, and simple, this story feels like a tale before the truly ominous story of the One Ring changes the tone. I recommend reading this BEFORE LOTR because it makes you love Bilbo and admire him and understand his actions later in The Fellowship of the Ring.What a glorious day for Kindle readers to have this fine series of books in eBook format.The LOTR is the gold standard for fantasy books - all others: Elric, Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, even the Twilight series are derivative in some way.The Hobbit is also appropriate for a younger age reader than the LOTR because it is not nearly so dark.

I especially love the language Tolkien used and how \\"friendly\\" it sounds, and as I understand the history, it was originally written simply as a story for his own children - not even meant for publication! But we're all much luckier that it did get published. So, since my family has started listening to books while on driving vacations, I wanted to share this much-beloved story with my own children (and my review is of the *audiobook* rather than the actual book).The reader, Rob Inglis, has a wonderful English accent that highlights how \\"English\\" the story really is, and he gets very theatrical in the many different voices he uses for the many different characters. But that's where the problems began. Most of the voices he used for the dwarves (13 different voices!) we found difficult to understand and not especially pleasant to listen to. His voice for Gollum was worst of all (very screechy - which is entirely appropriate to Gollum - but not at all nice to hear on a long drive in the car). Plus he reads it very slowly, which didn't engage the kids and made it very hard for them to tolerate. Unfortunately, and no matter how many times I tried, we only made it about halfway before my wife insisted I turn it off and not start it again (and none of the kids protested in the least). Sadly it made a very long drive \\"there and back again\\" even longer and I wish I'd have had a backup book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit Ballantine Books, 1966, 307 pp., $7.99J.R.R Tolkien ISBN 0-345-33968-1What would you do if you were taken by a band of dwarves?

There wasn't any glue on the packaging, just 2 CD's which I've never seen before.

He is the father of an entire genre, a genre that has been able to carry many of us through our darkest hours. Although The Hobbit came out over 70 years ago, it is yet fresh and vibrant. Dear Bilbo is still an enchanting hero and still unique--so many main characters are thinly veiled reflections of ideal selves, whereas Bilbo makes us instead rather want to become Hobbits.The Hobbit is less world-weary than the Lord of the Rings. It is also a more tightly knit story. For these two reasons, I prefer The Hobbit to the later saga, but I am still grateful that I am a better person for having experienced both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.In The Hobbit, we experience a series of adventures that are precipitated by an odd invitation from Gandalf, and through these adventures we see Bilbo pass from mere observer to central character. Tolkien was a master at many things: character, mythology, story; however, his observations of the essential qualities of human nature make his writings timeless and transcendent of societal changes.It was a joy to experience The Hobbit. I look forward to reading it to my girls.

It is a classic tale of a fish out of water exploring the greater fantasy world he lives in, much like Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. Bilbo Baggins is the fish, though he is much more unwilling than Luke or Harry to explore the fantastical world in which he lives. As a Hobbit, he lives in a comfortable hole in the ground where life goes on at a leisurely pace. There's plenty of time for meals, smoking, meals, drinking, and more meals. Then he's visited by the wizard Gandalf, who is helping some dwarfs organize an expedition. Gandalf wants Bilbo to go along, partly to break the unlucky number of dwarfs (thirteen), partly because he thinks Bilbo will be useful. They head off across Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, where the dwarfs once ruled. The dragon Smaug turned out the dwarfs and turned their underground kingdom into his lair. The head of the dwarfs, Thorin Oakenshield, is a descendant of the rightful king and is going to take their kingdom back.Like most of these stories, at first Bilbo is out of his depth. But he quickly becomes more resourceful, using his wits and his growing bravery to get out of the various tricky situations he and his companions wind up in. At one point he is separated from the group in the caverns of the Misty Mountains and has a delightful battle of wits with Gollum, a wretched creature who loses his preciousss ring to Bilbo. The ring becomes quite pivotal in The Lord of the Rings. But that is another adventure.This story is very well written. The descriptions are vivid and the world is well-crafted. The characters are interesting and the situations have plenty of humor and drama. The style of writing is a little old-fashioned, as if it were an epic, though some places the author addresses the reader (like, \\"for you it would be very strange if...\\") almost like he is a storyteller with an audience listening to him speak. I'm sure it will be wonderful to read this to my children in the coming years."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of my favorite books by my favorite author.

It is an inspirational coming-of-age tale, starring a reluctant hero who is made of tougher stuff than he realizes. It is a classic--perhaps timeless--children's tale that adults enjoy more so than the younger audience, especially in modern times. It is an epic fantasy tale that has influenced the genre--along withThe Lord of the Rings--more than any other book. However, it is not--in my opinion--perfect.The biggest complaint you'll find about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that the prose is 'too descriptive.' You'll see many Tolkien-enthusiasts bashing those who think that, insinuating that those reviewers who dislike Tolkien's style are simply too stupid to properly understand it. I, however, disagree. It all comes down to a matter of taste and, for me (at times), Tolkien's highly descriptive prose bogs the story down a bit too much. However, not a sentence in this story can be deemed \\"bad,\\" because the writing--whether you consider it too descriptive or 'just right'--is beautiful. His talent for describing both landscape and character is immense, and will leave any high-fantasy fan more than satisfied.\\"The Hobbit\\" is undoubtedly a beautiful book. As I said, I wouldn't call it perfect, but the story of Bilbo Baggins and his epic adventure is at the very least a \\"must-have.\\" I recommend you buy it in hardcover, preferably the Alan Lee Illustrated Edition, so it will last through the ages.8/10"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an amazing book to read.

It is an extremely good book from a great author. If you are reading it after you've read the Lord of the Rings, you are going to be quite pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book for years - over and over.... - I just love it! But I have been unable to find a hardback copy until now! Thank you! I will treasure the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a captivating story that combines ancient Greek and Roman mythology and Anglo-Saxon tradition to produce a timeless classic. J.R.R. Tolkien creates his own mythical world called Middle-Earth, which is actually Earth the way it existed millions of years ago. Tolkien first introduces the reader to the race of hobbits, which are little people who live to eat, in the form of Bilbo Baggins. A wizard named Gandalf approaches Bilbo with an adventure and out of courtesy Bilbo invites him to tea. Bilbo receives a surprise when a group of thirteen dwarves arrives with Gandalf. Gandalf has already volunteered Bilbo to be a burglar for the dwarves in their attempt to reclaim gold that is rightfully theirs from the vicious dragon, Smaug. Bilbo finally agrees to this plan and they set off the very next day for Lonely Mountain, the place where Smaug currently inhabits. Bilbo then experiences an epic journey where he is transformed from a regular hobbit that is incapable of leading to a leader who is courageous in the face of adversity and even becomes a hero before the journey is over. As the story develops the road for Bilbo and the dwarves becomes increasingly ominous and the road ahead seems to present more dangers than the road behind. Each of Tolkien's chapters symbolizes a new obstacle to overcome, which actually has little to do with the ultimate goal of Bilbo and the dwarves of reclaiming the gold from Smaug. However, all these chapters culminate in an ultimate battle between good and evil which pits the \\"Good People,\\" the humans, elves, and dwarves in a battle for supremacy over the brutal Whargs and goblins. Even though initially written as a child's story people of all ages can enjoy The Hobbit, which is the prequel to and establishes many of the ideas prominent in Tolkien's most famous work The Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What is there to say? It is tried, proven and true from the master of fairy tales. The illustrations are great. It's a must for all fantasy libraries and collectors."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As the prelude to the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit or There and Back Again, is a magnificent tale of magic, fantasy, and adventure. I found that I could not set this book down. With each page, I was that much more drawn into the realm of Middle Earth, and I made myself put the book down for a little bit in order to enjoy it.The characterization in this book is phenomenal. Both the protagonists and antagonists throughout the novel help creat the landscape of the book, as well as set the foundation for Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, displays the ideal character in that he is forced into a world of adventure of magic. As an innocent creature unaware of the outside world, Bilbo matures throughout the book, and is a classic example of a character who, by the end of the book, has developed into a great intellectual character. Bilbo continues to display this intellect throughout the Lord of the Rings.I have experienced many a conflict with other readers who did not enjoy the Hobbit, and I'm not saying that this book is in everyone's favor, but any reader of fantasy, magic, and adventure will love this book. I recommend the Hobbit to every person no matter what age. As a timeless tale of Tolkien, I give this book five stars (although, it probably deserves more)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien here, ho ho ho. You thought I was dead, didn't you? Well, I have been brought back to life by an evil necromancer. Now I'd like to tell you this book is great and you all must read it for I spent so many weeks writing this that you can sacrifice a few hours to show your respect to my work. Well, gotta get back to the Abyss.."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i first heard about the hobbit long ago in my adolescence when, like so many other classical titles, it was impressed upon me that it was something i ought to read. but, i'm not a fan of fantasy. and being a student much of my reading material of late is dominated by textbooks. when i finally picked up the hobbit a few weeks ago- this was shortly after reading the narnia chronicles- i was in the mood (so to speak)for the genre. i was suprised to read how funny and charming it was. i found myself laughing out loud at tolkin's description of bilbo's quiet shire home disrupted by hungry dwarves bent on glory and adventure.i was impressed by the scope of the narrative and the imagination of the creator of middle-earth. this is a wonder-filled tale and should be shared. i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was so entertaining. I couldn't put it down. The topics were so interesting and I loved when all 14 of them came to Beorn. The most interesting parts were when they were fighting the goblins while Poor Bilbo was facing Gollum in a riddle contest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I received the Hobbit as a gift when I was very young. Reading it then, I was enthralled by the adventure and the action and the strange creatures. I couldn't help but wish I had a magical ring too as a child.I'm older now, and enjoy the Hobbit for the messages and the characters, as well as the excitement and fantasy. And, much to my surprise, I find it a much faster read than the Lord of the Rings. Like a magical fable, it simply flows from chapter to chapter until it reaches a magical completion.The Hobbit is much more lighthearted than its successor trilogy, and well-suited to children of all ages. All that is required is a love of fantasy and escape that's missing in today's world. And I can think of no better world to escape to than the realm of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although LoTR is better I love The Hobbit more. It is my favorite book of all time.My father first read it to me when I was 4, so I don't see how people get off calling it &quot;too complicated&quot;. The writing is stunning and this and LoTR and The Silmarilion are the peaks of fantasy writing. Nothing writen will ever equal it in scope of imagination. If you also love this book I would recommend the illustrated micheal Hague edition and the audio adaption from The Mind's Eye."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was the best book I've ever read.

It has many adventures in it and I could go on all day about how many characters come into the story to make it even more interesting. My favorite part of the book was when Gollum (The Goblin) Meets the Hobbit and they go through a series of riddels to see who can outsmart who. I love this book and I hope you get to take the time to sit down and read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My the hobbit is good. I read hours everyday to finish it. It is worth wild to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is simply the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I just simply love it! My favorite part was the part where Bilbo challenges Gollum to a riddle game. The two had a deal. If Gollum won, Bilbo was lunch, but if Bilbo won, Gollum had to show him the way out of the gobin's layer. Bilbo won and then Gollum got mad. Gollum went a way to find his ring that could make one invisible. He was planning to surprise Bilbo and when Bilbo finally sees Gollum, it would be too late for Bilbo. But Gollum couldn't find it! Bilbo had it. He found out when he put the ring on and Gollum ran past him, trying to find his ring. Then Gollum sat down, whimpering the most horrible sound, whining the instructions to get out of the cave because he thought Bilbo already knew and Bilbo just wanted to get his ring. Bilbo followed Gollum's instructions and rode on Gollum's boat ( Gollum was rowing his boat to the entrance so he could find out if Bilbo had escaped.) The only problem with doing this was that Gollum wouldn't dare go near the goblins, though he sometimes ate them, but only with his ring on, so Bilbo had to jump. Unfortunatly, Gollum either heard or smelt him just when he was jumping. Gollum grabbed for Bilbo but missed. Bilbo finally got to the entrance but to his mishap, it was guarded by goblins. Fortunatly, Bilbo had the ring so he just walked past the goblins. Then the scariest part happens. The ring fails Bilbo and the goblins sees him. Luckily, he got out and returned to his friends. The reason why I like this part is because it makes you keep on reading and it is hair-raising. I could go on, babbling about the rest of the story but I can't because of the maximum of words. Still, I think you would enjoy it. You ought to read this book. It is, as I said, simply the best. No other book could out do The Hobbit, except for, maybe, the rest of the series. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is 100% 5 star if it is hard to follow. I am in Ms. Bartletts 8th grade Lang. Arts calss and as a class, we have to read it. It is hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What an amazing story! Here is a breif description of it, although, I can't do it a justice!If you could walk into the magical land of J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" you and your senses would be in for a treat. Your eyes could feast upon the rich earth, and the small ,plump hobbits, walking around the roads. As you peer out of your specticales, you would see small market places teeming with business. Perhaps you might see the farmer, bust with the never ending task of tilling his land to perfection. Their wives are singing whilst doing the laundry. Everyone is happy to be alive, in the place of comfort.If you were to put a hand to your ear, you might be able to hear the lone horse( as all but the largest hobbits can't ride them) telling his tale of woe for all to hear. And the old men, smoking their pipes as their rocking chairs creek with age telling each other \\" when I was a lad.....\\"The smoke reaches your nostrils, and you smile, for the smoke smells like pine, a delighful smell in a delightful place. Smoke wafts up from the local bakers shop, whisking away the pine scent. If you have not already, pick up \\"The Hobbit\\" ! It's a great read! Review By: Demotheseas"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the hobbit quite a while ago, but i still remember the adventure and the fun.I have three favorite parts:the part where gandalf and bilbo sit together and smoke, making shapes out of their smoke rings.the part where the trolls capture the dwarves and are turned to stone.the part where bilbo and golluem have their \\"riddles in the dark\\" (i love that chapter!)it's one of those books you sould read before you're twenty five, because everyone needs a little adventure in their lives."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excelent book which, relates to certain occurances in The Lord of The Rings. This book has an interesting plot and story. Throughout the course of the book, there are several interesting events that occur, however, they seem to go from one event straight into another, throughout the story. Making it feel like somthing had been left out in before, and after each occurance."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit when I was twelve, and I completely loved it. I've read it time and again, and I'm still not tired of it. It is one of my favorite books, right up there with The Chronicles of Narnia.Tolkien is excellent at creating an entire world , and making it unfold as you turn each page. I read it on Orgilion, er excuse me, ( pardon my elvish ) Saturday, and finished it by the end of the day. If you're an elvellon, oops, elf friend, or just a boookworm, I promise you you'll love this book. The elves, dwarves, dragons, wargs, hobbits, wizards; and orcs all take part in an exquisitely crafted drama that eminates in the Battle of the Five Armies. If you enjoy reading about adventures, instead of having them, or if you like a little bit of both, this book is for you. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any Christian parellels in this book,( unlike those in Narnia ) but it makes a great read anyhow. Namarie, darn, there I go again, I mean goodbye."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is a well thought of hobbit.

But the hobbit did worry about the matter.The next morning 11 dwarves arrive at Bilbo's home.Bilbo is bewildered why the dwarves arrive and why Gandalf had not came.Then after a short canversation Gandalf arrives and they all have a nice lunch. Then the dwarves and wizard talk of a map and destinations of odd sort for many hours. While Bilbo is wondering why his guests are speaking of such odd things, the dwarves ask Bilbo of food and drink. after another fine meal bilbos guests start singing of mountains and treasures and terrifying dragons.Then Bilbo falls asleep.

I liked the way the setting was put into it's place. I also liked the characters and their own unique personalities. If there is going to be a movie that will be a (must have).One day a wizard named Gandalf came to a town they call the Shire. He was there on urgent business and had to find a certain hobbit(small people that didn't wear shoes) named Bilbo Baggins. The Bagginses were known to not ever go on adventures or do anything bad. Soon he came to the door of Bilbo and he knocked on the door. Bilbo came outside in a hurry and Gandalf was talking to him about a meeting that would happen the next day at Bilbo's house.The next day a whole bunch of dwarves and Gandalf came over. This was now called the secret mission, for they were planning to go to the Misty Mountains to kill Smogg an evil dragon that killed a lot of dwarves and took their mountain.In the next couple of days they were off. They had many hardships and fought through a lot of trouble including: elves, goblins, smogg, wolves, and spiders.What happens next.......... well you'll have to read that yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Many fans of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings will tell you something like, \\"The Hobbit tells you some stuff you'll need to know when reading LOTR, but it really plays second fiddle to the ULTIMATE fantasy that LOTR is.\\" In my opinion, this simply isn't true. While LOTR focuses on a grand and epic battle encompassing Middle Earth in its entirety, The Hobbit is a more romantic tale - focusing on a single quest and taking its time to storytell. Its simple \\"there and back again\\" feel and lighter mood make it one of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime. Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a story about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. From where he lives, it is unrespectful of anyone if they go on an adventure. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf comes to his hobbit hole and invites over a team of 13 dwarves the next day. Hobbit holes are the homes of hobbits. They throw a large party, breaking pots and pans, tiring out Bilbo.They stay at Bilbo's home for the night, which had just enough room for them. Bilbo wakes up really late in the morning, to find a note that tells him to meet the dwarves in a few minutes. This is the start of Bilbo's worst times( with little or no food). I really enjoyed this book because it was really amazing with close saves and a good ending. Read this exciting book to see what is in store for Bilbo."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have recently added a classic to my all time favorite books list. And that is THE HOBBIT by J. R. Tolkien. This book was written all the way back in 1937 but still wows readers today. It is the prelude to the World famous Lord of the Rings series and contains many similarities and some characters.The book takes place in the magical land of middle earth where magical beings and strange animals run wild. As you read through the book you meet everything from evil lairs to villages and even vast forests. They help set the mood and are described in a very creative way that truly keeps your interest by leaving no detail untouched. This makes the book much more fun to read and keeps you entranced.The characters are also a crucial part of this book that makes it as great as it is.In the beginning there is just one main character but not soon after u are introduced to a wide array of main characters. As the group travels the encounter many tasks and adventures that set the pace for the book. But at one point in the book they split up and it is back to the single main character.Throughout the book the characters are trying to find secret treasure and travel the land. They meet new friends along the way and also have to fight off orcs and other dangerous foes. Then they arrive at the task of finding the treasure and they realize it's guarded by the giant dragon. Taking control of the treasure then becomes the main goal of the group.This book is a truly interesting one that will entertain people of all ages. The great plot, characters and setting will draw you in and ensure your interest.

Normally i don't like novel studies but this was an exception. Tolkien wonderfully provides the concrete details and lets you do the rest, he makes you use your imagination to make it seem like you are actually there.

Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however.

Maybe I'll get him to write a review on his big college paper topic: the relation of the cultural atmosphere and names included in many of Tolkein's writing to the ancient Anglo-Saxon times.

At first, I believed this book to be quite a silly story. However, after much reading I have come to see new aspects in the story. The way that the author describes the setting made mr feel as if I was marching through the woods on the adventure. During the dwarve's adventure, they come into contact with many obstacles including goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step, from the opening of the story onward, is a great adventure. Within the woods of the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings. Although as unrealistic the story may seem, I find myself hoping for Bilbo the hobbit to save the dwarves through each adventure. I recomend this book for suspense and mystery. Hoping that the dwarves would find their dragon and get the gold in the end,the only thing I could do was read on!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like adventure,then you'll like this book.The little hobbit was just smoking his pipe when a wizard and a gang of homeless dwarves came along to coux Bilbo into an adventure of a life-time!Read along and see if they can defeat the dragon Smaug and get the treasure that was rightfully theirs?I hope you'll like this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Simply put, I absolutly enjoyed reading this book. I was never bored, I never found myself questioning the author, I was just purely entertained from cover to cover. This book has been described to me as &quot;the greatest story ever told&quot;, and it comes darn close. It ranks up there with Alice in WonderLand and The Wizard of Oz to name a few. It is just one of those stories you can read over and over and still get completely engrossed in the adventure. The heart of this book lies in the timeless characters Tolkein creates. They are realistic in their humanity, but the fairy tale essence heightens their appeal. You just can't wait to see whom you are going to meet next.

As I was reading some of the hisory around the book, I learned that Mr. Tolkien had started it a bed time stories for his childeren.

Over dinner Bilbo discovers that he has the ability to be a most excellent thief. He learns the tales of the dwarves, and how most powerful and fierce dragon took their homes and fortune from them. This dragon's name is Smaug. The land in which the dwarves treasure and fortune lies is the city of Dale by the Lonely Mountain At first Bilbo is hesitant to even go on the journey, and thinks that the dinner has was put up to by the dwarves was just a dream. With a little bit of persuasion Bilbo becomes the thief for the small party he had over his Hobbit-hole. The Journey to the Lonely Mountain is long, and very dangerous.

Gandalf who was the parties' leader, leaves to take care of some business he has to deal with. Bilbo is then looked upon as the party's leader. Bilbo is a bit worried that he will not live up to the expectations that the dwarves have of him, but he proves himself worthy of being a leader on more than one occasion. After the long hardy journey is finally over, the party reaches the Lonely Mountain to retrieve their treasure. To find out what is to become of the group and their treasure read The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien....."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the Hobbit was an OK book. It is about a hobbit named Bilbo, who lives a very scheduled life until he meets 13 dwarves and a wizard. Bilbo doesn't like adventures, but his mined is changed after his long journey for a teasure. Bilbo runs into many dangers including a dragon named Smaug, Goblins, Trolls and Wolves. Bilbo makes many friends on his journey and looses friends too. I didn't like the ending to Smaug. They made him such a big character, but he dies so quickly. If you like adventerus books I would suggest the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read The Hobbit in Elementry school. Ever since then it has been my favorite book.

No need to review the literary works here. The Collector's edition is the way to read the story in my opinion. The 50th Anniversary is very similar as I can tell, but I prefer the green to the gold in addition to the green marbled page edges. The usual 5 of Tolkien's original watercolor artwork are resorted to their full color version and all the black and white pictures of the original version are now printed in black and green. Likewise, the maps are in black and green and in the front and back of the book.I was tempted to get the annotated version, which looks intriguing for long-time fans, but as I no longer had an original copy this felt like the right choice for now. I may buy the Annotated Hobbit down the road, although for now this one is perfect."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of those stories that most people have read at one time or another in their lives.

There's simply too much info in this book to even begin to cover in this review."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a pretty good example of what defines a classic novel. If you read it once, then 5-10 years later you want to read it again. I read my first (paperback) edition of The Hobbit when I was 12 years old. As I re-read it over the last four decades, I found that I could appreciate it for many different reasons. As a pre-teen, I liked the author's light and lively story-telling. It was easy to visualize the characters and enter into the story. As a young adult, I appreciated the way the author showed the characters could change/grow by being willing to enlarge their horizons. In mid-life, I appreciated the exploration of moral issues woven into the engaging tale: racial intolerance, obsession, selfishness. Later on, I began to see some of the political allegory: Hobbit culture echoed how the British saw themselves and Bilbo's encounters with Elves, Dwarves, Wizards, and Men represented the best and worst of how the relations of nations were in motion at the time of the book's first publishing. My point is no matter how many times one reads The Hobbit, it's many rich dimensions will bring us back to time and again to read and enjoy it anew. It's truly a book for all seasons."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a frequent reader but I purchased this book because of the Lord of the Rings movies that I love so much. I couldn't put the book down. The book itself is awesome."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can't say much about this one that hasn't been said by someone else, but i can say this: Buy the Michael Hague Illustrated Addition. It has better illustrations than the original, illustrated by the Author"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought \\"The Hobbit\\" wasn't really a good book. But take into consideration that I was forced to read this book with my English class. I have just never really gotten into fantasy such as Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. (I prefer science fiction.)Although, it was still hard to follow and I felt that it changed points of view throughout the book. I didn't really enjoy it and I wouldn't suggest this book.Sincerely,A 7th Grader"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a story about a hobbit namede Bilbo Baggins who is asked by the great wizard Gandalf to accompany him and 13 dwarves on a long journey to restore to one of the dwarves a treasure, taken from his father by a dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the 15 of them had to climb goblin-filled mountains, venture through spider-infested forests, hide from demonic wolves, and escape from an elf castle. Bilbo gets lost in a cave and finds the creature Gollum, who Bilbo steals a magic ring from. Gandalf ends up leaving the other 14 to fight the dragon alone.This story is very well written. Tolkien describes everything in such detail, you feel as though you're with Bilbo. This book is for anyone who likes adventure, fantasy, and Lord of the Rings fans. This answers many of the questions in LOTR. This is a great story, and will become a classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Book ReviewThe book was great. There was so much detail that allowed me to visualize the entire settings perfectly. I was expecting somewhat of good detail because that's what I've heard about the book, but not this good. It was incredible. Prior to this book I have never read a Lord of the rings book, but now I plan to read the rest of the series. The book gives you the feeling like your actually there more than the movie does.The book lets you know how Bilbo Baggins is feeling, and that is a big asset to the novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading or who is looking for a book to read. It will be especially enjoyable for the people that like adventure books. The setting of this book is takes place in a forest, mountains, and other outdoor places. I can honestly say that this is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. I was actually looking forward to reading it day after day for homework. All the other books I've read did not have any appeal to me.This book has a great tone set by the author. The tone of this novel is very curious. By that I mean that is it constantly makes one wonder what's going to happen next in the story. The tone made me want to read more and more are the story went on. The book got exciting at the perfect times and it became subtle at the appropriate times as well. The characters were perfectly made up, they fit the tone of the book perfectly, and without any one of them the book would not be nearly as good as it is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Paperback set in an illustrated hard box, includes the original versions of: The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was invited to do a public radio talk show about what books to buy for the holiday season and I decided to play the Ghost of Christmas Past and argued for finding old beloved books to give as presents (or, in my case cards: I give books instead of cards). I also talked about the joy of rediscovering beloved books through annotated editions, and &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; of J. R. R. Tolkien annotated by Douglas A. Anderson was my prime example. After all, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was about to hit theaters and even as I write this I have learned that yesterday would have been Tolkien's &quot;Eleventeenth&quot; birthday.An annotated version of book involves much more than simply rereading a book. If that was all I want to do I still have my illustrated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will pictures from the Arthur Rankin, Jr./Jules Bass animated production of the story. The annotated edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; provides an explication of the sources, characters, places, and things that made Tolkien's novel a classic. The text is fully restored and corrected, for those who care about such things, with Anderson's notes placed alongside for easy reference. That along would justify adding this volume to your Tolkien library, but in addition there over 150 illustrations, including Tolkien's own original line drawings, maps, and color paintings. Those, of course, are treasures, but Anderson has also provided illustrations from around the world and the most fascinating part of this book for me was looking at how, for example, Bilbo and the Trolls were drawn for Portuguese, Slovakian, and Swedish edition of &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; won the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inkling Studies, which sounds very impressive (and I even have some inkling at the what it means). This is one of those treasures where you would give five stars for the story, five stars for the annotations, and five stars for the illustrations. Granted, this is not the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; anyone should read. But after you have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; a few times and gone through &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least twice (the trilogy itself and not the movies), then it would be time to settle down and pour over this revised and expanded annotated edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The annotated version of the familiar There and Back Again expands the book's value enormously. All of the archaic words that have boggled generations of readers have been explained, and the story can be seen in a new light due to the implications these words arouse. Also are included the illustrations from the foreign versions of the book (several are quite funny - like the way in which the various nations imagine the dwarves and Gandalf - especially those whose mythology includes neither dwarves nor wizards). A very eye-opening book, Annotated Hobbit is a quite interesting piece of work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There is no question that J.R.R. Tolkien's story of The Hobbit is outstanding literature, so I will keep this review strictly to specifically the Alan Lee illustrated hard cover edition. Many people feel that the only high quality hard covers are leather bound. This book should quickly prove this to be false. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth covering with a beautiful gold dragon in the lower right corner (non other than Smaug himself). The pages are crisp and bright white, not a hint of yellow. The illustrations, scattered generously throughout, are both in color and in black and white and intermingle beautifully with the story. Alan Lee has truely captured Tolkien's characters better than any of the other artists who have tried. The detail in each illustration was enough to hold my attention for quite some time and definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic. Whoever feels pictures are for children needs to purchase this book and find the child in himself again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An small, unimposing creature - a Hobbit - is roused from his comfortable life in an unassuming home and pushed into a fantastic adventure. Accompanied by dwarves, wizards, beasts, and men, the Hobbit becomes the key figure in a quest for lost gold and lost glory.This story, the brilliant prequel to Tolkien's _Rings_ trilogy, lives up to the accolades surrounding the stories. The characters have depth, and the perils - as fantastic as they are - have a vivid air of urgency. While the _Rings_ epic may be faulted by some for including too much &quot;superfluous&quot; expository information, the Hobbit sticks to the story at hand. It is a wonderful introduction to adult fantasy books for any child, and one that would work well read out loud.Young readers can easily identify with Bilbo, the diminutive protagonist. Small in stature and initially lacking in confidence, the others in the expedition doubt his worth. However, eventually he proves himself to be invaluable to the cause and the most rational of the party. Isn't this the dream of many children? To leave the humdrum everyday life, and be part of an adventure in which your abilities prove to be the key to success?Read this book as a child. Read it again as a teen, and again as an adult. The story is exciting, impressive, and just plain fun."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review is for the Kindle version of The Hobbit:I reviewed this a couple of weeks ago, but I didn't see the review appear here. That works out for the best, however, because I needed to amend my review. I read several reviews from others who complained that the Kindle version had issues with portions of the book missing, and I also experienced that about 10% of the way in - whole paragraphs were missing. I returned it for a refund, but a few days later, I had an idea, purchased the book again, and having read 84% of it at this time, I have had no trouble with missing portions of the book.So what changed? The first time around, I increased the font size, as it is rather small. The second time around, I did not, and I have been able to read without problems. The font size is still a little small for my tastes, and if increasing the font size causes interruption of the book material, that is an issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm still glad to at least know that this might be the problem if it happens again with other books - I suspect it will.The Hobbit is a fun and entertaining book, and you can get much better reviews of the content from other people. I just wanted to put this out there for others who might be experiencing the frustration of missing portions of the book and to suggest a possible reason/solution. It is an issue that needs to be dealt with for the Kindle developers, for sure.Good luck and God bless!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was given this hardbound, encased version of The Hobbit for my 6th birthday in 1978---and have read it about ten times since. (Just finished re-reading it yesterday.) This book, and this version, are magical to me. The Hobbit is a wonderful book, full of adventure, magic, camaraderie, and growth---and is a perfect metaphor for the internal healing process: taking risks for the betterment of our character and soul. Bilbo is a classic example of a comfortable, under-exposed being who breaks out of his comfort to challenge himself and rise to new heights of truth and daring. You gotta love him!Also, the illustrations---all originals by J.R.R. Tolkien---are just marvelous. I've looked at them SO many times over the decades, and they are simply special to me: especially the picture of Smaug the Dragon sitting on his hoard of gold. WOW!So I highly recommend this book, and this version, to everyone and anyone.And if you haven't get read The Hobbit, LUCKY YOU---you have an adventure in store for you!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. However, there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. Moreover, it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.The Hobbit: or, There and Back Again (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands. Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years. The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today. The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix. You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it. Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down. If you have a vivid imagination and an interest in fantasy, than this book will become a classic favorite of yours too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent...."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What some people don't seem to realize is that The Hobbit predates The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien didn't anticipate just what his larger work would be about, but he worked it around a lot of the elements in The Hobbit.This first book was not written as a prequel, but as a story in itself. It lacks the epic scale, being more of a children's bedtime story, and an incredible one at that. If you've read it after reading The Lord of the Rings, expecting something in the same vein, you're not going to find it. You'll get a rich tale with no peer in children's fiction, written for the sheer enjoyment. The complexities of Middle-Earth are absent, and the excitement of the quest is the focus.Growing up I had the good fortune of having The Hobbit read to me over and over. When I was old enough to take on the Ring trilogy, it was a joy to see the mysterious land of Tolkien's imagination grow into a whole history. I suppose this is the ideal way to experience The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"WARNING: Spoiler Alert! Amazing book , I really loved it!!

The settings are interested enough, the character development is adequate, and the prose is satisfactory. But these authors have a wealth of personal knowledge of language, metaphor, and/or the human condition that makes the reading not only fun, but an adventure in satire, sociology, semiotics, history, and philosophy.

And you can't help but love Bilbo and his ever-present need to be back home safe in his hobbit-hole, cradling a good cup of tea.The story format is episodic, which makes sense for an adventure quest and I suspect is also a product of when it was written, but the narrative feeling of \\"this happens and then this happens and then this happens\\" disconnects the tale a bit. I'm probably being too nitpicky. The Hobbit is timeless good fun so don't miss out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I got hooked on this book last year when I read it, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the lotr.

The only way to describe the joy it gives is to give a nice copy to the other party and let her read the book, or rather let her enter the wonderful world created by Tolkien. I'm impatiently waiting for my son to grow up, so that I can read this to him. I don't know who'll enjoy Tolkien's world more, he or I, but I'm sure we'll come across this masterpiece more than once. And who is to complain, anyway?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can you say about this classic?

Few tales are better than the classic trip of discovery. Maybe Homer's epic poems started it, more likely it started long before him, a time so old that everything can be both true and not quite true, and men and Gods are interchangeable. This is one of those stories. A quiet Hobbit (Bilbo) lives comfortably (as Hobbits are prone to do), when a Wizard named Gandalf knocks on his door (as wizards frequently do in these kinds of stories). Much to his surprise, Bilbo is soon off on an adventure.Adventures, the things found out (and things found) do two things. They change the adventurer and they change the world around. This adventure does both. The quiet, shy, Bilbo becomes the leader of the adventure (much to his dismay), and as happens in good fantasy adventure stories, the changes have much more far reaching consequences than anyone (even Gandalf) could predict, and then there is the ring tha he finds accidentally while trying to escape from the trolls (but then that is the stuff of many later books).The people of Middle Earth, the trials and tribulations the world since the end of the 'good old days', the trials of the adventurer, and hints of the impact on the rest of the world are wonderfully described in a style that appeals to young and old alike. This is a story in the best story telling tradition. It's fun, it's easy to read, and it's a classic tale of adventure and growth. I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel that the immortal Mr. Tolkien penned will abide in my heart forever.

Anyone that reads this book will be transported to an incredible land of magic and wonder. Mr. Baggins is comical yet completely lovable as the reluctant burglar. The scene with Bilbo and Thorin near the end still pulls at my heart after all these years. As a prelude to the fantasy epic &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books, it is an essential primer for them.

It was read aloud to me in school when I was in Grade Five and it still has the same power to entrance now that I older. In fact, there is a new appreciation for this book as it takes me away from my stuffy adult self, much like Mr. Baggins at the beginning, content in my little hole with my daily routine. I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end.

Tolkien. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" at least four times in the thirty-five years since I first discovered it, and have never ceased to be thrilled by Bilbo Baggins and his brave cohorts. Their quest to destroy the evil dragon Smaug, recover stolen gold, deliver the enslaved people of Lake Town, and the strong bond of friendship they forge along the way, has thrilled millions of readers. Although \\"The Hobbit\\" is a prequel, of sorts, to the \\"Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,\\" it stands on its own as a wonderful tale of magical fantasy, and as a story of personal courage and growth.\\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs.\\" Tolkein's description of the Hobbit's home is important to form an understanding of Bilbo Baggins' character. Mr Baggins is the particular Hobbit of note, for whom the book is titled. He likes nothing more than comfort, and dislikes nothing more than change. What is a hobbit, you ask? Hobbits are \\"a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink.\\" Unfortunately they no longer live on Earth.Bilbo, who leads a very comfortable life at his home, Bag End, near the bustling village of Hobbiton, is rudely interrupted one day by a wise old wizard, Gandolf the Gray. Gandolf, with a great deal of pressure, persuades Bilbo to set out with thirteen angry, and determined dwarves, to reclaim their stolen treasure from a terrible dragon. The Hobbit, who has never stolen anything in his life, nor would he think to do so, is proclaimed \\"The Burglar.\\" And the skeptical dwarves are reassured by Gandolf that \\"there is more to Bilbo than meets the eye.\\"The troop ventures off, through various mysterious, mystical lands that no longer exist on Earth - Rivendell, the elves stronghold, the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood Forest, Lake Town and the Lonely Mountains. They meet and befriend numerous memorable characters along the way, and encounter fiendish enemies also. It is on this journey that Bilbo finds the all powerful golden ring, that plays such an important role in Tolkein's masterful epic the \\"Lord Of The Ring Trilogy.\\"Before Bilbo can return to the comfort and security of Bag End, he will fight many battles, change lives, influence the future, and undergo changes himself. The drama, suspense and sheer beauty of Tolkien's tale will captivate you. It is truly an unforgettable story, written in a most unique literary style, by a man who has created and peopled an entire world, and given its inhabitants a new language.

Their destination is the Lonely Mountain, in which lies the dwarves stolen fortune, guarded by a horrible dragon named Smaug.How easy is was to lose yourself in this world for awhile. I kept thinking about it every time I put the book down. It also wonderfully sets up the Lord of the Rings trilogy that includes two of the characters from &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; If you've never read this book like I hadn't, and are a big fan of either Harry Potter or the Robert Jordan books, you owe it to yourself to read this. It's great!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Now that I have read The Hobbit I must conclude that the reason for its apparent fame and renown was its novelty when it was published. Perhaps this book was the first of the fantasy genre, pioneering paths that would inspire and guide other fantasy writers for decades to follow. However, on top of this I must say that I personally found the book dreadfully unexciting. I am sure that if you have ever played Dungeons and Dragons or any similar RPG game you would have invented a story with a far more suspenseful, coherent, and intriguing plot than this one. Of course, the character of Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) is cute and quaint to say the least, his character does not exceed the shallow heroes of most average science fiction/fantasy books (you know, that clueless maverick who despite his befuddlement always comes out on top)... Unfortunately, Bilbo's 13 companions are similarly left undeveloped in a story that could have brought out so much in them. I have heard that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is better, so I will read that next, but for now I have no further positive remarks about Mr. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first found this book it excited me. After reading it, I must say that I now despise it. After only a few pages, I began to see darkness under its shallow mask. I can't believe people would buy a book of this caliber. It irritates me to no end. Let me begin my journey.It was a sunny Tuesday if I remember correctly. I was taking my unicycle home and noticed an eight year old kid waiting for the bus. I didn't want this kid to beat me up, so I had to look bigger than him, as I do with most mammals. I approached the kid with an awry grin on my face. The lonely rider stared up at me with terror. My plan was working. To be honest, I was terrified on the inside, but I had to show this animal who's boss. I hovered over him, completely shrouding him in my shadow. I won. The kid broke. He ran screaming. That sure taught him. I grabbed my spoils from his seat. His backpack contained few items. Some of the better ones included some stickers, a ham sandwich, and this book. I beat my chest in victory, then proceeded to skip home.I sat down in my porcelain throne at my house and skimmed through the book. Seemed at the time like just a children's fable. How wrong I was. I flipped back to the first page and began to read it for real. The first thing that struck me was the book trying to explain what a Hobbit was. I swore the book and ripped out this page. I did not dare read that in fear of a satanic summoning ritual. I proceeded with caution.The first chapter starts out fairly simple. An odd rabbit creature (presumably a hobbit, but I was not sure) was living in a hole like the scum he was. Pretty soon, he is visited by an older gentlemen named GrandGolf, or something of the sort. This character is my favorite at the moment. Grandgolf sees the rabbit creature and is immediately disgusted by it, insisting this creature leave his home, or be slain by him there. The rabbit is enlisted into the army and becomes the slave of Grandgolf. He now must travel with Grandgolf's company if he wishes to escape an eternal damnation.The book only goes down from here my friends. The author tries to envelop us in creatures that I think he made up himself. What am I? Eight? How am I to believe these lies without proof? I feel saddened about how lonely this author must have been in order to imagine such divine creatures. Without anything backing it up, none of this book is solid. How am I to believe that things such as trolls, dwarves, and wolves exist? I must confess that many of these ideas made me confused throughout the book. However, I press on hoping it will pick up, only to find myself losing more of my sanity.Sluggishly I continued the fantasy story of Tolkein. It made me queasy to start reading again, but I trudged on with a vengeance now. The rabbit continued reluctantly on his quest, hoping to ultimately escape the powers of Grandgolf the wizard. Until then, he lays awake at night, hoping for someone to save him. Eventually the party must cross a mountain. This is where the rabbit decides to make his grand escape. Without thinking, he kicks one of the dwarves in the crotch and jumps down with reckless abandon. He must have hit his head on a rock or something because he wakes up later.He opens his eyes to probably the most beautiful site in the book. A small creature called a Gollum rests on a rock in the middle of an underwater lake bantering to himself. This character has got to be the most believable in the book so far. Having been driven mad from the illusions that had been fabricated by the heinous author, he now sits quietly and often has discussions with himself. The rabbit, now crazy as well, sees this Gollum as salvation from the overbearing wizard-kind. He approaches it without hesitation and quickly falls in love.The rabbit grasps the hands of the Gollum, and after several sloppy make-out sessions they get married and the Gollum gives the rabbit a ring. With the loot in hand, the rabbit decides he has everything he needs and decides to divorce the Gollum. The Gollum does not like this one bit. It goes into a raging fit and chases after the rabbit with but a broken heart. With his quick thinking, the rabbit puts on the ring, which happens to give it super powers. The rabbit turns invisible, leaving the broken Gollum to wallow in pity and self loathing. The rabbit makes his way out of the mountain, only to fall back into the clutches of the warlord dwarves. Normally, the rabbit would curse himself for being so careless, but now he had the upper hand. With the wedding ring of super powers he can finally take his revenge on those who he had called master.The rest of the book is quite trivial as the rabbit finds ways to kill off his owners one by one, eventually teaming up with a dragon to conquer the world. I didn't feel like reading the rest of it in fear of spontaneous combustion, but I can tell it wasn't going anywhere.From what I have read of this book I can tell that an amateur wrote it. With it's false ideals and creatures there is no possible way that any book in this manner can be taken seriously. It has okay characters overall, and the sex scenes were alright as well. I just wish that the author had highlighted the theme of rebellion in a more positive manner instead of taking the route he did.I believe that this book receives more praise than it should be getting. I can hardly believe that this book was based off the movie. The differences are very uncanny and it's almost impossible to see this book and the movie under the same title as one in the same. Without the movie, I doubt anybody would have heard of this book, and I find it hard to call this a classic in anything but age."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress.

I read a great deal and I have gone back and re-read books from my past including Silas Marner and others.

In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review. Mike London 10-3-2012]New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a sequel to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"\\"The Marvellous Land of Snergs (Dover Children's Classics)\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character (for though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life experience to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past.Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others).This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicitly prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistencies between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.-----Original Review 2000: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not! No, just different!\\"The biggest problem with this novel is perception. Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children. There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that was his master achievement in children's literature.The Lord of the Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The Hobbit's success. Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the Rings. It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him as The Silmarillion.So delineation is required if you want to read this. Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings. Think of it like you would think of any other children's classics: children's classics. If you take it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not written to be like that. But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a failure in children's fiction. It is not children's fiction, it is epic fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction. That is EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit. They try to put it in the same type of genre or playing field as The L. R. They are both masterpieces, and I love them both dearly. But one is for children, the other with adults.Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem. How many books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel? Not very many. The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in the children's market. He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a sequel. So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put it. He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into it. So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel. Instead of looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece, an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece. The Hobbit is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time. The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market. Both are as important as the other, just in different fields.I haven't talked about The Silmarillion much. I have already reviewed it, so I won't go real in-depth here. But the same thing happened with it. People, expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the Biblical style of the published version. If Tolkien wrote that book out in narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer than Lord of the Rings. The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to many preconceptions that are incorrect.So, basically, in conclusion, think of it like this:1. The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece. He scores big with this one.2. The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy, not a trilogy. (Tolkien was always quick to point that out). The Crowning achievement of modern fantasy.3. The Silmarillion - the Bible of Middle-earth. Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth!

It is second only to The Lord of the Rings.Some say that fantasy is a lower form of the art of literature, because the highest art occurs when the artist puts himself and his real world into his work. But this is exactly what Tolkien did. As a scholar of ancient literature, he created a World like unto that which he studied, a World more wonderful than the creation of any other human.He created Hobbits who liked to draw maps and study ancient tongues and write about their adventures in their [his] World.His Hobbits faced the terror of giant spiders--as a child Mr. T. fell on a tarantula and was sick for days from the bite.His peace-loving Hobbits came to understand the horror of war, and found within themselves the courage to go forward, even in this understanding, to do what was needful. Lieutenant T. was leader of one of the few platoons which actually reached the enemy trenches at the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest battle in history, where the English advanced into a hail of machine-gun fire so fierce that the generals at headquarters could not believe the casualty reports.Mr. T. was raised and remained a devout Catholic. In the Lord of the Rings his Hobbits, along with good and valiant Men and Dwarves and Wizards, faced the evil Orcs of the Dark Lord of Mordor. It is not hard to notice that the Wizards are like Angels without wings, the Orcs like the imps of Hell, and the Dark Lord an enemy worthy of Satan himself.&quot;Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron.&quot; -- C.S.Lewis, in the first review of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The biggest problem with this novel is perception.

TolkienThere and Back Again told by Bilbo Baggins&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; is, simply put, the seminal novel in modern fantasy fiction. Although many may see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as strictly being a children's book or at best one for the teenagers, there is much in this novel for fans of fantasy fiction of all ages. I believe the last time I read this wondrous and beautifully crafted story was when I was a teenager myself but having been inspired by Peter Jackson telling the tale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the theaters I gladly purchased this novel to reread the epic and recapture the joy that it is to read one of Tolkien's classics.Although many an author in many different fantasy series have come close to creating worlds such as Middle-Earth in the fantasy genre, they have done just that, come close. Giving credit where credit is due though, a majority of these authors were inspired by Tolkien and their great works may never have been were it not for his in the beginning.If you're like me, making a revisit to the world of Tolkien's writings or coming to it for the first time, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is definitely the place to start. This review is for the Leatherette Collector's Edition, ISBN: 0-395-17711-1 which is a beautifully crafted novel and the illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself all combine to make for a wonderful experience as Tolkien weaves the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his first big adventure through an extraordinary premise, exceptional plot setup and execution and perfect pacing.The premise:&quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot; tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit that is visited by Gandalf the Wizard and the very next day twelve dwarves show up in his &quot;hole&quot; and enlist his aid as a &quot;burglar&quot; in their quest.Before poor Bilbo knows it, he's on a quest with the twelve dwarves and Gandalf to the far reaches of Middle-Earth to rob Smaug the dragon of that which belonged to dwarf King Thorin's father Thrain and is rightfully his, the treasure of Lonely Mountain.What follows from there is most certainly one of fantasy fiction's classic tales and an extremely enjoyable tale for all ages where Bilbo, Gandalf and the twelve dwarves go from one adventure to another on their way to the Lonely Mountain and an inevitable meeting with Smaug.I highly recommend this novel in this Leatherette Collector's Edition to those who've never read the story before and to those that have and wish to have the best possible version of it. It would be absolutely perfect if Peter Jackson would see fit to further immortalize this novel by bringing it to the silver screen after the overwhelming success of the &quot;The Lord of the Rings!&quot; {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit who lived a quiet life except for a single, life-altering year. He is recruited by a wizard named Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves on their quest to reclaim the land and fortune that is rightfully theirs by slaying the dragon who took it from them. Bilbo is a reluctant hero, but nevertheless a memorable one. And his tale is an extraordinary flight of fancy that will stay in your heart forever. I am extremely picky about which books I like to reread, but after reading this for the first time I am sure that there will be a second, as well as a third and fourth. Tolkien is a masterful storyteller, and the world he creates is so vivid and well-conceived that it is easy to lose yourself in the forests of Mirkwood, the Misty Mountains or the desolate Lonely Mountain. Bilbo's adventure is captivating from one leg of the journey to the next. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; touches on issues of greed, courage and friendship without ever losing focus or seeming preachy. The only fault I can find is with me, for not reading it sooner."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My father introduced the late great Mr J.R.R. Tolkien to me when I was 8 years old, at a time when I had an insatiable appetite for literature of all kinds. From one night to the next I used to long to hear of events that - somehow - had been happening during my daily absence.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; only added to my impatience. The animated tones of my father's voice as he described Bilbo Baggins's journey into the middle earth, created images of green mist, rugged mountains and dark woods that only a childs mind can see so vividly. Yet I can remember the look on my father's face as he turned every page to rejoin the adventure. And I realised that this book - this fantasy land - had captured my fathers imagination as it had mine.For years after my father read me &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, I longed to recapture the feelings that I first encountered in Bilbo's adventure - to learn more about Gandalf, and conjure up further images of dark, mysterious scenery. But maybe that time was too special. Maybe I'm never mean't to find another book with such magical power ..... because maybe I was lucky to be introduced to one in the first place.There are a lot of maybe's in life - questions that go along unanswered - as there are in this book...... that's the magic.In my adult wisdom (!?) I now know that I'll never truly recapture the feelings that I had as a little girl. But - when the time arises - I will strive to provide the same atmosphere in which my children can realise the magic of reading. And &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the book that made me realise how important the magic is.So Mr Tolkien, wherever you are, I give you 5 stars.... for the thousands that you have already given me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent fantasy adventure. It was easy to read and understand, and had lot's of humor in it. Though inferior to its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, the story of Bilbo Baggins quest provided the background that LOTR depended on. The Hobbit has a different feel from LOTR; it reads exactly like a fantasy, and that's what makes it a fun story. Wizards, dwarves, orcs, people, dragons, trolls, elves, and of course hobbits populate this book, so its in the right formula. Whenever I had to actually put the book down, I had thoughts of what would happen next to Bilbo and the dwarves. Despite the lighter tone in contrast with LOTR, there's nothing corny about The Hobbit. Upon finishing Tolkien's original classic, a person can't help being curious about Tolkien's masterpiece, LOTR. Besides, to feel the full grasp of LOTR, it is essential to read about Bilbo's quest first. Read and enjoy this classic, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books.Prior to The Hobbit, I heard Tim Curry read Dune: House Corrino (the last in the Dune Prequel Trilogy)...Edward Hardwicke read Sherlock Holmes...and Jim Dale read the Harry Potter books.All of the above voices are British, so I'm used to that. In fact, I prefer it. A Brit could read a telephone book and it would sound interesting to me.However, despite my penchant for the British dialect, it took a while for me to get used to narrator Rob Inglis' deep, mellifluous voice. I'm not sure why. Maybe because he seemed to read more slowly than the other narrators. Maybe it's because some of his vocalizations sounded similar. Or maybe it's because I've read the story before and I kept waiting for the next exciting thing to happen.Or maybe it was the songs J.R.R. Tolkien's characters burst into from time to time throughout the book. Inglis actually sings the songs! His singing voice is very good, but the songs seemed to last forever. (I fast forwarded through a few of them.)All of this is starting to sound as though I didn't like Inglis' reading of The Hobbit. Pish-posh. As it said, it took a while to get used to, but I quickly did so -- and hated to see the story end.A classically-trained Shakespearean actor, Inglis is a natural to read Tolkien. He has an incredibly expressive voice. Because of its baritone nature, his renderings of dwarves, dragons and goblins was dead-on.As I mentioned, I've read The Hobbit many times. I bought my first copy of it in the early '70s, in fact. But this is the first time I've ever heard it read to me.It was positively delightful! Perhaps Tolkien intended for his story to be read aloud. I don't know. But I loved listening to the adventures of Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin &amp; Company and all the creatures they encounter in their journey to Smaug's lair. Especially by a reader with such a marvelous voice.The quality of this 10-CD set is impeccable. The voice is clear and crisp. The sound level in all CDs is perfect. I have nothing but praise for this unabridged audio book.Which is why I bought Inglis' reading of Tolkien's other (perhaps more famous) works: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King. Collectively known as The Lord of the Rings.I have my listening cut out for me!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This 70th anniversary edition of The Hobbit is a fine production which includes the most recent corrections to the text. The introduction by Christopher Tolkien is about twenty years old, having been written for the British 50th anniversary edition in 1987. I don't believe this introduction has been available in an American edition before, so its good that it finally made it into print here. The book is well-designed and made so that it will last through many rereadings, as a classic should, and it is much nicer to hold and read than previous American editions, which tend to feel cheap and clunky. The paintings and line drawings by JRR Tolkien are as fresh and beautiful as they must have been when they were new, and much to be preferred over the illustrations provided by other artists. I believe that this edition of The Hobbit is the closest American version of how Tolkien himself would have liked it to have been published."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's Hobbit takes the imagination on a wonderful flight of fantasy. I read this book on a yearly basis and each year I am delighted and captivated by the world of Bilbo Baggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a new adventure for his friends in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skill is best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; the story is continued, but the sheer delight of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is never fully recaptured. This collector's edition is beautifully bound. Even more enjoyable are the illustrations and paintings by the author himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's always nice to have The Hobbit (any Tolkien) at my finger tips!!

Tolkien is a genius and if you've never experienced his writing, YOU SHOULD!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a shame that J. R. R. Tolkien's great work, The Hobbit, has been overshadowed by his still greater work The Lord of the Rings. Nowadays, most people regard The Hobbit simply as the prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit, however, is a great story even standing on its own.The Hobbit is the story of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a staid, unadventurous member of a staid, unadventurous race. One day, Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf and thirteen homeless Dwarves and somehow becomes their burglar with the job of helping the Dwarves recover their lost gold and home, stolen by the dragon Smaug.When they first set off on their adventure, Bilbo is not much use to the Dwarves and seems more a burden than a burglar. He can't seem to do anything right. Over time, however he becomes more confident and takes more of a lead. By the end of the story, he has helped defeat the dragon and has saved the Dwarves lives more than once.Tolkien shows great skill with the plot of the Hobbit, never allowing the pace to slacken but keeping the reader excited with Bilbo's adventures. Throughout the book, he shows the same keen ability to depict the natural world as he does in the Lord of the Rings, and so makes Middle Earth come to life in a way few authors of fantasy can. Bilbo's growth as a leader and a person are convincingly shown and Tolkien, at times displays a wry wit, especially with the politics of Laketown and Bilbo's conversations with the Dragon.If there is one fault with the Hobbit, it is that at times Tolkien was too aware that he was writing a children's book, and at times, his writing takes on a slightly condescending tone, the sort of tone that adults often use when talking to small children and which the children really don't like much. Overall, however, the Hobbit is an enjoyable book to read whether on its own, or as the prequel to the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"read this book its way better than the movie but just by a little bit...best book ive ever read"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have always loved any of Tolkien's works but I think the Hobbit really has a special place in my heart because of the childlike innocence that is not as present in the Lord of the Rings.Much of the story is told rather light-heatedly and much the way a grandfather might regal a grandchild sitting on is knee with a story of a far away place and fantastic creatures. The plot and characters are not complicated in any way, and if you are looking for a novel that is dark, and grim, with complicated characters, than The Hobbit is really not for you.There is not much more that I can say that other 5 star reviewers haven't said. I do have the Kindle version and there are no formatting problems and the illustrations are clear and very pleasant.

I introduced my friend to it and she said she got hooked on the first page because of the details and description. Another one of my friends, who saw the movie awhile back said she doesn't remember much, but of what she does remember, she loved those parts. I recommend to anyone who likes reading about elves and magic, to read this classic by J.R.R.

I'm not sure about how it would compare to other fantasy books because I haven't read any fantasy books lately, so I don't really remember to well about what happened. This is a great story about some dwarves, and a hobbit named Bilbo who go on a long adventure together, and, well... if you want to know the rest then you have to read the book. I would recoomend this book to anyone who likes to read, and even for people who don't like to because it's a interesting book full of adventure. Once you get started reading it you can't put it down. This is definitly a five star book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a avid fantasy reader and I loved this book.

It is much better that the BBC audio, which has a lot of distracting background music. These audio versions have been perfect for my 10 year old, who loves the story, is very intelligent, but has some reading difficulties. But... I am glad I did not just jump in and purchase this. I was an Audible customer for years, and they provide a wonderful service for those who can afford to buy the audio downloads. If I were getting an audio version to listen to myself, I would be going to my local library that has a copy with Rob Inglis reading the book. He is simply the best. As I pointed out earlier though, this is for my 10 year old who does seem to follow along better with a cast of charterers reading the parts. So I was able to get for free, the download threw my local library on Neibors. Now he has the chance to listen to the story, I didn't have to pay for a thing, and my library is justified in providing this service to its patrons.

I was so surprised. Every book I've ever read in English has been boring, but this one was really good.Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit (obviously) who likes to stay in his little Hobbit hole and stay to himself. He likes so smoke his pipe, eat, clean, and take naps. His life style does a complete 360 turns when Gandalf arrives and tells Mr. Baggins he will be accompanying the 12 dwarves to go defeat the dragon called Smaug, and take back the land that was one the dwarves. Bilbo doesn't believe him at first and soon enough he got sucked into the whirlwind adventure.All of the adventures in this book keeps you on your toes, I was like what's going to happen next??? I tried not to \\"read ahead\\" or appear too \\"anxious\\" to find out what happened so everyone wouldn't think I was a total nerd lol. My favorite adventure that they took was through the Mountain were Bilbo was knocked out and left behind... This part was so creepy, I kept thinking BILBO GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THERE!!! Overall this story is fun, adventurous, and a great change of pace. I went into this book with really low expectations and came out really enjoying it.I really enjoyed how Bilbo's character grew as the story progressed. He didn't think he was fit to be a Burglar at the beginning and by the end he was confident and an amazing Burglar... I really didn't think he would have had it in him lol. I love all of the characters!

I got this beautiful edition for Christmas and settled in to let Tolkien's amazingly magical world of Middle Earth open up before my eyes. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for his own children, but even though it is supposedly a children's book it sweeps adults up as well and holds them in its spell through the entirety of Bilbo's fascinating journey.It is rare that a \\"children's book\\" is considered a prologue to an adult book, The Lord of the Rings (always considered by Tolkien as one book and not a trilogy). I am very glad I read The Hobbit first because it gets the reader acquainted with Middle Earth, and several characters and places are mentioned and continued in Lord of the Rings. At only about 300 pages The Hobbit is a fast and delightful read, and when you are finished you will probably do as I did and immediately begin reading and enjoying the incomparable Lord of the Rings.Although the films are good, Tolkien's imagination has to be experienced firsthand to be believed, and it all starts here with The Hobbit.

Though actually originally written as a children's story, it almost immediately transcended such a classification, and through the years many adults have read the delightful story of a small, but tough Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.Most folks know the basic premise of the story. If not from reading it, then certainly they know part of it from the prologue to *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie, and likely went out to learn the rest of the tale. A wizard, Gandalf the Grey, goes and visits the son of an old Hobbit friend, and after spending time with him, surreptitiously marks Bilbo's door with a sign that is an advertisement of services for a professional burglar.The dwarves that Gandalf was helping look for a burglar promptly knock on poor Bilbo's door, and up he finds himself enlisted in an adventure to slay a dragon and find lost gold. Initially the dwarves belittle Bilbo, and this just makes him all the more determined to prove them wrong about him, which attitude he does, to put it mildly, regret more than once on their quest. Eventually he finds the Ring and the adventures are many, but that is too much of a spoiler for this review. Suffice it to say, it is one grand adventure after another.It is said that the Hobbit was published on the recommendation of the publisher's son, who heartily endorsed the tale. It also was published on the strong recommendation of Tolkien's friends, including C. S. Lewis. Tolkien was a man of a very exacting nature. The debt owed to Tolkien's close circle of family, friends, and a few close academic peers is incalculable. For their insistence that Tolkien merely \\"publish it already\\" ensured the book kept the whimsical tone it may otherwise have lost.*The Hobbit* is often criticized, to be sure, for not having the extremely \\"serious\\" tone and \\"complex\\" plot lines of its sequel, *The Lord of the Rings*. While this criticism is perfectly fair, it also greatly misses the point. Yes, Tolkien included fantasy elements in the story derived from the epic fictional history of Britain that he was writing. But that was all that these were, small derivatives. There was not a concerted effort when he wrote the *children's* story, to include all of these. Indeed, while Tolkien had to go back and rewrite the section \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" to make the story of the Ring and Gollum coincide with the overall story of *The Lord of the Rings*, that is as far that he was able to go. He realized that to make the tone and story of *The Hobbit* match that of it's sequel would effectively make it no longer the fun story that everyone loved.So the question is, what is *The Hobbit*? What kind of story is it? It is lighter, but with a sense of foreboding. It is the story of a fat, happy, contented age coming to a close in a devastating war that will change the face of the earth. It is the origin of a story that is an attempt to explain how a variety of myths can be true.To this, many may object that *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of the story, but this is untrue. *The Silmarillion* is the beginning of *all* stories, and only concerns the events of the later periods of Middle-Earth very faintly, and near the end of that epic narrative. It is the Creation myth, one that connects with the Christian faith of the author surprisingly well.In fact, the light-hearted tone of *The Hobbit* is the pefect bridge for the reader. It is the most \\"modern\\" in perspective, and introduces the reader to the peoples, geography, and events that they will find are connected from the First and Second Ages in *The Silmarillion* and the Third Age in *The Lord of the Rings*.J. R. R. Tolkien didn't like allegory, as he himself attested, but he did try to do \\"applicability\\", which is really just a way of saying that he didn't directly do \\"x = x\\" in the story, but allowed his Christian worldview to mesh with ancient epics in an effort to reconcile the two differing myths, or as he later convinced Lewis, to separate the \\"one, True Myth\\" to which the other myths copy and pay homage.Perhaps the most important link, however, to *The Lord of the Rings*, however, (besides the Ring itself, of course) is the importance of characters and the emphasis on certain truths and values. Among these are loyalty, the Providence of God, and the simultaneous righteousness and brutality of warfare.Before entering the military after the outbreak of World War I, Tolkien and his closest friends, who made up the core of a club that was likely the inspiration for the later Inklings and other clubs Tolkien loved to found at the various colleges at which he taught, had this notion of the glory of war, and how they would find renown for their deeds. This is shown in the perspective of Bilbo and the other heroes at the end of the story. While they were happy to have won the battle against evil, they also felt the horrors of war quite keenly.For the careful and patient reader, this book contains so many nuggets of truth for a \\"children's\\" book. It is most definitely *not* only a simple story. It is WELL worth your time.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading it. I loved all the characters.

I now want to read all the others."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wanted my daughter's introduction to The Hobbit to be by book, not the movie adaptation, so I certainly did not want a book featuring still pics from the movie on the cover. I also hoped the book we would become a cherished possession so I opted for the embossed hardcover with classic illustrations.So far it has been a big hit - she has been thoroughly engrossed in it for the last two weeks. She also picked up that this book is one of the &#34;keepers&#34; not to be hauled off to Goodwill when she outgrows it.Hopefully when she is older we can share the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story was about Baggins, Eldron, Beorn, The Eagle King and Gandalf. They were in search of the ring. Once they got the ring the job was to carry it to the Elf. Eldron and Beorn Baggins deliver the ring. They had some problems on Lonely Mountain trying their hardest to fight off goblins, maugs, giant spiders. My favorite adventures were when they were on Lonely Mountain where the dwarves are trying to get their treasure back from the dragon Smaug. I can relate to them all because me and my friends like to go on adventures and do fun stuff until I get tired. Once I am doing something fun I don't get tired.I think this book is a great book. This is the type of book that you can't put down.

The Hobbit is a very good book and that is the truth. To read it is to be bound by some mystical, unseen magic that transgresses times itself before the final page is turned.

Read this before Lord of the Rings. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"You are probably familiar with the Lord of the Rings series. But, do some of you wonder where it all started. For example, where did Bilbo find the ring? Well you're questions will be answered when you read the Hobbit. This is the exciting prequel to the Lord of the Rings. We meet Bilbo Baggins a hobbit who is thrust into an adventure with a band of dwarves and the wizard Gandalf. Gnadalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is an excellent thief and so he must go on this journey. The dwarves seek the treasure that was stolen by the dragon Smaug. The dwarves are led by Thorin Oakenshield. Along the way they meet trolls, goblins, elves, and the dragon Smaug. This is the first book where Gollum is first introduced and where Bilbo finds the ring and uses it. This book is a masterpiece that draws you in to every battle and makes you believe you are part of the story. If you loved the Lord of the Rings you will certainly love every action paked page of the Hobbit. Tolkien has proven once again that he is the master of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book. My mother used to read this book to me as a child, and I also used to watch the cartoon almost everyday. I recently picked up a copy of this book just to read for fun and I loved it as much as I always have.\\"The Hobbit\\" is about Bilbo Baggins of the shire. One day he is disrupted by a band of dirty dwarves and the famous wizard Gandolf. This band is looking for a burglur to travel with them to reclaim the dwarves old kingdom and fortune from the dragon Smaug.Chapter by Chapter find Bilbo and his band of Dwarves facing a new problem. It is in this book that The one ring that rules all, or the ring of power is found by Bilbo, and starts the wonderful story of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". This book is wonderful. Do not pass it up.Do keep in mind before reading this book though, that Tolkien wrote this as a book for children. There is a lot of singing and whatnot in here that can get a little annoying at times. But other than that it is a good story. The plot is very uncomplicated, as it should be for children, but dont let this turn you away. I would highly advise this book before you dive into the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel itself is one of the greatest works in the fantasy realm to date.

He first tends to be alittle timid, comfortable, independant, and secure in his little hole, also called his home. He is not afraid to follow his own path, and he craves adventure in a most un-hobbit like manner. He is more of the role model type for others. Biblo is later visited by Gandalf the wizard, and not to long after, twelve dwarves show up in his hole, to tell him about a quest they have planned, and what part they would like him to take part in. His quest is to go and rob Smaug the dragon for the treasure of Lonely Mountain. They want him to be their burglar. He is very creative, and has a large imagination. Overall, i think this book is good, but not great. It is more written for the fantasy type people, and who like wizardry. If you like The Lord Of The Rings, then you would like to read this book because it relates when when he finds a rind of magical powers. So if you like fantasy, wizardry type of books, then you would like to read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was in great condition (new) with great price and came in a reasonable amount of time.

The book becomes an adventure and becomes quite interesting when Bilbo Baggins began using the powers that the ring possessed. Prior to the adventure, the book is boring and dull.

A hobbit of the shire named Bilbo Baggins, is sent on a quest by the Maiar Gandalf the Grey to help a group of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield in order to defeat Smaug the Dragon. This book is incredibly well-written, however, I find the story to be very stale and ordinary. I recommend this book as a prelude to the incredible Lord of the Rings saga and the Silmarillion. Another good series is George R.R.

I found this book to be interesting; it kept me reading it and turning the pages. I thought the ending could have been alittle better because it was just too simple for the complexity of the book. Smog seemed to be a big force with a huge wrath but he was killed easily do to the lack of diamonds over the one part of his body that is the most vulnerable, his heart. I think there should have been a big war lasting days, carrying the drama out longer. This book was a bit slow in the middle and beginning but picked up at latter until the disappointing end.

Along the way they fight Goblins, Trolls, Wolves, and giant spiders. Bilbo and the dwarves never have to fight Smaug though. One of the BEST works of all time in my opinion and lots of other peoples' opinions. I STRONGLY encourage you to buy this book. You should also buy the Lord of the Rings because The Hobbit is a prelude to the Lord of the Rings.

It has to be something about the descriptive writing he uses in the book, and the way he describes the creatures. His writing is just so powerful that you just sit there for hours reading away. I&#65533;ve noticed that the &#65533;Lord of the Rings&#65533; trilogy is very popular, and most people are J.R.R. Tolkien fans. But what a lot of people don&#65533;t know is that \\"The Hobbit\\" has a very deep connection with the plot of &#65533;the Lord of the Rings&#65533;. It is not actually part of the series, but I guess you could call it a prologue. Read this book if you want to know how the trilogy began. Or, like I did, just read it cause it&#65533;s an awesomely good book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Hobbits are small little men-like beings that are known for their calm, non-adventuresome nature. This all changes when an unsuspecting hobbit named Bilbo, when Gandalf comes back to The Shire. He tells Bilbo of a far off land in peril. He tells of a dragon that is wreaking havoc to the people of the nation. But most of all he tells of an adventure, an adventure that Bilbo is not to keen to be a part of. With a band of dwarves, a wizard (Gandalf), and a Hobbit, the team sets off on their quest. Along the way, the group is met with many challenges including a bunch of trolls, some mischievous elves, and a creature named Gollum. It is in the cave of Gollum that Bilbo has to use his skill of riddles, to outsmart the creature and escape. On the way out of the cave, Bilbo finds a ring that will come to lead to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their quest leads them to the mountain of the dragon Smaug (Mt. Doom), where it is again up to the smart and cunning of the little Hobbit to save a town. Here, at the lake, and epic battle occurs. With the dragon slain, it is time for the return trip and for life to resume as normal. Bilbo has a hard time trying to readjust to his former life of a hobbit. He is constantly seeking adventure again, and so is looked down upon by the inhabitants of the Shire. This book is filled with action, adventure, and friendship. It is a great read, and starts the epic tale of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A bunch of hobbits and a wizard go a long adventure together. They face dangerous things on their adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book after watching the first part of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie at the year 2000. I loved the movie and you could tell, I guess; but this book struck as directed toward the younger readers.I do not mind the juvenile material, but the conversation was more that I can stand. And other than that it was a fine story.If you had watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, you'd know that it started with a hobbit (one of the Hobbits which is a tribe of halflings) named Bilbo, who was trying to have a big party for his elleventeen birthday (111 in the hobbit tongue, don't you think it is very childish for me, sigh). This story, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is the sole account of Bilbo's adventures, and is the predecessor of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"Gandalf, who appears in the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" appears here too, and is one of the integral components of the story. He introduces Bilbo to 12 dwarfs (or dwarves as he insanely like to write it). The 12 dwarfs take Bilbo, who reluctantly agree to accompany them, on a trip to kill a dragon (what can be more childish). These dwarfs have some strange (childish) names, like dori, ori, nori, oin, and gloin.They encounter some trolls, goblins (or orcs), and Bilbo meets a strange creature called Gollum. He gets his ring from there. They meet some more odd creatures and then reach the place where the dragon is.They actually kill the dragon and then have a big fight with some other armies. Bilbo forsakes the dwarfs, for some reason or another. Things must be fixed, so Bilbo becomes a friend of the dwarfs one more time. He gets his share from the treasure of the dragon (all dragons must have treasures, you did not know that? oh my!) and then goes back to his hobbit hole, where he lives.You are welcome to read, you might not get bored, but I am not all that enthusiastic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There is no action, no underlying them, it's too gory, but, it wasn't horrible. I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games. And people with no life and lots of time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a kind of prelude for The Lord of the Rings, but it lacks some of the good style found in the latter. You could tell me the style is the same, as well as many characters, but I can still find a difference between the books, that makes better TLR.If you are buying this book, the story, etc. are OK, but I recommend you to get TLR too. You'll enjoy the whole saga this way."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While I admire Tolkein's imagination and ability to create such a vivid, interesting world, I found the book quite dull.The characters: Bilbo: Yes, I know he is not an adventurer (and perhaps the reader is supposed to identify with him), but that doesn't make his whining any more pleasant. His luck seems to explain some very fortuitous events, but makes it feel as though the book was written backwards (Okay, _this_ is going to happen, so _this_ had to have happened here.).Gandalf: a powerful wizard presumably fighting for good, but condescending and self-important.and a group of dwarves only really distinguished by Bombur the Fat and Thorin the Leader.It was interesting to see where some other fantasy realms got their ideas, but I found it difficult to pick the book up. Nothing important happens for periods at a time. Of course, the benefit of this is a more in-depth view of Tolkien's world. Don't get me wrong: the world is fascinating, but I'd much rather read about more interesting characters living in a very similar world (Dragonlance novels by Weis and Hickman come to mind.). Why suffer through the bad parts when everything can be wonderful?The only moment I felt any connection to the book was a section towards the end, when someone admits their faults and moves on. (I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't read this.)I've read worse (Some other Dragonlance novels come to mind.), but I'd only recommend this to fantasy historians or those who have already enjoyed the better books in the genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My book is about a hobbit named Biblo Baggins.

Grades 6-1"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book didn't expand my imagination, like Harry Potter does. It was slow moving, and quite uneventful, until the very end. The book didn't become decent, until it was almost over. The ending was exciting. But every event up until then meant very little to me and did very little for me. I didn't even like the style in which the book was written. I actually give it 2 and half stars, because it wasn't horrible. At one point I did enjoy reading it. I just didn't think it was the great book every says it is. However I will read the whole Lord of the Ring series. Because it is not an insufferable book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The little people win, of course, but boy does it take awhile for THAT to happen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Unlike its admittedly horrible sequels, I liked this book a lot. It was light and funny, and flavoured with a wonderfully dry and ironic style of narration. Unlike LOTR, which was overstuffed with useless information, The Hobbit never stops being exciting.

They play on his &quot;Took&quot; side which is his mothers side. The Tooks were adventure seekers, they liked going on journeys. Other Hobbits found the Tooks less respectable than the other side of Blibo's family. The ohter hobbits loathe going on adventures, in fact they hate going anywhere very far from home.(Adventures make Hobbits late for dinner). One thing you should know about Hobbits is that they really like to eat and sleep. They have about six meals a day. I only gave this two stars because it seemed like the author was in a hurry so he ended the book. Like he really had to go to the bathroom, so he ended the book as fast as possible. It also seemed like the author got really into the story and when he came to the end(Last four chapters) he didn't know how to end it. I am hopeful for the other books in the seires.

This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"(...) The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien gets 2 stars. It has some parts that are exciting, but not many. It contains heroes, hardships and good vs. evil, which is were the 2 stars come from. I don't recommend it. While I was reading I had to make myself sit down and read. It wasn't enjoyable like reading should be.This fantasy story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who didn't like to be bothered. One day the wizard Gandalph and about 14 homeless dwarfs come visit him in his quiet little hobbit hole. They changed everything. He is soon pulled into their quest of fighting goblins, spiders, evil orcs, and wolves in hope of finding the treasure that the great dragon Smaug protects.Most of the book is dull and tiresome. In my opinion you could skip 5 pages every now and then and not miss a thing. For instance, Tolkien uses 24 pages to express what happened when the dwarfs first met Bilbo, when all that was needed was about 8. He wasted about 100 pages total in the book which has 304 pages.Although The Hobbit is a bit slow, it shows the never-ending battle between good and evil. Tolkien portrays this well. When Bilbo comes face to face with evil he uses poems and riddles, which are challenging to figure out.The Hobbit also has a worthy plot of heroes and hardships. This can relate to other books such as the Harry Potter series and Homer's Poem about Ulysses. Bilbo is said to be a hero many times when he is faced with a challenge. One of the dwarfs complain \\"I'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can not get it any other way...\\" They had many hardships such as food, shelter, and ways of transportation.All in all, i would not reccomend this book. Even though it has a few good qualities such as heroes, hardships, and the relationship between good and evil, it is still boring and dull. It only deserved 2 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the &quot;Leatherette&quot; editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the &quot;Leatherette&quot; Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased by mistake, did not read but I'm sure it is a good read and may purchase in the future."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Test review..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I own many copies of the Hobbit to include the audio and ebook.

I love Tolkien's works and in light of the release of the first part of The Hobbit in theaters I decided I should read this book. If you only buy one book for the kindle make it this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of my favorites !!!! Can't wait to see the movies and how well they will match up :) &lt;3"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked how this book for Kindle included the pictures and runes that are in the actual books. Great layout."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Writing a review about the Hobbit is kind of like writing a review about the Bible, or the US Constitution. Just silly."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a great book, the narration was incredible. I will reread this over and over! On to the Lord of the rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the illustrations and maps in the Kindle version are not as good as the printed book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a book that's full of adventure, from start to finish. The reader will enjoy heroism, song, and good vs. evil. The reader clearly imagines landscapes that are English of long ago in description.A journey ensues by the main characters, Bilbo (the reluctant hero), the Dwarves, and the wizard Gandalf. The characters pass through well described places such as Rivendell, The Misty Mountains and Mirkwood on their way to Lonely Mountain, in order to take back treasure stolen by the great dragon Smaug.One of the things I liked most about The Hobbit is that we can all find our inner-Hobbit; the part of us that wants nothing but an easy and comfortable life. But there is still something inside all of us that perks up at the thought of adventure and a journey into the unknown.The Hobbit is a book that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I'm nearly 50 years old and have read The Hobbit for the first time; and now I understand why The Hobbit is such a long lasting favorite and fondly remembered by all who read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is an amazing read for all ages and demographics. There is a large amount to be learned from a book like this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this story many, many times since I was 16 (and am now re-reading prior to the Hobbit movie release at the age of 50) and I continue to enjoy the story's depth, intrigue and mystique.While Tolkien was no slouch as a conceptual artist, the story this time is beautifully enhanced with the amazing art of Alan Lee. Throughout the book artwork is included at the beginning of each chapter, on multiple occasions within each chapter and especially at crucial moments of the story. For first time readers and children especially (Tolkien wrote the book for 8-10 year olds) this significantly aids in the interpretation of Tolkien's succinct and masterfully crafted descriptions of characters, the landscape of Middle Earth and the action scenes too!Tolkien fans and Lord of the Rings (LOTR) Movie fans will know that Alan Lee and another artist were selected by Peter Jackson and used as the principal 'conceptual artists' during the production of the movie trilogy, because he loved their art work and how they had accurately and creatively adapted Tolkien's words to portray his world and mythology. If you have the LOTR 12 disc box set - in the extras DVDs of the LOTR you will see that Alan Lee embraced the movie production beyond what he was employed for and has a true love of all things created by Tolkien and of Middle Earth itself. Alan Lee is a master conceptual artist and with a few quick pencil or brush strokes (e.g. sitting down in the 'proposed set' for the Hobbiton township) he quickly and accurately depicts Tolkien's vision of words into a picture or scene for all viewers to enjoy.This book has a significant number of detailed pencil sketches and superb water-colours of key events, characters and action. I have read this book on my IPAD which allows you to 'zoom-in' on each sketch and colour drawing (I presume the Kindle Fire has the same functionality) and you can interrogate what's happening or what Alan's trying to portray to the reader, in even more detail. Superb reading and enjoyment. Cannot recommend it enough.I also have Alan Lee's 'LOTR Sketchbook' compiled during the production of the LOTR, again another masterpiece of conceptual artwork; I hope as he was employed again as the conceptual artist for the Hobbit Trilogy that he will produce a 'Hobbit Trilogy Sketchbook'."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Sometimes I wish the fantasy genre didnt exist because some people wont read Tolkien because they say they dont like fantasy.

It is fun to read and makes you want to spend more time in that fantasy land with the Hobbits."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A timeless classic that will transport you to a world full of hobbits, dwarfs, elves, goblins, trolls, wizards and dragons. This is a great book for adults and teens. Let your imagination shape the images of the hero's and villain's, as Bilbo and the dwarves try to complete their quest for their treasue under the mountain.

Just read it already. That said, I'll type a bit more to hit the threshold."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book many times in my life and get something out of it every time. Many lessons can be learned from this and all of Tolkien's writing. I picked up this version to have on my phone and enjoy being able to highlight phrases and parts I want to note or read again later. Those just getting into this book from the movie should make sure to read it too! Pick up a copy and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wonderful reading for any agegroup.

Can't wait for the movie to be released on DVD."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It has been more that 15 years since I've read this book originally, so i decided to pick it up again. I love the innocence of the story, It is beautiful and intriguing. However, it is relatively easy to put down. I read 2 other books since rereading this novel, which could be due to several mitigating factors. However, what ever the reason, it is still a classic and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great Book! and great service!

When I buy used hardback I prefer that. Instead I received a brand new reprint. Still it is an excellent buy. It is that same edition, just minus the wear and tear. Weird thing to complain about I know, but still would've liked it slightly more &#34;loved&#34; Get this book now, after the movie trilogy comes out evryone is gonna jack the prices on this.

Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a nice, big book with a lot of beautifully painted illustrations inside. One thing I didn't expect was that the cover shown is actually the cover protector (I don't know if it said that in the description I read) and the real cover is very plain, green and with gold writing. All the same, I'm thrilled to have it and would recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I originally read The Hobbit in 7th Grade. It was the first full length book I ever read. Up until that point I had no real desire to read. I lost my virginity to The Hobbit and went from reading my first book in 2 days to reading a book a week for the rest of my life.The Hobbit is a great first book for anyone new to Fantasy. Although it is not sophisticated enough for some readers; it sets the stage for the true masterpiece of fantasy: The Lord of the Rings. You cannot read TLOTR without first reading The Hobbit. I would categorize The Hobbit almost as a children's book. Whereas The Lord of the Rings is definately for adults.Please take the time to read The Hobbit and then read TLOTR. You are in for a wonderful treat. Then do your kid's a favor, read The Hobbit to them at an early age. You will see their eyes light up with wonder and fascination. They will thank you many times years down the road."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is unbelievable how he came up with this story and it is only the introduction of the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is defiantly a great book but I really liked The Lord of the Rings better. The hobbit is very important though because it sets the stage for the ring trilogy. By itself it is still an engaging,interesting, and enchanting story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recommend The Hobbit to anyone who enjoys a book you can't put down. You should have at least a 6th grade reading level. It is about a hobbit named Bilbo Bagins who is a normal hobit until one day... An unexpected party shows up with lots of dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They go on a mission to find the evil dragon Smaug who has stolen treasure from thier ancestors. They are trying to win it back It is the first book of a series of 4. If you read this book you should read the other three called The Lord of The Rings trilogy. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a real page turner because he keeps the suspense going. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. That is why I recommend The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The only other equal books I've read are The Lord of the Rings series.Tolkien was a genius when it came to books. He really knew how to write.Tolkien will always be the best author (in my eyes that is).Tolkien is a recomended author from me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The only other equal books I've read are The Lord of the Rings series.Tolkien was a genius when it came to books.

A must read for all who enjoy fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, is this better than any other trade paperback version of The Hobbit? I dunno. But this is THE HOBBIT. I have read it about a billion times to my kids and I CANNOT WAIT for the movie version this month!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A must read for all LOTR fans. I can't wait to compare it to the movie to see what they added, what they kept, and what they removed for &#34; artistic&#34; reasons."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the classic tale from Tolkien -- the one that started it all. Not only is the read essential fiction for lovers of fantasy, it is also essential for lovers of well written plots, characters, and development.Keep in mind that it was intended as Childrens Lit back in the day, and it's still better written, with a superior vocabulary, than many adult fiction novels today.It is engaging, captivating, and mesmerizing. If you are able to suspend disbelief at all, you will find yourself immediately drawn into the story.Tolkien paints his surroundings vividly, with excellent characteristics, appropriate details, and a historical lore that tells you these people are real, they have existed for ages, and they are not to be trifled with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's nice to add this to my Kindle collection. Paperbacks are old and yellowed. Hadn't re-read this in decades and even got my husband to give it a chance. He loved it too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Such a nice, light read. Love how Tolkien builds the character of Bilbo, giving us all the understanding and hope that we can become someone of character and courage, even in the hardest of circumstances."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My father read this book to me when I was a little girl. It was awesome reading it again. :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this in anticipation of the upcoming movie because I heard that they are going to break it down into 3 movies. I couldn't believe that they were going to stretch this book into three movies. I don't want to be sidetracked so I'll keep the review to this book. If you read The Lord of the Rings this is a great pre-LOTR book that has the same adventure that you see from the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you need my review, here it is. The best young adult's book of all time, bar none. Sorry Harry Potter fans, but this is head and shoulders above all others. Like the Potter books, it's also great for adults as well. Read the book before you see the movie! From what I've seen, they've taken greater liberties with this movie than they did with LOTR. Galadrial and Legolas, and presumably others, do not appear in this book, and I don't see how, if it took LOTR 3 movies to complete, how can it take 3 movies to do the &#34;Hobbit&#34;? Anyway, enough about the movie, a great book, a classic. I wish I'd been made to read this book in high school (although I'd already read it in 5th grade), instead of &#34;Mill on the Floss&#34; or &#34;Walden&#34; Gah!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ordered this so I could get the narration before going on a car trip, and it was great. The reader had slightly different voices for most of the characters and never got them confused. Listening to this made me really excited about the release of the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a must for any real Lord of the Rings fan. I would encourage reading this novel before seeing the film. There are so many wonderful parts that have been altered or left out entirely."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a wonderful classic that i don't regret finding time to read full of wonderful creatures and shocking twists it will be one of my favorite books for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"An easy way to describe this book was adventurous and enthralling. I assure anyone who enjoys a good take on Bilbo Baggins's story would enjoy other pieces conducted by J. R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although I am still reading the book, I have read it a few years ago and I am amazed at what I missed the first time. Re-read it if you haven't read it in awhile. It will amaze you"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It has been many years since I last read The Hobbit. I found it as enjoyable as before all the adventures Bilbo, the Dwarves and the Wizard undertake."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"We were very well entertained by this book. SInce, it is now a popular movie, the book is even more fun to experience. Tolkien has provided us with many great stories. This one is right up there with the best of them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book kept me fixed on something to do & it also kept me from boredom on the plane to Miami. I was reading for 5 hours when I fell asleep. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't make Thorins death more ceremonial. All in all it was a really good book to read. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a Tolkein fan so I like all the extra notes this book has in it. It is great"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Don't see the movie, read the book. The orignial story is far better than the screenplay and if you are used to being confused by JRR Tolkien's writing style in the Lord of The Rings series, rest assured, this is much better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a good book that gives you a lot of background for middle earth mythology. I would recomand this for all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is very good.

My husband bought it on my kindle for me and i got to read it before i saw the movie! i can't wait to see how the movies bring the book to life. by far this is my favorite book that JRR Tolkien writes. It is a lot more light hearted than the Lord of the rings. Definitly a must read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbitt elegantly presents an entertaining fantasy quest story in which the main character, a hobbitt named Bilbo Baggins, is an antihero (or, at least, a reluctant hero). The story describes a beautiful world in which live all manner of fantastic beings - dwarves, elves, hobbits, goblins, trolls, men, and a dragon named Smaug. These various somewhat disimilar beings live in such proximity that, if they only move around a small bit, they will affect each other in significant ways. That is what I like about the story. Mr. Tolkien succinctly describes and compares and contrasts these different beings as the story goes along in a way that, I think, provides a metaphor for relationships among different cultures in the real world in which we live. He shows that some differences are tolerable and, even, desirable and advantageous; that some differences are insurmountable; and, that this is just the nature of the world that must be handled, sometimes carefully.Some may not agree with me when I say that Mr. Tolkien's descriptions are succinct. This leads to what I dislike about the book. I wish for even MORE elaboration. I wish the descriptions had been as full and elegant and as wide in scope as I know Mr. Tolkien could have made them - as in The Silmarillion (in my opinion, the real Tolkien masterpiece). Of course, I know this would have dramatically changed the realized audience and that may not have followed Mr. Tolkien's intentions. This is just a personal wish of mine.This is a wonderful story for readers of all ages (8+ ?); however, I would not rank it as one of the greatest stories of all time as many other Tolkien fans seem to do.The story contains some wonderful lessons for younger (and, I'm sure, some older) readers about self-reliance in the face of adversity and fear; commitment to one's values and relationships, especially when that is difficult; and, realizing that sometimes one must (even reluctantly) do things one would not have normally chosen to do in order to lead a life worth living."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am currently rereading this book for maybe the sixth or seventh time. If you don't like this book you haven't an imagination nor a soul."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is modeled on Beowulf, but yet anti-Beowulf, in that the fierce dragon is stalked not by the toughest guy around who prefers fighting hand-to-hand, but by a rag tag collection of dwarves blundering around the countryside, at times the opposite of intentionality.The lair, the hoard, the smoke--but games of wit and tricks of evasion, culminating in some other guy shooting down the dragon based on inside information mediated by a bird.Another opposite trend of this is the way the characters strengthen and develop, whereas in Beowulf, the hero ages and deteriorates. These dwarves, by contrast, are already old, but become more adventuresome, and more bold.The skeleton of the story, though, is still Beowulf. But much improved by the inversions. Another refreshing twist on the old story is the way both Gandalf and Baggins both hold their accomplishments lightly, Baggins preferring to go home to his pouch of tobacco and his pantry, and Galdalf vanishing somewhere undefined after closing off a conversation with Bilbo on the terminal point of how individuals acting on their own, yet have a part in fulfulling someone else's prophecy.All the while as I was reading through this, for the first time since grade school, I was reminded of what I guess I'll call &quot;Middle Led Zeppelin&quot; and the Song Remains the Same scenes with Robert Plant dramatizing the songs of quest and discovery, many words of which seem lifted from the same old English sounds reflected in Tolkein's work, particularly this text.So if Tolkein is updating Beowulf, were Robert Plant and Jimmy Page revising the Hobbit, or at least struggling to interpret it? Dwarves on a far cliff with dueling stratocasters? Elves down below churning and hopping around in curious pagan synchronicity? I'm thinking sure, why not?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was great. Bilbo Baggins was a perfect character for this book.At first he seems like a coward at heart, then he becomes a fighter when he sees how much he is needed. The plot was interesting, Gandalf meets Bilbo, and so do dwarfes. Bilbo goes out and faces trolls,Gollum, and other funny things. If you would like to read a really good book, read this."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is maybe the best way to enter the world of Fantasy, it is one of the first books of the genere, and everyone eho writes today a fantasy book - takes something from it. I first heard the book from my father who read a chapter to me me every night, since then I have read it again many times, and was amazed each time again from the world J.R.R. tolkien created. It is a delitfullbook read with many well done characters and great advntures. If you have even a slight interest in entering the world of fantasy, I can't think of a better way..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was wonderfull! Like the person who previously reviewed it my only regret is not reading it sooner! This is the thrilling and mystical story of a respectiful and sqeamish little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins of Bagshot row who is visited one day by an extrodinarly renowned wizard selling, er, adventures and eventually somewhat &quot; tricking &quot; Bilbo into accompaning thirteen easily likable dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost gold. I won't tell any more, for that would ruin it but it is a wonderfull and whimsical story that sweeps you away from your troubles into the land og wargs and wizards and things as evil Goblins and as good as Elrond the occupant of the last homely house in the mysty mountains. I will probably read this book again one day because it is wonderfull. J.R.R Tolkien was one of the most original and creative writers ever with his brilliant poetry and songs and descriptions of far off places of fear and brilliance. In short buy this booka nd read it, you won't reqret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a classic, a must read for anyone who loves fantasy. From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a true classic fantasy tale. It can spark the immagination of the young and the old. In this respect it is much like the Harry Potter series. I am 33 and I enjoyed Harry Potter as much as any fantasy tale. The Hobbit was groundbreaking in that it paved the way for generations of future science fiction writters. It was written in 1937 and to this day it sparks the immagination of the young and the old. It is a great book to introduce young minds to reading and it is a fun tale you can later enjoy as an adult. The Hobbit has passed the test of time. Not too many books written in the 1930's are still so loved as the Hobbit. It is a treat that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is certainty up there with my favorites.

It has lots of illustrations and pictures and lots of notes relating to the text. If you're not someone who likes all that, you can just read the main text without reading the notes.

The songs were kind of boring, and the plot was little more than a long series of mishaps, but it's told in a captivating narritive fasion that will keep your attention.

Get it with the narration as well, it is so very with it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Long before Frodo gained possession of the One Ring, before the great council in Rivendell or the terrors of the mines of Moria, there was another hobbit, Bilbo Baggins by name, who had his own adventure. This book relates that adventure.Though it explains various parts of the Lord of the Rings series (such as how Bilbo got the Ring), this is truly a tale independent of the well-known trilogy. Very little of the journey actually deals with the finding of the Ring, and the focus rests on Bilbo and his journey with Gandalf and a troop of dwarves.The story, as it is told, is of Bilbo's part in a quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and recover lost treasure and land of his dwarven companions'. The tale abounds in adventures, encounters with mystical creatures, hardships, and every other element for which Tolkien's stories are famous.This book was written for children (the reading being much easier than Tolkien's other works), but is a timeless classic which can doubtless be enjoyed by young and old alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Perhaps THE BEST little adventure story every written. Written for kids but certainly enjoyed by all. It has trolls, dragons, a kindly but strange wizard, dwarves, and of course Hobbits. It's really a story of bravery and strong friendships in the face of mishaps and evil things. What stands out in this book and The Lord of the Rings is that the world Tolkien creates sucks you in hopelessly. It only takes a few sentances and you really feel like you are along for the journey.Tolkien creates a world with a huge history full of peoples and monsters and dwarves, with nature playing a large role in all of his books. The history part is small in The Hobbit since its focused on the journey and characters. The Hobbit is meant to be a lead-in to The Lord of the Rings, which has much more history and nature and more characters than the Hobbit. 'Rings is a darker tale and much more serious. Its harder to read, much longer, and I think the best adventure story ever written.In response to Chris Fletcher, you have some valid criticisms of Tolkien. His writing style is a bit, well, sticky. When you think things should be moving faster and faster and the action is coming, you instead get \\"and then the big troll (or whatever) was killed. On to the next adventure.\\"However, the upside to this is you really feel like you are reading a kind of history book found in Middle Earth. I think Tolkien was a bit nuts and that's why his stuff was so good. He half-believed he really was writing and living in the world of his own making. He created entire languages, maps, unforgetable characters and mostly sad but gripping tales of adventure. Some people can't get through Tolkien's sticky prose when reading the lengthy The Lord of the Rings and I understand why, but stick with it! After reading the whole thing you will be glad you did. Remember no one can tell you how to read a book. If you come accross a paragraph about Bilbo's half-sister and all her family and the history of her cat, just skip it if you want. Tolkien really does go out on a limb sometimes escpecially with all the names and family trees and fictional history.However, this same strange Tolkien style allows for re-reading and getting much more information, and a sense of depth and life to Middle Earth that is truely amazing. I have read the series, both the Hobbit and LOTR twice and I got much more the second time through. I read it slower and tried to keep the characters and places in my head. You can buy a nice map book which lays out all of tolkiens worlds in detail including battles and paths that the characters follow. Its by Karen Wynn Fonstad and has a lot of detail. Careful though, some plot happenings are given away in the tracking of characters and the battle maps :DIf you really want to get background info you have to start with the Silmarillion. And that beast can drive you crazy. Parts of it are amazing to read however and it explains some of the history that was confusing in LOTR. Where did Galadriel come from? What or who exactly is Gandalf? What's a wizard? What are the counterparts to Sauron and other evil in middle earth? Surely there must be some good gods or angel like beings? So, Silmarillion: very difficult, for tolkein fans mostly. Its long, hundreds of names, not a continuous story. It does explain a great deal about the gods and formation of Middle Earth and many things and people and places that show up later in the Hobbit and LOTR.Hobbit: very easy fun read, not a whole lot of depth, short, great characters, great adventure.The Lord of the Rings: medium difficulty, lots of depth, some history, lots of names, some difficult and confusing paragraphs, but a truely great tale. The kind of book where you find yourself kinda stunned after reading the last sentance. (The movie is not bad, but messed things up a bit, read the book! Notice that Tolkien's name is not on the movie. The family took their name off it because of the Hollywood treatment.)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the best book i have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkein's now classic fairy tale of the land of Middle Earth and its inhabitants, the Hobbits, is an enchanting and mythical story of the underdog hero Bilbo. The so-called prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually a splice or intersection of the Ring in which Bilbo discovers the ring in Golem's cave. The story of Bilbo and his adventures is classic lore of slaying the dragon to win the pot of gold. With his band of misfits and hungry tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum gnomes, there is a comic ambiance to the story that helps the reader through some of the slow scenes. While this is not a must read to understand the Ring Trilogy, it certainly is a worth while read unto itself without the burden of two more books to complete the journey. Tolkein's writing is fun and witty while asking the reader to understand a few new words in his created language. There are times as well that the story slows down either for narrative purposes where the writing speaks to you, the reader, or for the group to sing a song to celebrate their happiness in the style of medieval celtic literature. While the book is reccomended and in some cases manditory, it's an overall enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is very exciting to follow up to half of the book, but eventually becomes kind of boring.

But it is amusing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i remember watching the cartoon of this with my dad on sunday afternoons when i was little, it thrilled me, just thrilled me. I think this is the best book Tolkien ever wrote. I was never a fan of the Trillogy, but i loved this book. You cant go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a very exciting book. It has wierd and interesting creatures that were unique and not your average fairytale copy cats. It makes the reader feel as if he/she is traveling and starving and tired and scared along with the rest of the characters. I also like how the author describes the scenery so vividly. He paints a picure in your mind that of all the places bilbo and his company of dwarves visit.Gandalf the wizard is my favorite character. He always seems to know what's going on, even when he isn't around. He is smart and uses his cleveness and magic to help the group out of tough situations. Sometimes he tricks people in a harmless and friendly way. He makes friends with the alot of people through out the novel. He has human , dwarf, hobbit, elf and magical friends that can transform into animals.I liked the plot in this book alot. It kept my attention and made me want to keep reading until I found out what would happen next. The best part was when bilbo tricked Gollum in the Goblin caves. Even though the plot was complex it was not too hard to understand and was very interesting.This is an interseting book that will keep your attention until the end. It is fun and exciting and describes everything in great detail. It is so good that I can't wait to begin Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is probably one of the best books ever written in history. It keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, and makes me feel as if I was there, walking beside the group of dwarves or Bilbo himself. The details are rich, you can feel the awesomeness of this amazing story, and it is a _great_ prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's interesting looking at the level of greed in the dwarves. They care for nothing but treasure, or so it seems. Another thing is probably Tolkein's writing style and how it changes from this book to the rest of the trilogy. The Hobbit is a must read for anyone who enjoys books and diving in to a great story. This book is truly amazing!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book has some big words and is difficult for younger readers but the story is great. You can picture the story in your mind's eye.

They take Bilbo on an exciting journey to get their gold back from the evil dragon Smaug. About half way through the journey the life saving wizard must leave on important matters. This is when they really start heading into troubles. Bilbo must take charge and be the thief that Gandalf told the dwarfs he was. Bilbo manages to save his friends many times and even discover something magical. Quiet no more, Mr. Baggins earns the respect of the dwarfs and learns that life isn't as easy as he once thought.I really liked this book because it is action packed.

Tolkien writes of an adventurous tale of a little hobbit and some friends. It is set in a fantasy world where good is always at battle with evil.

The main character is a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Hobbits are well mannered, small and fat creatures. This story is about a jorney which dragged Bilbo out of his hobbit-hole(a place where he is secluded from danger and anything that might harm him. Bilbo;s adventure brought out courage he didn't even know existed. None of his companions believed in him at first because he seemed so small and useless. After Bilbo saved all of their lives, they began to respect him. Throughout the book, Bilbo hets many chances to prove his courage. In one part of the book, Bilbo's companions get in serious trogble with a group of giant spiders. It was Bilbo;s chance to prove he was courages. Bilbo did all he could to help his friends and in the end became a hero. This book shows that everyone has courage somwhere inside of them and they sould try to fingd it.

But the wizard gandolf comes and rather takes him on a frightning, dazziling and thrilling adventure with 15 homeless dwarves to capture a stolen treasure-a treasure stolen by the great dragon smoug-the tire of an entire nation! The dwarves rather dislike Bilbo intill they discover what he is hidding as a secret-a magic ring he found on the trail.

This book was very good if you like adventurous funny books I recommend it to everyone"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent piece of work done by JRR Tolkien. It combines adventure, fantasy, and folklore together making a thrilling book. This book was written because JRR was a professor of English at Oxford and had wanted to write something like this for a long time. The book shows that he spent much time on the book. Through this work, he became the father of the fantasy/adventure genre. I had to knock a star off though for the confusing laguage he used in conversation and in his descritions. Perhaps if one likes to think about something very deeply, this language would be a great source of thinking material. However, I enjoy the reading. I have to have adventure after adventure after adventure. This book portrayed that, however, the language did slow it up a bit. All in all, a very excellent piece of work by JRR.

Most people seem to read The Hobbit before The Lord of the Rings, but I got it backwards.I enjoyed the novel well enough, I guess, maybe, but I found it lacking the weight that The Lord of the Rings has. It is a simple story about a simple quest to get treasure back from Smaug the dragon. The episodic nature of the novel added to its simplicity: the band go here, fight something, win, move on.One of the best scenes is with Bilbo Baggins and Gollum asking riddles to each other. The dialogue is fun, and it helps see the origins of Gollum and the hobbits to be explored later.

The story is fantastic, whimsical, engaging, and has a moral depth uncharacteristic of many modern novels. It is considerably lighter both in content and length than The Lord of the Rings and is meant generally for a younger audience, but that does not affect it adversely. I won't go into too much detail about the story itself. I'll just say that if you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and do so! I'll focus the rest of my review on the version that I bought.I got the Hardcover released on September 18, 2012, which has a green cover with a little &#34;Now a Major Motion Picture&#34; emblem over one of Tolkein's illustrations of Smaug. The binding and physical quality of the book is, of course, more than satisfactory. It includes a decent copy of Thorin's map, although it is spread over two pages, and thus some of the center of the map is lost. I would have preferred to see a fold-out map. It contains some excellent illustrations by Tolkein at various points in the story, including a drawing of Bilbo's hobbit hole.

Don't think Hobbit should be made into 3 movies. LOT trilogy is my favorite of all time. HOBBIT is more mundane."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A true good versus evil story and what is best about it is the hero isn't always the typical hero and is often makes the decision most of us would make in difficult situations. The best thing about this Hobbit book was the illustrations. I have a 6 year old and and 8 year old that I am reading these stories to and most of the illustrations in other books are pretty simple drawings. These illustrations are ones that you could look at for quite some time while dad was reading because of the detail they have in them. I will purchasing the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the next few months and the only ones I will be buying now are the ones illustrated by Alan Lee."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had read the Lord of the Ring series but had not read the Hobbit.
