But the truth is, words are not enough. I've read CITR for the first time when I was 16. I'm 19 now and have read other great novels from authors such as Vonnegut, Heller and Rendell, but Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is still number one in my heart. I've promoted this book to so many people, I should work for Salinger's publisher or something. People say they're obsessed with this book, well guess what? I'm part of that statistic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I liked catcher in the rye. Everytime I put it down, I couldn't wait to begin reading it again. The book is humorous at times and very honest, which makes it funny. Holden Caulfield, seems a little disillusioned about people and how phony they are and the other characters in the story are extremely realistic. Like Phoebe, Ackeley Kid, Sally? (the one with the loud voice), and Stratedler. But it's too bad Holden never got to meet &quot;Old Jane&quot; again. this is a good book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have read this book three times, and it still remains as one of my favorites. Holden Caulfield is such an incredibly lovable character, and getting to know him was amusing. His sense of humor is great, and the way he stereotypes people and hates 'phonies' made me laugh. It was such a wonderful book and I thought that the language added to the flavor and style. It was to the point, and very vivid. I loved it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i read this book because of the acclaim it received from my fellow teen readers, the only critics whose reviews i will acknowledge. they said that i would be able to relate to Holden, and that his cyncism and bitterness would be familiar to me. from this description, i expected an intelligent, profound, thoughtful character who was misunderstood by the rest of the world, and frustrated by the lack of understanding he was getting from those around him. holden did not fit this description-actually i did not find him to be intelligent at all. but i think what makes the book so amusing and thought-provoking IS holden's immaturity. the reader is not threatened by him, since his character has a humorous pretentious quality that is endearing and not bothersome. the book didn't cause any deep questions and about the meaning of life to arise, but instead provided a succint, comical, and thoughtful celebration of teenage existence and the thought process of the undeveloped mind."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but my friend pushed it on me. One day I had nothing to read on the subway, I had in my bag, I opened the first page, and I didn't stop reading it until it was finished. It's one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although considered a classic, I would not rate this book highly. It has no plot and becomes tedious to read after the first 70 some pages. I think I know why so many people rate the book highly; it does a good job of showing the thoughts of an adolescent on the verge of becoming an adult. But the lack of plot and meaning just ruined it for me. I would compare this book to an abstract painting. I liked it at first because I thought it was original, much like the way abstract painting was original at one point. But after reading the whole thing, it was like I had spent a day going through an abstract art museum."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I did not like this book. I am a teenager and I found this book very depressing. It was confusing and he told stories that just got off the subject of being in New York and such. This book is not worth reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read Catcher in the Rye for my AP English Composition course's required reading. It is misleading to stereotype this novel as &quot;teenage angst summarized,&quot; because, frankly, I could rarely identify with Holden's experiences, though many of his feelings could have been more poignant had they been written in more lucid prose. There were parts of the novel that moved me, and by the end of the book I was NOT praising it as a literary masterpiece, but I knew that Holden's psychology had been brilliantly developed through Salinger's writing, or depiction of 1949 adolescent slang. I frequently could not relate to Holden's point-of-view, much less his undertakings. His character was so different from mine, yet I appreciated it because there were some basic deep-rooted reasons for the way he acted throughout the book that justify his anger [Allie, James Castle]. He is not a deplorable character, as some have said, instead he frequently obtained my sympathy. Everyone keeps mentioning the episode with the prostitute, in which nothing really occurs. He does not act as a perverted teenager in search of sexual satisfaction at all, do you not remember the outcome of this subplot? The &quot;sex,&quot; drinking, smoking, and excessive swearing can be overlooked if one is trying to comprehend where Holden is coming from, since these factors are not meant to encourage or praise these habits, but to illustrate Holden sincerely. I do not know if I would ever recommend this book. While some parts are truly human and affecting [Allie, Phoebe, James Catle, Mr. Antonili] most of it is just Holden telling you his story, which involves many glimpses into his mindset. What really made me keep reading were the other characters in the book and the original way in which Holden described them. It is not a bad book, but it is definitely overrated. If you're curious about it, check it out from the library. And if you read the review of the guy recommending Atlas Shrugged by Aynd Rand--do yourself a favor, don't buy that TRASH of stock characters and propaganda."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was 16 years old. It was the best book I ever had read up to that point and still is today. The true message of the book has to do with one of the most perplexing aspects of life and adulthood. Understanding the implications could be life-changing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't understand why so many people are raving over this book. It wasn't bad but I didn't really see a plot. It was just a bunch of chatter. I wish I could have gotten out of it what so many people say they've gotten out of it. I love reading and am very disappointed. Maybe I just need to read it again... If you have any comments PLEASE e-mail and explain to me your feelings. Maybe it will help me &quot;get&quot; it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is great! I don't recommend it for anyone under 13, there is lots of swearing... It's great how Holden decides what HE needs and wants for himself and never follows in anyones tracks. It is also a great summer-time read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I havent finished this book yet. I hate reading, but I have to read it for school. I am up to chapter 7 and so far it really is not that bad. He is a messed up kid but who isnt nower days? His cynical views are hilarious!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the best book I ever read. Im 16 like Holden I've got almost the same opinions about life. I bet, this book will be change your whole view about life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Incredible book, the best I've ever read. I have read it 3 times already, and I plan on reading it again. Be warned, however, this book has forever changed my view of the world, and if you can get the true meaning out of it, it just might do the same to you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an excellent book that I would reccomend for all peolpe over twelve. The language is harsh, but the storyline and plot are amazing. I read it in two days because I couldn't put it down. It tells of a harsh life for a 16 year-old boy, and his struggles with the shallow world that he lives in."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I loved this book. It is probably my favorite behind The Berstien Bears and too much T.V. It was funny, full of meaningless thoughts, and going nowhere with fun. Just like my life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can you say about a modern classic -- I guess I can only add that my perspective comes from reading this book firstly when I was 47. I missed it in my youth -- and it was never part of high-school reading class.Putting it into historical perpective the prose were unique at their time. The slang and first person came at a time when Normam Mailer was also experimenting with dialogue. I must say that although the book sort of starts and goes nowhere, it is a very interesting tranche de vie of an early 50s angst ridden teenager, wrought with confusion. In that sense it is difficult to relate to .... not just for a fourty-seven-year old dude, but even in conjuring up my memories... I find it hard to relate in many areas.I fear that although this slender volume has weathered the years well, it has a particular vocabulary that most teens would find hard to understand without a broad education (or lucky enough to have parents that watch only movies from the 40s). The kids jive, and talk in ways that we can only wish today. Would we were so lucky as to have teenage youth that had the mere problem of this troubled child.Having said that, there are still people that we can relate to: from his jock roommate to his rather nauseating patrician friend -- we can all relate to the wish of being free of these people. The relationship with his sister is more interesting... he appears to go to her because she is a haven of sorts from the corrupted excesses of being a teenager.Well, as I said, I enjoyed it... It did fill in a small hole in those modern classics which I have not read.... on to Franny and Zoey I guess..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is an intriguing book in that it doesn't reveal itself fully until the end. The way that Holden Caufield addresses you the reader with the first-person conversational narrative is an intriguing way to tell and story and it took me a while to get used to it. He speaks in a very colloquial manner and you can almost hear that New York accent in his speech.Holden Caufield tells his story from the night that he was kicked out of his school Pency Prep. The story takes place over the course of three days but it brings the reader through an immense psychological journey. Holden is constantly annoyed by the \\"phonies\\" around him and is adrift in his life. But at the same time he has a certain attachment to the people around him.He leaves his school when he learns he is kicked out and spends the hours of the next two nights and two days in New York trying to sort things out. Along the way he meets strangers in two nuns, a pimp (and his prostitute) and kids at the museum, old friends from schools that he's gone to, his sister and an old professor. He is appalled at what he sees in humanity and adrift. The story is his struggle to find his direction.The story builds to a moving conclusion and I was surprised at how much I like it at the end. It is a very quick read but deep enough that it will take more than once to take it all in."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I write this review having to look back almost 20 years when I read this book as a child. At an age when I found it difficult to engross myself in fiction (I simply did not read a lot as a child), I traversed through this book with interest.Unless you have issues with the course language, you should anticipate an amusing account of events as Holden is thrown out of prep school. The tale is told as Holden recites the two day episode after having been kicked out. The events are conveyed as though Holden is speaking candidly to the reader; which is a style I found enjoyable.The Catcher in the Rye flows nicely and presents an effortless journey into the mind of Holden Caulfield. As one of the more popular fictional works of the 20th century, this impression alone should be sufficient to entice any reader. While I personally would not bestow the book with quite that level of praise, I do feel it offers a worthwhile undertaking."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This one will always be one of my all time favourites: out loud funny, yet painfully honest as it follows the 'coming of age' journey of a young man."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I must admit, at first i found the book quite boring and lacking direction. I was thinking to myself \\"sounds like an ordinary boy with ordinary problems\\". Afterwards, as i got to know Holden much better i realized the true depth and meaning of the book. There are no revolutionary ideas on society or politics, while others would go so far as to say \\"it's all bad words and no purpose\\". The book is NOT about a tightly hashed plot or a well thought-out social commentary, its more than that. It's about growing up. Something we all go through and how some of us undergo some serious mental anguish and pain. It's about the lost of innocence and how life can beat the heck out of you. Put aside all the crude language and annoying repetitive phrases and you are left with a book about life's greatest battles that we all must face. Rich or poor, young or old, ugly or beautiful, ALL of us must deal with death, depression and most importantly learn to live for the sake of love.. And that, is what this book is truly about.Lucas."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Teenagers need parents to push up against. (Adult-mediated) conflict helps teenagers define themselves and come into their own. This classic novel embraces the unique teenage experience of alienation, rebellion and the driving desire for acceptance. Holden is the teen prototype, cynical and sympathetic, wise and self-conscious, hopeful, genuine and desperate. Salinger's prose is elegant, spare and sounds fresh, even today. The timelessness and self-conscious portrayal of this bildungsroman still resonates with students and grown-ups alike. An American literary treasure and a must read for lovers of human narrative."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"In order to love this book, you have to really get the words he says and understand that he is just a lost teenage soul like the rest of us. The book was by no means a lame one, I loved every part of it. It was easy to read, there were many interesting parts to it that gave the book it's extra taste. I highly suggest that anyone who is a teenager currently or whoever struggled in their teenage years, to read this book because you will definitely love it, but maybe not depending on your taste."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like millions of other people, this book was required reading in one of my high school language arts classes. As well it should be and as well it should remain. Holden Caulfield is a teenage boy from a family of privilege that is convinced that everyone in the world is phony. In a cynical and at times bitter story, Salinger manages to capture the essence of teen angst long before it was part of the mainstream culture. There are triumphs and tragedies, but Caulfield manages to maintain his even keel of having a sour opinion of the world.The high part for me is when Caulfield has his encounter with a prostitute named Sunny. He tries to play the sophisticate and yet fails miserably; he gets no action, is robbed and then roughed up. If there is a better literary description of the sexual difficulties encountered by teenage boys, I have yet to have read it.Although the Caulfield character appeared earlier, this complete story was first published in 1951. Yet, despite all of the changes in our society in the half-century since that time, this book still is the best description of teen angst in combination with the feeling of not belonging in society. It should be required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger does a remarkable job of capturing the struggle that we all face when losing our innocence. The sense of confusion, uncertainty and the desire to save the world when facing reality for the first time, is best depicted in this book. It is a great read for the thoughtful, particularly the young."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" is a pretty popular book, even though it feels at first there's no main idea or anything.Well, first, it's pretty different from different books. The main character, Holden, left Pencey Prep-his school. It's actually honest in a lot of ways-At least Holden is. Sure, he complains a lot and makes others feel bad. But that's what makes it so interesting.But there's another part to it-pretty hard to explain, but somewhat dealing with life.Anyway. No action. Some drama. Not really any comedy. But GREAT for some reason.You'll find you can't stop reading this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Just one flaw:The narrator of this story is presented as an avid reader, yet he speaks with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure.By my count, he uses the catch-all phrase \\"and all\\" 174 times.He accuses most adults of putting on a false front, so, by my count, he uses the word \\"phony\\" 47 times. A student with above average literacy skills would likely look the word up in a thesaurus.His little sister Phoebe, who is presented as an honor student, is likewise verbally deficient. During the conversation in the bedroom, she uses the phrase \\"and everything\\" 5 times.This is especially unrealistic considering that Holden and Phoebe's parents are viligant about their children's verbal expression. During the bedroom conversation, we see that the word \\"lousy\\" is verboten in the Caulfield household.Salinger probably held a stereotype that all adolescents and children speak with a weak vocabulary and weak sentence structure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for there to be some reason this book has been banned. But it didn't get better. And I see no reason this is a banned book. The story was not compeling and neither are the characters. How anyone can think this is the best book ever written is beyond me. Please don't waste your time reading this. If you must read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in The Rye was a very well outlined book but the auther was very inconsistant with the dialogue for different characters. For example: Holden would say &quot;goddamn&quot; a lot in the first part of the book but then he started saying &quot;chrissake&quot; and &quot;hell&quot;. Holden wouldn't say them consistantly like anyother person would have. The book didn't fall into reality enough."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was a horrible book, with no plot or any good characters. I have no idea why people continue to read it. It uses repetative and pointless language. A filthy and horrible peice of literature, if you can call it literature. The only thing that makes this a classic is that it was once banned, and maybe it still should be."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A crappy childhood. A rejection letter from NYU. An esspresso machine. $$$. These are the elements that seemed to inspire Salinger to write \\"Catcher in the Rye\\".Reading the critically acclaimed novel [and I use the term loosley] is a little like watching the minute hand move during an especially tedious physics lesson. The story opens with grim dullard Holden Caulfeild, whose name I didn't remember for most of the book, telling us about his morbid childhood. Shortly after he decides we \\"don't want to know\\" and goes on about flunking out of school, which is something else we \\"don't want to know\\" about. Frankly, I don't appreciate being told what I want and don't want, but Holden seems sure, so he rambles on. His monotonous rantings evoke an equally unemotional response from the reader. I liked him less and less as the book progressed.Overall, Holden to me seemed like one of those people who no one wants at the wedding but gets invited anyway, and when he gets there he proclaims that the food is bad, the music tasteless, that the bride looks like an ogre and who makes such snide remarks as \\"Amy, red is TRULY not your color...\\". In short, one of those people who talks big, says little and who really needs to be locked in a box.His complaints are various and meaningless. He can't seem to accept other character's happiness, insisting that this emotion is \\"phony\\". The characters that do slip through his very self absorbed radar are all forgettable so if he ever mentions a character a second time don't be surprised if you don't know what in hell he's talking about.The plot is totally worthless. It seemed like Salinger wasn't really sure what to do with himself when he wrote this. Holden ALMOST calls his ex. Then he ALMOST becomes a hermit. He ALMOST makes it with a hooker. Every paragraph feels like another sack of BS wrapped in a box and addressed from J.D. to you.Catcher in the Rye is an overrated, tiring, pointless 'work of literature' about, for, and made by spoiled rich kids who hate their parents and waste money on Jimmy Eat World CDs."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First things first, I am so happy I never have to listen to this kid Holden Caulfield think or speak, ever again. The way he forms his sentences, his word choices, his perspectives, his actions - they are all SO irritating and horrible. I realize that the character is not supposed to be the brightest light in the pack, or the most likable fellow, but often the unlikable characters in a story or film end up being very likable to me in their own satirical way. I am an extremely sarcastic person and also slightly sadistic with humor - typically I relate with cynics over everyone else, but Holden is not even an effective character in that light. When he shares a paragraph's worth of his thoughts with me, I simply want to punch him in the nose, or at least go on ignoring the fact that people this annoying actually exist on this planet.It was ridiculously challenging getting all the way through this book. He never shuts up, and there is not much change in the pace or events throughout. It's simply a wandering, rambling, BORING teen who thinks he's too good for everything in life, complaining nonstop about the same things repetitively - typically this would sound like a fun read to me, but the problem is that it's NOT entertaining in any way. It was SO unmemorable and stale that the only two segments in the entire story that I can even recall at this point, just one week after finishing it, are a section towards the middle involving a motel room and a hooker, and the book's last couple of chapters.The one thing and only thing I DID like about the book, was the meaning of the book's title and how relevant it was when looking at the entire story as a whole. However, a great title does not make a great story.Last thing I will say is that I find it almost OFFENSIVE that this kid is still being considered a synonymous representation of \\"the cynical adolescent\\". \\"A slang that sounds edgy even today, which keeps this novel on banned books lists\\" - are you kidding me? I think the South Park episode from last season (The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs) perfectly expressed how anyone with enough brains to keep up with the progression of morale in modern society, specifically in teens, could see that this kids perspectives and vocabulary would seemed to have lost their edge somewhere around the 1960's. \\"His constant wry observations about what he encounters capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation\\" - couldn't disagree more. I felt like an alien through all my teen years and this brat is the last person I would ever relate to.I gotta say - I'm pretty disappointed that this is considered classic literature. When I described my first novel to people, a couple of them said \\"So it's kind of like Catcher in the Rye, it sounds like\\" - that's why I read it. Now, I can knowingly say \\"No, it is absolutely nothing like Catcher in the Rye. Things actually happen in my book\\". I won't be giving J.D. Salinger another shot for quite some time, if ever. I'm going to try Philip K. Dick and Bret Easton Ellis next, and I'm pretty sure I'm headed in the right direction..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a Gen X'er I've noticed many people my age who've grown up in the \\"self-help\\" era to become self absorbed, excuse-making adults. I found Holden Caufield to be weak of character and he reminded me of the afore mentioned people. I struggle with understanding why this particular book has been so greatly celebrated. Is it the same logic that has spawned America's fascination with society's weakest? (Dr. Phil, Jerry Springer, ect...) Are we coddling our children into becoming Holden Caufield's?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is the worst book I've ever read. One reason I hated it was because we were forced to read this by our evil teacher. I would never read such crap, if I hadn't to. You would guess, when you start reading, that there are some good parts in this novel. There are none! How can you write almost 200 pages full of this nonsense. For instance, the main character is always feeling depressed and criticising everything and erveryone he meets. Two lines further, he says the person is killing him (being very funny). If he does that in one chapter, it's OK, but this keeps on going on and on for 26 chapters. It's the same with the events that happen in the book. Never anything excititing happens to the main character. Every chapter there is a new event and that drags on for almost 10 pages. Booooring!!! Another annoying thing is the language the main charcther uses. He always uses the same worths on and on. It's a slow reading book too. In short, the writer should be executed for wasting our time like that. Should make a good horror story too, his dead."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is known as a classic for it's simplicity. It is not symbolic, beautifully worded, are even an elegant story. It is not the crude language that turned me off, I liked that because it set tone for the book. It was the fact that I do not believe this story has any artistic value, other than it's over 100 pages. What can I say, different strokes for different folks. The only reason I would suggest this book is for experience sake. Any well read individual should know this book. That doesn't mean that you have to appreciate it.I also think that this book is not as universal and does not apply to ever adolescent or teenager, I think the only person this book applies to is the author himself. It is a selfishly written , unintentional classic.This book should have a Surgeon Generals Warning or something like that reading... WARNING: This book should not be read while operating heavy machinery, for it strains all intelligent thought from your brain."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Why is this book such a classic? For the life of me I can't understand it. I am 20 years old, I read a lot, and I was not forced to read this book, just so you know.This is the most pretentious, pointless, ridiculously stupid, annoying, whiny, hypocritical book I've ever read. Why on earth did I or anyone else waste time reading this? For that matter, why did the author bother writing it? It's just one big rant against supposedly phony people by a moron who's a big phony himself (Holden, not the author, whom I don't know at all). This novel's one saving grace is that it's short. Had it been much longer I doubt I would have finished it.Seriously, how many times can one read the word goddamn over and over again? How many times can one tolerate &quot;(insert thing) kill(s) me.&quot;? How many pages can Holden spend whining about phony people? How much money did Salinger make off this pretentious crap? However much it was, it was too much.This is the worst book I've read yet. Classic? I don't think so.If you want something in a similar vein but much, much, much better, I'd highly recommend you read &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"if you have ever felt different or you may think that you may need a little change in what you read, this is the book to read.

It is still as socially relevant if not more than, when it was released a half-century ago. Unfortunately, some people just don't get the total gist of the book. For those who do; it exposes America's true moral character in unsurpassed sartirical splendor. It is the perfect narrative. Economical, yet more than gets it's message across. Read it again if you think that it was just required high school fare. I'm sure now that you've aged a bit, you will enjoy the book more than ever. A work of genius."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Quite simply, a must-read for every generation. A beautiful, sincere telling of a teenage boy's take on the world. Holden Caufield is certainly one of the most memorable characters from the last 100 years of literature. The bittersweet tone of the story enthralls you. When you read this book, you will remember it for your whole life. It grips you.Bottom Line: Read this book. If you've already read it- read it again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger takes the reader on a fantastic journey, in which one can see the world through the eyes of young Holden Caulfield. It may make you feel sorry for him sometimes; it can also make you angry at him. One thing you won't be, though, is indifferent. This book is about a sixteen-year-old, but it's not to be read by sixteen-year-olds, simply because they won't get it (look at all those reviews from people who wanted to know the point of the book). They ARE Caulfield, and it won't be until some years from now that they will be able to recognize that fact and come to terms with it. Salinger is brilliant, and &quot;Catcher&quot; is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am baffled by this novel's standing as one of the great classics of modern literature. It seemed to be essentially a literate exposition of the author's own life experiences, with the liberal pepperings of 'goddamm' and other colloquialisms philological tools within the capacity of any two bit writer. JD was lucky merely in that, as a side effect of his autobiographical catharsis, he tapped deeply into the wellspring of the American psyche. John Le Carre's 'A Perfect Spy' is an example of a truly great once-in-a-lifetime, from-the-heart coming-of-age novel... and he has written a great many more books than Saint Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All to frequently, reviewers tend to look at Holden as the voice of a post war generation. It would seem more appropriate to say Holden is the voice that so many of us, no matter what generation we are, wished that we had while going through the growing pains of adolescence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a superb book. I loved it 100%, besides one problem. I thought after I finished it, why was this book written? I agree with, I think one else said this. It gives no reason, and no plot, but I loved it to much to not for it to exist. There is no reason for it to exist though, but too good of a story. I thought of it, and wondered, why did this be written, but hell, I loved it. That is my only problem. It has no plot, and every story should have a plot. I'm not one of those religious guys, and I did read it correctly, pretending that you are Holden Caulfield. That's why I like it. The story is great. It could effect some minds though, but not mine. Great book. If you like depressing books, read this. This, next to, &quot;On the Road&quot;, by, I forgot his name. &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;The Partner&quot;, by John Grisam, and Earnest Hedington's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, are my favorite books. I also like the series of Terry Goodkind's, &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot;. Though, above all, I like &quot;The Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The storyline dragged in some places, and it jumped around an awful lot. Holden's vocabulary was kind of limited, but maybe this was the author's intention? Nevertheless it is a classicthat has to be experienced at least once."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you ever have to give one book to a Martian to explain what teenage thoughts and experiences are like, choose this one."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye ie the best book I have read in a long time. Holden Caufield is just how he wants to be and that is what makes this book so wonderful. He knows what he likes and dislikes. I have recommended it to everyone I know!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the best, most influential book i have ever read. This is the book that got me interested in reading (in general). Now the only Salanger book i have yet to read is (Seymore : Raise High the roof Beam, an introduction.) I recomend people buy all his books. They just keep getting better as you read them."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher is the perfect book to read when you are in your angsty teen years. Not only did this book inspire me to purchase a hunting hat, i also intend to name a child, or perhaps a dog, after our disaffected antihero Holden Caulfield. the boy every high school student should feel at least some empathy toward. Holden Caulfield let us know that sometimes it's fine to be a little offbeat. touching, funny and just a little whimsical, my life would be all the poorer without knowing that the world is full of Holden Caulfields. A masterwork of touching human understatement."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A good book for young boys. You can read it with your own ways, and got the same feeling."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is a young boy not quite sure what life in general is about. He takes the reader on a journey through a few days of his life where we see that Holden doesn't have all the answers, and infact that may be what makes this book so appealing. Altough the reader may at times be appalled by Holden's attitude and fierce language, we also find him to be irresistable. When Holden is kicked out of his prep school, he is not quite ready to face his family. Instead he decides to take control of his own life. Alone in the city, Holden tries to discover just what he has to offer. There is really nothing special about Holden except for the fact that he is like so many of us, just struggling to survive."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; a number of times while I was living in Romania: first an excellent translation, later the original.It is less important to me that the book is perfect: absolutely every sentence is perfectly balanced independently and with the rest of the book.What's amazing is that it seems to bring up some universal human values that were there in post-war US in the 50s, in communist Romania in the 80s, in information age Canada in the 90s, and probably a lot of other times and places."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a teenager, and I was going on a long car ride with my family, so I thought that I would bring a book to help ease the boredom. I chose Catcher in the Rye. This book is the best I have ever read. I don't think that there is a better book to describe a teen than this book. His experiences are some of the same I have gone through (some, not all). Someone said that this book had no physical plot. Well, I think that is what makes it so good. A book this well-written doesn't really need a plot. It's about life, and life doesn't always follow a physical plot. This book is excellent and well written. A deftinate must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"j.D Salinger's book, althoug nearly 50 years old, is a timeless piece which displays evrythign from the thought process to the mind patterns of a teenager to someone who is depressed, what's more even if you arn't either of these you'll be able to get inside of them. This book absorbs and takes over and you literlaly feel like you've know Holden (the protagonist) for years. You can go back and back."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"An excellent portrayal of a young male (Holden), Mr. Salinger makes this book come alive as you read it. It only took me a couple hours, and I was able to finish this book-I couldn't put it down! All through the story I found myself laughing out loud. Originally, I had to read this for class, and I figured it would be confusing and boring. However, I was delighted by the easy reading, and am now Mr. Salinger's biggest fan."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not what I expected, this young man comes across as a 50's anarchist. Except for a few passions in his life, he rebels and criticizes everyone and everything. A true pessimist, his observations have a painfull truth to them that readers can identify with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield, the main character in this book, is a teenage boy who is trying to figure himself out. He starts out in a boarding school, yet leaves without permission. He then wanders the streets of New York City for 3 days. He encounters a prostitute, bars, girls, and an old professor. At this point in his life, Holden does not have much faith in his fellow race. Even though at times Holden can seem a bit cynical and pesimistic, I liked him and related to him. For anyone who is a teenager, or been through thier teenage years, they can relate to the obstacles Holden faces in one way or another. Yes, the book has an excessive amount of foul language, but if you can see past it, you will find a wonderful story of three days of a teenage boys' life. I would recomend this book for any and everyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"And I thought I was the only cynical ... during high school. I am very sorry I waited until now to read this fine book. Holden mirrored many of the same feelings I had myself during that stage of my life. A concise, to the point, timeless piece of literature that people will identify with forever...if they are not being phonies!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger's classic novel about the adventures of a cynical, depressed teenager is nothing short of brilliant. The dialogue, though written a while ago, speaks as human as today. The message gets across because we can all feel for the character, Holden. We were all at that stage of uncertainty and madness and it [stunk]! \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the most honest and thought-provoking I have had the pleasure of reading. It remains one of my all-time favorite novels. It's a must for any fan of fiction, anxious teenage boy, or anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is about a troubled teen that had just gotten kicked out of prep school and saw things that no one else had. He never kept on track, if he said one thing about a person he had to say each and every detail about him. He was one of those people that analized a persons way of living, like his roomate and next door neighbor. They would fight almost daily that Holden too became angry and fought back.Holden Caulfield was a genius in my eyes even though he failed every class. It wasnt't like he was smart in an academic way, but rather in a selective viewpoint. Holden knew how to speak his mind and he did it throughout the whole story. All this kid really wanted was love and respect and I feel you should read this to follow the troubles he faced to get it.I feel that J.D. Salinger is a great writer and loved how he got into tangins. If you don't read this book, I know you'll miss something real special."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What happened in the first place was in high school we were reading Pride And Prejudice with all the phonies in it, but then the guys were complaining and this Englsih teacher her name was Miss Mishka said we can read Catcher In The Rye next. Now you don't want to hear about all that and honestly I don't want to get into it. So now I said I should walk over and pick up the good old book again and you know what I missed it! It's a darn good book for chrissakes. Holden is the main character and you keep looking for him coz he's really real and really cares and he's so genuine. I mean that kills me everytime. You have to feel sorry for him though. He's an outsider and never fits in. He's really a kid. But people think he's insane. But I think he's sane as hell. He has his ups 'n' downs but he's no phoney, if you know what I mean. The book is terrific. It's descriptive as hell and so not pretending. Gee, I miss old Holden Caulfield already if you really want to know the truth."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's no accident that Catcher in the Rye routinely appears on readers' lists of favorite books. It represents the first and perhaps the best book that adresses teen isolation and frustration. I first read this book as a teen, but have re-read it several times. Each time, I have been able to relate to different aspects of this exceptional novel. Nowadays, I am a child psychologist and see so much of my teen clients in this book. I can also see parts of myself in the \\"hypocritical\\" adults that populate Salinger's book. Of course, my perspective is different now and I understand that this kind of behavior is what helps us succeed in the world, but it always makes me think and question myself. A true sign of a classic. If you're a teen, read it now, and if you're older, read it now!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Personally, I think this is one of the greatest books ever written. The themes it teaches are just amazing. My perception of the theme was to live life to the fullest. Holden was trying to say that you should cherish your childhood, don't grow up too fast. Another theme in this book is things don't always work out the way you want them to. That's not much of a lesson, but it is true.Another reason that this book is great is because Salinger does a great job in describing his characters. You really get a vivid picture in your head of Holden when reading this book. My only complaint is that Salinger didn't write more than a few books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. It contains all aspects of other literature, at least in my opinion. As a freshman in high school, i've read an eccentric collection of books. Catcher in the Rye contains a little bit of all these, from Anthony Burgess' &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; with the whole rebellious adolescent human nature stuff, Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; also dealing with the human nature, hence the title &quot;heart of darkness.&quot; THere's also a hint here and there of &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; i believe, which i'm not quite done with yet. I am Holden Caulfield. Everything Salinger wrote about this character i could relate to, either in my life personally, or in someone elses, and THAT is what makes a book. It's the only book i will read over and over and over and STILL catch a little something that i didn't notice previously that makes it even more interesting. THis book is supposedly trying to be banned from schools, but i think it's the best book to read as an adolescent. It's thought provoking, and really changes your perspective on things. ALl in all, It's the best book I've ever read and one that everyone needs to read at some point in their life. An american Classic!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"catcher in the rye, a book, a lengend. the book to me was like a devil hell ride. It boiled my skin like 83 pots of boiling hash oil. the raven cries... laissez-faire! the lights, the carnage.. who wilt cry last when the world shares it horrage with the world. not a story, the CATCHER IN THE RYE is no book, it is a way of life.

Many men can identify with Holden. I felt as though Salinger described what growing up as a male was all about. I have read the book twice and still feel as though I do not completely understand everything. I do understand and identify with many things that the boy is feeling throughout the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is very good and exciting. When you read the first chapter you want to read the rest right away. It is also very emotional and will have you reading a mile a minute."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book illustrates the problems associated with a highschool boy losing his innocence. It explores aspects of life which we have all had to deal with while growing up. This book takes all of the pain and anger involved with the transition from child to adult and compresses it into one book. The Catcher in the Rye is undoubtedly one of the most influential books of this century. If you are a student in highschool, you must read this book. Without it, you are missing out."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher In The Rye describes a few days in the life of Holden Caulfield after he has been thrown out of Percy University.

Even though there is alot of swearing in this book I think that almost anyone would enjoy reading this book, I know I did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's a great book. Holden was this depressed guy with cynical thoughts on his head. It touched me. I couldn't put it down. It's easy to understand and you won't get bored of it. The only problem I see with this book is it's too short. I would've read it if it was the longest book ever written."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To everyone who has not read this book, I say to you read it. This book is my favorite book as I have read it at least four or five times. Everyone can seem to identify with the main carachter Holden and his teenage rebellion. It also shows us, through Holden's love for his sister, that even the seemingly roughest people we know still have a smooth, tender heart. Salinger has written an excellent book with of great prose, beautiful flow, and great monolouges and dialouges of Holden. His ability to show us so clearly how Holden feels is simply extra icing on a great cake. I would recommed this book to anyone, despite any contraversies that arise around it. Although it hasn't changed my life, it has changed the way I think. Please pick it up, because you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Throughout these reviews, I have read horrible things about Salinger's style and the character of Holden Caulfield. Obviously, the people who feel this way are idiots who can't handle any type of syntax but the basic, mediocre subject/verb dribble. This novel is the best I've ever encountered. Some readers seem to miss the fact that Holden is talking to a psychiatrist- the reason for his rants. You don't go to a shrink to say everything's fine. You go to complain. Salinger's insight into the mind of the clinically depressed is amazing. I can't imagine anyone not falling in love, or at least empathizing, with Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The absolute best book I have ever read--ever.It is a jab at society(in the 50's),it shows just how stupid we can be sometimes.It is dead on characterization,everyone has thier own distinguishable personalities--and you follow Holden through the book seeing his depression rise and his mental health decline.His relationship with his little sister is touching and shows the characters hidden kindness---you get to feel Holdens personality through the thoughts that go through his head.It allows you to figure out why Holden is the way he is today(i.e brother dying, numerous expulsions)and lets you feel for him. I guarentee after you read the first chapter you will be hooked.With heavy regret I cannot give this book more than 5 stars,because it is better than the &quot;Perfect&quot; book.The true great American novel.If you have not read it yet,get it today!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this is the best book i've read. the main character holden caulfield relates to every teenager in the world. no one could ever portray someone as well as J.D.

A masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's a great book. Really makes one (especially the adult) look back and see how purely human we all are. Easy enjoyable read, great to discuss with teens."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, -by J. D. SalingerI am glad I finally read The Catcher in the Rye. Everyone always talked about it, how great it was, and now I can really appreciate it. J. D. Salinger really understands what teens are thinking, because I could definitely relate with this book. The experiences and thoughts remain the same over all the years since it was first published (1951) to the present.The main character, Holden, is a confused teen-aged boy that everyone can relate to. He tries to put on a big tough guy attitude but he is really just a good guy. He loves his sister Phoebe and his parents, no matter how much he disagrees with them. He is against all the evils in the world, tries to rub out all the \\"f*** you\\" signs and helps little kids put on their skates.He is passed from one boarding school to another, just trying to fit in. He is smart, but doesn't get good grades. He makes a few friends here and there, but just finds people to be too phony. He also has to watch out for perverty guys and womanizing creeps like his old roommate, Stradlater.He spends his Christmas break being an adult, sleeping in hotels and hanging out in bars. This only helps him to discover that this is not happiness and decides to leave it all. In every kids fantasy he dreams of moving away to a peaceful cabin in the middle of nowhere, away from all the jerk taxi drivers. It takes the innocence and stubborn love of his sister Phoebe to convince him to stay.This is an excellent book that I recommend reading a.s.a.p.. I regret not reading it earlier and this is a \\"must\\" book to read before graduating from high school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a universal book that can be applied to any situation.Literally. It may be quite outlandish for me to propose such a claim but it is nothing but the truth.Love: Holden's strained relationship with parents, pure idealic realtionship wirh Phoebe, and tragic but poignant relationship with deceased brotherSex: Insecurity and desire are related through his interaction with the girls at the bar, with the prostitute, and girl next door.Innocence: Phoebe and his goal in life \\"the catcher\\"Pride: Not telling parents he dropped outAcceptance:pervasive throughout trying to be accepted yet not be phonyHumanity: Money to the nunsFrankness: ugliness of girls and his annoying roomate AckleyEtc. Etc..In short, an inspirational and remarkable book that touches many facets of life. This book should be read over and over. Everytime you read it you find soeting else you didn't notice before.. which is quite intriguing.."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a wonderfull book. It is interesting, engaging, funny and timeless. I read this several years ago in my honors english class and we spent over eight weeks reading and dissecting it. Though I doubt JD Salinger would agree with any of our observations (correlations between this story and the quest for the Holy Grail), it made for interesting study. This is a wonderful book that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This touches home, to the most overwhelming emotion, teens and tweens have at one/many point. When crushing stress and loss cannot be sheltered in your conscious anymore. The need to be Independent to escape. If only for a runaway moment. Caulfield belongs to a school. Many schools. Inhabited by people, whom he never had a say to be included with. He stumbles, he tries. Everyone understands the superficial, the bothersome details are behind the uniform, and behind a tinge of gray in hair. Salinger writes for us, those who cannot in Caulfields world, understand. The missing pieces as to why and a slab of his understanding. You see the interpretation of Caulfield, how a person his age transgresses through one moment of life and recounts what the mind carries with it. He describes the hidden beauty in freshly fallen snow. No footsteps no clutter. Caulfield sniffles, his nose bleeding, his memorable hat from New York stuffed down over his ears. You follow Caulfield away from his stuffy dormatory room. Away from the truth that lay behind him. As Salinger writes it, Caulfield has a good number of days before his parents even hear of the word that he has been expelled from school. In the night, as he's stomping through the snow, you feel the reason behind Caulfield decision to leave. You understand the anger. In writing that most anyone would feel comfortable with you are lead into the red district and the busy but then lonely streets of a very adult district of life. Caulfield describes the days as a \\"bit of madeness\\". This book doesn't have a dusty feeling to it. Although predating World War 2. The story could be these times, could be any time and date. It is timeless.-jeff"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have just read The Catcher in the Rye for the first time, and all I can say is that I think it's a great book. Being a teenager myself, I found that I could understand the character's feelings and it was all so realistic and accurate. The author is a genius. I admitt that the book is not likea lot of standard books, but that's why it's classic. I believe that anyone who doesn't appreciate this book, just doesn't understand the book. Not in a way where they don't know what's going on in the novel, but in a way as in they can't find a way to relate to the character. Anyway, I give the book a big thumbs up and definitely recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book written by J.D Sailnger and though it has had some controversial issues about the violence, vulgarity and sexual references,I would still recommend it. But if you're under the age of 16 I wouldn't suggest reading it because of these issues. This book is about a 16 year old, Holden Caufiled and his 4 day adventures. His adventures begin when he got expelled from school because he failed all his clases except one. He then decided to leave school early and go to New York. Holden struggles to be accepted in the adult world, but thinks that its \\"phony\\". Holden Caufield represents the average teenager who has to deal with a variety of problems. I recommed this book because its straightforward, easy to understand and it is a good book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not everyone will relate to or understand this book (as is evident in some of the reviews...) It wasn't written to be a goddam english class reader, & it's not meant to make you friggin suicidal either. It's just honest and that's what makes it powerful. It might be 50 years old but you'll recognize people you know in it. It's damn funny too. Maybe you need to have gone through some of your own mindfu#s to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a great book that everyone should read especially people from 13-18 years old."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Being a jerk teenager who constant complains about everything and everyone to myself, i thought i should read this. Of course, like everyone who's read this book, i could relate to alot of what holden caulfield did or thought. Especially because both holden and many other misanthropic youths complain about the most minute, stupid things, stuff that really shouldn't matter.Another thing that was addressed that hit me like a load of bricks, was hypocrisy, such as holden's labeling of all the &quot;fakes&quot;. Such as when he's talking to his teacher, and he's (in his mind) yelling at him and such, but what he actually says is just as far from what's on his mind, as the what the teacher says, and i do this ALOT. And of course, reading that, didn't inspire me to say whats on my mind, didn't change me at all, so i guess it did nothing but raise my hypocrisy up another level. As much as holden thinks he does, he really doesn't want to hurt anyone, or else he would say all his critical thoughts.I also found myself criticizing Holden, himself, for stuff like: how can he be soo disgusted with humans, and still dance with those women, who are by my standards some of the wrost examples of humanity (not all women, but the ones at the bar), How could he buy them drinks, and so on. And that single-handedly proved the point of the book, even the ones who complain so much about how bad humans are, arent perfect themselves, maybe equally bad. I don't mean holden by that, but it applies to him too.If you've ever wanted to slap every human that ever walked by you with a goofy smile on their face, read this, and you will either miss a few major points, and continue to want to slap people (like me). And/Or, you'll recognize those points, and be too much of a hypocrite to change yourself(like me). And (not or) you'll enjoy the book, no matter what you think its point is. There isn't any hard-to-get college english course stuff in here, its a GREAT human story (keyword: human). that should affect everyone in some way.At the bare minimum, you'll be occupied with a good story for a couple days."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the story of Holden Caulfield's three days that he spends in New York, by himself, as a 16 year old. It's near impossible to give a good summary of it because there are so many subplots and tangents in the book, but this is part of the fun. To get as much as you can out of the book you must discuss it with people. If you're able to understand what Salinger was trying to get across you will enjoy it more. I think the age of the reader has a lot to do with the enjoyment one gets from it. The closer one is to the age of Holden, the more they will enjoy it. They can see how he is so similar to them or people they know. I believe most everyone knows someone who is like Holden and if people can somewhat understand Holden, they may be able to understand other's in their lives. It's just a flat our good story and is easy to read. It'll go by quickly."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This Book by J.D Salinger is one of his finest (if not shortest).It tells the tale of adolesance in its most cynical and sarcastic form... in the form of a soon to be expelled prep school boy to be exact.You watch the young character work through his emotional problems and spiritual problems in his own unique cynical matter. The story is well developed and is witty to the ending... with a slightly disturbing surprise ending that leaves you thinking for days after you've read the book.This is one of the most well developed and complicated characters to ever be presented in literature, and his story is one worth reading about.This book is recommended to anyone as a good read and good example of fine literature."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This, along with Catch-22 and The Blind Assassin are amoung my favorite novels right now. Salinger does a great job at creating an amusing unreliable narrator (Holden Caulfield). At the beginning, Holden is failing out of his fourth school and has yet to tell his parents. Holden doesn't want responsiblity; he just wants to be young and running around fields (Catcher in the Rye). As I myself am 16, I found this novel especially relevent and can understand what he feels. Holden is overly cynical, to the point of hilarity, of everything. He espcially hates phonies, but pretty much has something to say about everyone. There are very few people that he respects. So while you are reading this, remember that while Holden is a very intriuging character and is very amusing to read (its like reading gossip at some points), he has faults, too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book, \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" by J.D. Salinger, accurately depicts the life of a student, Holden Caulfield, in the late 1940's, who has just side-stepped his educational career by failing out of high school. He then wanders around New York City, avoids going home with the one exception of visiting his sister, and does not tell his parents about flunking out.I liked this book for a number of reasons. I felt it was easy to relate to his feelings, and Salinger easily shows what is going through this teen's mind. There were many times in the book where I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what would happen next. With so many twists and turns, the only way to find out was to read on.However, the negative side of this book also revolves around the thoughts and emotions of Holden. Many times throughout the book, the same emotions are displayed, where Holden says the same reaction about people. It becomes annoying when he says the same phrase over and over again.Despite those negatives, I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading again in the near future. This book was highly controversial in past years, especially in the late 1960's. Nevertheless, this book is compelling, and I recommend it for all who love to read over the age of 16 due to a high level of profanity."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not quite seeing what all of the praise was about even over halfway in, this book crept up on me. It turned out to be much more than I expected and can't help but think that much of the following it's gathered was drawn for the wrong reason. For instance, in the movie \\"The Good Girl\\", the angsty youth gave himself the name \\"Holden\\" and for obvious reasons: he identified with the cynicism of the character and his adolescent contempt for the world around him. Problem is, of course, that's not the point of the story.It's humorous and had me snickering like an idiot as I read through some of Holden's observations, but the characters deep flaws are not a celebration in themselves. That was the impression I had gotten from people over the years: this guy is great because he's jaded like me. Not that many of his observations weren't dead-on, but to have held this general outlook and not feel sad in some way is to have missed the point altogether. Many of us can see a bit of our own cynicism, particularly earlier in life, in Holden and hopefully clearer yet, the innocently mistaken notions that led to such frustration."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel by J.D. Salinger. It was a savagely funny page-turner and no matter what the situation was this book never failed to give me a great laugh. This is one of those books where you don't need to relate to the story to fully enjoy its humor. I can't recall a page that didn't crack me up. For example a part in the book I like was when Holden Caulfield said that he was loaded because his grandma was losing her mind and would send him birthday money four times a year. There were also a lot of other funny parts but I remember that one the most because I was at the airport going out to California to see my mom and I only see her once a year. Basically I think that this book is a great book. There were really no parts of the story I didn't like except on the very beginning of the book. I think that the author spent too much time talking about Holden's school. They spent about 80-100 pages just talking about what he was doing at his school. Other than that I can't recall any bad parts in this book. It was funny the whole way through so I cant really complain about anything."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden would probably be toting a rifle to school and he'd be on the six o'clock news. This very sad book has a different resonance when you read it as an adult and parent of teenagers. I recommend this to anyone who worries about getting inside their son's head or even if you want to start a converstation with your teen. You should both read this. That way, you can both know you are not alone and you are going through this together."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just finished the book for about the fifth time. Most reading this will know the story of Holden Cauldfield and his little oddysey during the Christmas season of 1949. I first had this book assigned to me by a young lit teacher when I was about Holden's age. It was my first really serious, critical book report. What I liked about it at the time was its brevity but I did get a good grade on the report which was held up to the class as the standard for such an endeavor. It was only during my second reading about ten years later that it occured to me why that teacher had chosen me to report on Catcher in the Rye. I feel that many read far too much into the story and how it is told. When it came out in 1951 it was not just controversial, it was considered downright subversive and banned in many places. Today one can only assume that the four times the F-word is used in the original version was the impetus for such a reaction. Actually, it is just the story of an intelligent and insightful but troubled teenage boy for whom the pressures of looming adulthood and the recent death of a sibling are too much to bare, leading to a breakdown and the catharsis of this telling. Sure he is critical of others and of life but he never spares himself in his criticism. Yes, we can assume that he has in him some of the phoniness that he so vehemently decries. &quot;Let he who is . . . .&quot; However, through Holden Cauldfield we can see through so much of the unreality of everday human experience and interaction. He is not a hero or a fool or a phoney. He is just a guy that needed a little time out and felt also a need to share with us in an incredibly humorous and entertaining way what he was going through at the time. It always makes me smile, it really does. I'm awfully succeptible to that type of thing, I can tell you that right now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A special gift to who have to think about the humankind and the society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Alright, well I'm also a teenager and seeing as all the other ripped this book apart, I think I'll go ahead and support it. This is simply the best book I have ever read. I admit, I go to prep. school and it's sometimes rough and Holden realistically portrays that. The character of Holden Caulfield does NOT represent all teenagers and that stereotype. He represents so much more. A teenager sick of the world before he has even reached manhood. This may be a critically acclaimed book and I'm sure it has won many awards before. Now forget that for a moment and simple read the book. Holden's wryness and the extremeness of his character well represent a person searching for who he is and in doing so what the world is around him is like, &quot;phonies&quot; and all. J.D. Salinger has simply outdone himself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is a book that rebels against the systematic programming of people that has been going on for years. This novel shows a young man who knows something is wrong, but can't figure out what. He doesn't have the words or knowledge to know that everything he has been taught about the world is a lie. The thing people don't realize about books like these and others, is that these people are here now. There are many teens in America who are depressed for seemingly no reason, and who don't enjoy school and hate all this bs that is flooding our world. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After I read this book, I felt incredibly let down. I had repeatedly been told that this novel was the greatest ever. I found Holden to be an immature, spoiled little brat. I also found him very difficult to relate to. It didn't surprise me, however, that so many stalkers and murderers loved this book. I gave it two stars because it wasn't the worst book I have ever read. It was interesting at some points (sort of like watching a car accident)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have only recently read this book and I must say that I couldnt believe it was written in 1945. The language and the characters are so today that it feels like a story of todays adolescent youth rather than that of 4 decades ago, Also the other characters that Caulfield encounters during the course of the book are so well defined and real that it feels like a part of ones own life - The strange thing about this book is that when you finish it it feels like a very light book but it stays with you, the characters stay with you and it makes a deep impression, but you'll only know it after some time has passed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I found Catcher in the Rye to be very creative and well written. It was one book that held my interest. Though at times depressing,the outlook on life and Holden's antihero attitude humored me at times. Phoebe was a brilliant character. Many times I felt the feelings holden felt. Especially with the vivid first person. I can't say enough other than I wish it was longer. A must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye.... well talk about zany characters that can be real... whew... they're all crazy in the head... you'll have a blast of the past.... where Holden ( the main character) meets these mundane characters as he ventures the streets of New York after being axed from school... You'll meey queers and over-acting Actors who seem to be enjoying themselve... well you have to read it to enjoy it...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"All in all, this book made me want to know the author, as Holden would have put it. I loved every page of this book because I felt as if I knew Holden. I identified with him to some extent and I wanted to know more once the story ended. He was so real, which was refreshing to read for it is so often difficult to attain such an intricate level of emotional simplicity, it was as if we were let into the sore mind of this teenage boy. His private thoughts there for us, thoughts that made me read many lines and paragraphs over and over again. This is the first book that I have read more than once. A unique way of story-telling."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It still has the edginess and ingenuity it had when it was first published. I can completely agree with Holden's disillusions of the world around him.Another thing I loved about this book was it's style of writing, Holden is a unique narrator, I just love how he digresses throughout the entire novel. It's ironic that he says he isn't going to tell about any &quot;David Copperfield crap&quot; and focus on his Christmas vacation, but through his digressions you learn all about him and his past. Wonderful to the end. A classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was a wonderful book, but i think it lacked descriptive qualities usually found in other award winning books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Directly after finishing Catcher in the Rye, I had many negative thoughts about the story. At the time, it seemed to be pointless dribble, describing a young boy's problems with life and how he couldn't deal with them. On top of that, the fact that the book did not feature a &quot;plot&quot; in the sense that other books do, bothered me. At times, I was extremely annoyed with Holden's ignorance, which caused me to think this way. Also, it seemed poorly written to me. On several occasions, words were spelled incorrectly which caused the book to appear unpolished. On the other hand, it made the story seem like it was written as a diary.Instead of producing a flat character, J.D. Salinger managed to show the reader a character that acted much like real people. This included a temper, mood swings, and on top of that, small aspects to Holden that seem very realistic. At one point, he acted like a particular character was his best friend, but several pages later he would consider them an enemy. If I were to relate his personality to someone in another story, I would say that he is a lot like Gene in A Separate Peace. While the plots do not parallel one another in any particular way, each character has many similar qualities. Both youths have mental problems to an extent and because of this, pity themselves. They both have difficulty interacting with others too.It has been several weeks since I finished reading the novel. Since then, I have thought about how Holden acted throughout the story. He definitely is not a normal youth; in fact, I feel he can be quite demented at times. However, I also believe that there are pieces of him that every reader can relate to. It felt reassuring to know that there are other youths that can be just as cynical as I am. I also feel that it is fairly close to how I think and act at times. There are some very humorous parts, which help keep you entertained. The simplistic sentence structure, fairly easy vocabulary, and laid back writing style add to the idea that a good book does not need to be eight hundred pages long.One aspect of the book that impressed me from the start was its ability to capture my interest. Compared to a recent book that I have read, Dracula, it never had a lull and always managed to keep my interest intact. I am not an avid reader, yet I found myself reading it longer than the time that I had allotted each night. Its friendly, yet strikingly amusing tone, managed to keep the story flowing well. I did not care for the excessive vulgar language, because at times it seemed out of place. At some instances in stories, the language can add feeling to the story. However, when over-used, it makes the story seem cheap and unattractive in some respects.Overall, it is a very good story that is definitely worth reading. It is not a very long story, so even if you do not like it, you will not have wasted a good portion of your life. Then again, I thought that this book was very interesting and presented many ideas that cause you to think about your life and the way that you think. It is definitely worth reading once in your life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was really interesting. I thought it would be boring at first, but as I continued reading it I started to enjoy it. Holden Caulfield was a very complex character. I felt that he contradicted himself a lot in the book. Sometimes he would say he didn't like a person or a thing and the next minute he would change his mind. It was a funny book too. I never laugh aloud while reading, but this book was funny in some parts. The things Holden said would make me giggle. In a way the book was depressing. It was about a confused teenager. I thought that Holden lied a lot throughout the book. He would come up with outrageous stories. Overall, I would suggest reading it sometime."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caulfield may have been placed in a mental institution, but his views on the world are more dead-on than those of any of the &quot;phonies&quot; out there who place themselves on pedestals. The novel's dark and seedy style is not for everyone. However, I am a 17-year old boy, just like Holden was at the time he told his story to the psychiatrist, and I can honestly say this book is a must-read for any teenager disgruntled with the self-righteous hypocrites pervading the adult world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm a 14-year-old girl, and frankly I'm disgusted whenever people dismiss Holden as whiny or sick. I think the Catcher in the Rye is one of the most sensitive books I've read in a long time. I myself am tired of optimistic self-help writers and objectivity. I mean, sure, Holden complained a lot, but at least, when he was confronted with phoniness and mediocrity and perversion, he didn't form a little optimistic cocoon like those writers whom most people enjoy. And, as a teenager, I can tell you that most of the behavior Holden observed or succumbed to is very real, and when Salinger confronted it in his novel he wasn't making it up or being overdramatic. Holden never found perfect human behavior, or even managed to attain it himself, but at least I know that someone else tried to do that, rather than lying and saying everything was fine with society."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher In the Rye held my attention throughout the entire book, yet when I reached the end, I found myself thinking: why was this book written? This book is about how someone perceives teenagers to be clueless and finding fault in everything in his world. I do not believe that all teenager are in fact this way. The writing style of Salinger is fresh, with good wit and power, but the story line is not in-depth enough to have any substance. Holden offers few real insights into a teenage world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I chose the novel as my term paper book and I chose to study about Holden's behavior and way of thinking and responding to situations. The novel is full of learnings and very down-to earth. Salinger made a very unique teenager which we can all relate to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a reader I found it to be a well thought out book that had a lot of information that is true within today's society. Especially with the difficulties that teenagers go through these days; it justify's their situation!!!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Not much of a review. I am 17 and reading a story about another 17 year old, behaving rather differently from you really makes you think. I am not inspired. I am just plain amazed and awed by his personality. Realism, forthrightness, hit-you-in-the-face....."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm disappointed in those 17 year old kids who think they are smart enough and experienced enough to negatively judge this amazing book with just one reading. Holden does not represent all teenagers. He is sick and needs help. This book gives us the opportunity to try and understand what some kids experience. Don't try to be like Holden, try to help him."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think it's really funny that most of this book is devoted to examining &quot;phonies&quot;. Holden is a &quot;phony&quot;. This is quite useful information if you prefer to search for meaning in the book; it allows Salinger to say two things at once: e.g.-he points out the phoniness around us, while at the same time decrying the hypocracy of American culture (pointing out phoniness when we ourselves are phony). Pretty interesting, but it doesn't stack up against the more interesting, meaningful, and longer studies of culture that followed, i.e. Catch-22, The Recognitions, Gravity's Rainbow, and Infinite Jest."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I mistakenly wrote a negative review earlier today. That review was for another vendor. I received this CD timely, well packaged and in perfect condition. Disregard my last review.The above was obviously concerning the business I bought the CD from. Concerning the book itself (in my case CD-it is not on Kindle), if you have not read it-read it. The writing style is unique. Although the character has a rather strange outlook on life, many of his thoughts we have all shared whether we want to admist or not. Perhaps most interesting is that although he has a very cynical outlook on life-the book makes you think how much people are judging us negatively when we speak to them. It reads rasily-full of foul language-although again whether we like to admit it or not that's how most teen age boys (for that matter men and women too) talk and think. This is must read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was the selection for my book club, and it was chosen since it is considered a classic. I'm sure at the time it was a masterpiece, and it feels very authentic, but it doesn't really strike me as timeless. The general view of the club was no one really liked it. I'm glad I read it, since I at least now know, but I would not recommend it nor reread it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"So...I know this is a supposed classic and it sooo great and blah blah blah pffft. But, I did not like it. I don't know if it's because I didn't read it in high school like everyone else but read it later in life when I just wanted this whiny spoiled rich kid to shutttt upppppp. I also didn't care for the writing style - some may call it simple prose, I call it crap that my cat could write (and probably would. My cat has a similar sense of entitlement to that of Holden Caulfiend - oops, I mean Caulfield) Now, I try not to let this influence my opinion of J.D. salinger's other celebrated work as I have not yet read anything else by him and I hear Frannie and Zooey is amazing. So, yeah, there you have it. Didn't like Catcher in the Rye, so sue me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not really a kid but I'm writing this review through a family members account & I don't want their name on here.I've got 5 brothers, they all say they had to read this book for school (4 had to read it in junior high, one read it in high school).I didn't have to read it for school but happened to come across it on a vacation & ended up reading it on the plane ride home.This book is very good & entertaining, however, while reading it I could not think of why a school would feel that it is appropriate for kids to be reading for a report.I would never let my kids read this book while living under my roof (yea yea, I know, you can't stop your kids from doing stuff but in an ideal world where this was possible, I would never let them read it).For an adult that wants to somewhat relive their childhood, give it a try.While the character is very hateful & kind of an ass, some stuff he goes through is stuff most people go through so it may bring back a memory or two.I liked this book for the plane ride but don't think I'd ever want to read it again. The character was too much of an ass & I'd rather not 'see' him again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since there are so many reviews already recorded here, I just want to say how cool it would have been if a movie version would have been made for Catcher, and if James Dean would have played the title character, Holden Caulfield. And yes, I do highly recommend this coming-of-age classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently finished reading the book \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" by J.D. Salinger. It was about a teenage boy, Holden Caufield who has gotten kicked out of yet another prep school for failing his classes. While the book was decent, it still had a lot of ups and downs.I think part of the reason I didn't like the book is that I am a fourteen year old girl, and I can't really relate to the events in the book. Too many of the cultural references were before my time, and made it difficult to read at times. I'm also not a fan of books that move slowly, and this book does start off very slow.There are also things that I liked about the book. I liked how the author wasn't afraid of how people would react to his book. He just wrote what he wanted. Another good thing about the book is the even when it was moving slowly I wanted to keep reading to find out why it is one of the most banned books in the United States."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"People never notice anything\\" (9) states Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. The story is a monologue of Caulfield's existence in a privileged society filled with \\"phonies\\" during the 1950s in New York City. Caulfield's parents send him away to boarding school, which does not alter his cynical attitude towards life and prompts him to be extremely apathetic and fail out of multiple schools until he lands at Pencey Prep, where the story begins. The reader discovers that Caulfield is actually very troubled because of the death of his younger brother, which affects his attitude towards life causing him to disregard a life of affluence and conclude that it is empty, providing no comfort, as many believe money can. At one point in the story, Caulfield expresses that money, \\"...always ends up making you blue as hell\\" (133). After being expelled from Pencey Prep, for failing every class except English, he decides to venture into New York City before the letter detailing his expulsion reaches his parents. Caulfield embarks on a journey in search of what is missing in his life and what will ease his depressed state. Masking his feelings behind sarcasm and witty banter, Caulfield reaches desperation, as he stays awake night and day, drowning in his own misery while in search of what will make his life better.This novel is brilliantly composed by Salinger, who examines the life of a teenager who feels lost and trapped inside an empty world. Whether it is his compulsive spending, apathy towards school, or even confusion with the opposite sex, Caulfield is a character that is so real, the reader feels as if he is a troubled friend who is in need of help. Because of his character and the conflicts he faces, Caulfield makes The Catcher in the Rye a timeless masterpiece. In an increasingly material world, the troubles of money and the search for what will bring true happiness is a more relevant theme than ever. Adolescents will always find comfort in knowing that Caulfield felt the same feelings of being ignored or invisible while also enormously pressured to conform to what is acceptable and leave a life of simplicity and innocence, and enter the world of adulthood."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I purchased this CD set for my class and could not be happier. I couldn't imagine a library without it especially with so many reading (and time) impaired students, our dyslexic students are helped immeasurably by this audio. It does not hurt that the narrator is wonderfully expressive and truly brings the story to life. I could not recommend these five compact discs enough. Be sure to check your sellers rating before you buy."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let's start with the fact that this book is an American Classic. It deals with the coming of age of Holden Caulfied, a completely incoragable young man who is not always likeable. That's the thing that sucks you in. This kid swears, smokes, lies, gets kicked out of school, etc. etc. Not exactly the kind of book I want my teenager reading, but in the end, the story all comes together.***Possible Spoilers***Holden is quite intuitive and really sees the underbelly of human nature and the false bravado with which adults live their lives. He, of course, is full of false bravado himself (the scene with the hooker shows that). He calls them like he sees them, even at the expense of others.Is Holden a hero to teens or a rebel without a cause? The answer lies in your own interpretation of this story. Give it a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I didn't much care for the book if I could pinpoint one thing I had a problem with it has to be the fact that Holden Caulfield is a jerk and a somewhat comical figure really who deserved everything that happened to him.This in and of itself does not make the book a bad book the annoying part is that this is one of those books that attracts a really snobbish fan base think Atlas Shrugged, Brave New World or Lord of the Flies only if you can believe it Catcher in the Rye fans make Aynn Rand fans look sane. To those people I say reading a book that someone else wrote and having a strong opinion about it does not in and of itself make you an intellectual. If Catcher in the Rye was you're introduction to the world of literature I can respect that but there are better books to read once you have finished this one Catcher in the Rye is not the end of the road."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a great book for teenagers to read because it is a story about a boy&#65533;s attempt to leave his past in hopes to find his place in the world. Holden, the protagonist of the story, is a troubled teenager who gets kicked out of prep school. Throughout the story, Holden experiences different things while being out on his own. The story takes place in New York City where Holden is forced to deal with many issues of the world such as alcohol, depression, prostitution, suicide, and love. Leaving behind D.B., Phoebe, and Allie (members of his family), who are the antagonists of the story, he tries to understand the world the best he can. There are a few external conflicts that take place, like when Holden and his roommate get in an argument over a girl and the brawl between Holden and Maurice over a prostitute. The central conflict of the story is inside of the main character. Holden struggles to find his true self and tries not to see the world as good and evil but as a whole. As for the ending you will have to read and find out whether or not this young teenager can overcome the problems of the world and realize the true meaning of life.J.D. Salinger uses a number of metaphors in order to help you visualize the story more accurately. He also uses irony, symbolism, and many flashbacks that allow you to see the story from the characters&#65533; point of view. Salinger&#65533;s vivid details help the reader to understand the full impact of the story. The author wrote this book in order to show the many different paths chosen by people for their lives. Many authors show only the &#65533;good side of town&#65533; but as for Salinger he decided to reveal the not so good side. The language used in this book is quite rough, but Salinger uses this in order to display the world as it is in real life. Despite the language, I think this book was well written and interesting for people my age. I am positive many teenagers will be able to relate to the lifestyle of Holden. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to sit down and read a great book about the hardships of life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is an amazing novel. I was fortunate enough to discover this book in New York when I was 14. It was so amazing that I finished it in a day.Basically, if you have not read The Catcher in the Rye, read it. It will be one of the best books you have ever read. The opinions Holden Caulfield, the main character, voices in the novel are simple and true, but they are also revelationary. If I explained much more, I'd give away too much.The Catcher in the Rye will open your eyes to the complexity of society and the joys of life. It is the tale of a disenchanted youth, trying to evade responsibility and preserve the few pieces of innocence he has left.The book is great, the character is great, everything about the story is great. I'm not some crazy hyper-obsessive geek writing this review to impress his literature-obsessed buddies, I'm a normal person (as much as I hate to admit that after reading this book.)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"since im only 15, and i probably sound like an idiot but...i really do like this book. since in high school they make you reader all the \\"great classics\\" and ruin the entire experience for you, i decided to read it before they held a knife to my neck and made me. i've read almost all the books that people say are amazing and i was left very unimpressed. catcher inthe rye i liked because i felt i was actually talking to holden, i laughed, and i felt like i could relate to it. the fact that i laughed really amazed me since i usually never laugh while i read, but CITR did that to me. its a wonderful book, and i'd read it again and again for the rest of my life if i had the time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; by J.D. Salinger is an excellent comming of age novel. You see the world through the eyes of the main character, Holden Caulfield. Salinger uses swirls his unique characters into his &quot;stream of concious&quot; writing style. The blend of Holden's tangents and his simplistic observations of other people serve as a source of comedy and sadness.Holden is a unique character in himself. He observes other people's &quot;phony&quot; actions and ridicules them for it, when at the same time Holden is not perfect by any means. I think the idea of seeing your self, and self-actuality are two of the novel's main themes. Holden is one of the most prominent protagonists in contemporary literature because he is so easily realted to. His hardships of adolescense can apply to almost every teenage in today's world. The struggle for a purpose in life is one of the biggest challenges that people face, and I think the novel shows one way that a lot of people handle it.This novel is one of the best books in American contemporary literature because it carries so many themes and ideas about life that everyone can relate to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What can a person really say about _Catcher in the Rye_ that hasn't already been said? Everyone in the world believes that they are Holden Caufield, and so it seems like everyone should be able to enjoy this book. It is an quick and relatively easy read that has enough depth and feeling to keep the reader moving, and every once in a while, an insight that made me take a deep breathe. It is clearly not the greatest book of all time, but it is easy to identify with Holden as he feels isolated and alienated. It is fun to smile as we see him denounce a type of behavior in someone else, then immediately act in the way he just railed about. It is a good reminder of what it is to be a teenager, and how doing seemingly incomprehensible or destructive actions feels like the only way to fight back against a society that is conformist and authoritarian. It's too bad that the Holden Caufield we all possess passes so quickly from many members of human society. If we could hang on to just a little of his spirit, it might do us a world of good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden is hilarious. The book works because he is speaking directly to the reader, and tells stories that are ridiculously funny without his trying to amuse. And, yes, he himself is a huge phony. This technique is called irony -- and Salinger is no dummy. The fact that Salinger wrote the book without any intentional moral, message, or goal makes it even more special. It is not forced or trite. The book is very, very sad, yet very, very funny. It is a masterpiece NOT because it is so \\"realistic\\" or because Holden reminds us all of ourselves, but because it is novel, creative, and above all, memorable. I have read this book a number of times, and find a new insight with each reading. Kudos to Salinger."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book, to say the least, is very unusual. But I think that's why I love it so much. Holden Caulfield sounds eerily like any teenager you might've run into back then, or even now. This book is completely unique; it doesn't even really have one dignified plot, but instead, many subplots. This book is a page-turner because it's very interesting in the sense that it's about everything in the world, and nothing at all. This is a must-read, and I promise you will never forget it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To tell you the truth, I went into reading THE CATCHER IN THE RYE only because my cousin had insisted it was a good book. Once I read a few pages, I was completely hooked! You can understand a young adolescent boy for who he is and at some points even yell at him for what he believes! I loved reading about Holden because he made me think of things I loved, hated, and took for granted. At one part, he mentioned something about how school did nothing for him and that he only enjoyed English. He loved his family very much and I thought that was very sweet. His sister did sounds just as cute as he had said. In conclusion, I would efinately recommend this book to those who never read it, and even to those who already did to read it again. Nothing can be wrong when you read a good book twice or more, because it offers you the great values only great literature can give. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a personal favorite of mine and I will someday make sure that my children read it too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I mean it! I really do! I know this book has little action, no intrigue, no super covert symbolism, believe me I know this. But it is still one of the, uh, lets say, Top 3 books I have ever read! I loved it!!!Lets take a look at our Protagonist, Holden Caufield. This book is entirely his narration of one weekend after he gets kicked out of private school. He decides to run away for a few days into NYC. There he runs into old friends, prostitutes, pimps, nuns, and a bunch of other classic characters. But it is not these people that draw your interest. It is Holdens thoughts and feelings towards each of them that makes this story a classic. His thoughts are sometimes dreary, sometimes off-the-wall, and sometimes HILARIOUS, and all the time fascinating! I gotta admit that even though Holden was supposedly losing his mind, I would be willing to bet each one of us can relate to the thoughts he has. I found myself, many times, agreeing with his take on things, despite the fact that critics and psychologists declare his take bordered on the insane...I say right on Holden!That is what makes this a classic...the fact that despite his problems we can all relate!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've read 'The Catcher In the Rye' twice. Once when I was 14 years old and the second time more recently when i was 19. When I first discovered this book it soon became the most riveting read of my life. The subjects that it covers were ones that were extremley interesting to me at that age, so I found it to be very enjoyable.However the second time i read it I found it extremley hard work to enjoy as much as I once did. I feel that a mature reader will find Holden Caulfield to be a very annoying and obnoxious character, as I did on this occassion.On the other hand the story does move at a fast pace and is truly captivating. 'The Catcher in the Rye' has many devoted followers and many non-followers, I prefer to sit on the fence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff (...)\\"J. D. Salinger is an American novelist and best known for this very book, The Catcher in the Rye, which is considered a classic of USA's literature, being in Times list of 100 best books since 1923.This book tells a rather uninteresting story of this sixteen-year-old character Holden Caulfield and his wanders through New York for a couple days, after his expulsion from his boarding school, exposing the real face of teenager's life, in which the main character is also the narrator. What is perhaps more interesting is that he has such a depressed and lonely way of life that it is almost impossible not to have anything in common with this global character, who is supposed to represent the transition from childhood to adult life.When I started reading this book, I found out that I was addicted to it, even though it had no plot at all. It really doesn't, it's just a dude telling about his life. But it is Holden who you are actually reading. I have never read, in my whole life, such a descriptive and well-developed character. You actually feel that you are reading a teenager's book who has failed in about four schools, not an intellectual like J. D. Salinger. That's probably why the book is so addictive: it's a clean and straightforward writing, which makes it feel real, a very real account. I do have a lot against writers and philosophers who are claimed to be wonderful and swell, but they can't write clearly such as Salinger does. This book may be read by anyone - in fact, it is aimed to teenagers and I do recommend them to read - and anyone who reads this book will understand what it is talking about. Some of them may not like, but they will surely get the least of it.Holden Caulfield is this teenager that wanders around New York and lives a very teenager life - don't forget this book was written in the 50's - and finds himself in the transition from child to adulthood; facing problems like an adult - and that's probably why Salinger set him alone in NY - but still with a mind of a kid. While he tries to evolve, starts to find out that everybody looks fake and lousy, but he turns out to be a complete hypocrite, which is probably the main purpose of the book.The title deserves five stars just for itself. Although you read the book until about the middle without getting where the author is trying to get you to, when Holden hears a little boy singing this song about a catcher in the rye - which he actually misspelled -, everything starts making sense. Holden flies through the book trying to find a shoulder to lean on, someone that will hold him while he's passing through his puberty, sexual life and depressing times of adolescence; and that's what he searches, even unaware of what's actually happening.While he's not getting anything that's valuable from his current relationships - which are represented by his Pencey school and his friends in there -, he goes way back to the innocence of childhood and brings back his old memories and relationships in attempt to survive the hard times that is entering the adulthood. But when he actually gets to those memories, he is not a kid anymore and his mind has changed. In this quest of finding \\"a catcher in the rye\\", Holden even unburies his dead brother Allie and contacts people who are still in their innocent times - such as his sister - and people who are really in the adulthood, like his old teachers.This transition is easily seen in every sense. From trying to drink being a minor to a massive change of his views on the world, contrasted by what he remembered things to be and what they really are right now. I highly recommend this book to anyone. This is surely one of the best - if not the best - novels I have ever read in my entire life. Although aimed to teenagers, this story is surely universal.100/100"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Yeah, me an a billion other people had to re-read it with Salinger's passing. Teenage angst/mental breakdown was done better by Sylvia Plath (The Bell Jar), and while there are affecting scenes particularly with Phoebe, I thought the emphasis on shock became gratuitous"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is a very simple book to read, but along with its simplicity is its embedded with an insurmountable amount of substance. This is one of those books that requires the reader to become readily equipped with a hammer, chisel and magnifying class before tackling the first page. This book contains a number of themes and insights that are worth analyzing such as childhood, teenage pressure, sex, sexuality, intuition, \\"phoniness\\" in society, etc. Since it is such a quick read, Salinger knew what he was doing when he was constructing this book by placing relevant themes, motifs and symbols that still applies to modern times.Fitted with wit, personality, depth and not to mention memorable quotes, Catcher in the Rye is book that is crafted with beautiful and mesmerizing brush strokes on canvas that will leave the reader in awe and appreciation. This is probably my favorite book, but I am currently halfway through Richard Adam's Watership Down, and Catcher in the Rye will most likely be bumped to number two on my list."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Cather in the Rye represents exposure to the unknown world. This is an Excellent book and I recommend it to everyone with a desire to learn about life."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"What struck me most about this book is its disarming casualness. Salinger remains one of the most unpretentious and talented author, who weaves the story so naturally that the reader becomes a witness to life itself enfolding before the minds eye! A very bitter sweet novel, which gives an authentic glimpse into the heart of a teenager! It is poignant yet amusing story of a boy who is driven by his inner instinct of yearning for the ideal amidst a phony world.An interesting thing: Though Holden's mind wanders weirdly to escape from the depressing world around him, at the end the real \\"he\\" stops him in the face of his love for his kid sister. He is compelled to tell this story to the reader, but he doesn't like it. He doesn't want to remember anything about it-clearly because when he does that he becomes too sentimental about the interesting people he misses!A timeless masterpiece!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher stands up to the tests of time. I recently re-read it with my fiancee. We enjoyed Holden's travails."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Read this because a friend told me it was her favorite book. I did not enjoy Holden Caulfield's character at all. He was whiny, obnoxious, and extremely hypocritical (I guess that's the point?), and I just could not look past it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently reread \\"The Catcher in the Rye;\\" the first time I'd read it, like most of us, was in high school literature class. Though I enjoyed it back then, I didn't understand Salinger's literary feat as I do now. He captures the voice of a sixteen-year-old, confused, grieving boy masterfully. This is literature at its best."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Either is not yet available for the European market or I am just unable to find it..How come this American classic does not have an e-book version just yet? Incomprehensible, really..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book is just fantastic. It was in perfect condition with no scratch or pen mark, like it just been made.

Holden Caulfield is funny, likeable, vulnerable, and interesting. I find it so easy to relate to Holden as do many of my friends. The Catcher in the Rye is a beautiful novel about the difficulties of growing up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is one of salinger's best book.

I was pleasantly suprised. Holden, while frequently cynical, was entertaining and funny. His problems were unique, but he displayed himself just like a teen, and made everyone remember those days growing up."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger has sucessfully portrayed the feelings of the average American Adolescent... To not read this book would be to contradict the necesities that all Americans endure. A classic, Salinger's Holden Caufield works himself into every reader's psychie, as well as their emotions. Even today i have been unable to find an individual who has NOT been able to relate to the trials of Holden... he is an inspiration to be oneself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger is nothing less than a literary genius. Not only has he written a book that has helped many teenagers, including myself, come to term with the emotion turmoil revolving in their heads, he has written a book that even the open-minded adult reader would cherish. He has written this book so elouqently and with such brutal diction. He has written the quintessencial teenage angst novel: an expelled teen that runs away from school for a solo 3 day excursion in New York City, while at the same time trying to find a conneciton to the real world and beating his bloody fists against a brick wall of phonies. I have read this book 6 times, and I plan to read it 60 more times before I die."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of the Best books that I have ever read! Not only does Sallinger do a wonderful job of presenting the inner-thoughts of a troubled teen, but he also describes this tale in a unique and creative style. This classic 5-star tale is an excellent choice to read. I would recommend it to anyone. Do yourself a favor and read it!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To be honest, I have not read that many books in my life. This book, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, was given to me as a school assignment. At first, I thought it would be a boring book, just like all the other ones that they give in school. I ended up loving this book. I love Holden Caulfield. Holden speaks the truth about life and about adolesence. He says things that a lot of us feel but don't really admit. Many of the things that Holden speaks of really makes sense. You start to feel that you're not the only one who thinks the same things. I would tell anybody and everybody to read this book. I can totally understand why this book is a classic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hmm...Having your privacy invaded (your personal letters put up for sail, your love affairs made public) is good for sales, I guess. Oh, well, this was a great book then, and it's a great book now. Just to be sure you don't misunderstand it, you might like to read some other J.D. Salinger works as well--at least the delightful &quot;Nine Stories&quot;.I also very much recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a true classic and has lost little luster with time. I recently read The Triumph and the Glory, about fledling youth thrown into the crucible of war, and one of the characters reminded me of Holden Caulfield, so I read Catcher again. Both books are profoundly moving. They both are coming of age tales, perhaps that's why they stick in my mind together. But by all means read Catcher in the Rye, it is timeless."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"catcher in the rye is the most entertaining and enlightening novel out there. this book made me laugh a lot and see all the phoniness out there. and since i live by N.Y.C., i could relate somewhat to Holden Caufield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I despised this book. I found Holden to be arrogant, and one of the most annoying people on the planet. Tthe funny thing is, he's not a person, he's a character, and he truly made me mad. I had to force myself to finish the book because I would become so annoyed with Holden. It's a well written book, but I just could not stand him at all. If you are one to get annoyed very easily then do not read this book. Save yourself from the agony. As far as the story goes, it was okay. Things click with you from here and there... reasons for this, reasons for that. In all, I found nothing spectacular about this book and I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have been wanting to read &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot; for the past three years. The moment I actually picked up the book, I regretted every moment I had spent wanting to find pleasure in the story.I understand Holden. He is like a normal 15 year old boy. Trying to fit in, not knowing his place in the world; but his techniques with whining and always befuddling the world around him got tiring after the first three chapters. God forbid someone acts like a 'phony' for even one second of their life around Holden.I would have liked this book better if it had some sort of technique thrown into it, and perhaps a specific goal that was worth going through all two hundred and something pages. Yes, the ending was a bit of a surprise but not enough to be handed a 'spectacular realistic ending' title to it.If you like reading more realistic, based on what could really happen in your youth life books, then I recommend this. But if you are a heavy reader and are more sought out to read things with more integrity, intelligence and adventure, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Forget the hype and the idiocy. It's a [false] book and the author's constant use of \\"and all\\" to keep reminding us that the main character is a teen begins to grate from the very first page. This is a book that I have attempted to read all the way through for the past 25 years and could never, ever get past the third page. I mean it was sheer agony. This guy Salinger is so overrated it's laughable, just like Dostoevsky and his Crime and Punishment. And as far as Salinger not wanting to be bothered goes--fine. Leave the man alone. I mean who cares what he does or how he lives his life? I never could be interested in this guy who has written a book I could never bring myself to finish anyway. What is the big deal?People (read gullible types) don't seem to get that this is nothing more than his publisher's ploy to keep book buyers buying the...Catcher...People (some people) wonder why Salinger hasn't written/published anything in forty years.

It was one that was on so many recommended reading lists in high school and college, but I never got around to it. It is supposed to be a classic work for an American novel. It has been quoted or referred to in so many other works or movies that I figured it must be riveting. I actually do find the writing to be brilliant, but the story's plot, characters, dialogue and narration are frustrating and boring. There is so much slang that it is extremely, staunchly stuck in its period. I think Salinger could have gone so much further with less slang and vulgarity. You understand right away that the main character is immature and makes no growth throughout the whole story, but the repetitive slang and vulgarity becomes a distraction and diminishes other things that Salinger tries to accomplish. How come I still find it to be brilliant? Because I think Salinger wrote it the way he did intentionally. I think he wants every flaw of Caulfield to stand out in blaring fashion. I think he wants the period to be captured in cement, to have this work stand as a testimony to the deep-seated narcissism in the adolescents of that day, or maybe adolescence in general. I am sure that Salinger has expressed his intentions and the many intellectuals have a better understanding of what he wanted to accomplish, but I find it ironic that the story is held up so enthusiastically as a model for coming of age and adolescent rebellion. If Salinger wants this story to be viewed in such a romantic vision, I think he would have wanted to make the characters and their experiences to be more attractive rather than shallow and pathetic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is a thoroughly entertaining look into a lost youth who cannot seem to associate with anyone or anything, and struggles to find any purpose to his or anyone's life. He doesn't seem unlike many people (youths and adults) who don't feel like they connect to anyone, or at best marginally connect with just a few people. The dialog is entertaining, the narration is entertaining, the entire book is entertaining.It's a great story that I feel nobody wants to associate with, but deep down everyone can associate with at least a little bit from one time in our life (and that one time could possibly be now)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book has always been one of my favorites and I even read it 2 times.

The story is essentially the quintessential American coming of age story, however, beyond this, there is so much here that's possible to discuss.It's for that reason that it's worth reading: in order to discuss it with others who have read it. I don't find this to be a demerit on its part. Not at all. Art that inspires discussion can be great art... in fact, maybe only art that inspires discussion can even be considered good.The reason why I haven't fallen in love with this book and have given it such a low rating is because I feel like it offered me very little in terms of personal revelation. For me to love a piece it must teach me something, offer some sort of revelation. Just enabling me to discuss it with others is not enough for me to find a work to be great.By no means, however, would I attempt to dispute the meaning another may find within these pages. It simply did not resonate with me. For others this is not the case. Either way, it is a very easy read, so just read it quickly one night and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"To write a review of Catcher in the Rye is almost silly. It is undeniably a modern classic. That said, you either get it or you don't. I've met a lot of people that hate the thing. Their biggest complaint is that the novel seems to be a random collection of thoughts without any plot. There is definitely a plot...but the narrative voice is so strong that it overwhelms the storyline. Basically, Holden Caulfield's inner mind IS the plot. If you don't appreciate the uniqueness and humor of that voice, then you're not going to enjoy this book. I happen to love it. In fact, I spent YEARS trying to find a book with a similar narrative voice. Of course nothing matches J. D. Salinger, but Peter Cordovan's The Mental Defective League comes close.The Mental Defective League"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some will love it, some won't. I like this book because I feel everyone has a little bit of Holden Caulfield in them. Sure, Holden can be annoying. I bet you find yourself telling Holden to shut his \\"goddam\\" mouth once in a while. Well, that's why I like it. Salinger did a great job creating Holden. He is one of the most believable characters I have ever read about. I have read this book numerous times, and I have never grown tired of it. I think one good reason it gets a bad rep is because in some schools it's a reading requirement, and young people don't like being told what to read. I read it in the 7th grade and was required to read it in the 9th grade, which of course was no problem for me, but everyone in class struggled with it. Maybe they shouldn't make it a requirement...If you're reading it, pay attention to when Holden puts his hunting cap on. What is going on? And can you relate? There are many symbolic meanings floating around about the hunting cap.

It is a bunch of jumbled memories and personal thoughts and opinions. They are very pleasing to read, and his &quot;kill the phonies&quot; attitude matches mine exactly which was very intreaging for me to read about, but when I finished the book, as I did about 15 minutes ago, I was left with this feeling of disbelief.

I must say that Holden Caulfield is someone any teenager can really relate to. He may be a little screwed up, but he is an independent thinker and realistic. Holden represents a lot of misunderstood people out there. I will always consider this book one of my favorites. Out of all the books that I had to read in high school, this book sticks out as the most memorable and the one that I, as an individual, have learned the most from."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Out of all the books I have read in high school, I would have to say that this is the only book that touched me enough to make me remember everything about it. Not only does the reader connect to Holden Caulfield, they can also admire his individual train of thought. This was a hard book to put down after starting. Although Holden is a very cynical character, it is something almost everyone can relate to. It is almost as though the reader lives the experiences along with Holden. This will remain my favorite book for a long time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I simply do not understand how anyone can say this book is anything more than a worthless story about a worthless human being. The central character is a spoiled brat, who can not be happy with anything his privelaged position has given him, and instead seeks to spread his misery to all the people that he comes into contact with. Whether it be a hooker, or a school chum, or his own family.If it wasn't for the main characters constant whining, there would be no plot at all. This has to be, without a doubt the worse book I have ever read. The authors only real accomplishment is that he seems to be able to write complete sentences."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye / J.D. Salinger; My opinion.I have not much to say about this book, only that I didn't like it very much.I think it's too long-winded and dull. I really got bored of it. The central figure, Holden Caulfield, talks to much about stupid details, and when he's telling us something, he begins to talk about something else in the middle of his story. He's to busy with all the stupid toughts he has, and that really irritates me. An other thing that bores me, is that Holden uses some expletives like &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;I mean ...&quot;, ...I also think that this book is ridiculous because, if you have read it and you will write the story down, it's about one page long without all those useless, stupid details.I find the book also to &quot;difficult&quot;; the story is not difficult to understand, neither are the words that are used in the book, but it's not easy to follow when the narrator (who is Holden) changes the subject constantly. I mean that he begins to talk about something, and when he uses someones name for example, he begins to describe this person immediatly. When he has finished describing this person (for example two pages later), he begins again talking about the first subject. At the time that he's there again, you have already forgotten the subject, and you have to read the whole passage again to understand what he's saying.This is all I have to say about the book, I have no good words for it, and I am glad it's finished now."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm not the kind of person who reads a lot of books and this book is a reason why. First the story is not interesting and also the way it's told is very stupid. It takes you hourst to read it and then find out you just read about some stupid 'adventure' of a young lad which i don't even believe, even if it's fiction. Just reading about a young depressed kid, makes me depressed, not just because i wasted my time reading it, but because it's just not a good story. The last thing i want to say is that the repetition in this book is terrible. Every 5 sentences the same word: Chrissake, goddam, sunnavabitch... Just read the first 5 pages and then you read the whole book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had thought for many years I was missing something by not having read the 'classic' Catcher in the Rye. After suffering through this highly, unsatisfying, cynical read, I have to pause and wonder how we have come to this point as a society. Here we revere a character that has not a positive word to say about anybody and who laughably ruminates on the essence of phoniness in his world, all the while whining about his deep-seeded depression. Holden Caulfield is the epitome of the phoniness he holds in such contempt. Of course the baby boomer generation relates to this moronic, critical, lazy character who brazenly takes opportunities given to him by his parents, namely a quality expensive education, and squanders them one after another. Then this lout has the unmitigated gall to take Christmas money from his little sister. Holden Caulfield is a vapid, soulless character, much like the entire baby-boomer generation that has venerated Salinger and never grown out of t! heir own adolescent, self pitying depression. Let it be known that I am 35 years old, not some old codger compaining about the younger generation. For the sake of future generations, I beg with informed readers everywhere to reveal this sham of considering Catcher in the Rye a classic for what it really is - a pathetic piece of drivel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was on my to-read list and I'm so glad I picked it up as a gift for myself while holiday shopping.

Are you constantly ridiculed and/or picked on? Or are you just cynical and mad at the world? If you are any or all of these things, this is the book for you. It is your bible. Holden Caulfield IS you. Sorta. And he IS me. Sorta. We can relate.That is what makes the book so good, it is realistic and believable. It could happen to anyone. In fact, it happens, more or less, to hundreds, maybe thousands, of teenagers every year. Out of all the characters in popular literature, Holden is probably the most &quot;real&quot; to his readers, with the possible exception of Sherlock Holmes. I know people who thought this was a true story and wondered why the author's name didn't match Holden's.All this is not to say that only teenagers will like the book. They are more likely to like it, but anyone could like it. It is a realistic description of the world. Many of the things said in the book about human nature are so dead-on accurate that is it damn near scary.SPOLER ALERT. The sad ending, where Holden ends up in a mental ward is depressing. One can only wonder what would've happen if he had gotten his cabin in the woods like he wanted..."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Although I have read this book 3 times in earlier years, I found it full of new surprises this time around as I read it for a class. I can identify greatly with the main character, Holden Caulfield, as he roams through the streets of New York, looking for anything to give him some self confidence in his life. You can't help but feel sorry for him as he puts on facades of swearing and acting tough to compensate for yearning and loneliness. He is expelled from his school, and decides to leave several days early and spend some time in New York city before he faces the music of explaining his recent mishaps to his parents. Holden encounters all sorts of situations in the few days before he finally goes home, all of which are detailed in this book. J.D. Salinger writes a wonderful representation of what a teenage boy feels inside many times throughout his life, searching for acceptance, and self realization all in one step. The symbolizm which gives the book its title is masterful and is one of the more analyzed aspects of this American classic novel. I would rate this novel very high on a list for young adults, but would advise against for those under the age of 16 because of the profanity. Pick it up if you havent already and I promise that you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"giving this book a favorable review is almost clich&eacute;. the one thing that, i think, most everyone that has read this book would agree upon, is that it is truly timeless. since it's publishing in 1951 this book has become an american classic.the story is simple enough but rich with many characters. the main character holden caulfield is sometimes &lt;as in the story&gt; misunderstood. i paraphrase yogi berra, &quot;.. i thought catcher in the rye was about baseball, turns out it's just about some whinny kid ..&quot; this comment was made tongue in cheek and to illicit a laugh but those who do not enjoy this book often leave with this misconception.the story is really one that would seem to be ripped more from today's generation x then the era it was written. holden is experiencing many difficulties in life, most of which appear to be centered around authoritative figures. the book is written in holden's narrative and although he tries to come off as sophisticated, cynical, or perhaps even aloof he's really just looking for meaning or to be understood.i realize that my review can only inspire you so much to read this book. i wish i could do more. i can only suggest that if you have not read this book - buy it .. read it. if you have read this book - read it again. regardless, your time will be well spent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Your asking why 3 stars. Well honestly I would have made it 3 1/2 if that justifies it. The reason why it didn't get the standard amazon.com ranking of 5 stars is because it just did not seem profound enough or motivating enough to get anymore. I was always jealous of not being able to read this in high school (for some reason it was not required) and I made a point of reading it someday (afterall this book was voted the best book by high school seniors this year in Illinois.)Salinger did a wonderful job writing in a first person adolescent style speech, and the character desiring to be the 'catcher in the rye' seemed ironic. Nevertheless, I finished the book shrugging my shoulders and thinking 'what was the point?' It was well written, but I am not sure why it was voted as the best book by high schoolers - if any book should have had that honor I would think it would have been Harper Lee's book, To Kill a Mockingbird - which was also simply written but definitely felt more profound than this. Holden Caulfield is a typical cynical teenager that really has a hard time dealing with the senselessness of humanity. Nevertheless, I just didn't have any feelings toward the book afterward and it didn't feel as profound as many other reviewers felt it was.I think everyone should read the book, but if you're over the age of 18, I think you'll find yourself saying - I wish I would have read this a few years ago because I feel I have outgrown the attitudes that Holden expresses. Will I have my kids read it some day? Absolutley, but would I say it was the best book I've read. No."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the archetypal book of angst and enlightenment, a novel of growth and realization. Full of symbolism and hidden meaning, this novel captures the very essence of the teenage soul. It is a study of the problems that plague nearly all adolescents. Holden Caulfield wants to catch others from falling, but first he must learn to catch himself. I strongly reccomend this book to all who haven't read it, and all who have but don't own it. It'll be yours to read whenever you start feeling like you're dissapearing every time you cross the road.(PS, though Catcher in the Rye is about adolescents, it is not for adolescents only.

They cancelled my crumby show, even if it was phony, and now I'm forced to write this god*** book about the aftermath because I went from a cute kid to an ugly monster who still bats my eyes. I have to go to school with all these people who never listen to my pesty whining, and I'm sexy even though I'm a virgin, I really am. Of course, I would never admit that to any of those phony, crumby jocks I don't like but still force my company on and all.I get kicked out of school because I'm a rich preppy spoiled brat, and I lose all my money as I hide out in a hotel, chicken out with a hooker, and get beat up by her pimp. Who can blame him? I'm a total loser, I really am.From there, I call up everyone I know to hang around with me because beggars can't be choosers, and everyone gets mad at me because I'm annoying, they really do. I can handle my liquor, I really can (I guess that makes me William Holden Caulfield.), and any girl who doesn't like me is stupid, so I feel sorry for them. Even my little sister can't take anymore, and all I seem to do is hate everyone except little kids and dead people like my brother Wally--er, Allie.Okay, that's enough; you get the drift. This book is so overrated, I just can't appreciate its mass appeal as classic literature. There is no point to it at all, except for this kid to prove what a rich brat he is, whine and smart off to people he doesn't even like although he insists on hanging around with them, and brag constantly about virtues he doesn't have, making him one of the biggest hypocrites and phonies of them all. Repetitive, whiny, and a total waste of time. And where are his parents through the entire thing while he's out getting into trouble?

It was a brilliantly written book and is just awesome.The story is of Holden Caulfield, a teenager who hates everything and doesn't apply himself....ever. He drops out of school after school with nothing changing. This novel goes through his life after he is kicked out of Pencey, and goes to New York for a while. In New York, he deals with his family, prostitutes, perverts and much more. It is a must read for anyone. It dives down into the thoughts of every teenager, but also the minds of everyone.

Catcher in the Rye, as everyone hopefully knows, is the story of one weekend in the life of Holden Caulfield. Holden has just failed out of another Prep School and, after getting in a fight with his roomate, flees to New York City, where he holes up in a hotel rather than go home to face his parents.As his story unfolds, we learn that he had a beloved younger brother who died of leukemia and Holden has been extremely troubled since then. In one of the more memorable images in literature, Holden explains that he sees himself as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (he has misremembered a Robert Burns lyric as &quot;if a body catch a body coming through the rye&quot;). He imagines a flock of little kids running through a field of rye along a cliff precipice and he is poised at the edge trying to catch them before they fall. But Holden isn't just troubled by the Mortality of others, as one character tells him, he is spiritually troubled by the morality of others. He rages against all of the &quot;phonies&quot; and &quot;mean people&quot; he meets. What could make a young man feel more ineffectual and helpless than taking responsibilty for the mortality &amp; morality of the whole human race?This story of a young man coming of age, trying to understand the human failings of those around him, is one of the great works of Literature &amp; should rank much higher on the Modern Library list.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I thought that this was one of the best books I ever read. It was a summer assignment and I was a little skeptical at first, but I got right into it. Someone once told me that it was one of the most appalling books they ever read because it just talked about how this boy hated everything. I thought that that was what made the book great. It told the truth and people hate hearing the truth becasue they find out that everything is not happy go lucky. Somethings are depressing and sad and J.D Salinger was one of the first people to admit that and I think he did a great job in doing so."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book opens as Houlden is awaiting Christmas vacation and the first day of his expulsion. He tells of how he can't stand his roommate and all the guys that go to Pency. Then he leaves three days early. He quickly packs and heads... somewhere. Since he did not want his parents to know he failed all of his subjects except English, he detours and spends three days in New York hotel. While in a cab, he strikes up a conversation with the driver. Then Houlden pops the question that follows him throughout all his cab rides. &quot;You know those ducks in that lagoon right near Central Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you know where they go, the ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know by any chance?&quot;(page 60). The driver could not tell him. But he knew what happened to the fish... they get frozen under water. It puzzled me that the driver could not tell Houlden the answer. Then I learned that the ducks were a symbol for something else in his life. Houlden used to have a brother Allie, but he died of leukemia. Houlden is sort of an atheist so he does not believe much in G-d. If there is no G-d, there is no heaven for him, either. Houlden still thinks about him often. It makes Houlden wonder where Allie is. The ducks are a metaphor for Allie. Houlden wants to know where did Allie really go. Catcher in the Rye is a good story for teens to read. I felt as though I could I relate to some of the situations. J.D. Salinger did an excellent job of looking through a teenager's eyes at the surrounding world. The &quot;goddamns&quot; gave that real teen approach, but I think it was a little overdone. This book was written in the fifties, and it's nice to that some things about teens will never change. I found the last chapter of the book to be rather confusing. In its shortness, you have to read carefully to notice the details that tell his fate about his breakdown. Houlden drops small clues about his psychological problem as the book develops. Breaking all the windows of the car with his bare hands after Allie dies would be one of the signs. Houlden doesn't tend to interact with others well. At his last school, Pency, we know he doesn't get along with Stradlater, Ackley or any of his classmates. He doesn't get along with Sally, either. There are, although, some people he gets along with... Jane, Allie, Phoebe, the nuns at the restaurant. The tone of the story is depressed. To me, it seems more clearly stated than in most books. Everything about Houlden is depressed, except at the end when he's watching Phoebe on the carousel. Houlden was a rather flat character, or didn't change much throughout the length of the novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Throughout this book, Holden is not just searching for the meaning of life, but more specifically the meaning of his life. After nearly forty hours of bars, prostitutes and trashy hotels, he finds it. Happiness. Plain and simple, right? Unfortunately no. This spawns another question. What makes you happy? For Holden, it was watching his sister Phoebe ride the carousel in the park. It did take him, however, aout seventeen years to discover that. Even worse, there are people out there much older than that that still aren't sure what makes them happy. That's why through Holden's example, the importance of finding yourself and finding what makes you happy is so important. Because of his innate knowledge of life Holden seems to teach life lessons throughout his journey through New York."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I didn't like The Catcher in the Rye all that much because it confused me at the beginning. Holden Cauefuild, the main character talks about getting kicked out of his high school and staying in a hotel for three days because he can't go home because his parents will be mad. While staying in a hotel in New York, Holden talks about his life experiences with love, girls, drinking, and his brother dying. He talks about how he misses his brother very much. Also he mentions another brother in Hollywood. He often goes back and forth about different situations in his life. He really doesn't stick to one thing. Holden acts as if he as all these problems and no one to talk to. He goes to bars in New York to clear his mind but that doesn't work. He just creates bigger problems for himself. Holden also goes out with one of his friends to try to get his mind off things but instead he gets ill. I understand how he feels, but I didn't like how he cusses. Yeah, that's how we all talk, but the language got annoying after awhile. I would read this book again only if I had to. But if you heard good things about it that interested you, then read it and find out if you like it better than I did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I heard a lot about this very book, but never exactly knew what it was all about. So finally i bought and i was deeply impressed. I never would have thought it to be possible that 2 days in someelse's life could make me look that throughouly at my own life. I asked myself about at million times if I am a phoney too.I can recommend everybody to read this book, but read it open minded, you have to experience it. Most certainly one of the best books i've ever read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is the most accurate, precise depiction of adolescence. Perhaps if this book has something wrong with it, it's that it's too real. Not much amazing stuff seems to happen in real life, and the same goes for what happens in this book. After a while, Holden's cynical, often hilarious observations get a bit old."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Personnally, I really liked it. It's all about this teenage boy dealing with teenage problems like: what will my future be like and also pressures from his parents. the author wrote just like a teenage boy would talk. This book is extremely alive and refreshing but at the same time, a book that encounters the problems of adolescents."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I know it is probably akin to a crime against humanity to dis this book, after all who hasn't had to read this book in high school? But, I recently reread this book some 25 years after high school and I'm sorry but the language is a little bit out of date. Wouldn't it be great if Salinger came out of retirement and rewrote this book to today's language standards? It is still the best novel around about the alienation of America's youth (and boy are they ever alienated now more than ever) so it is still a worthwhile read if you can get past the archaic language. Come back J.D. we need you more than ever!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I swear to God, if I ever meet a teen as whiny, obnoxious, and self-absorbed as Holden Caulfield I will knock the little punk arse-over-teakettle.And yet, this book is praised to the skies and is the staple reading for high school students everywhere. Why? Don't talk to me about \\"realism,\\" or \\"edginess,\\" or \\"life experience.\\" Holden is like every adult-formed stereotype of adolescence multiplied threefold. He's almost impossible to identify with. What would teens have to learn from a character like this, with so few redeeming qualities (he likes his little sister and gets upset over a little graffitti.. really, that's all), except that it's perfectly acceptable to lie, whine incessantly, and throw a strop when life takes an inevitable curve?Holden has no desire to elevate himself from being a pessimistic drain on society. He gets booted out of his fourth school, calls everything and everyone \\"phony,\\" and has all the ambition of a garden slug. If Holden were an actual person in 2005, I'm sure he'd be on Ritalin, Prozac, or some combination thereof.Even if a more sympathetic character were at the helm, the book is essentially rambling and lacks any real adventure or goings-on. Holden's trip to New York City basically consists of (yawn) more griping and some marginally interesting sightseeing of the Big Apple's seamier side. Occassionally redeeming is Salinger's prose, which is straightforward but contains a few nice bits (namely the source metaphor of the novel's title as a symbol for lost innocence). It's troubling and a real sign of the times, however, that a book like this would be embraced as \\"classic.\\" Kinda puts the current, shallow, teen-oriented music of today like Korn and Bright Eyes in perspective, eh? There's no better market than angsty youth, and Catcher In The Rye simply perpetuates the cycle."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Having never read this book when I was supposed to in highschool, I realize I never missed anything.

So i decided to give it a shot and see what the hell was so special about it.Well, the answer is nothing... This book just rambles on in its &quot;1940's rebel style. To be frank it had virtually no redeeming qualities other than the jargon he used (swell, terrific, sexy, flitty, and grippy). I kept expecting him to break out of his pathetic existence and kill a bunch of people or find value in his life. He did neither. Instead I spent a few days reading into the mind of your typical pathetic teenage brat.Don't bother reading."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger has been called a great writer.

The fact is though, this book is pointless, its like a docusoap on channel 5 (thats a UK thing!) shown at two in the morning, which noone watches anyway.

A *very* short time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"While I doubt that this book would rate as meaningful, or powerful enough to be subversive, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's because I can't relate to a spoiled preppie kid. Maybe it's because I read it when I was too old to appreciate it's message. Whichever the case, Holden Caulfield is nothing more than a snot nosed crybaby. I fail to see why Salinger is such an acclaimed writer, either. It's nothing more than an exercise in self indulgence."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The first thing you'll probably want me to say is how great 'The Catcher in the Rye' is, and how it changed my life, and all that existential angst crap - but I don't feel like saying that, if you want to know the truth.It's just a book, for chrissakes, about some lousy goddamn kid who goes to New York for a few days. If there's one thing I hate, it's phoney books. Don't even mention that Holden Caulfield guy to me. So he's a bit screwed up and all. So what? And don't start talking about the human condition, either - I'm touchy as hell about that. We've all gone through that madman stuff; I don't need some goddamn crazy author telling me how it feels.

Yes, it's cynical and full of youthful angst but with no point, no moral, no closure. I don't wish to add to the time I wasted reading it to comment any further. The only reason I rated this with 1 star, is that there was no option for no starsIf you've got the time, spend it reading other required high school books, i.e. \\"1984\\", \\"Animal Farm\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\"- time much better spent."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Probably because of how stupid it is. It's been years since I read it, but I can sum it up for you. It follows the experiences of a spoiled rotten dumbass rich kid with no drive, no motivation, no goals, no self respect. Why? Because he's never worked a day in his life and expects the world to feel sorry for him because he has teenage angst. This kid could be considered the orginal emo without the make up. Yeah he shows signs of schitzophreina, but that really doesn't make him more compelling or pitful. Bottom line, this is the saga of a self centered little bastard incapable of feeling any emotion for anyone save perhaps his little sister. It's not timeless, the story teaches nothing, but creates a model of an idiot. I'll say this though, if you are a parent and you're kid turns out like this kid, you have failed as a parent. Mabye that's the point of the book, but I doubt it.The book is overhyped by the hippie crowd because they can relate to the character. As in they're spoiled rotten rich little idiots who have never worked a day in their life and are looking for hand outs. That's the description of the main character and the synopisis of the book. This is probably why the book has been banned so much, because it's an insipid self centered, apathetic mockery of the human experience. A guide to living for the weak minded so called elite masses."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read!

If this book is an example of what I will be getting into, I'll stop now. The Holden charactor rambled on and on about things, jumping from one subject to another and mainly focusing on his self absorbed thoughts of life and people. I felt nothing but distaste for him because he was such a whiner that wanted to blame everyone else for his laziness. At the end of the book all I wanted to do was say &quot;WAAAAAAAA!&quot;.

In my life I had only used the word \\"phony\\" to describe something as fake or not real. Never had I used it about people. Holden Caulfield took this word and flipped it upside down in J.D. Salinger's book THE CATCHER IN THE RYE.After the traumatic death of his younger brother, Holden Caulfield, the 16 year old narrator of this novel, fails out of school for the fourth consecutive time. Not yet ready to confront his parents, he takes you on a two day journey through life in New York in an adult world bursting at it's seems with \\"phonies\\". Holden slowly makes his way home while making detours to hotels, bars, and bus stations and meeting different people who make him think about the world around him. One person especially would be Holden's younger sister, Phoebe. Phoebe is one of the only people who has any influence on Holden and who he says is not a \\"phony\\".With Holden's use of profanity, J.D Salinger's writing style could not resemble a 16-year old any more than it does. This is an amazing book and a must read for anyone who loves classics."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is in my opinion the best coming of age novel ever written. The main character, Holden Caufield, is the \\"protector of innocence\\" opponent of every thing \\"Phony\\".Holden doesn't seem to fit in at any of the many schools he attends. He gets kicked out of all them and doesn't really care. He hates the phoniness of all the teachers and wishes everyone would just be honest to themselves. He makes friends with all the rejects in the school, such as old Ackley.Holden is caught between childhood and adulthood. He remembers how Jane always kept her checkers in the back row when they played checkers, which is a very childish thought. But he also frequently thinks of death, which is a very adult thought.The Catcher in the Rye is one of the best books you will ever read. It is perfect for young adults (such as myself) that are struggling with the phoniness of the adult world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Classics come and classics go, and this classic should never have been. A man going through a depressive time in his life is not a good story unless his depression brings about side stories, as does occur in 'Invisible Man' by Ralph Ellison. This book seems to go nowhere leaving the reader to continue to hope for the expected conflict that never transpires. 'The Catcher in the Rye' is quite a disappointment."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Look, lots of 'Classics' just don't hold up over time.CATCHER IN THE RYE is just not one of those books. CATCHER IN THE RYE is the most readable and agreeable piece of angry literature around. If you are young high school or middle school student, and you have a summer reading list from which to choose **CHOOSE THIS ONE.** You will read the whole thing. You will pick it up when you wake and keep reading on the bus.Heck, even if you were just 16 years old once in your life, you will enjoy the heck out of this book.The explicit contrast between the sarcastic and critical mental life of Holden Caufield and his (generally) polite and suburban-style 'mask' with which he integrates with the world highlights the 'phoniness' and hypocrisies of a HOW-TO-MAKE-FRIENDS-AND-INFLUENCE-PEOPLE lifestyle (even if that too is a top-notch book). Without ever tipping his hat, Salinger gives us a precisely accurate view of the possible dysfunctions that evolve in overly 'polite society' when being political - or polite - causes you to not act on your impulses, and not be true to your feelings.If you have ever been frustrated as a teenager, you will enjoy enjoy enjoy the heck out of this delightfully hysterical book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is very interesting. It tells of a man who goes through many struggles in his life. This book is being narrated or told from the point of view of Holden, who is telling this story from a sanitarium(place for mental people). Basically he tells us of his life up until his life in this mental hospital. He tells of when and how he got kicked out of school,he tells when Holden and his roommate fight,how he struggles with women and how he loves his sister dearly and ends up staying with her because he got kicked out of prep school I liked this book because is sounded like it was a real story. It makes me feel like J.D. Salinger actually experienced or knew somebody that experienced these events. This story sounds very true and can very well happen and thats why I like this book. One specific thing that I like about this book is that Holden has a dead younger brother,Allie. This brother meant a lot to Holden. Sometimes when he is searching for answers he will talk with Allie. This is very interesting because even though Allie is not physically going to answer Holden imagines what Allie would say and do to respond. Allie is there for Holden in spirit throughout the whole book whenever he is needed. I think that the author could have not made Holden do things so quickly. In some books that I have read like \\" A Series Of Unfortunate Events\\"( I know it is a kiddy book but it represents what I am saying) the author make the characters think things out before doing them. Holden jumps things very quickly. He moves around and acts like a chicken with its head cut off(figuratively speaking). I believe that holden could have thought things through, that would have made the book much better and much longer."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Book ReviewThe Catcher in the Rye by J.D. SalingerBy DerekThe author, J.D. Salinger, truly took on the part of a troubled teenager in the book called The Catcher in the Rye. The Catcher in the Rye is a very well known book. It is enjoyed by many, but personally, not that much by me. Salinger really made you feel what the troubled teenager was feeling. This troubled teenager called himself Holden Caulfield.The book starts off with Holden getting kicked out of school. This is not the first time that he has been kicked out of school. At the current school that he goes to, he dorms with an interesting character named Stradlater. In the dorm next to him is a friend of his named Ackley. Holden finds him to be even more interesting than Stradlater. Holden said, \\"He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn't get out of your light when you asked him to.\\" After he got kicked out of school, he went to his old history teacher. This teacher appeared to be very wise and knowledgeable about the world around him. He also cared a lot about Holden's future and questions him about what he is doing with his life. He asked him, \\"Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?\\" Holden thinks that it is just a phase that he is going through. He said, \\"I'm just going through a phase right now.\\" This \\"phase\\" that he is going through doesn't stop any time soon.Holden decides that since he has already been kicked out of his current school, that he might as well leave. This is where the true adventure begins. Holden decides to travel to New York for awhile. The thing he doesn't realize is that he will find out a lot about himself on this trip and meet a lot of interesting people along the way. Holden seems to always want to depend on someone throughout the book, but he ends up being independent. Throughout the book you see him always wanting to talk with someone. I would consider the book to be an adventure. The theme seemed to follow what a troubled teenager goes through.The Catcher in the Rye was an interesting book. I liked how the author got into the part of Holden. You could really feel the troubles that Holden was going through. The only problem was that at times the book seemed to get tedious. Overall I didn't like the book too much. At times the book hit a climax and got very thrilling, but for the most part it was boring. I do think that the author did a good job, but the book didn't appeal to me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's not all written in greek like all of you might be thinking. In fact, it is qiute entertaining. It's just about a regular old joe named Holden Caulfield who just dropped out of college and goes bar hoppin' to try and forget it. Along the way he discovers the true meaning of not giving up. Pretty funny and pretty dramatic. I downed it quickly in a couple short days. A definite 10 out of 10.It deserves to be a movie. So the only real question is why is it taking them so long to make it into one. I'm sure it could be applied today by modern society. Oh, and wait until you get to the scene where he leaves the college. It's a laugh and a half. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"J.D. Salinger has written an incredible narrative through the cynical eyes of a kid who has seen too much of his own innocence lost.As a novelist myself, everything I write about children of Holden's age must always be measured against the yard stick that Salinger has fashioned in this book. We project on youth simplicity, forgetting that smooth skin and small stature do not ensure simple thinking and narrow vision. Thank goodness that Salinger reminds us how wrong such assumptions are.His standard has become my own catcher. I read and re-read this book while writing my latest novel (I KILLED A BUNCH OF FOLKS), and I think he kept me from falling off the easy cliff of simple portrayals of the most bewildering stage of life.I suppose Holden would call me a phony for mentioning my own work in describing this masterpiece, and maybe he'd be right. Frankly, it doesn't deserve to be on the same website, let alone be mentioned on the same page. I'm sorry, Holden, that's just how us adults are.

Caulfield is a teenager growing up in the 1950's in New York; he has been expelled from school due to his poor academics once again. Caulfield leaves school a few days before the end of the school term and goes to New York to \`take a vacation' before returning to his parents who will surely be disappointed. The book tells of Caulfield's thoughts and actions through these days in which he has a nervous breakdown, which is caused by his unexplained depression, impulsive spending and odd erratic behavior due to his past nervous breakdown.Inevitably Caulfield's life continues to go on as most of the people ignore what is happening until it beings to infringe upon them. Throughout the book we are challenged to think about society's attitude to all humans.Caulfield beings an investigation in his own sense of emptiness and isolation before finally declaring that the world is full of \`phonies' with each one out there for their own phony gain. Is Caulfield actually the one going insane or is it society that has lost its mind for failing to see the hopelessness of their own lives?I recommend this book as a description of our own human conditions, however this makes this book to be an uncomfortable read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A troubled teen is captured in Holden.

Holden Caulfield is lonely and does not belong to any particular clique. He deals with a vanishing childhood that leaves him unhappy and depressed. Through his critical and often times cynical sarcasm he comes across many experiences that teach and mold him into a more mature individual. He is forced to leave behind his childhood and juvenile ways. After being kicked out of Pencey Prep Holden is sucked into the adult lifestyle. Because he is tall and portrays an older imagine Holden is able to blend into his new surroundings. Though he might seem like a delinquent, he still has loving and caring feeling towards his sister and dead brother. Irony plays a great role in this book because Holden accuses many of the people he encounters as \\"phonies\\", but he himself is a phony at heart. As the story unfolds, Caulfield is faced with many hindrances he must overcome. His interest for the opposite sex grows as he matures, though he is unable to be with the girl he desires. Holden must learn that criticism is just another form of self doubt, because one can only be content with themselves if they are first satisfied with their others and their environment. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in laughing-out-loud. In my opinion, I thought this book was a great read because of it's relatability and use of humorous, yet meaningful circumstances."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Someone once told me I'd have a hard time relating to the story because I didn't grow up during the fifties.

Why? It's truthful, as cynical as it is, and it reveals much more about any narrating character without even having said a word of revelation. Holden Caulfield is by far the best characterization of a generation of teenagers who are too lost to understand the necessary goods and bads of the world, and when we do not understand, we ignore. It is his ignorance and cynicism that eventually lead him to fall apart in his own hands, and the reader finally understands that there is more to life than meets the eye.

I did.I think I could use this book as a judge of someone's character and/or personality by whether or not they liked it, because it's easy to dismiss it as the story of a spoiled, psychotic, ungrateful teenager. But that's not what it is. It is the bittersweet tale about a young man struggling survive and understand his world. Being close to Holden Caulfield's age in the story, I liked his way of thinking, but I also related to his emotions. He is overly sensitive, even if he doesn't realize it. I think that's an issue with many (if not all) teens. We don't want to be easily crushed, or syrupy or sentimental, but we're still people, and we are in the thick of swarming emotions and growing experiences, trying to figure out the world around us. We can't help it.But I don't know. I could describe my take on this book for hours and hours and it still might be all wrong. It is, very simply put, an ode to growing up. I particularly related to his feelings about childhood, innocence, and leaving that world behind. My biggest statement about this book is that it should be appreciated for what it is, and not banned. This book is more worthy of being read in schools than The Odyssey or Huckleberry Finn (although I am loyal to mark twain) or any other of the meaningless garbage we are forced to read. Kids need to be reading something that entertains them that they can relate to, that draws emotion and that makes a valid point.

It got a brief mention in the introduction of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", when someone was comparing Alex to Holden Caulfield (the teenage protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\"). I never had to read the book at school but I knew some who did. Apparently a lot of girls make their boyfriends read it. I also learned that it was Mark Chapman's favourite book. (Mark Chapman was the guy who killed John Lennon, in case you're wondering.) Chapman's enthusiasm for the book would more accurately be described as an obsession, as he seemed to base his life entirely around the mind set of the angry young narrator.Last week I finally got round to reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", which I really just bought on a whim. Personally, I quite liked the book, it made a change from the kind of literature I normally read. Although I couldn't relate to Holden Caulfield completely, certain things did strike a chord.Like many teenagers, Holden is plagued by a crisis of identity, a sense of nihilistic self-pity, an unshakable belief that adults are all phony, everyone sells out and society is superficial. Is this just self-indulgence? Well, yes, but that is one of the luxuries of being an adolescent: to be convinced that everyone except you is a moron. Holden even concedes that he himself may be a madman, so he's not completely pig-headed. While Holden see double standards and hypocrisy everywhere, he too admits to being a huge liar. Hypocrisy is not a uniquely adult condition, it's just as prevalent in childhood. No one can have a frame of mind completely free of contradictions and inconsistency.Set in the 1950s, the story takes place over a couple of days in New York, with Christmas approaching. Holden, who has just been kicked out of yet another school, lets us in on his cynical world view. Like the typically confused and \\"sensitive\\" rebel, Holden seems to be disillusioned with everything, a listless soul with no real sense of direction in life. Two or three other characters try to help him but their advice goes in one ear and out the other. If there is one person Holden truly loves and admires, it is his younger sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only character in the book that hasn't let Holden down. She still has her innocence. Sadly, this can't last forever. She too will grow up, and it's just possible her outlook too will descend into cynicism. But for now we see Phoebe as a ten year old girl with ideals.Unfortunately, the kind of uncertainty Holden contends with doesn't necessarily fade away with the onset of adulthood. Since Holden was a teenager in the 1950s, it would be interesting to know what he would be like today as a middle aged man, assuming he survived the turmoil and angst of adolescence. Would he have straightened out? From what we read in the book, one can only hope he has."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think that this book was pretty good. This book is about a boy that keeps flunking out of school without much direction in life. He has a lot of potential, as said in the book by Mr. Antolini. He is too preocupied in finding &quot;phonies&quot; that he can't focus on what is really important so that he can't enjoy life. He is always pretending to be older than he really is, lying about who he is, everything else about himself and he doesn't even realise that he is a phony. He sees himself as &quot;the catcher in the rye&quot;, which is a protector of the innocent and the preventer of others becoming phony"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i read this book for the first time when i was a freshman in high school. i fell in love with holden caufeild, and could so easily identify with him. i felt like he was with me, like he was inside my head! i have read it many times since then, and each time i discover something new. it is a perfectly spun tale, coated with beautifully vivid anecdotes that will keep you smiling even through natural disasters. to know holden is to love him. what else can i say"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you loved Catcher in the Rye (as I did!), try Rule of the Bone, by Russell Banks"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Yes, yes--you know the shtick: I read CATCHER when I was in high school--and, like all things banally true, have rediscovered it again at 35.

I could only think of Twain's Huck Finn, perhaps Cather's Jim Burden, and Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. I felt as if I had touched (if you will) a real person, a real voice, one that lived on days after I had finished the book. I'm sure the plot is far too contrived (the homosexuality, veiled and polite, is so predictable as to be laughable), and the other characters disappear into a miasama of similarity. But then Holden. He remains, a voice of unfettered adolescence born out of the fevered memory of adulthood, mine and Salinger's.

The characters in the book are very real and entertaining. We all know Jane Gallagher, Maurice, Sally Hayes, and even Holden Caufield in our own lives. Salinger is very in tune with the youth of the 40's and even the 90's when he wrote this book. Alot of the problems Holden faces in this book are the same problems faced by teens today. This book is not required reading material but a damn good book. The book's profanity may seem a little damned gratuitous at times but that is how life is to some. I would recommend this book to anyone i gaurantee you will laugh through tears"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For me this book was one of those sacred cows that you're not allowed to say anything bad about without being ridiculed. Everyone is supposed to love this book. How can you be an intellectual and not love Salinger? Well I may not be an intellectual, but I certainly did not like this book. Holden Caulfield does nothing but whine about how life is not fair and moan about where the ducks have gone. I know the ducks are a metaphor, but I just did not care. Holden Caulfield is immature, even for his young age, and I found him so miserable that I couldn't enjoy the book. He does nothing but complain and stew in shallow teenage angst. This book seems to be loved by millions of people so others must enjoy something in it that I didn't. I just wanted to provide my opinion because many people just gush over this book, and it only annoyed me. I'm sure it's a classic for a reason. I just didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a 16 year old male, so i can certainly identify with the main character's thoughts, feelings, and uncertainties towards life. If you are a teen reading this, here is a message: YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. its got everything. Prostitutes, Profanity, Drinking, and much much more. This is the story about Holden, who has just been kicked out of his school, and spends a couple of nights and days in the great city of New York. He goes through alot of things, that seem very credible, but the book, the way he describes what he's going through and his bitterly sarcastic outlook on life keep you entertained the whole way through. You cant read a paragraph without reading at least 2 profanities, so if you cant handle it dont even bother. And i cant believe it was written at least 50 years ago. Most of the language and dialect he uses is just as modern as it is today. He can always find something about a character to make fun of or gripe about- and you'll find that within the first chapter. Give this book a read- its GREAT. if you are an older teen like me, it will become the most treasured book in your collection."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"MY OPINION ABOUT THE BOOK : \`THE CATCHER IN THE RYE'bye J.D. SalingerI have to admit I liked the story very much. I couldn't stop reading, so fluently it went. On the end it's a little bit heavy and it becomes a little bit boring. But only a little bit. I red it immediately when I got it, till chapter 15 and one or two weeks ago I finished it. I needed a few pages before I got in to it, because I didn't had a clue what the writer was talking about. I was guessing I would understand it while I was reading the story, but it wasn't so. I had a lot of questions when I finished it; and that is something I can't stand.Somewhere in the book Holden is telling us how he feels when he had red a very good book with an interesting person on it, then he has the feeling he wants to call up that person, he feels like meeting that person. I'm sure you will find it ridiculous, but sometimes I have that feeling to when I have red a good book, and also after this story.I find Holden a very nice person, I can't imagine him tall or anything, but I like his character. I don't like his language, it is pretty much the seem the whole book and afterwards you have the intention to speak the same way. That's not a good sign, because my mother language is not even English but Dutch! I give a few examples of whole sentences he repeats the whole time, if you count it with the rest of \`bad' language, you have only left a hundred pages. The examples : I don't feel like ...; the hell; got a bang out; knocked him out; phoney; I have to puke; drives me crazy; shooting the bull; it's sort of funny; I really was; ...and all.On the other hand, I think it's smart of the real writer, because that's probably the way kids talk in New York. My opinion is that Holden seems a real person, there are so much little details, you don't believe he's imagined by a writer. I give an example ; I have figured out that the reason why Holden hates movies is because the only brother he has left over is a prostitute in Hollywood. The brother is busy with making stupid movies in stead of using his good writers qualities. Holdens' character is very good worked out, the whole book is very psychological and I believe every thing that happened.The writer must know how it is to be depressed. I had the idea there was a whole other Holden than only the one in the book. A Holden who is happy. That are all proves the story really gets you and that you really got interfered.I think I've already mentioned that the book reads fluently. The big line is chronically and that makes it easy to follow, his flash-backs make it more interesting because that way we become more knowing about Holden. His story begins when he is at the hospital and it ends when he is going to the hospital, are whatever it is. That's a thing that bothers me, but it is also the reason why the book is so interesting and you want to know more about it.On the other hand it's funny you want to know more about it, because the story is the dullest you can imagine. You are the whole time waiting for the big \`thing' to come, but there isn't anything coming, except that Holden is getting more depressed with every page. But the writer is completely honest with it; at the first page he says :\\"I don't want to write my autobiography.\\" And in the end he lets you know that he isn't going to answer the questions you asked yourself the whole time you were reading.My conclusion is, you can missed it, that I liked the book, the character, the writing style a lot and that it is your duty of a good teacher to recommended it to your pupils every year again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. I remember myself drawn into it then but after I finished it I thought it was fun but didn't quite think it a classic. Recently, I had felt a need to escape my everyday life and the idea of taking off from my job, roommates, life really appealed to me so I picked up this book again. I read it little bits and pieces and treasured each moment. I really identify with Holden a lot mre now after being in the world for a little bit. Salinger's observations through Holden are interesting and his digressions make for great reads. But what I noticed this time around almost above everything else is the intense and sharp humor of the book. I found myself several times laughing out loud. The book is really funny. Holden's observations are so true, it's just funny. The humor relies on behavior instead of jokes and I think at 24, I've observed more behavior and appreciate the humor. The relationships Holden has a very touching and interesting too. I felt that he was more similar in this regard to an early twenty something than a high schooler, but I think early twenty-somethings are a lot more &quot;phony&quot; than holden so he works better as a high schooler. It's a good book. I want to read it again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"CATCHER IN THE RYE by J.D. Salinger demonstrates, through the thoughts and actions of Holden Caulfield, the struggles of the adolescent years. On the surface, Holden is a disturbed young man. He refuses to get along with his peers, viewing them as \\"phonies.\\" After being kicked out of yet another private school, he decides to leave for Christmas break early. Holden ends up spending several nights of self-discovery out on the streets of New York. He meets various alter-egos such as taxi drivers, a prostitute, and bar flies in his attempts to escape the \\"Ivy League\\" upbringing his parents have forced upon him. Through this experience, he learns that it is up to him to find his own place and happiness within society. CATCHER IN THE RYE dissects the fears, thoughts and turmoil of the young person's mind-- giving birth to an enjoyably insightful novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think quite a few of the reviewers here have missed the point about what this book was all about. And the reasons for it becoming the sort of cult classic among young people... For me this book has always been too intimate and real to review objectively in a literary way. When you read it... it's like your own private thoughts are being opened out and put on paper for the world to analyse and amuse themselves with. I don't know about the background and the context in which the author wrote the book but it seemed like I was going through my own diaries of adoloscent years. Disturbing, dark, a sense of endless isolation... a brilliant, inspired work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hated J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" when I had to read it in high school. I thought main character Holden Caulfield could have been killed off in the first chapter, and it would have made for a better story.The book takes place over a weekend in the life of Holden, a perennial dropout in virtually anything he does. He gets kicked out of the latest in a string of colleges in the beginning, so he heads home, for New York City.Once in the Big Apple, Holden looks up old girlfriends, visits a prostitute (and winds up haggling over the price), is reunited with his beloved sister Phoebe and does a host of other stuff one typically does over a weekend or when one has been thrown out of college and doesn't want one's parents to know.The entire story is told from Holden's point of view, and in a stream of consciousness that bounces from one subject to another at random. The character ruminates on where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, his roommate's clipping of toenails and sex.He also has developed the incredibly annoying habit of saying something, then reiterating it as if his audience does not believe him. He really does, I swear to God. After a while, classic or not, defining character trait or not, you want to smack him. You really do. But that was really the only left-over hostility I felt for what many consider to be the Great American Novel.Maybe it's because Holden is now a fellow college student, and I can commiserate with him when people drop into his room unannounced or are obnoxious.Maybe it's because I have grown into a very random thought pattern myself, so I no longer find the subject jumps to be quite so annoying.It could be because young Master Caulfield is a cynic, and I am an individual who celebrates cynicism and sarcasm, as these are characteristics which seem to be even more the rage today than they were in the '50s.Or could it be because there's still such a fervor over \\"Catcher,\\" even though it was originally published in 1951. And while we're at it, exactly WHY is there such a fervor over the book?Is it because Salinger, after completion and publication, slipped away from the American public and became a recluse, writing (or so we think) in the comfort of his own home behind a great wall of silence?Would we still like the story if J.D. Salinger were the century's Stephen King, pumping out novel after novel after novel, and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was just the book between \\"Franny and Zooey\\" and \\"Hapworth 16, 1924\\"?Would we still applaud if Holden Caulfield were the adolescent cynic created by a one-time author named Milton Nosepicker?Or does the story transcend its author, his seclusion or the fervor around it? The answer is up to you. I'm stumped."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"No need for a long review. Basically it comes down to this - if you haven't read this book, you've been deprived. It hits right where it matters, no wonder it's a classic. No bull, just blunt reality with which you cannot help, but relate right away.

I was shocked to see negative, narrow (not to mention grammatically incorrect) reviews. This book is not about having an action-packed plot, or even about &quot;teenage angst, &quot; which seems to be the buzz word. Salinger has drawn Holden to be a pure, true person. He shares ALL his feelings with us. How can the reader NOT relate to him? He holds nothing back; he bears his whole self to us--frustrations, insecurities, confusions, passions and all. He is not just going through the &quot;angst&quot; of being a teenager, but the difficulties of being human. Holden reminds us to experience life with eyes and hearts open. I fell in love with this character when I first read the book at 16, and still hold him dear to my heart at 29. This book should be on every persons reading list, from high school to old age. I thank Mr. Galbraith for introducing me to this book, which I continually re-read, and Salinger for such a beautiful, insightful, endearing character."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"From page one to the back cover, J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is a book that certainly holds your attention. This book shows the world through the eyes of sixteen year-old Holden Caufield, who has just been expelled from his third consecutive prep school and has yet to return home to surprise his parents with the wonderful news. From the moment the book begins, you travel to so many locations and experience so many different occurrences that by the time you are finished it seems like you have spent two years, not two days, inside the main character's head. In my opinion, it is Holden's personality that really makes this book as interesting as it is. He is a very &quot;real&quot; person, with deep emotions and a LOT of sarcasm, which is appreciated today as a realistic quality more than ever before. Without Holden's sarcastic comments, thoughtful observations, and detailed descriptions, the whole storyline would be completely boring. These facts combined with his relationships with his family, friends, and the opposite sex, make Holden a character teens can relate to, regardless of what generation they are from. While most of Holden's thoughts are typical of one his age, there are also a few of them that set him apart as somethat mature, (and somewhat &quot;disturbed&quot;), which is another interesting facet of the story thrown in by Salinger. The Catcher in the Rye is definitely a page-turner. At the end of every chapter you are left wondering what Holden will do next, or what quirky memory he is about to recall. After experiencing this book for myself, I can easily see why it is regarded as such a timeless classic amongst readers of all ages."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Who cares what a rich spoiled brat thinks of the world?

However, I was recently challenged on J. D. Salinger's \\"magnum opus\\" and, having never read it, I could not respond other than to say, \\"Don't know.\\" So in the interest of informing myself on the subject, I read it.In brief, The Catcher in the Rye is a tale of Holden Caulfield, a neurotic, narcissistic sixteen year-old from an upper crusty family who flunks out of prep school and spends a night of debauchery in New York City. Holden has a penchant for calling everyone a phony, yet it soon becomes obvious that he's the biggest phony of them all. The narrative style is first person, so the reader is forced to endure Holden's puerile blather throughout the entirety of the work. The fact that his younger brother died tragically is supposed to add a level of pathos to the story, and I suppose provide an excuse for why Holden acts and thinks the way he does.There is so much wrong with this book, that it can't possibly deserve the kind of accolades its gotten over the years on the strength of Salinger's writing skills alone. Simply put, what made this book special is that it was (and is) a vehicle for introducing young people to obscenity and \\"alternative lifestyles\\"--and making them seem normal, at least in comparison to the occasionally judgmental but always hypocritical main character. The amount of pointless vulgarity and blasphemous language contained in The Catcher in the Rye is so overwhelming, even by today's standards, that the reader quickly becomes numb to it. It was apparently one of the first mass market books to incorporate the phrase \\"f--- you\\", and no doubt that made it immediately attractive to those with an agenda of breaking down societal standards.Salinger is a sloppy writer, with stream-of-consciousness tangents flowing out in every direction. Some of these are meant to be profound, I suppose, but their profundity never reaches above the level of frat-house philosophy. Some might say that this was Salinger's point--to recreate the ribald banter and egotistical musings of upper-class teenagers. But to what end? Such talk quickly becomes trite and tiresome in person, let alone when encountered in the written word.On the whole, there is nothing inspired or inspiring about The Catcher in the Rye. I can't imagine how anyone who reads it will come away with any positive insights into life, the world, or the human condition--negative ones abound, of course. Recalling how nave I was as a teenager, I can readily imagine the kind of impact a book like this might have had on me, particularly in light of the false gravitas English professors are wont to bestow upon the works they select for study.If you are a young person whose professor has selected The Catcher in the Rye as part of your course work, you should take it as an insult. Imagine as you read that this is how your professor views you and everyone in your age bracket--as moody, ill-spoken, amoral losers who awkwardly seek sexual encounters and intoxication at every turn. If you don't view yourself that way, I would encourage you to read something better, more positive, and more uplifting--like the book that would have been my favorite as a teenager had it been available at that time:Angels in Iron."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book when I was about 14 or 15 and I just re-read it at the age of 48, thinking I probably would get more from it now that I'm older. I didn't. I am an educator and I can't help but wonder why in the world this book is on so many recommended reading lists. There are scores of much better written and more worthwhile books. Try reading &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower,&quot; for instance. I can't help but wonder if &quot;Catcher&quot; was part of Salinger's journal at some point. It sure didn't take any stretch for him to create the plot, setting, or characters in this novel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As I was reading this book, I was waiting for the author to finally get critical of Holden's shallow self-pity, self-gratifying rants, and senseless behavior. I thought such a classic and highly regarded book could not possibly be endorsing Holden's meek frustration, ironic arrogance, and outright paranoia. I was waiting for this book to contrast Holden's senselessness with a clear-thinking and stable character, but such a contrast never came. The possibility remains that the author was offering a VERY subtle criticism of Holden, but this book just doesn't seem to carry enough intellectual weight to pull off such subtle irony.The book details three days in the life of it's protagonist Holden Caulfield . It presents him in several situations (some run-of-the-mill and some a little spectactular) and shows how mentally unstable he is. The book then proceeds to blame his mental ills on society, saying that modern society is an alienating place for teenagers. This is true of course, but only for somebody without anything to believe in, somebody cynical, somebody like Holden. The book glorifies Holden's mental instability by making him out to be the victim, somebody who can't help his senselessness.This book would have been great had the author realized that simply detailing sensitive person's alienation is not enough for a good novel. He needs to get to the root of that alientation (Holden's cynicism) and ACTUALLY MAKE A POINT ABOUT IT. This book is so highly regarded because in it cynical people have found a justification for their senselessness.&quot;He who writes for fools will always find a large public&quot;-Shopenhauer"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My god, probably the most boring, inconsequential book I ever read.

The guru of adolescents - then and since then and now - is gone. Adding to the aura of genius as a writer is the aura of mystery that surrounded the greater part of his life: will we ever know the etiology of his silence? With his death we can only hope that the manuscripts that were never published in his lifetime will beign to appear and be available to public evaluation and consumption. Until that time, we can only offer appreciation to a very influential writer of our times. Grady Harp, January 10"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Add this one to the pile of classics that weren't for me. This was another one in my banned or challenged list. While the story was ok, I never found a point to it. It seemed to lack a plot or something. It was an easy read, but I was extremely glad when it was over!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Much as W.H. Auden achieved with his controversialThe Age of Anxiety, Salinger's \\"Catcher\\" revealed to a compliant U.S. citizenry that all was not well in America, contrary to President Eisenhower's subsequent head-patting.This is the genesis of a series of period tales concerned with the classic \\"troubled youth\\" of 1950s America. Most people became even more aware of this cultural rift through the most famous of James Dean's three significant films:Rebel Without a Cause (Two-Disc Special Edition).\\"Catcher\\" was published in 1951 and was immediately banned from numerous school and public libraries. But likePeyton Place, by Grace Metalious, young people still managed to acquire a copy, hiding it under the mattress. By today's standards there's nothing particularly earth shattering in the novel, just a few instances of the f-word and some sexual tension. But that was pretty radical stuff back in the early '50s.The story's protagonist is Holden Caulfield, a young man who struggles with the ethics of every situation. Since we live in an imperfect world Holden determines that nearly everyone is a \\"phony\\" and, as a consequence of his grim paradigm, he's perpetually disappointed with the human race in general. He wants to \\"protect\\" children (thus he daydreams of being \\"The Catcher\\" [of children] in a fantasy-based rye field which borders on a dangerous cliff -- once these children fall over life's cliff [depravity] they are lost, in Holden's view.) As one might expect, Holden has few positive encounters with prospective girlfriends and his interaction with male peers is usually not all that positive either.This tale is pretty bleak but it does yield its lighter and more hopeful moments. It's conveyed from the first person perspective of the protagonist, which was no easy task for Salinger. In any case this is fine American literature of the First Water. It seems like a straightforward read but upon subsequent readings one discovers much more.If you're a person who now, (or ever), spends time questioning authority then you'll likely enjoy this book; ergo, its timeless popularity with both high school and college students. And I think that this book is chiefly a work which males can relate to more so than females, much as women would link more assertively with a book such asValley of the Dolls.I give this one my highest recommendation without the slightest reservation - it's a terrific novel of the age."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have 2 copies, one for the house and one for the car. I have read this book over and over. I'm just kinda crazy about it. I found out that Kennedy's and John Lennon's assassins and the guy who shot Reagan all had copies of this book. Kinda creepy but still a good, fun read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As an English major and a lover of books, reading and writing, I probably shouldn't admit this...but up until this past week I had never cracked the cover or even read any kind of overview (back of the book blurb or otherwise) of The Catcher in the Rye. It's always been on my \\"list\\" to eventually read, but it never climbed up to the top until now.I don't know if it is/was taught at my High School, but I do know that it wasn't on the required reading list for me in Honors or AP English. I also know that the book was banned for many years and I wouldn't be surprised if there was still a ban (even if unofficial) of it at Viewmont. I decided to do a quick stats check on it being banned and saw that interestingly it has a very divided history. Up until the 80s, it was the most banned/censored book in high schools & libraries. In the early 80s it was paradoxically the \\"most censored book\\" and the \\"second most taught book\\" in public schools. In situations where it isn't banned outright, it pushes its way into the top 20 list of \\"most frequently challenged book.\\"From a super high level reading, I can see where the angst against the book comes from. The book is FULL of profanity from the first page to the last ranging from the more commonplace to the F-bomb. It doesn't help matters that this language is coming from a teenager, the narrator Holden Cawfield. Add to that the fact that this same teenager (and most people he associates with) are constantly smoking and drinking. While there isn't explicit sex in the book, there are numerous high level references to necking, petting and intercourse as well as general explorations of sexuality as a whole. Overall, this is just the sort of book that makes \\"family values\\" advocates run for the bonfires.At the same time, the book is extremely \\"real\\" in terms of dealing with the identity crisis and the sort of awakening of self-awareness that happens to teenagers. While I wasn't a swearing, smoking, drinking, sexing teenager (or adult for that matter), I can relate to a lot of things said by Holden. And even though there aren't any earth shattering answers or resolutions given through the narrative, simply exploring these truths rather than brushing them under the carpet is enough to make most teenagers (or anybody who's ever felt alienated, confused, or just anxious about life) able to relate to this book at some level and use it as a launching ground for the basis of their own self-awakening.The honesty of the narrative voice is refreshing but can also be the cause for some controversy. Most parents or adults don't necessarily want to admit that the youth of the world are struggling with these sorts of issues both in terms of the smoking/drinking/sex and in terms of the emotional and mental anxieties. Whether that's because the adults have suppressed their own anxious memories of their youth or because they don't have any idea how to help their youth through the situations, I'm not sure. But it seems that a lot of times, the adult reaction to \\"troubled\\" youth is to just punish them and/or leave them alone and assume that as they mature they'll either turn into upstanding adults and overcome the problems on their own or they'll turn into really bad eggs and end up in prison. Either way, the problem is no longer a threat to society.There's a lot more I could say about this book, and I haven't even bothered to review it in the same way I've reviewed other recent books, but I think the best thing to say about this book is that it should be read in order to fully digest and understand it. As I mentioned above, there is definitely some content that can be offensive to many readers. However, the way the content is presented feels natural and makes it hard to fault the book or author for its presence but rather just accept the presence as a part of the character you're exploring.As a parent, I'm a little torn as to when I'd want my kids to read this book. It gets into a sort of maturity conundrum. I'd have some moderate worries that the book could possibly give an immature reader some bad ideas, but if a reader is sheltered from the book until they're \\"mature\\" enough to better swallow the concepts, then some of the potential help and insight of the book can be lost. I don't think this book portrays delinquent or rebellious behavior in a positive light by any means. It straddles the fence a little bit with drinking and smoking which is understandable considering the era in which it was written/published (the 40s-50s) but even then, it shows some of the bad effects of these bad decisions.I think the main thing with this book, as with anything anybody ever decides to approach, is that it should be approached with a grain of salt and with an open mind tempered by mature responsibility. I wouldn't mind seeing this book in my kids' reading list in high school...possibly even junior high. But I'd want to be sure that I (and hopefully the teacher as well, but definitely myself as a parent) discuss with my kids what is to be gained from the book, what is to be learned from the book, and how to poise a reaction to the book. That's not to say that I'd want to brainwash my kids and try to shove propaganda down their throats, but I'd just want to be sure that they (and any reader...yourself included), takes this in (and any book) as something to be learned from but not necessarily emulated.The Catcher in the Rye is a very intriguing exploration into the psyche of the American teenager (specifically, a male teenager...I'd be curious to hear female reactions) and I think Sallinger hit many of the key teenage issues squarely on the head without coming off as preachy or condescending. Apart from the controversy of the content, perhaps that non-preachy form is another thing that makes society dislike this book. It explores a lot of the problems of teenage life, but never sets for a clear course of action to overcome them...leaving the teenager to figure things out for him/herself. Depending on the support structure of the kid, having all those ideas and issues opened wide could either be very constructive or very destructive. I hope to help my kids with the 'constructive' path when they get around to reading it.*****4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just reread this book after 30 years, and I found it even better than I remember. It's such a great window into the teenage mind, a boy on the cusp of childhood and adulthood, a study of contradictions: both silly and serious, irrational and clear-eyed, exaggerated and stone-cold sober, muddled and laser-sharp, intolerant and deeply sensitive, unpredictable and responsible, unbearable and immensely likable.This is the story of Holden, a 16-year-old who flunks out of prep school after prep school. Nothing and no-one is good enough, except for his dead brother, everyone and everything is phony, black and white are the only colors. As he goes on one last sleepless adventure before his parents find out that he's been kicked out of yet another elite academy, Holden's despair grows to suicidal wishes, but a last visit with his kid sister and a former teacher provide connections that he cannot bear to lose.What will he choose do? Drown in the duck pond in Central Park? Move to a dude ranch in Wyoming? Try another school? We the readers get to witness his internal dialog as his mind gyrates through needs and emotions, rational thought and crazy ideas. And we get to laugh, because at times Holden's dead-pan humor and the awkward situations he drags himself into are absolutely hilarious."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book many, many years ago. I was still a teenager. I had to read it as soon as I saw that it was banned on the Catholic book list. The Catholic book list ban was, of course, my personal must read book list. I have never figured out why it was banned. It did have a few \\"bad\\" words in it. But there was nothing I found offensive.It was basically about a young boy who had a good deal of complaints about his siblings and his parents.The only thing that I saw that made the book unusual was its honesty. The boy was very selfish and very jealous which I have since discovered is rather universal.The book I thought was very open and straight forward regarding the immature feelings of a child. I would never had said such things even if I felt them when I was that age.I guess that was the whole point of the book.I read it a long time ago but yet I always remember it. I respected the fact that somebody was saying what I was hearing quite a bit of in the schoolyard. And as I go through life it does seem that much of the same attitude of personal jealousy, selfishness, resentment, and individual competitiveness is exactly what the world is made up of. It was a good book in my opinion. I know it had me thinking.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's an easy book to read, but if u understand and analyze it carefully, Salinger had done a great job.

Every other book you read after Salinger's will not have the same effect on you. Holden Caulfield is as true as your father or as true as your brother. A teenager growing up in a world of adults. A teenager who wants to be free in a world of adults, of rules. Salinger was trying to understand what was going on the earth on those days. Rock and roll, beats, drugs, No war make love, the power to a new generation. Bau he gave no definitive answers, he just showed the difficult road one has to follow if he or she wants to be free, to be free in society.

D. Salinger I was astounded How could a book that is lacking every aspect of a plot, covers only two days and is about a 16 year old teenage boy be so highly regarded. Even though the book is not a \\"masterpiece\\" in my eyes, it is still a good read. Salanger is a master at using figurative language at is skilled at appealing to all ages. No matter how old you are, you most likely can relate to this book in one way or another. This book isn't just a book about some kid named Holden, it is about life and the struggles with moral issues, family, friends, sex, lies, and troubles from within. Not the best book but defiantly a book to have read. Remember, to enjoy it you must look beyond the printed word. Good luck!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Some people just don't get the book, but there is a reason this is one of the greatest books of all time. The author is a master in the use of symbolism. Almost every name in the book has a symbolic representation. There are two level at which one can read this book. The name Holden for instance, is representative of &quot;Hold-On&quot;. Holden is trying to hold-on to childhood innocense. The title of the book is based on Holden catching children before they enter adulthood. Picture Holden in a field beneath a cliff with a giant net catching inocent children prior to their entry to adulthood. Another example of the symbolism is the Carousel at the end with his sister Pheobe. The Carousel is going around in circles never entering the next phase. The reason this book is often used in High School is because teachers are smart enough to grasp the underlying meaning. The book is a story of a young persons strugle with the rites of adulthood.

Now several years older, I don't think exactly like Holden does, but it doesn't prevent me from seeing how sincere and sensitive this character is.Although I admit I was sad when the book was finished (and each time I read it, I experience the same regret) but I still think, as I thought then and as I think of all books that leave me feeling like that, the length of the book may be the best thing about it. Many readers wished it had gone on longer and I know what they mean--Holden's charm is very quick to communicate itself--but Salinger knows his stuff. He gave us enough and not too much--the best things in life are best just tasted, not devoured whole.The Catcher in the Rye (for those who might be interested: I couldn't beat Holden's job title; my own is &quot;Professional Human,&quot; you may laugh all you like!) offers a fresh perspective; anyone who has a fresh mind, an open mind, an empathetic mind and a good heart--because hearts aren't underrated in Holden's world, even if they are denied in our self-consciously cynical world--should read this book.

In Forster's words, Only Connect--this book will show you how."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read this book in college in a class about banned books.

However, the book fails miserably. Holden is not a typical teenager, but rather a deluded child. The central images of death, sex, and innocence do not combine well. Salinger attempted to write a novel giving insight to every teenager's life, but all he does is focus on the phoniness of society, and the breakdown of Holden Caufield. Holden Caufield is portrayed as a typical teenage male, obsessed with death and sex. He wants to devote his life to protecting the innocent, yet he is far from being pure. Holden's younger brother died two years ago, but Holden still talks to him. Holden remembers anything that has to deal with death or sickness because he fears death. Salinger saturates the book with references to Holden's fixation on death. Holden is also haunted by his sexuality. He describes himself as a sex maniac, but he can not bring himself to actually use a prostitute. Salinger again gives the reader detail after detail proving how much Holden thinks about sex, but he never quite gets there. Holden does not like &quot;phony&quot; people or &quot;phony&quot; things, but Holden is the phoniest person in the book. Holden acts like he is the best person to stand on the cliff and catch the children playing in the rye, but he is not innocent. Holden, as the narrator, gives a skewed view of society that is not very accurate. Phoebe should have been the narrator of the story because she has control of her feelings and she thinks things through. Also, she represents the innocence Holden is trying to protected. She can be influenced, like any normal human being, but she gives a more accurate view of society than Holden. Phoebe is the person who keeps Holden in check because she has not been corrupted. Salinger's style makes this book easy to read, but the constant cussing makes the book a struggle. Also, Salinger uses the same phrase, &quot;that kills me&quot;, in so many different ways it is sometimes difficult to catch the meaning. Salinger is not realistic in describing his characters. Phoebe and Allie are too perfect. They are portrayed that way because of the way Holden sees them, but Holden is disillusioned. Holden himself is not an accurate portrayal of a teenager. I sympathize with Holden because he is so confused, but I do not agree with Salinger's description on the &quot;normal&quot; teenager. Overall, I think The Catcher in the Rye was a well-written novel with lots of symbolism to connect its major themes, but the themes did not mesh and the book was not realistic, so I did not like it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J. D. Salinger, took place in the 1940's (though it's story could have taken place today, or at any other time, for that matter) in New York City. The main character is Holden Caulfield, the narrator and a bad student. Holden is quite intelligent but lets his talents go to waste by not doing school work or anything else he felt like. He is awfully stubbborn, and brutally honest, and I didn't really like his characteristics very much, even though they were very much like how real people act. The book was odd because there seemed to be little plot. The story starts when Holden Caulfield gets expelled from his exclusive--and expensive--school. The rest of the book tells of Holden and his excitement through New York over a period of several days with almost no plot. Pretty boring, right? Not neccessarily. The book was not about plot, it was about exploring characters, especially Holden. But there were a mob of others. Most characters were just in for a few pages, and then were gone. Those types of characters include: Mr. Spencer, a teacher; Ackley and Stradlater, annoying roommates; Jane, his crush; Mrs. Morrow, the mother of someone he knew; three ugly girls Holden danced with; Sunny, a prostitude; two Catholic nuns; and numerous others.But Holden was still the majot character. I really didn't like him that well. I liked most of the other characters, though, especially Phoebe, his clever sister. One reason I didn't like him was his reinforcing everything he said. Also, cursing in a book is an okay thing, but this book goes to some extremes. Don't refuse to buy it on account of that, because it's still a good book, just Holden's cussing can be a distraction. And even though I didn't like Holden's personality as a character, he was the best person to narrate the book. The book was very good with a lot of hidden meaning. I really hope that a lot of people can read this classic, but it's not one of the best classics out there."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Why did I wait so long to read this book? I am not sure but it was in one word brilliant. I loved Holden and the prose so much, that I regret not reading this sooner in life. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Like most people, I was required to read this book in the late 60s. I don't have any recollection of being touched by it at all. I read it again in college, and either I thought it was all about disaffection and rejecting middle class values or I was told that by my teachers.I glanced at it again over my daughter's shoulder on a long plane ride a few years ago and couldn't wait for her to finish so I could read it again. I was shocked to see that I had completely missed the point: it's about Holden's vertiginous fall into depression after the death of his little brother. His parents and his sister are all too damaged by their own grief to help him, and he's struggling to feel something while avoiding feeling anything. These are familiar demons, beautifully evoked."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I graduated from Hi School in 1950. There are no words to describe how regimented the world was at that time. There were no rebels as models that was before James Dean & Elvis. The sterotypical girl were supposed to resemble Doris Day and the male be as stoic and jock like as possible to be accepted in that world so long ago. The movies were our role models very few had T.V. and T.V. was impossibly stupid in 1950. Even if we were unaware of our behavior we were attempting to emulate what we had seen on the screen. If you didnt fit the \\"Keep up with the Jones\\"mentality you were an outcast. The phoniness and the superficiality of this decade is what makes \\"CATCHER IN THE RYE\\" so relevant today. I had heard about this book for years, never read it until my later years. This book is a monumental work of art that todays teenager can identify with even more so than in 1951 when the book was published."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Let me start by saying that I can see why a lot of people wouldn't like this book, especially a lot of people who have to read it for school. To many people, it seems like the typical \\"teenage angst\\" kind of book, and it's very easy to think that the whole way through the book. If you learn nothing from this book then you didn't get the meaning behind it - it's a blunt statement, either you agree or you don't. And if you *do* get the meaning behind it, but found it to be boring or repetitive anyway, then that is your opinion. Some people just simply don't like the same books.I have to admit, when I first started reading Catcher in the Rye I was a bit struck at why it was considered a classic in literature. With me, I started seeing something deeper when I got to the middle of the book. It isn't until you start seeing the same things being repeated that you start to notice. The title of my review is a great example. Holden Caulfield is a prime example of questioning youth. Most teenagers aren't focused on morals, nor do many of them think deeply about what goes on in the world. And the few that do are like Holden; they're confused, lonely, and scared as hell. So the more I read and the deeper I delved into the meanings behind Holden's thoughts and ideas, the more I began to understand. Holden Caulfield isn't just the average 16-year old. He is, yet he isn't. He *thinks* deeper than the average teenager. He's still immature in a lot of his thinking throughout the book but overall his character is just this mass of confusion. He seems confused at a lot of things, at why a lot of people are the way they are, yet he himself isn't perfect. That is what shapes his character. He isn't flawless, and the author, Salinger, clearly brings that out to the reader. Sometimes Holden contradicts himself - a flaw within himself that is telling the readers that he is human. By developing his character in this way, I saw it as a way to make you both like and dislike him. If you liked him too much, you'd have sympathy for him, but if you disliked him enough too, it evens out to where you really just don't feel bad for him. Rather, you're just following along with him. If I felt any kind of sympathy for Holden throughout the book it was when he tried to talk about things but no one seemed to understand where he was coming from, or what he was talking about. With Holden, what he said didn't have to understand. He just wanted to talk. And he never really felt like he was listened to. This is evident every single time he gives a waiter or waitress a message for a musician playing - \\"People never give your message to anybody\\". Holden not only is insecure about people not delivering his messages, he *knows* that people won't deliver them. And that is why I feel like Holden repeats a lot of sentences in the book. I feel like the author wanted Holden to keep repeating things, even when he was going \\"I mean..\\" because Holden never felt like anyone listened to him to begin with. If he doesn't think waiters or any of the people he talked with listened to him then why would he think his readers would listen to?One of the things that I noticed, that really brought out an important issue for today, is how neglected Holden seemed to be. The whole time you're reading the book, it's easily clear to see that Holden just wants someone to talk to. The first example was with Ackley, and then with Stradlater, the woman on the subway, to Faith Cavendish, to the three women at the hotel, to cab drivers, to the prostitute, to the nuns, to Sally, to Luce, to his sister Phoebe, and to Mr. Antolini. And the only time that Holden ever felt that anyone was listening to him was when he talked with Antolini. The way that I took it, by the time he had finally gotten to Antolini, he was so burned out and tired from everything - drinking, poor rest, getting sick - but I also felt that he was finally give out mentally too. It's obvious that Holden was tired of the life that is \\"expected\\" of humans, of adults, and wanted to find his own way, but people kept pointing out how important things like school really were. When you're a teenager you feel that way, and when others don't listen to you or try to understand, the whole world comes crashing down on you. I can understand why some readers would say that Holden is just another \\"whiny, rich kid\\" but even \\"wealthy\\" people can have a hard time, mentally. The thing is, BECAUSE he such a well off kid helps this story flow. Because it isn't told from a poor person's point of view, or someone who is considered dumb. It's told from a teenager's point of view that, though he may be well off, is still struggling with the same exact problems that we all face sometime in our life. With Holden, he experienced it when he was young, and that's why this story is so important to society. Because many teenagers still continue to feel this way, and it's up to us to make them feel important and worth something. Another thing I noticed was that Holden is a very anxious person, and he is easily bothered by the smallest gesture if it is given by the same sex. This was the case with Mr. Antolini. Holden literally freaked out and left his house when he woke up to feeling his old teacher's hand on his head. I don't blame him for leaving either, but this tells us something about Holden's character. That he really is \\"yellow\\" and that he is quite anxious when it comes to people rubbing him the wrong way.What I walked away from this book thinking was this: As humans, we seem to be in such a hurry for everything. That we focus so much on media and entertainment and trying to impress others, that we miss the bigger picture, and that's life. We forget that there are others who need help, others that just want to talk, to not be lonely, how Holden was, how a lot of people are. The great thing about this story, is everyone can come away with a slightly different interpretation. For me, it's about direction, it's about finding yourself. It's about helping others, it's about a cry for attention. I think Holden said it best in my favorite part of the book, when he was telling his sister Phoebe about what he wanted to do in life - \\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all..and I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff..I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff..that's what I'd do all day..I'd just be the catcher in the rye..\\"."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hardly feel qualified to review such a classic.

People are always reading books they enjoy, like a bunch of phonies. That depresses me like hell. I'm only sorry it took until this point in my life to read it, I really am.While it is a little disjointed and rambling, these elements are planted by design.

Somehow I escaped that requirement and never read the book in high school, but I recently picked the book up for something to read on the long train ride into work each morning. It turned out to be a good choice, and a book that I really enjoyed, though it took awhile for me to get into it.The first problem was my own fault. Somehow I had confused the book with \\"Lord of the Flies\\", (which I also escaped from having to read in high school), and I kept waiting for Holden to somehow get stranded on an island in the Pacific. Needless to say, the story of a confused teenage boy flunking out of college and reluctantly having to go home and tell his parents seemed a strange and slow start to the story of a bunch of boys stranded on an island. When I finally got myself straightened out, the story started making sense, but it still seemed slow and monotonous. Hearing this boy complain about every little thing was not grabbing me at all. I wondered if making the book boring was done on purpose... to mimic the dullness of someone always complaining.From what I've said so far, you would think that I hated the book, but slowly the plight of this young man began to touch me. Beneath the constant grumbling and complaining was a kid feeling disillusioned, and not really knowing where to go with his life. I was actually becoming interested in what was happening to this boy, and how he saw it.Catcher in the Rye is an odd book. On the surface, the story can seem quite boring, yet some people really connect with it from the very beginning. Some people don't seem to connect with it at all. And for some, like me, it takes a little while to connect with the book. I think those who do connect with the book, whether right from the start or after having read a ways into it, are those who recognize either now or somewhere in their lives a feeling of being lost or disillusioned...a confusing mix of apathy, bitterness, regret, anger, fantasy... feelings commonly felt by teenagers as they enter the world of adulthood, but feelings that anyone can feel at any time. For those who connect with it, reading Catcher in the Rye is like a little light illuminating a part of us that we probably don't often see or wish to recognize, and in which one can learn to feel sympathy towards others (or ourselves) in such a place of emptiness.If you decide to read this book, my suggestion is that you give it a chance. Don't give up on it too early. It may surprise you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am sure I am in the minority of people who did not like this book. I found it boring and long winded at times. Now I can see where this book was groundbreaking for its day and age and I can appreciate the controversy that surrounds out, but on an entertainment/enjoyable level it missed the mark completely with me. I read \\"Nine Stories\\" and really liked it (especially \\"Teddy\\"), but this book ended any desire for me to ever read Salinger again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"How can any teenager not relate in some way to Holden Caulfield?This is what makes this book so awesome. It's simple, easy to follow, and totally universal. In high school Holden was the only person I'd ever \\"met\\" who really understood things. It's great that other kids have similar experiences with this book, and because of it, like me, get turned onto literature. I think Salinger has communicated the adolescent experience like no other person ever has."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I went through this whole book wondering, \\"What is the plot?\\" I did not realize until after I had finished reading that this book was about many different themes and that the plot varied. The main character, a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield, gets kicked out of a Prep school and spends most of the book wondering the streets of New York making observations in his head. He goes through many different character stages during the novel. In the beginning, he seems like a normal, practical kid who does not get good grades in school. After he is expelled from school, he gives in to increasing feelings of loneliness and misery. He begins to think about people he used to know, his dead brother Allie, his sister Phoebe, old girlfriend Jane Gallagher, and friend Sally Hayes. He ends up spending time with Jane and then sneaking into his house to see Phoebe. I will not ruin the rest of the story, but many things happen to Holden that seem weird and irrelevant while reading the novel. Overall, I think this was a good story. Like I said, I was confused while I was reading, but I was able to put the pieces together after I finished the novel. I think J.D. Salinger wrote this story very well. The writing was intriguing and interesting. It was not one of those books that I could not put down, but whenever I had some spare time, I wanted to read it. It had a style much different that any book that I have ever read. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. My interest in Holden is what kept me into the book. I found the way his mind worked to be fascinating. Whenever he got a thought in his head, he acted on it. It was this impulsiveness that often got him in trouble. I do have some criticisms, though. Even though it was well written I think there should have been a better plot and more themes to make the story more interesting. I also have some questions as to Holden's character. I do not think the reasons for his bizarre actions were explained well enough. At one point in the story, Phoebe asked him to come up with one thing that he liked a lot. He was such a pessimist that he could not think of anything at first. He finally thought up a wild scenario that he said he would like. He said that he would like to stand on the edge of a cliff that had a rye field on it. The field would have children playing on it and he would catch them if they started to fall off the cliff. He would be a \`catcher in the rye'. That was the only thing that he could dream up that he liked. As you can see, I have a few criticisms, but I found this book to be very enjoyable. In general, I thought The Catcher in the Rye was a good novel and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book to read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You grew up in a small town, didn't have many friends, went off to college and found it to be a strange new place... This book is for you. I don't know what people in West Virginia have against this book, but I suppose like anything else, everything is relative to your own personal experience. If you've never lived in New York, you probably wouldn't understand. Anyone who can't understand why a man would pay a hooker just to get company, to have someone to talk to, has obviously never had the luxury of feeling true loneliness. Holden's inability to articulate a certain memory without sidetracking is indicative of his state of mind (is it not a term paper; it is a confused young kid talking about how he feels). If you don't understand that, you really shouldn't read the book at all."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"this is my all time favorite book.ive read it 6 times straight in a row .i would reccokmed it to any one betwwen the ages of 15 to 17. what i liked about it is that it tells it like it is.not like how these tv sitcoms portray &quot;the perfect life&quot; its something ANY high school kid can relate to."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Hi.

The story takes place over a period of several days after Caulfield has been expelled from prep school. His cynical observations on his sorry state of affairs and his contempt for teachers, phonies and apparently all adults in general ring amazingly contemporary despite the book's being nearly 50 years old.I read this book in college, then later as a married adult and parent. It speaks volumes to the alienation of youth in a fast-paced engaging prose. For those who read this growing up, it is worth another look from an adult perspective. You'll be amazed at how different your reaction will be from the first time you read it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I gave up reading in 7th grade due to frustration with everything in life. In 10th grade i picked up this book and read it in two hours, and have read a book every week since. What's so great about it? Maybe nothing. Maybe the fact that the main character is an average frustrated teenager isn't anything new. The fact is, this book captures what it is like to be a HUMAN...to hate the phony even though you are phony sometimes yourself. To desire being good but being bad. To give up on society only to feel even more alone in your struggle. The truth is what it's about."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Holden Caufield jumped into my life about seven years ago when I was in high-school. I thought he was a funny smart alec who understood how rough it can be to be a teenager. But the more times I read this novel the more I realize that, while Holden's sense of humor is funny and smart, his attitude on life is one of fierce detachment. Through his relationship with his sister Pheobe, we can see that the only thing Holden truly loves is the past, and his only dream is to halt things where they are so that the things he loves will not change in any way. He is still suffering from the loss of his brother, Allie, and can not stand it that someone so young and innocent could have departed so soon. He is embittered against his brother D.B. who, Holden feels, has sold out in order to write scripts for Hollywood movies. And he is fiercely protective of his sister Pheobe, the only thing in his life that is still fresh and innocent and the only person he truly loves. Every anecdote and conversation that Holden has screams of this obvious longing to just stop things for a bit and not have to worry about people changing or growing up. There is not a single character with whom he interacts with for more than five minutes that he doesn't wind up resenting due to some part of their personality which indicates to Holden that they have sold out, moved on, lost track and become phonies. Outside of Pheobe there is only Jane Gallagher, the girl he used to hang out with, who he can view as being the same as she always was. And although Holden mentions calling her up numerous times in the book, he never actually communicates with her in any way being too afraid of what he'd find out about her. Especially after learning at the beginning of the novel that Jane has gone out on a date with his roommate, a known ladies man. The idea that Jane is now facing the trials and tribulations of real life would be too much for Holden to deal with, resulting in a strong desire to talk to Jane, but a fear of what he might find out. Holden is left with the memory of Jane as he loved her, and the real life Pheobe who he still loves, but desperately wants to preserve, thus finding peace at the end of the novel as she rides around and around, hopefully for Holden, forever on the merry-go-round. I related to Holden when I first read him. But I find I relate to Salinger as an artist more then Holden after subsequent readings."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of the half dozen books which I've read over a hundred times in the 30 or so years since I first encountered it. Being a troubled teenager when I read it, I identified with Holden, and when I became a writer, it was hard for me at first to shake Holden's narrative voice and find my own. I've studied the book to death, and read most of the critical books about it and its author, J.D. Salinger, but somehow everyone has focused on the book's language and Holden's teenage alienation, without ever getting their brains around the central point to the book.Holden Caulfield is a teenage boy who's lost his younger brother, Allie, and is terrified that something equally horrible might happen to his younger sister, Phoebe. All his obsessions -- the title of the book itself -- has to do with his inability to deal with the grief of his loss, his distrust of a universe that could do this, and his wish that he could wrap his arms around innocent children like his lost brother and protect them forever -- protect them from falling off a cliff as &quot;the catcher in the rye.&quot;."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I hate to be unkind -- but Catcher in the Rye is an amazingly stupid book. I am always so frustrated when people go on about how \\"wonderful\\" the little novel is.It's not. It's stupid and here's why:There is no plot. How can you have a story without a plot? The character has no desire and no purpose, no problems to solve, no goals. Basically, the entire book is about what a lazy slacker he is in school, how he thinks he looks old enough to get a drink in a bar (but he doesn't), and how much he hates his parents but is in love with his little sister.I dragged myself through this book grinding my teeth and waiting and waiting for something -- anything! -- to happen. But nothing happened.Here's what the book consisted of: Holden wanders around New York (I think it was New York, I don't remember), gets drunk, and wanders home. The end.I was mad when I read this book, and the only reason I read it was because my boyfriend said it was good. (He's not a seasoned book critic like myself.)Anyway, check this book out of the library for a laugh, but don't expect anything else."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"..I wonder if every teenager had a journal or a diary. If they did, many of them probably read like \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".The first time I read this book I think I was about 14. It wasn't assigned, I just had heard about it and figured I'd read it... I almost felt I was \\"supposed\\" to read it because of what it was about. While I was able to relate to the book, it didn't blow me away or cause some kind of cathartic moment... I liked Vonnegut better and went back to his novels...Now, 25 years later, I have read it again and have come to a realization. I don't really like the book, but I am not going to rant about it or even \\"blame\\" it. Here is why:\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was written in the 40's and uses what would have been called \\"cutting edge\\" style and bad language from that era. It is commendable for this because it reflects the reality of youth and the pain and angst many teens experience. I also give Salinger kudos because the times I got irritated with Holden Caulfield it was because he just just being an irritating little bastard... and that is the genius I acknowledge - I wasn't pissed at Salinger for writing Caulfield in an irritating manner - I was pissed at Caulfield. The writing style and issues Salinger wrote about are universal in scope and many of the people who complain about the book bitch about the way Holden is acting - not even realizing that they are giving immense credit to Salinger while shredding his book. Seldom have I heard anybody say that what Holden is saying is unbelievable - they complain because he is a whiner... Get it?It is not on my list of must reads for the simple reason that it read like much of the crap that I wrote.. and truth be told - if you go online and start reading BLOGs, you can see many of the angsty observations and rants Caulfield gives on a million different pages. Catcher came out at a time where there was very little discussion about what teenagers thought or felt then BAM!!! there it was. That is why it achieved \\"Classic\\" status - because it was and is a book that blew past the conventions of the day.Maybe I missed the \\"ideal\\" age to read this work, I am not sure. Maybe it affects people it is supposed to. I won't call it \\"crap\\" like some of the other people, but I sure as hell will not call it \\"life changing.\\" It is a book that I recommend people read because it might have a big impact, but it missed the mark with me."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am not an avid reader, nor am I one who enjoys the burdensome task of slaving through a book for English class. I do read a lot (because I have to), and so far J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is by far the best book I've ever read. In writing this book, Salinger surpassed Hemmingway, Hawthorne, and all the other \\"great writers.\\"Catcher is the story of Holden Caulfield, a selfish, hypocritical, and troubled teenager who has been kicked out of a private high school just before Christmas vacation. Like any teenager, he isn't eager to tell his parents that he's been kicked out of school, so he leaves his dorm and wanders around New York trying to find himself. The book follows Holden and his encounters in the Big Apple. He drinks in bars, solicits a prostitute, and does many other things that some boys at that age often think about, but lack the means and the cajones to actually do. Holden is troubled about the fact that he is growing up. He does not want to become older and sees his maturation as a transition from the real and personal world of being young to the phony, impersonal word of the older generation.I enjoyed this novel because Salinger amazingly writes the dialogue of Holden to resemble that a real immature pre-adult. He also did not shy away from including profanity and risqu&eacute; subject matter. Salinger also writes in a style which, as I have noticed over the past couple years, many of the great American novelists lack. It's called PLAIN ENGLISH. There is not any complicated dialogue, confusing metaphors, or any hidden meaning. When Salinger has a message, he says it straight out. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye is a well written novel.Any living, breathing, human with at least half a pulse would enjoy this novel at least for the story itself. However, if you are a guy around sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen you should definitely grab a copy of this book and get to reading. Trust me you wont be sorry. Salinger has also written some short stories like \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\\" I haven't read those stories yet, but if they contain only half the literary perfection found in The Catcher in the Rye, then they're definitely worth looking into."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I wonder how many young people can relate to J.D.

Somehow instinctively, I turned to Holden and a book that I had read several years earlier, but that had not made a significant impression then. Reading the novel again, it perhaps made me more desolate than I was before, and I dropped out of school a few months later. SOme might say that the book, then, had a negative impact on me. One less engineer in the world. One less go-getter. But through the contemplation I did in the months after leaving college, and the inspiring example of an English teacher I had at my local community college, I was able to find the true direction of my spirit. I had to make my life into something that I truly saw as meaningful. I couldn't settle into a career that would not fulfill my desires. I'm writing this review from my teacher's desk at school in my classroom. I'm an English teacher. I've found my calling. And although I can't entirely say it was Catcher in the Rye that pointed the way for me, the provocations of thought and emotion that this poignant little novel provided me had a definite impact. For those of you reading through the reviews here on Amazon and noting the great dichotomy of love and hate for this book, note that all great works of art have such an effect. Division is often the result of a work such as this. And I must say, no one should be forced to read this novel in school. It goes against the nature of the novel for us to cannonize Catcher and feed it to our youth as some sort of hallowed treatise on individualism and our flawed American society. Bleh! Leave it to be picked up by the curious and the lonely. Let it find its own audience."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Boy, this book just killed me. I really mean it.

Salinger's novel, this is not just the story of pessimist Holden Caulfield but a satirical view on the current state of society and and the loss of innocence. Such is the character of Holden's dead brother Allie who sybolized the goodness that was in society which is now gone. And Pheobe-who Holden so wanted to protect and keep innocent-is what is still left that's pure and good in society and thus that's why Holden wanted her to stay exactly the way she is. The ducks in the pond that Holden was obsessed with-wondering where they went after the pond freezes over-represent the innocence of youth and the shortness of childhood. And he's wondering where it goes and why children have to enter the phony world of adulthood so fast.

After hearing teachers and peers extoll the virtues (or lack thereof) of this book since high school, I finally took the opportunity to read this novel as a graduate student studying to become an English Language Arts teacher. Generally, I like the \\"classics,\\" and so I was surprised to find that I am simply not a fan of this book. I find the lead character, Holden, to be superficial and whiny to say the least (although I recognize that this ties in with the novel's overall themes). However, my personal bias aside, I still think there are many good arguments for making this text available in libraries, and for continuing to teach this text in school.First, this is a text that many high school students can relate to. For example, Holden says that school is \\"full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses...and everybody sticks together in these dirty goddam cliques\\" (Salinger 131). For many students this is an accurate picture of high school; a place where no one cares, everyone is fake, and the world is divided into cliques dictated by a popularity ladder. For students who resist this structure, or find themselves constantly tangled in the web that is high school, they may find a kindred spirit in Holden; a character who fights boldly, bravely, and perhaps uselessly against conformity. Additionally, this text gives teachers a chance to talk about such literary elements as symbolism (Holden's hunting hat has the potential to produce a very interesting discussion), narrative voice (can we trust a character who is unbelievably hypocritical, constantly refers to himself as \\"crazy,\\" and lies to nearly everyone?), word choice (what exactly is going on with that title anyway?), and/or theme (love, lies, innocence, honesty, authenticity: take your pick folks!).An added benefit to this text is that it is written in very simple language, although the layered meaning is quite complex. However, even though the language is simple, as educators we must be very careful about which students we attempt to teach this text to. Due to the prolific profanity (see above quote for a simple example), and often mature content, I would not recommend teaching this book to any students below 9th grade. It might be wise to consider if your class is ready for this mature text, and to examine whether or not the content (and this character) might offend/bore/alienate some or all of the students in your class. As part of this consideration, I would also recommend that teachers send a packet home with their students explaining to parents why this book should be taught, how it fits into the overall unit of study, and how the teacher plans to scaffold the trickier elements of this text (such as the profanity). Despite these challenges I still believe that this text should continue to be taught. \\"Classic\\" or not, there are elements of this text that can resonate with adolescent readers, and this book presents many interesting opportunities to engage with literary terms and ideas that we want young readers and writers to grapple with."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that where knowing too much about it can actually ruin it for you. I remember reading this book back in high school and not being very affected by it, simply because it was too complex. Now, eyars later, I've read it again and haven't enjoyed as much as I might have simply because I knew too much about it already. It really is a book with a very select audience: teens who are at that awkward stage of growing up, but are not ready to be grown up. Holden Caufield, in all his complexity, crassness, and \\"phoniness,\\" is the supreme symbol of that time in every teenagers' life. This book can only be enjoyed by those at that stage in their life. Read it when you are to immature and you won't understand anything. Read it when you are too mature and you will probably have forgotten what it was like to be that young and too fear and hate everything that the adult world stood for. For me, I am on the latter side, having forgotten what it was like to be that young, thus not getting as much enjoyment as I would have if I had read it a few years ago. WHen should you read it? I can't say for certain, but you definitely should read it. And sooner rather than later."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This novel and Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway are the reasons I'm still madly in love with the English language! The novel is a good one, it hooks me from the very first sentence and I wish it can go on as long as War and Peace and the Bible combined. It begins with Holden telling us about his lousy life, he just got kicked out of Pencey, a prep school, because he flunked a bunch of courses, but not English. Thank God!!! Naturally, he thinks the world is populated by a bunch of phonies and idiots and perverts and naturally, they are all grown-ups; like D.B., his brother, a screenwriter in Hollywood who drives fancy car and all, or his teacher, Mr. Antolini, who's sensitive as hell and I sort of liked him at the beginning until he tries to molest Holden. Personally, I'm quite interested in what kind of parents Holden has and why they produced such a lousy kid in the first place but Holden doesn't tell us much, except that they are touchy, and probably pretty sore about him not taking his education seriously. Kids are okay with Holden, though, like Phoebe, his ten-year-old sister. She's an obsessive writer of some girl detective novel and she wants to run away with him all the time, so do we. As we follow Holden, okay, being dragged around all over New York City by Mr. Salinger's strange but extremely wonderful prose, we encounter and get terrific laugh out of many amusing scenes and characters. But then, when we reach the end of the novel, we realize that Holden is not some lousy rich kid who flunked out of prep school. He's the sadness in all of us, the loss of our innocence, the ephemeral of life, the death of people and things we hold most dear to our heart, the catcher in the rye that we all wish to be... I want to tell you more about this enduring classic but I think it's better if you buy the damn thing and start reading it, for God's sake!!! Nick is the author of THE CARTESIAN MACHINE."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Magnificently written, perfect voice. I have to admire Salinger's talent portraying a young man on the verge of a breakdown. I don't enjoy episodic structure in novels so the story dragged for me and I wanted to skim. I persevered because the book is on the recommended reading list for year 10 studies, which I sometimes teach. One of those books you should read, but not necessarily for pleasure."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book honestly changed my life. I read it my senior year in high school, and it sparked my interest in reading more books that could be considered \\"classics\\" I definitely would say that this is one of the best books ever written. The way that J.D. Salinger portrays Holden Caulfield and allows the reader to get an insightful look at what goes on in his mind throughout this time in his life made me not want to put the book down. The way that Holden appears so transparent, yet he is so twisted makes him so relatable but also so different. He also used so many literary devices, which made his writing style even more captivating. It definitely challenged my ability to read and analyze books."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As the author of, [...], and a teacher, I know a little something about teenage angst. I'm knee-deep on the front lines nearly every day.I was, and still am, a true disciple of the Catcher-Cult. And, I'm sure there is nothing much to add here. It's all been said over and over again. I do, though, want to mention an experience I had with the book over time.When I first discovered the book at 16, I was completely devoted to the Holden mind-set. Everyone I saw was dripping with the fake and the phony. The world looked different to me. This almost ruined books for me. I actually expected to get that experience from every book I read. It was sad when it was not true. When I reread the book at about 25, it still rang true, but with some of my own angst long-gone, the book had lost its urgency. In a moment of personal confusion and conflict, I reread it yet again at about 30, hoping it would renew me in some way. It had the opposite effect. I couldn't help but think that Holden whined way too much. Enough already.I read it again at 42. And? I realized, perhaps more now than at 16, that Holden was more right than ever. The Catcher-Cult, once dormant inside me, had caught fire again, and a few decades later, once again changed my view of the world. Both the boy and aging man owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Salinger. Thanks."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the most memorable books of my childhood that touched me on the deepest levels of my soul. I highly recommend this book as a must read and dare to say it belongs on the list of 100 books one should read before adulthood."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Salinger penned one of the greatest novels of the century. His character lives in a world not unlike what most students his age experience. His language and views of the world in a stream of thoughts resulted in the banning of Catcher in The Rye in many of our American high school libraries. The innermost thoughts of its main character, Holden, are bitter and angry. He thinks of himself as a madman who detests those people in his life as phonies. Holden doesn't fit in with a society he is constantly expelled from. The novel is brilliant and thought provoking. I highly recommend the movie based on this novel. (Holden) J H Trembley"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, is a bildungsroman novel. The book is a flashback to the life of a sixteen year old boy and the different encounters that make him who he is. The boy's name is Holden Caulfield. The beginning of the book anchors you immediately with Holden's opinion of the world around him. Holden is currently at an all boys boarding school on the east coast. He is failing the majority of his classes though and is being kicked out. The book begins in Holden's last days at boarding school, then takes you straight into his adventures. The setting of this book is more dangerous than the world I know. It's thrilling to see how many interesting characters are introduced throughout the book. Each is vividly described along with Holden's unique opinion on each. Holden gets across his point in a humorous way. This book is amusing because of how bluntly Holden expresses his thoughts. While at a boarding school, a boy named Ackley lives in the room across from Holden's. While in Holden's room, Ackley states that he's going back to his own room, Holden replies, \\"Okay,\\" then thinks, \\"He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room.\\"This novel is written in first person which makes it easier to understand the way Holden thinks. This novel puts you in his shoes. The descriptions allow you to picture every detail. For example, while checking into the Edmont Hotel, Holden describes his surroundings, \\"The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixty-five. He was even more depressing than the room was. He was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness. I'd rather be bald than do that.\\" Everyone and everything is analyzed by Holden. His thoughts are often sarcastic. Holden's life is full of exciting, new experiences that keep me turning the pages. In fact, I enjoyed the book to the point where I did not want to finish because I did not want the book to end. Holden thinks, \\"What really knocks me out is a book that when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.\\" This novel is wonderfully entertaining, sarcastic, and amusing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think this a very bad book. All it talks about is a boy, who tries to be unique and be himself. He calls everone he meets phonies, but what he does not get is that he is very phony by saying he does not care about what people say when the truth is that he really does care.For me reading this book was a hard to read (and I read a lot, Believe me!) because Salinger did not make the reading very easy.If all of Salinger's books are like the Catcher in the Rye, then I will never read Salinger again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I believe much of the hype of this book has to do with the time of release. Many things shock us based on our culture at the time. This book would not be a 'blip on the radar screen' if released today. Overall a good piece of work, but not as epic today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is not supposed to have a point. At all. That's why this book is considered a modern classic. J.D. Salinger had no purpose for writing this book, except to write. After reading this book, you really start to think about how trivial things are, like why you care about &quot;phonies&quot;, and that life should be lived minute to minute. Holden shows the reader the beauty of life just being lived, with no ambition, and no other reason, except to stay mildly happy. Holden holds high standards for everyone around him, even strangers. And the one person who can keep within the highest of these standards is his sister, Pheobe. Salinger goes beyond petty sibling rivalry, to show the deeper human connection in Holden's shallow world. The person who does not understand the point of this book, understands perfectly. Holden is a hero, living through beating after beating, mild homelessness, dealing with the ignorant, and missing out on an education. Anyone can gain from reading this book. You just have to stop looking for the point, and just read."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently read Catcher in the Rye for my English class. It didn't goanywhere it just kept going on about different things that happened to Holden. The book didn't have just one story, it had a bunch of storys that didn't go together. The Author didn't tell what happened at the end or what even happened to him. Nobody who reads this book can relate what happens to Holden. I wish I wouldn't have even picked this book. The only good part of this book is all of the cussing. An example would be in his dorm room and he is talking about a football game he isnt even at. The book has no plot it is about a boy who fails out of prep school and doesn't want to go home to tell his parents. The writer should have focused on one thing instead of trying to make the story together with other stories . It goes nowhere It just tells a bunch of different stories. He keeps going off and doesn't keep up with what he is talking about. This book should not be sold anywhere because it has no meaning. The story is too long and it has too many different stories it never goes with one thing he always goes off on something else. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 40 because its too boring for younger people. I think this book only deserves 1 star because it has a lousy plot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye By Lynn C (A/B)Showing a lonesomelife of a teen boy, the age of sixteen, by the name of HoldenCaulfield, the author J.D. Salinger writes a novel of Holden&iexcl;s life in the book called The Catcher in the Rye. The novel is fiction with a form of the first person view. The style of this book is very descriptive in fact. The basic outline of the story is about the freedom the main character, Holden Caulfield, wants, and how he wants to be someone who has meaning. Holden has basically been expelled from many schools. And yet, he is staying at Pencey (school). Well, Holden tries to stay tight in Pencey, but it seems like he cannot stand his life in the dormitory. Eventually, he sneaks out of Pencey after having a fist fight with his roommate, a few days before the vacation, and hangs around on the streets of New York, while visiting his loving sister Pheobe and friends from time to time. And basically everything else in between the main parts, are just very deep descriptions of his memories. Through the story, you will find many problems with Holden and his friends having fist fights, and problems within the society and Holden, where Holden hangs out in night clubs looking for girls to hang around with, and places such as the hotel room he stays in. There are a tremendous number of conflicts in the book, which makes it interesting to read. If you look at the book and think back of the story, you do not really feel that it has any point to it. You would start to wonder why Holden ever even went to a dormitory if he didn&iexcl;t like it. I mean, all the book talks about is Holden&iexcl;s pathetic life, and what he goes through at every place. I am sure the book was a story, but I did not find any point in the book. There wasn&iexcl;t a direct thought of what the book was about after I had finished the book. Even though the format of the story was not quite what I thought, I still think that the book was put a lot of thinking in it. Out all the books I have read in my life, this book is quite different in a way. One of the books I read before was called Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther, which was about a little boy who had cancer and died, it was a quite depressing biography of a little boy. The reason I am comparing it the with The Catcher in the Rye is because, it only describes basic thoughts in a regular way, but The Catcher in the Rye takes every event and deeply describes every bit of it. Not only that but also some subjects the main character, Holden Caulfield, talks about leads to other things in his life that relates to it. So, it is like branches on a tree, one leading to another. I found that confusing for me, because while I was reading the book, I did not know what to focus on, so that I can comprehend. On the other hand, I slightly did find it interesting for me to read in a way. While I was reading through, I seemed to have enjoyed the deep descriptions of Holden&iexcl;s life, but one thing I seriously did not really enjoy reading in every other sentence, were the curse words the author slipped in. Every other sentence of this book had curse words slipped in to them. I found that part inappropriate for young readers to read. Over all, I think the author put a load of thought into every paragraph of the book, but I don&iexcl;t think he mainly focused on the format of the book. Because, if you read through the book, you seem to enjoy it with much interest since it is really descriptive, but once you finish it, you ask yourself, what was the point? I mean, the plot and setting was all great, but what about the ending? The Catcher in the Rye does not seem to leave a memorable thought to the reader. If the author would have put a little more effort on the basic format of the story with reasoning, I think the book would have been one of my favorite books. It seems like the author enjoyed describing every thought of the book with much effort and time. I recommend The Catcher in the Rye to high school students with a book rating of eight out of ten."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I have just finished reading this book and honestly, I am not quite sure what the point of it all was. Holden just didn't seem &quot;messed up&quot; enough for me. If he was more dysfunctional, with a bad history and more serious problems, I think I'd appreciate it more. But he just seems like another slacker I might come across at any time. I think if the book was to be edited, omitting the parts that were not significant; those parts which just basically padded the book with unneccessary chapters, it'd be about 100 pages. Plus, the ending didn't satisfy me. It wasn't a book I could &quot;sink my teeth into&quot;. I guess I think this way because I started reading it assuming it would be great, and it was anticlimactic."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This is, quite simply, the best book I have ever read. I cannot begin to describe what I was feeling while I read this book. It was absolutley mesmerising, captivating, and just plain wonderful. There has been much contraversy surrounding this book due to it's language and so forth. I thought that Holden's tendency to drink and swear actually added to the book. It showed his lack of self-esteem and how depressed he really was. I hope everyone who reads Catcher in the Rye will love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've always wondered what about this book makes it a classic so I borrowed it from a friend and got ready to be entertained. But I was sorely and thoroughly dissappointed. I can't believe this guy actually suckered a publishing house into actually printing this piece of garbage. Unles they did it as an example of just how NOT to write a book. There is no plot, no real character development and the language is instantly droll. If I hadn't borrowed this book I would have been angry at having been swindled out of good money. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was a complete waste of paper. It had some interesting points but, it had no plot. It also turned out to be a major dissappointment because it ended so poorly. It should have been some elaborate lie that he had thought up while telling his sister. His parents should have played a bigger role in the book. The one part I did like was him talking to his brother."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Without meaning to be critical, cynical, nor harshly judgmental, &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; compels me to ask: Why do schools and libraries encourage teens and young adults to read this senseless dribble about (what I perceived to be) a critical, cynical, and harshly judgmental antagonist? Frankly, and unfortunately, I was not too pleased with the book's plot (or lack thereof). Simply put: It did not make any sense, and I, as a reader, did not feel remorse nor sympathy for the principle character. His repetitiveness was viewed as immature, as well as his cussing and judgmentalism were irresponsible. Not exactly good examples I would set for any upcoming generation of young readers. I was unable to figure out the author's reason(s) for writing such a &quot;critically acclaimed&quot; classic, and I could not care to. My opinion of this book is that it's not worth the read. I would not recommend it to anyone, not even to a dog."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am a reader from Germany. In my mind this book is one of the best I ever read. The reader is able to feel, what the main charakter feels. If you are reading this novel you are Holden himself. I can't stop reading, because I was really moved by this novel. There's no part in this book, you are boored while reading it. The way Salinger wrote the novel is really fantastic. It is written in a very lively stile. It's a really moving story, describing a young boy having a lot of problems. After, and while reading, you start thinking over all the characters in this novel, and about human beiing.I also started reading a german translation which is really terrific, 'cause the way the translator interpret the story is not the way Salinger wanted us to interpret the story. But this is only my own opinion. Please read this novel and build up your own."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Rather than drone on about the influence this book had on me (though great it was) or the way in which it captures the feelings and perspectives of so many teenagers like every other review I would simply say that this is one eof the few books where there is so much more than meets the eye. Everyone will tell you that Holden is disgusted by phonies, but what makes this more interesting to the point of amusement is that often, right after he he attacks people for being phony, he does something phony himself such as when he's in the bar. To me it's the things like this that make it relate to teenagers because all teenagers like to criticise others for following the crowd while they are following a crowd of sorts themselves. It's all these lil things that make the book so incredibly good. Also, the entire catcher in the rye bit, and the idea that the field represtns youth and realness in people gets me every time; I read it and afterwards I'm stuck in a state of contemplation for a good hour at least.What I would give to have met J.D. Salinger...Oh and one more thing, I think it's far too simplistic too blame all of Holdens &quot;angst&quot; (an incredibly over-used and crap word) on his brothers death; I believe there is slightly more to do with it than that. Don't you?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"When my friend read this book, she said she wanted nothing more than to slap Holden. I didn't. I wanted to marry him (which I subsequently did, but that's another story). What I loved most about Holden was his elemental uncorruptibility, a fundamental innocence that could not be lost through experience. Instead, the power of his innocence shaped all of his experiences, transforming even his mistakes into acts of courage, idealism and beauty."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"By telling a story about the bleak, post-war world around him, Holden Caulfield was not only Salinger's insight, but his irony. We've all been in Holden's shoes and know what it feels like to be irritated with things we can't change, so we can all relate to his disposition. But, the underlying trait of Salinger's protagonist is that he's basically all talk. The scene with the prostitute, making fun of Ackley behind his back--they're all emotions and feelings that are, in some respect, universal to all human beings, but mostly the sort of things we are too proud to speak about. The historical part of the novel (the post war boom), was what caught me best though. Salinger criticizes American economics by letting a sardonic teenager (who, in all actuality, no one would have listened to the argument of) and let him do his dirty work as well as spend a whole crap load of cash. So, by using a cocky character to critique the general ills of a superficial upper class, Salinger shows us the incessant struggle that all of us, in every walk of life, goes through. You can read this book on an economic level, a sociological level, a historical level, the list goes on and on. Bravo!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Teenage angst at its peak, told in a way that did not make me sympathize with the main character.

The Catcher in the Rye is a great work of literature that everyone can relate too. Well, almost everyone. Just like Holden Caulfield, I'm a 16- year old teenager who is often unable to communicate with others even though I wish I could. I also get to be very cynical about life and other people even though they might be all right, and I truly hate all the hypocrisy and conformity people are subjected to and accept throughout life, as seen in the faculty of the private school which I attend and detest so much. I might not be exactly like Holden Caulfield, but I can definitely relate too him in many ways as a very realistic person that J.D. Salinger has created.

But Caufield was the original, and his was the literary shot heard 'round the world.

Salinger's passing. Simon was going to school at Dartmouth, near where Salinger lived in New Hampshire, and he really wanted to meet the writer. He managed to get as far as the great man's front door, before being turned away by a girlfriend. In response to the short blog entry, I noted that I've read many books, but never The Catcher in the Rye, for whatever reason. Every time someone tries to explain the book and why it resonated with them, I just get annoyed. It makes me want to read the book less.So I commented on Roger's blog article, and joked that I'd probably prefer a Pastrami in the Rye to The Catcher in the Rye. I have a thing for Langer's. Anyway, Roger then wondered if anyone had read Catcher recently, or wanted to now having not read it in the past. A few days later I when I was out and about, I idly went to a used bookstore, discovered they were out, went to a second one ditto, and wound up buying one of the few copies left at the local Borders. It's been a couple of days, and now I've read the thing. It wasn't at all what I expected, and I didn't relate to Holden at all...but I still think it's a brilliant book, just not for the reasons that everyone else (or those I've read, anyway) seem to think it's great.For those of you familiar with music, Randy Newman is probably best known for the song \\"Short People.\\" It's about prejudice and how stupid prejudiced people are. Newman famously has gotten sick of various lunkheads yelling \\"Hey Randy, short people suck!\\" at him randomly on the street. He deliberately chose a characteristic that would be beyond prejudice, even semi-intelligent prejudice, and found that people were much more stupid than he thought, and that the song, as a result, resonated with a lot of people it wasn't supposed to.With The Catcher in the Rye, I get the same impression. I don't think this was supposed to resonate with anyone. If I understand it correctly, the book was written for adults, and only after a good long while was it assigned to children. It resonates with teenagers in many ways, because a lot of kids when they're that age feel aimless and alienated. The problem with taking the book literally is that *no one* at least as far as I'm concerned was ever as alienated as Holden Caulfield. It's as if Salinger wanted to exaggerate the unattractive qualities of this kid, with the intention of making a main character so objectionable that no one could like him or take his story seriously, and everyone would get the message that this sort of alienated behavior is beyond the pale. No wonder the guy exiled himself for 50 years. No one understood his book...either that, or I misread it completely.So, for those of you who haven't read the book, this is a synopsis of the plot, though it's mostly a synopsis of the main character because there is no plot. Our hero, or anti-hero really, is Holden Caulfield. He comes from a well-to-do family (at one point he mentions his father's a corporate lawyer, they have an apartment that's half of a floor in a building next to Central Park, he has a grandmother who sends him lots of money for his birthday, etc.) and he's just been kicked out of his third prep school. He left one (because everyone there was a phony; one of his bugaboos is he hates phonies) and was kicked out of the other. This one is called Pencey, and Holden has been kicked out because he just ditched most of the classes and did none of the homework. So he goes back to New York City for the weekend, and just aimlessly horses around for the whole book. At the beginning, when he's telling you what is going to happen, he says he'll tell you about the \\"madman\\" weekend he had. You get the feeling that the character's supposed to have written this account as therapy, to try and sort out why he did what he did.The weekend itself is unremarkable, except for Holden making an ass of himself repeatedly. He goes to various bars and restaurants and tries to order liquor, which he shouldn't be served because of his age. If he gets it he gets drunk and sits there getting annoyed with the people around him in the bar, and silly things about them that irritate him. If they don't serve him alcohol he does the same thing, only he doesn't get drunk doing it. Holden's hyper-critical about everything around him, and spends pages telling you about how he can't stand phonies (almost everyone he mentions in the book is a phony in some respect) and he hates *things*. One of the more annoying (and recognizable) traits of Holden-the-teenager is that he is constantly trying to convince you he's an old hand at things. He repeatedly refers to \\"when I was a kid\\" and is always telling you that he \\"always\\" does something in such-and-such a circumstance, as if he's been doing this or that for decades. He's the sort of teenager who earnestly tells adults he's very mature...and of course isn't mature at all.So why did I give this novel five stars? It's brilliantly written. The author adopts Holden's voice and uses it as his own--never breaks character no matter what--for 214 pages. You believe that this little self-important self-absorbed twit is actually writing this book, telling you about what an ass he was during this weekend. I'd always thought that this book was to be taken as the classic coming of age story, but of course Holden doesn't come of age during the course of the book, at all. At most, he gets a little sense smacked into him (figuratively) when he announces to his little sister that he's running away, and she decides to come with him. Holden instead is shipped out to Hollywood, where his older brother D.B. is a screenwriter (who Holden predictably thinks sold out). D.B. keeps watch on him, while he's here in California. Holden the narrator isn't clear about what's going on, but it sounds like his parents sent him to some sort of sanitarium or something, perhaps to help him get his head straight, and he's written this account while there.I guess what I'm trying to say is this: The Catcher in the Rye is about how screwed up and alienated a kid can be, except the author exaggerated the characteristics past all reality to make his point more forcefully. To my mind, the book is sort of a cautionary tale. If you spend your whole teenage years criticizing everyone and everything around you, you could wind up like this. It's not a pretty picture, though at times the book is very funny.I have to say then that I'm appalled that this book is taught in high schools as if it's somehow something that teenagers *should* relate to. They shouldn't relate to it, and no one should aspire to he like Holden Caulfield in the least. This book should be read by adults, those who have gotten far enough along in life that they can safely look back at their adolescence and realize what a jerk they were being when they did various things that seemed important at the time. *Then* you might get something out of it, and you'll certainly get a laugh or three."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I've heard this book referenced so often, and felt like a dummy having never read it. I am so glad I finally did ...about a quarter way through the book I actually dreaded its coming to an end.

It was clean and not a single stain on it.

The book itself was great, i really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I was looking for a good book to read when I came across this recommendation with high ratings. Surely a book with this high of a rating must be very good!I was very disappointed! In short:Pros:Salinger's good writing style makes for easy reading.Cons:Poor story line. There's not much to this book. No interesting plot. As others have said, the hole story is Holden gets kicked out of school, goes to NY & gets drunk and goes home.No insight or learning. There's nothing to be learned from this book. This is not a coming of age story or anything interesting.At the end of the book I thought I wasted my time reading this book when I could be reading something more worth while."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I finished the book, but it was tough. I didn't like the stream-of-consciousness style and I also didn't like the protagonist."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The book describes an extreme case of confusion when a person leaves childhood. It expresses the emotions like Munch's painting, The Scream."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of my favorite books. I would recommend it to teens and not adults though. It is extremely relatable (for me anyways)and is great to read when you're at the point of your teenage life when you begin to think everything is dumb. I really grew a relationship with the characters and I think I finished the book in probably two days. I just thought it was so good."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is one of my favorite books. I was fourteen when I first read it for a school assignment, and I've loved it ever since. The language, the story line - this is just an awesome book all around."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is about a boy named Holden Caulfield who has just gotten kicked out of Prep. School, again. He has a cynical, sarcastic tone as he talks about all the phonies in his life. After a fight with his roommate Stradlater he leaves early and goes to New York City. For two days Holden proceeds to meet up with old friends and teachers from the past, make them mad, and get drunk. After seventeen years of life Holden is just fed up with everything and everyone, but deep down you can tell he's hurting. He talks a lot about his brother, Allie who died of cancer, and how he used to write poems on his baseball mitt so that he'd have something to read while in the outfield. Holden also mentions his sister Phoebe a lot, and how she's probably the only person in the world that isn't fake. Most of the story is pointless, but it had a pretty good theme. The theme of Catcher in the Rye is that of coming of age and growing up. Holden is afraid to grow up because he thinks the adult world is phony. The reader can tell Holden is worried that no one will ever be real with him once he's an adult, and that they'll just tell him what he wants to hear.After reading the book I have to say it won't ever be a favorite of mine. Holden is rude, crude, and not very friendly. I can't really tell what the book was trying to say, or what message it had. Even though Catcher in the Rye isn't the nicest book in the world I liked how forward it was. The author, J.D. Salinger wasn't afraid to make Holden a bad boy who liked to swear, and openly hate almost everyone. It's a bold and daring book epically for its time, that's why I give it a three out of five stars. Catcher in the Rye is very out there, and I would only recommend it to people who don't mind, profanity, \\"adult\\" subject matter, and those who are over the age of thirteen. If you're more into calmer books with a bit of a daring side and less swearing I would recommend The Great Gatsby, The Help, and Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't want to make this review seem completely derogatory, but to be honest, I have little to say that's positive about the book. Maybe I'm missing the main moral or the big picture here, but I really just didn't understand.So obviously, I get the perspective that the author is writing from and I appreciate what he was saying. I just feel like he didn't it well. Not to say that I didn't like the whole adolescent theme that he so nicely set up, but he really could have done better on his characters. Rather, his character. If you look really hard, you can understand where this character is coming from and who he is. But this Holden guy really needed to be more defined. He did great emphasizing on the trial and the seemingly complexity of being an adolescent, just not quite well enough.Again, I really am trying not to sound so negative here. Here goes. I was recommended this book because it was supposedly so inspiring. Maybe that was a joke or maybe I'm crazy. But after reading it, I didn't feel inspired. In fact, I'd say I felt the opposite. The book had a sort of negative feeling to it and I was really upset with how things ended. I also felt like it was encouraging things to be taken advantage of. Maybe my perspective is a little skewed or something.In the end, I sort of felt like this book was a waste of my time. I think that my expectation were just a little to high for it and that's one reason I was so disappointed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book in one day, it's so good. I know to many of you avid readers out there, reading 1 book in a day might not be that much of an accomplishment, but hey, I don't read all that much.Maybe it's just because I'm a 14 years old boy so many of the things in this book I can connect with, but this book, IMO, just has everything. It'll make you laugh out loud time and time again and it has writing that is actually clear and easy to understand (unlike a lot of my reviews). I definately recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but especially to guys like me that can actually connect with many events that are happening within the book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"There's always been all this arguement on whether or not Catcher in the Rye is a classic or not, whether or not it is great. I think that regardless of your opinion of the novel, you have to admit its importance to our culture, and just how many people it has touched. It's because Salinger works it on many different levels. When I read it first in my early teens, it touched that teen angst that we all seem to be filled with. But as I got older, and as I re-read the book, I begin to see that it isn't normal teenage feelings. As I age, I can understand the sadness, the despair, being lost like that. This is not just a book for young people. It transcends age (though you may be reading it in secret).The other thing about this book that grabs you is the voice of the narrator. I've always felt that voice awas one of the most important aspects to any story. Those with an interesting voice, like Huck Finn or Nick Carroway or Holden Caufield, last forever. Regardless of your opinion of J.D. Salinger (and I'm no big fan of his), you have to admit, The Catcher in the Rye is a a great book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was different from the books I read. It was the one that was closest to my life also known as reality. As you read this book, it seems as if Holden's always digressing into some other insane subjects, but isn't that how people really think? Also, all of Holden's pessimistic views accord with how people really feels. Mankind seems to always have this dark view of things even though happiness is layed right in front of their eyes. Well, I'm digressing again. Anyways, this book was a book that was certainly one of the better ones, and was a book that never stopped your emotions from rising.Based on what I'm reading on the review board, and what other poeple I know said about this book, one similarity seems to arise from all the reviewers, complaints about the ending and the \\"message\\" behind the book. First of all, books are not like movies, you do not have to see the ending that has been already created for you, but make an assumption about what happened. That is the beauty of the book what separates from the \\"phony\\" movies. Also about the message of the book, the whole book is filled with messages, it is up to you to find out the right message for you."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It is difficult to understand what the message should be. But it is only once you put the book away that you understand what it is about. It shows life - not only of a teenager boy - from an unusual perspective. Those thougths does not fit to the correct social patterns we would love to see. And there is no moral at the end which calms down our indignation. It is up to us to find our own insights.This is what I appreciate, a book who leaves it up to its reader to draw her/his own conclusions."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'd heard this book was being banned for 'inappropriate material' and, of course, I had to find out why. Holden's angsty tendancies, but subtle humor kept me turning the pages. It was actually the first book I read in two days...wowzas! It provides an insightful, but satirical, outlook on the world of a teenager growing up with no answers. The symbolism, the plot, the overall aspect makes it an instant classic and my favorite book so far."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i reviewed this right after i finished it and gave it four stars. but after a while i realized i was still thinking about this book. and usually after i read a book i stop thinking about it after a day or two. but this one stayed in my mind for weeks. so i still agree with most things i said in the first review i'm just changing it to 5 stars, because of its staying power. if you want to read my original review keep reading.well i read this because i am a 16 year old male. so i was supposed to really identify with holden, and i did at some points in the book, but at others he was a bit too cynical for me and i can be pretty cynical. my favorite was near the end when he was with phoebe, his little sister. that got to me the most. sometimes though his problems became a little bit too much. I also think the word \\"corny\\" was overused. all in all though it was a good book. i am definitely going to check out salinger's other work."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After you read this, Holden Caulfield will live on in your mind, hanging around, speaking through you, informing the way you think of yourself and others. It's a masterpiece of writing, in which the author clearly and completely presents to you another person's mind and soul.It is an incredible exercise in empathy. It really was. As I read it, I realized that Holden was far from perfect, but I cared so much what happened to him, I could feel his loneliness and could see him resisting getting the help he needs. Salinger's recreation of a boy headed &quot;to a fall,&quot; as Mr. Antolini tells him, is an amazing opportunity to be someone else for awhile.The colloquial speech of the novel is well suited for reading aloud, and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. I really did. We read it like madmen whenever we could. I'm not kidding.I guess I just want to say that I love and care for Holden Caulfield and I hope, somewhere, he's alright."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i read this book for the first time when i was 14 (over a decade ago)....and haven't managed to delete it from my memory even to this day...its left an unimaginable impact on my mind as it depicted the trials and tribulations of a teenager with such genuine accuracy....that as a teenager i was overwhelmed to read that i wasn't the 'only one'. Perhaps the teenage years of one's life are the most lonely that one goes through....and to find someone else who identifies with you at that point in time seems ineffable....even today i enjoy reading this book as i can now at this age understand the finer tones and nuances that were missed at a younger age....i recommend this book highly...."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think a lot of people miss the most important meaning of this book. You can love it; you can hate it; you can feel indifferent towards it. However, the one thing no one can deny is that at one time in all of our lives we have felt exactly as Holden Caulfield did. The Catcher in the Rye is a timeless novel of teenage emotions. No matter how you feel about the book, you must admit it is an accurate depiction of a teenager's mind. Sometimes we all feel like Holden Caulfield."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"JD Salinger's loose style of writing is excellent. i love how its so easy to read and follow, this book is a very good book because of Salinger's writing technique, but Holden, a rich, depressed boy, is nothing but a hypocrite. I liked the story though because its almost funny to hear Holden bitching about other characters he believes are phony when he in fact is just like them. it reminds me about a lot of people i know, those types who say &quot;i hate when people think there better then others&quot; and &quot;I hate when people talk behind eachothers backs&quot; poor spoiled little rich kid :( i feel bad for Holden."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'll admit that I read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because of its reputation. I have always heard that it is one of the greatest books of all time, a coming of age story that defines a generation. Upon completing the book I was left wondering what it all really was about. Maybe it was over my head and I could not appreciate its story, but from the moment I was introduced to Holden I never like him. I found his tales boring and his encounters dull. Each one was more irrelevant then the last. I just don't see how this book is on the same level as other great novels such as \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird.\\" The only redeeming quality of the book is that it moved along fast and was a quick read (shocking for such a drab book)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book wasnt very interesting. I couldnt relate to the character and his personality he was negative most of the time thinking everyone but himself were phony. I dont recommend this book because it doesnt grab your interest."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"After hearing about how wonderful this book was, I was very disappointed when it was my turn to turn the pages. The writer, throughout the entire novel, habitually takes the Lord's name in vain. Why!? What's the point? What was he trying to prove?! I was \\"required\\" to read for class, but would rather risk a poor quiz grade then be exposed to such derogatory and offensive language. Even if the language was improved, the story is boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but each page turned proved just as dull; a complete disappointment and waste!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It was a Christmas gift for my husband. And we have been looking all over for it so he's excited to read it again."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I don't like this book, but it isn't a terrible book, and I've read a lot of terrible books. In fact it's a good book, but that's it. It's good, it's ordinary. I've re-read Catcher three times now, I get it and what it try's to convey and all I have to say is, meh. For me there was nothing new, nothing exciting, and it certainly wasn't life changing.Is it really worth all the hype?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Since others before me have done an excellent job describing the plot, I'll move right into my thoughts on this \\"American classic\\". Salinger's writing style does a good job of capturing the stream-of-consciousness thought process of a 16 year old boy. Unfortunately, about midway through the book it became very repetitious and formulaic to the point where I could have produced dialogue for Holden on my own. I don't believe a main character has to be likable for a book to succeed, but Holden was irritating to the point where I had to force myself to continue on with the book. He constantly labels others as phonies when he is, without a doubt, the biggest phony in the novel. He is constantly seeking the company of others to ease his loneliness, but proceeds to find fault with everyone he meets. And, quite understandably, no one, except his sister Phoebe, wants his company. I must ask those who have given this book five stars, would you want to spend 10 minutes with this whiny, spoiled, ungrateful, self-centered narcissist?On the upside, Salinger does redeem the Holden slightly when we become privy to Holden's thoughts on his little sister and dead brother. The relationship between Phoebe and Holden is quite touching, and I was glad I didn't give up on the novel when I reached the part where Phoebe showed up at the museum with her suitcase so she could run away with her brother. I found Phoebe to be an infinitely more interesting character than Holden.I felt as though Salinger deceives his readers by introducing Holden's memories of James Castle, a boy who jumped to his death after a group of boys entered his dorm room and demanded he apologize for a slur he made to a member of the group. The boy refused to apologize to the very end. I thought this might be an indication that Holden was finally going to take a stand against all the \\"phonies\\" and do something with his life to free himself from the quagmire of hypocrisy in which he seems to be drowning. Normally at this point I would issue a spoiler alert, but I can't spoil the ending more than the author. Other than Holden realizing the important role his sister and dead brother played in his life, NOTHING happens. NOTHING!Other reviewers seem to be able to relate to Holden, I was unable to do so. My high school and college years were simultaneously the best times and the worst times of my life. I encountered plenty of phonies, but I also met some of the most genuine and decent people I've met in my entire life.Finally, I think if you were rip off the cover and hand this book to 100 people who have never read it, I believe the reviews would not be quite so glowing. I'm sure many people truly love this book, but I think there are many who claim to love it because it's been declared an American classic, and do not want to appear incapable of appreciating what their peers claim to be a great novel. I guess one might refer to them as phonies. ;-)"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I like to read classics that I have never read before. This one looked interesting and heard lots about it over the years for it. Not sure why it is a classic. I agree with other reviewers that maybe this had more meaning when it was first published. The constant swearing and repetitive dialogue was beyond irritating. A quarter of the way through the book I disliked the Holden so much I was hoping for a suicide, but unfortunately, he continued on and on and on. Not all books are considered timeless."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a verbose and rather mundane monologue. The main character, Holden Caufield, is an immature 17-year-old of average intelligence, and we're trapped listening to his inner ramblings for the entire book. He is constantly complaining, and the other characters in the book he interacts with dislike him for the most part.The plot arc is just as mundane:- To Holden, everything is either depressing or corny.- He is kicked out of school for not applying himself.- He blames the school for being 'full of phonies' (p.90) for his failure.- He goes to New York for a few days.- He calls a bunch of people who either don't want to hang out with him or regret it later.- He goes home and hangs out with his sister.Maybe this is stereotyping, but to me, depressed kids are usually highly intelligent. I kind of expected Holden to at least making interesting observations about the world around him.Maybe this book was a classic in another era. To me, The Catcher in the Rye is utterly forgettable. Holden's inner struggle to find his place, his way, or his meaning in the world, while noble, is uninteresting."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book was depressing, rambling and extrememly vague. What a waste of money! It's as if the author wrote the entire thing as stream of consciousness. The plot has holes all through it. The story jumps all over the place and is really quite boring. I have no idea why it is such a classic and revered by so many. I am absolutely gobsmacked if this book is recommended for high school reading. It is completely unsuitable. Don't even bother reading this book. I love reading classic novels but this one was very dissapointing."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"unlike most artistic works touted as profoundly significant this one fails to live up to the hype without seeming pretentious as a result. it doesn't seem very ambitious. just a light easy read without much there to either praise or criticize. far from the angry loner the character is said to represent Holden Caulfield seems basically laid back and content, more average than intense. it's an engaging read once you get past the first chapter, and maybe that's not a compliment to be sneezed at since so few books really seem to actually hold my attention, but it's nothing more than that. it didn't make me think."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The great thing about this book is it's a legacy. J.D.Salinger was a mystery.His creation was a groundbreaker. I read and re-read this book several times. I still remembered this first time I was still in my teen,It came like a breath of fresh air. Never before I'd read such unique character,Holden Caulfield. Salinger's narrative style was charismatic,bewitching and truly remarkable. Now I'm in my late-twenties I still find it amazing each time I'll read it..I see things from a different level or perceptive.I'm sure in the years to come, at different stops of my life,my views may vary but I will certainly read it for a long time, this book will withstand the test.This book was about Holden,17. Salinger took readers to see and experience a few days of Holden's life through Holden's preceptive. Holden's going through a phase which was realistic and compelling. Showing the true meaning of life and psychological reality of people. What is human nature? Who's truthful and who's a phony?This book filled with ironies and highly debatable social and physiological issues. It also drawn a foggy line between madness and genius.

The book is really about the loss of youth and innocence. Holden desires to catch those falling off the cliff into a corrupt world. It is a poignant dissection of a society that dictates peoples action and response and allows no room to just be. Those who love it for its apparent 'humour' and cynical desriptives are entitled to do so but I think that readers need to awaken to the fact that there is something more profound here than just a discussion on superficiality.Maybe this is why Salinger no longer associates with the world."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is a good book and all. That Holden Caufield, he kills me. I swear to God he does. I mean, he's not a phony or anything. I hate phonies. I really do.(Okay - I know I'm not the first person to mimic the prose of Catcher in the Rye - but I couldn't help myself)This novel is considered a classic by many and clearly one of the most popular books of all time - in large part because it was groundbreaking and controversial in its day. But (and it's a pretty big but) it hasn't stood the test of time well. Its controversial elements are tame by today's standard and the novel itself feels hopelessly dated (not in a good way - like say \`The Great Gatsby' is dated by the Jazz era).The character of Holden Caufield may have connected with young people of a certain generation and class, but I couldn't relate to this story of the poor little rich kid struggling to find his way in the world. While Holden is not without his charms, for the most part he comes across whiny and self centered - the kind of kid who needs a good kick from behind.Salinger's first person prose has an authentic adolescent feel to it but over the duration of a novel the repetitive short choppy sentences can start to grate on your nerves.A lot of people consider Catcher in the Rye to be among the best novels ever written. There are an equal number of detractors who will tell you it is among the worst. I fall somewhere in the middle.Despite its dated feel and whiny central character, Catcher in the Rye is often entertaining and at times touching. Holden's relationship with his younger sister is the heart of the novel. It is through his sister that I came to care (at least a little) about Holden.Is this one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century? Not by a long shot, but it's worth a read if you weren't already forced to in high school."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Knowing he will soon be expelled from prep school, Holden Caufield decides to leave early. His next three days are spent in New York City where he dwells on his emotional problems and his cynicism toward life. This book is unlike any other I have had the chance to read. J.D. Salinger is able to write this book through the mind of a 16-year-old boy in 1945. What is unique about his writing is that I can relate to the character's feelings in 2001. Salinger is an extraordinary writer. I felt as though I was a cynical young man in lonely and bustling New York City. I feel his emotional problems that are induced by the recollection of his dead brother and the younger sister at home he misses and loves. This passage from the book shows the problems he had with the death of his brother, &quot;I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it.&quot; The way Holden describes it, he makes it sound like nothing, but you know that it is a serious problem. Laughter is inspired by Holden's description of his past roommates and there habits. Some whistle, some are slobs. No matter what Holdens emotions encompass, they are always easy for me to relate with. Salinger doesn't focus on imagery much, and little symbolism is used. Salinger uses figurative language to draw the reader into Holden's world. This is an excellent book for teenagers to read. In researching the book, I found that it has been pulled from the curriculum of several schools due to the language used in the book. The book was written in 1945 and uses several slang terms that would be heard in that decade. This is the only aspect of Salinger's writing that I found uninteresting. Terms like, &quot;chewing the fat,&quot; and &quot;sonuvabitch,&quot; are outdated and don't appeal to me. Due to the emotional content of this book, I feel anyone can relate to the problems of Holden Caufield. I enjoyed the book and I thank Mr. Salinger for writing it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am 54 years old and avoided reading this book for over forty years. So why did I relent?First, because my 15 year old had to read it in Lit class, and I wanted to have something to talk with him about. He hated it. Really, he did. My wife hated it too. That killed me. So I really HAD to read it now.Back in the 60's and 70's lots of conceited literati phonies kept saying how *Catcher in the Rye* was \\"The Great American Novel\\", \\"Salinger's literary triumph\\" and other such baloney. They said that. Really, they did.I ignored my *39-page rule* for two reasons----1. if my son actually had to had to read the whole thing so did I; and --2. I thought after 39 pages Salinger would turn it around. But no, he didn't. He really didn't. If you want to know the truth about it, I found *Catcher in the Rye*, wasn't all that those phonies cracked it up to be.I slogged through to the bitter end, all the while suffering as that conceited b-stard Holden Caulfield incessantly whined and complained about everyone and everything in the world. It depressed the hell out of me, it really did. The little rich boy should have been complaining about his laziness, absence of character, or inability to see the world and others beyond the range of his annoying petulant whine.It depressed me even more reading old Holden's monologue, spouting the word \`g-ddam' practically every 25 words. (That got old VERY quickly.) And at the end of the book, around page 200, he drags out the dreaded \`F' word. That must've made quite a stir back in 1945.Maybe *Catcher in the Rye* doesn't travel so well anymore because it's the 21st Century and all. The world is so much bigger now, and somebody saying \`g-ddam' every other sentence isn't so unique and different. Actually, it's rather tame for these times. Really, it is.Legend has it that after writing a few novels and getting so much attention for this book, old J. D. Salinger kind of disappeared. He dropped off the face of the earth. Really, he did. Maybe I'd kinda \`disappear' too if I wrote a book this dreadful and then it got all kinds of acclaim from those same phony literati scum-suckers that so disgusted my protagonist"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As a 10th grader, I was recently forced to read this book as part of my English Honors class. I was not very excited to, but that was when I had no idea what this book was about. I read it and it was great! Easy to read, it caught my attention, and is definitely one of my favorite books that I've read. I am now reading Pride and Prejudice, which is nowhere near as good as this because that story is much more difficult to read and has a far less interesting plot."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I am writing this entry after just receiving notice that the author of this book, J.D. Salinger, has just passed away at 91. I am living proof, although I am sure no alone on this account , that the teenage angst that preppie Holden Caulfield, the narrator of \\"Catcher In The Rye\\", was caught up in his immediate post-World War II generation was contagious all the way down at the bottom of society to housing project kids like me later on. Needless to say this high school assigned-reading was one of those books that I devoured at one sitting, if I recall correctly. But here is a better perspective on the book. Some books you read once and move on. Others you read, re-read and live out, including on a trip to New York a stay at the old Taft Hotel. How is that for having a more than a literary effect on the reader. Only Jack Kerouac's \\"On The Road\\" had more. So long, J.D."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye is quite simply an American classic. Its approach is unintentionally timeless, as Holden, and those he encounters, are as believable as characters come. I'm amazed that even in this digital age, college students can so easily relate to Holden's situation and the angst he feels towards the world. Everyone goes through it, and that is why so many people (of all ages) love this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"For years I resisted reading this book ... RE-reading it, that is. Although I had read it in high school and vaguely remember liking it, it carried tainted memories. It must have been about a year after I first read it that John Lennon was murdered. I soon came to associate this novel with Lennon's killer; for decades to come, this stigma remained an overwrite of any memory I had of the actual story.But I always knew I wanted to re-read it again someday, so..... finally giving in to my curiosity -- and because a friend was reading it -- I decided to do it.Although I must agree with the reviewer above who criticizes the irritating and distracting everythings \\"and all,\\" I'm glad to report that overall I enjoyed the novel greatly. Sure, it's dated, but that can be a good thing. It provides the reader with a real flavor of the time. The hunting cap amused me a bit (evoking a vision of Ignatius J. Reilly -- I wonder if there's a connection?). I found that the narrator, rather than speaking to us, seemed more to be keeping a running narrative in his HEAD, as if planning what he WOULD say to someone, should he have the chance to spill his guts. Talking to himself, in other words. With us inside his head. It's a device that works very well. Very immediate. Very easy reading.This story is very sad -- it's a firsthand look at a \\"different\\" boy who at the age of 16 finds himself confronted by emotional and mental challenges magnified by his adolesence. He seems to live in a world akin to that experienced by someone suffering from bipolar disorder. Or ADHD. Or Asperger's. Or schizophrenia. It's unclear. Regardless, his view on life is such that he is able to see important details others would never concern themselves with. He thinks outside the box and is too square to fit in the round hole. The emotions are real, daring, unexpected. The love he feels for others is the only thing that makes his life worth living. We conclude that he is indeed someone special.One other thought. I found the very brief epilogueish chapter to be almost an anticlimax. I would have preferred the story to end with the more mysterious and outcome-implied zoo scene in the chapter prior. The fact that a few more explanatory pages follows is unexpected and not really necessary, in my opinion.Overall this remains a very good novel, psychologically gripping, not quickly forgotten, very touching ...... but maybe just a tad overrated (and all)."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"God, i loved this book! the first time i read it, i was going thru a bad time myself, really low and depressed and i could really realate to holden. My favourite thing about the book is that all the characters are so REAL, they are not the flimsy shallow images you read in todays novels, Holden Caulfield is a real human being and i wouldn't be surprised to meet him one day.I loved the descriptions of the people at Pencey. Stradlater, \\"Ackley-kid\\" and his history teacher who read out his exam essay.The style of writing is beautiful too, really keeps you hooked on till the last page...So overall, i would say this was an amazing book, and if you are thinking of reading it, go ahead....you'll enjoy it for sure"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This was my favorite book from highschool reads, i like how it had a not sad ending. And had some funny moments,that were so true to life.Good short read, great price."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Catcher in the Rye was one of my favorite books. I read this book as a sophomore in high school and I absolutely loved it. I don't read books very often, but this one caught my eye. I think it was mainly because the main character, Holden Caulfield, is the narrator of the book and he is a teenager himself. He tells the story how a teenager would tell it, however, he does curse occasionally. The way he tells the story, and how he lives his life as a teenager really interested me and I think that's why I liked this book so much. So give it a shot, what do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is a first person narrative by J.D. Salinger. The point of view is through Holden Caulfield's eyes, a sixteen year old junior in high school. Holden has just been kicked out of his school, Pency Prep. for bad academic scores. He decides to leave before his parents find out he has been expelled and goes to New York City, where he grew up. The story is mostly set here, and this is where Holden goes through an internal conflict. He cannot decide whether he wants to retreat back to his childhood or interact with people as an adult, ie: have a sexual relationship. The story mainly tells of his interactions with others and the conflicts inside his mind. He cannot decide if he wants to interact with them as an adult or retreat from them like a child, calling the adult world \\"phony.\\" Holden changes a lot throughout the story, he cannot decide if he wants to become an adult or recede to childhood. He knows that on wednsday he will have to face his parents and become the same child again, yet for the moment he is free and having somewhat of an adventure. The story can be boring to some, however many will find it very interesting. I dont want to ruin the rest of the book for you, as if you have not read it already i encourage you to read this classic, wonderful book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The great irony of The Catcher in the Rye isn't that Holden is a hypocrite (which he is), it's that Salinger, using Holden as his voice, stresses the phoniness of his language -- &quot;old so-and-so,&quot; &quot;and all,&quot; &quot;knocks me out,&quot; &quot;kills me,&quot; &quot;gave me a bang,&quot; etc. -- as much as, say, Laurence Olivier hams his way through &quot;Hamlet.&quot; It's like Salinger is admitting his own phoniness through a guy who hates phonies, who himself has moments of phoniness. That's the joke. And it's funny. Yeah, it's cute to watch Holden give all those young kids his tips, since he's as clueless as they come about the world around him; or watch Holden admit, just a tad, when he's wrong. He's tremendously likeable to us (even if he must come off as a jerk to everyone in the book not privy to our insider information) because we see all his insecurities; it certainly has a therapeutic effect on the teenage mind that thinks he's all alone in the world, and Salinger mentions this near the end of the novel, of course.You could hardly say the book is profound in ideas -- the closest it comes is that bit about the suitcases -- but it is an important book, obviously, and a good one because, even if we're not in Holden's economic situation (and even if we're not growing up in the '40s and '50s), nearly everything he says stays relevant. (Well, maybe not the part about the frozen fish, but doesn't every teenage brain imagine leaving everyone behind and starting life anew?) All that's changed is the degree of cursing. (What's written on the wall that shocks Holden into anger is kinda funny, seen from today's perspective.) I haven't read Salinger's other stuff so I can't compare, but it strikes me as far too easy to criticize this book for its thin vocabulary -- Salinger lays it on so thick as to become comical and has Holden himself mention it once or twice, for chrissakes.One thing most of us are interested in when we read a novel or watch a movie (not Holden on the latter, I realize, though I wonder what he'd think about Brando in a few years) is to be planted in some other world. Here, the world is sparsely described to us, but it's neat to put yourself -- as I did -- in the shoes of someone of the time. Where words like &quot;flit&quot; were used; or where Holden says &quot;colored&quot; people, which is indicative of the times, and then goes and overcompensates by telling us a white musician could never be as good as a black one because she'd made a song too cute. I get a bit of a thrill when I read stuff like that, a little ahead of its time. Holden even has a reasonably modern view of &quot;flits&quot; for someone his age. (Maybe all that time around the &quot;gorgeous&quot; Stradlater influenced him...) I can't say the book changed my life, but I can see why it would make countless readers wish they could call up Salinger up on the phone whenever they felt like it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Have you ever thought to yourself : \\"I am in the mood to go shopping\\", and then by time you get to the mall, all of a sudden you find yourself thinking: \\"Why am I here? I really don't want to be, I'm just not in the mood.\\"I think this perfectly describes Holden Cuafield's life in the novel The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. During this book you are constantly introduced to things that Holden, the main character, wants to do but by time he gets there or does it he is already bored.Holden is also the most indecisive character I have ever read about. The great part about that is because it describes everyone perfectly, because everyone is indecisive when it comes to making decisions in life. Mostly because when you make a decision it affects your life forever and no one really enjoys it.The biggest reason why I liked this book so much is because Salinger allows you to get into the mind of Holden Caufield for a few days. Have you ever looked at someone sitting on a bench and thought to yourself \\"I wonder what they are thinking?\\". In this book you get to be in the mind of someone and know their deepest thoughts. Holden may have been indecisive but he is also human, so his actions in life are just like anyone else's. He was struggling with what he was going to do with his life which is what we all do at a young age.The only part about this book that I found disappointing was the end. I feel as if it wasn't complete because Salinger leaves the reader hanging. You never get to see what lies before Holden to understand what he does with the rest of his life. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, begins with Holden Caulfield, the narrator, while in psychiatric care remembering what happened to him last Christmas. He begins his story when he was a student at Pency Prep at the age of sixteen. Holden had been having a hard time at school and failed four classes causing him to become expelled from his fourth school. He struggled with school, because of his immaturity and lack of responsibility.Throughout the novel Holden puts himself in situations of self destruction. He allows himself to be bossed by another peer, he clearly stated to a teacher that he found what he learned a complete bore, and accepted his unfortunate fate without trying to improve his life and get back into school.Fed up with Pency Prep, Holden leaves early and decides to stay at some cheap hotel in New York City. There he finds his way into several night clubs and realizes how phony everything seems to him. He had strong feelings for wanting to escape as far away as the woods to live in a cabin with Sally Hayes, a girl he had feelings for.By the end of the story he tells Phoebe, his sister, that he will be leaving soon and this causes much grief for her, because all she wants is for her brother to get his life together. Holden begins to become more distraught and feels as if he were going to die. By the end we are left hanging with the curiosity of what happens next as he goes back to the present time ending with how he misses his peers from Pency Prep.I would recommend this book to anyone especially a teenager who could possibly have an easier time relating to the story. Holden's struggles were very interresting to follow, because at times they reminded me of how I have felt in the past, because of all the pressures I have in life. It was interresting to follow how he interpreted life and how difficult it was for him to be happy with himself. The ending was excellent, because it didn't leave a definite ending. On the other hand it allowed me to continue the story in my own mind according to how I came to understand it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This novel has so many great qualities. I don't know what it is but whenever I think Holden, I think of it as a reflection of myself. Obviously everyones favorite part of the novel is the middle, Holdens sexual exploration. the thing is though, that he's still a virgion by the time the book ends, it is his way of catching kids from falling out of the field of Rye, where Holden would dream of suddenly becomming Peter Pan and taking kids with him to neverland where you never had to grow up, which is that night of his exploration in New York he passes up several sexual oppertunitees.The novel was about ten to fifteen years ahead of it's time with Holden noticing societies flaws and urban decay, in which the film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; comes into mind. But that's another story. Several essays have been written on &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; and if you want to check them out then I suggest you look for &quot;Readings on 'That Catcher in the Rye'&quot; have fun!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"First of all, this has gotta be the funniest book i've ever read. I'm a sucker for sarcasm, and Holden is full of it. Second, this is also one of the most touching books I've ever read. The scene between Holden and Phoebe comes particularly to mind.This book has often been criticized for the hyper-critical temperment of it's protagonist. This is a shame, and an ironic one, since these reviewers entirely miss the point, like reading the gospels and poo-pooing the crucifixion without regard to the ressurection. True, Holden, due to his hightened sensitivity, is especially irritable and intolerant, forever chastizing people (though generally not to their faces, as he is an avowed coward; no less critical of himself than of others) for everything under the sun, and in particular, for being phony. But, the attentive reader will notice that after nearly all of these self-righteous tirades he reflects that the people are somehow not to blame for thier faults, which, ugly as they are, only end by inspiring his sympathy. It makes a profound point, namely, that the things most deserving and in the greatest need of our sympathy and compassion are, more often than not, the things least likely to inspire them (at least, at first glance). One of my favorite lines, to illustrate this point, is \\"'It's no fun being yellow'\\".This was my favorite book when i was younger (later supplanted by The Brothers Karamazov) and i must've read it at least four times. At one point Holden says that he likes books with a little humor in them, books that, when you finish them, make you wish you could sit down with the author and just shoot the bull for a little while. There's no one i'd rather shoot the bull with than J.D. Salinger. Let's hope that someday he'll see fit to publish the purported sixteen novels he's got locked up in his safe.Also recommended: Franny and Zooey"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Most people hate this book either because they think Holden is a whining spoiled brat or because they don't like the writing style. Well then, that's their preference... Allowing these things to annoy then shows they do not truly appreciate the profound meaning of the story. They are acting exactly like Holden: a shallow boy. The writing style is to provide realism; it is meant to get the reader depressed, to get the reader to see through Holden's eyes. But Salinger isn't restricted to writing in a depressed glum tone; he shows his literary ability with many of the other various believable characters, such as Phoebe. This book exemplifies the iceberg idea: you can only see the small peak of an iceberg but underneath the water is a mountain. With this book the words may seem like useless and boring rantings but there is an enormous amount of meaning lying beneath the words. If you are looking for a \\"fun\\" entertaining light book don't read this; this book is meant to be read not for its suspenseful plot (it has none) but it's universally profound meaning. This is a fantastic story about a boy desperately struggling to maturity, a boy learning about life. I encourage everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I just don't get the hype... Yes, I've read the whole thing (in h/s and in my adult life) but, for something that has been touted as one of the greatest novels ever written it sure is a tough read! And it's not that it was above my head, it was just plain old poorly written in my humble opinion. The grammar was beyond horrible. I think my 10 year old son could've done a better job.I wanted to like this, even love it because we've always been told about what a \\"classic\\" and \\"must read\\" it was... but, in the end, I was just miserable.Sorry, but, I know I can't be the only one to feel this way, right?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"If you are a teenager, read it. I mean it. Read \\"The Catcher in The Rye\\" now before you are too old to \\"read\\" it.As a high school student, not only did I enjoy reading this book, but I literally found my identical twin in this book; Holden Caulfield. Every single words he spitted hit my hearts as I was experiencing deja vu.I have long had so many questions that can not be, do not deserved to be, answered. Yet I do not like that answer, neither did Holden. Where do I go from here?Holden's short 3-day adventure partially pointed me out a way out and perhaps did throw out more questions on my face.This book is much more than Peter Pan Syndrome, antisocial behavior, and a \\"cynical adolescent\\".And Life is much more than schools, adults, and a sex.In a sea of neon, clocks are racing toward the mid-night, when will our souls be solaced?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I think I have it figured out. The real secret to writing a blockbuster piece of &quot;literature&quot; nowadays is to introduce a character that usually shows a bit of promise but ends up going nowhere (It's all society's fault. Again.). This character must bring forth complaints and problems to light that perhaps we may overlook in day to day life. But most importantly, and the truly key part...it must be eye-openingly offensive. You must assault the average readers senses, morality, and common sense. The better you accomplish this the more &quot;acclaim&quot; the book will get.Holden Caufield, filled to bursting with teen angst, gets kicked out of his prep school and decides to sort of meander back home over the course of 3 days just before Christmas. His insights during this journey are filled with cynical observations on phony people and the occasional zippy one-liner. What made the book get acclaim no doubt was it's examination of teen problems of the era, but notably it's heavy use of profanity. I've heard profanity in great quantities in my life, but there came a time when reading this that the whole thing just started to get a little overdone. Sort of like hearing Al Gore repeatedly say &quot;Lock Box&quot; during the presidential race in 2000.I'm not a violent person by nature, but I really wanted a few minutes in the ring with Holden after I had to put up with him for a few days. Save for Heathcliff in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; I cannot think of another literary character that needed a smackdown quite like this guy did. When push came to shove the stuff in this book really wasn't much different from listening to my gangsta-nephew describe how unfair life is to him because my sister won't get him an SUV for his birthday.The idea behind the book showed promise...the execution was terrible and disappointing...as I look back at those times when I was going through my teen years I will say that yes, they were turbulent and filled with feelings of powerlessness to affect my own choices and direction in life. One of the rites of passage into adulthood is to be able to look back at those years and realize that you weren't always right, and were all too often driven by impulse and hormones, and a good dose of confusion. Teen angst is nothing new and will probably be much the same 50 years from now.To those who are about to click on the &quot;This Review didn't help me at all&quot; button, I ask you to view this objectively...is there any real value to experiencing this book? Because hoisting the likes of Holden Caufield on your shoulders and moving forward under his inspiration will likely get you the same place he goes...nowhere."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I had to read this for school and I don't see why this is still such a beloved book. I can understand why it might have been popular when it first came out in an era where people strived for a \\"wholesome\\" atmosphere but now this book is just 200+ pages of garbage! There are several things wrong with this book.First of all, there is the repeated swearing. I'm not usually bothered by this. Stephen King uses quite a bit of cursing, for example, but his stories are still interesting. This book, however, swears so much that the book would probably be twice as short if you took them all out. Every other word seems to be \\"g-dd--n or a variation of it.There is also the repitition of the phrases \\"____kill(s) me\\" and \\"phony\\". Now, this wouldn't seem so bad at first. But believe me, you have NO IDEA how incredibly annoying that gets after a while. I actually started to cringe whenever those phrases were coming up, and I'm not exaggerating. Take out those two phrases plus the swearing, and this book is reduced to about 1/4 of it's actual size - maybe less.Next there is the movement of story. The Catcher in the Rye does not go anywhere! There are a few mildly interesting, new occurences here and there but the majority of the story is about the main character,Holden, getting kicked out of his 4th school and going away to New York before having to face his parents with another rejection. During his stay in New York and once he goes home, he does basically the same, average things every day and this book - from beginning to end - is just one huge pessimistic opinion about everyday life. The story ends much the same way it began with no elevation or climactic events anywhere in between. In other words, boring. I had to force myself to finish it.Finally, there is the never-ending and annoying whines of Holden himself. Halfway through this book I was pissed off and annoyed with Holden. All he does is whine and complain about every little thing around him. Not only is it incessive whining, it's rambling. He cannot simply state his dislike and reason for that dislike for something. He goes on and on about what he dislikes, why, the events that trigger it, what it reminds him of, and a million other things not even related to his topic. That is all this book really is - a load of complaints at absolutely everything including the harmless, meaningless things/people around him. This book does not so much give me an insight to a troubled teen's life so much as it makes me want to scream at him.There was one thing I did really like about this book. Salinger writes very well in first-person dialect. I felt as if Holden was actually talking to me in a casual conversation. It also allows the reader to figure out for themselves, why Holden acts the way he does through what he tells you and his actions. However, this conversational attitude towards it is vastly overshadowed by the swearing, lack of movement, and overall annoying-ness of Holden. Even if it is conversational, it doesn't matter much because the person having the \\"conversation\\" with you is someone you wouldn't WANT to talk to in the first place! The purpose of this book would've been much better if it had just been a short characterization story or maybe a psychological analysis, rather than trying to pass it off as a novel that will thoroughly hold interest. The Cather in the Rye created a disillusionment of society for people in the 1950's, thus the wide-spread interest. That disillusioned fascination has died down since then, and this book should too."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I'm an avid reader...been so since a young kid. Heck, I even taught English for a while. Just don't want you thinking I'm some 10-year old who doesn't give a damn about books.I was lent a copy of this book by a colleague at work, saying that it was a \\"classic\\" and something all kids in the US had to read (I'm English - moved here a little under 4 years ago - so was fortunately spared reading this arduously long and boring book at school). I figured my kids would someday read it, so I thought \\"What the heck, I'll give it a shot.\\"To say that it's the most insanely boring and pointless book I've ever read in my life would be an understatement. Aside from that, the style of writing is intensely annoying. Perhaps to give the \\"uninitiated\\" a taste of the style of this book, I'll try to imitate the part I found most annoying...\\"I was really bored with this goddam book. I really was. I know the girl who lent me the goddam thing meant well, but it bored me out of my mind. It really did. Forcing myself to read this brought me back to my school years, when I was forced to read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee. It was back in England, must've been the summer of '85. Man, it was hot. It really was. I remember thinking it had to have been as hot as in the story....\\"What does this show?1. The insane amount of pointless swearing that goes on in the book.2. The frustratingly annoying usage of the words \\"It really was.\\" or \\"He really did.\\" or \\"I really am.\\" as a pointless reinforcement of what had been stated previously. The only thing this \\"writing style\\" (and I use that term liberally) reminds me of is back in school when someone would try to pad out their essays or stories with what we called \\"waffle\\" - pointless repetition to bump up word count. Period.3. The author is so apt to digress from a point it's just not funny. He'll be in the middle of a conversation, take you into a 2-page retrospective on some randomly connected incident or memory and bring you back into the conversation expecting you to have your interest still maintained.Some reviews of this book dub the main character of Holden Caulfield as \\"whiny\\", and yes, he is to an extent. More annoying is the author's constant effort to prove a point by dubbing everyone that the character encounters as \\"phony\\".There is no plot, there is no story line...although I guess you could say the story line is \\"the day in the life of a manic depressive, borderline paranoid teenager who was just expelled from school again\\".No character is endearing, no anecdote or memory is interesting. It's just a seemingly endless pile of drivel that I was counting down the pages to finish.Do I want my kids to be forced to read this? A resounding \\"NO\\" is an understatement. Make them read the stylish writing of Shakespeare or the evocative and captivating writing of Harper Lee in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". Our kids have enough to deal with in this day and age...let's not burden them further by boring them to death. Inspire them, teach them, let them be creative, but forcing them to read this senseless drivel is nothing short of torture."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"As with the beginning of any good book, (whether fiction or other), you begin to familiarize yourself with the characters and start to search for the underlying plot or story, if it's not already known, and then as that story begins to unfold, you continue to read with great anticipation and expectation for some kind of climactic conclusion which brings meaning and understanding to all that has preceded it, constituting a comedy, a tragedy, a mystery, a success, a failure, a moral statement, etc., or some combination thereof. The Catcher in the Rye exhibits essentially none of these qualities and leaves the reader confused - feeling that he/she has failed to grasp some symbolic meaning behind the story (when, in fact, there is none)- and longing for closure.The whole story revolves around a two or three day period (staged around the 1940's-1950's) out of the life of Holden Caulfield, a cynical, pessimistic, negativistic, complaining teenager who doesn't have even the slightest sense of direction in his life. You quickly learn to dislike this disturbed youth and wish to counsel him, which would probably be as much of a waste of time as it was reading this book. How on earth this book has come to be known as a Classic I don't understand. There are so many good books in this world - don't waste your time with this bad one!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Story begins with Holden Caulfield's fourth dismissal from an all-boys prep school. From beginning to end he lacks direction yet in his own scrambled way he is searching for answers.Again and again he rambles on about how depressed and bored he is. Continuously complaining that he is surrounded by phonies; his banter goes off on tangents that never seem to lead him to any solutions. Holden reminded me of a teenager with Attention Deficit Disorder who when given solutions couldn't seem to process them.The redeeming part of this book was Holden's relationship with his sister Phoebe. Younger than Holden, she seemed to have more direction and sense than he has ever had. I liked his affectionate name for her, \\"old Phoebe\\". The tie in to the title was an interesting aspect of Holden's personality. In his dreams he saw himself as standing guard on the edge of a field of rye, catching all the children who were about to fall over the edge. Similar to his outlook in life where he seemed to protect those that were in need.I know to some this book brings back fond memories of days long past, and a coming of age story that has lasted throughout the decades, but I don't see what the cult like fascination with it is.

Definitely not the page turner or gripping until the last page that I expected :/The main character just seemed like a driveling ungrateful brat... maybe I have to be a teenage boy to get it?"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I recently had the opportunity to read The Catcher in the Rye. For years I had heard it was a CLASSIC. What a joke. The only thing that kept me reading was the HOPE that it somehow would get better, sadly it NEVER did. This book can best be described as an exercise in INANE DRIVEL. When they say it is written from the perspective of a young man they were right. A SELF ABSORBED, OUT OF TOUCH JUVENILE. This would be best described as a lengthy BOOK REPORT written by someone who thought the world should revolve around him. How this became an American Classic BLOWS MY MIND!. Moby Dick YES, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn YES. The Catcher in the RYE. ABSOLUTELY NOT. If you want to plod through hundreds of pages of adolescent blather, and you've got plenty of time on your hands to waste this is the book for you. If you want a truncated version, go spend a half hour in a High School cafeteria listening to some 17 year old's cry about how life isn't fair. The Catcher in the Rye, in my opinion, is an ABSOLUTE JOKE. I try and read one or two classics a year, sadly I wasted my time with this pretender."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I first read The Catcher in the Rye in 10th grade, and immediately fell in love with the voice of Holden. The style flowed easily, and the author quickly painted a perfect picture of the character by using the language that had no holds barred. It is because of this language that I have to agree with a reveiwer who said &quot;Salinger is subtle, and yet wonderfully blunt&quot;.I was also impressed with how the author developed his character, and never strayed from the foundations he a laid. Not once did Holden seem unlike Holden.The Catcher in the Rye is a classic. Salinger so perfectly put himself into the shoes of an angry and depressed teen that it's almost impossible to think that anyone but Holden actually penned the novel. It is also no wonder that this novel has become required reading in many schools, irregardless of the complaints from parents not approving of the language the author has chosen.I have never regretted having been forced into the reading of this book in high school. In fact, I have a new found respect for any schoo lthat reequires it's reading. It was nice for me to have been able to read a novel that proved I wasn't alone. Not to mention that it forced the my whole english class to talk and think. What a marvel."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This story is about teen angst and don't be caught thinking this is some book for killers or conspiracy theorists. This is a book about a fifteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield. His narration and his wry explanations are so real its almost like you are reading a diary of his or his thoughts and not a book written by Salinger. He does such a fantastic job of setting up his character and the way he looks at the world that you almost have to believe Salinger stole this or wrote this when he was fifteen. An amazing story that takes you through Holden's life and how he looks at it. No longer is he the simple happy go lucky person he used to be. Now he can see the world through his own eyes. And it isn't all flowers and rainbows. No it's harsh and different. Read this book if you are 13-18. You might not get the full gist of this book if you haven't read it before, and you are 40 years or older."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"My impression of the book was that it was well-written but many of the ideas and concepts were very dated. Supposedly there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this book because of the deviant nature of the main character. Judged by today's standards....the violence in the movies and video games are much worse."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book is definitely not for everyone. If you're looking for a classic novel to read simply for the sake of saying &quot;I've read it&quot; stop right now. Pick up something else. Not only would Holden be embarrassed for you, but more than likely you won't be able to appreciate this work for what it's worth.&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is manna from literary heaven for those who appreciate the written word. The story, in and of itself, in unremarkable: fifteen-year-old Holden Caulfield journeys from his private school to his New York home. Essentially, that's the plot. However, the 200 pages are wrought with detail and oozing with narrative voice.Holden can be wry; Holden can be surprisingly deep; Holden is at times appallingly cynical; most of all, Holden is real. By the time you've finished reading, you'll know Holden better than any other character you've experienced.I iterate: the plot is not remarkable. It's an experience that could easily be encountered by most anyone. In fact, the writing is so amazingly clear and descriptive that you just might come off feeling like it actually happened to you.If you love to read, then this book is for you. I guarantee you'll finish it in an afternoon. If you're unsure whether or not you'll be able to appreciate this, a similar narrative piece with a deeper plot is &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky. If you read and enjoyed &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, I highly recommend any other of Salinger's books, specifically &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; or &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; by John Knowles."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read the book The Catcher in the Rye a few months ago for extra credit at school. It is an extraordinary book and I'd recommend it to anyone. Another good book that is similar but a little more modern would be &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; by stephen chbosky. If you liked the Catcher in the Rye you will most likely like this book."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is a fantastically written novel. Any teen would love this book because it is written using language and thoughts they would understand and have. Once you get into the book, you can't stop reading. I even found myself thinking about situations from the book while I wasn't reading it. Already being a classic, I'd recommend this book to anyone who isn't too uptight or snobby, because they might have problems dealing with the use of some sarcastic, blunt words. 5 stars, buy it today."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"the Catcher in The Rye. i don't really know exactly what to say about this book. i picked it up for the first time in about the sixth grade and i've read it about four times since then. although i don't relate to Holden, the main character, as well as i used to, this book is a worth while read for anyone. you will fall in love with Holden, and feel good to recognize the underlying compassion he has under all that cynisism. i'm not going to write a synopsis because i'm sure you've read about a hundred of them already, but i tell you, read this book. i'm not a very big ready whatsoever, but i could not put this down. it offers a glimpse into the mind of a teenager in the fifties, who doesn't sound very different from a teen today. you will be moved, thats an order. give this one a try."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"We had to read this for a school assignment, but luckily I had the chance to read it before we had to tear it apart word for word in class. I just couldn't put it down. What people do wrong when they read this book is that they label Holden's way of thinking as taboo, and begin to think of him as mentally ill or severely depressed. This book is not for everyone, because many do not understand what Salinger is trying to get across. But if you think you are open-minded, give it a try. I personally found this an amazing book that lays out the truth about the people of the world even when some people don't want to see or admit it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"I read this book for school, but i'm definitely glad this is the book they assigned us to read. It was absolutely amazing! As a 16 year old, I can personally say I relate to some of the things Holden has to say. The way he expresses what he feels, and the language he uses, are highly amusing, in my opinion. I thinkmany teenagers will find themselves interested in this book because many of the problems Holden has to go through, are things teenagers have to go through nowadays as well. All in all, this book is simply fantastic, and I recomend anyone who hasn't read it to goread it this instant!!"},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"Despite a weak plot, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a wonderful book about a brilliant, yet cynical, teenage boy. Following the course of a few days, the book uses several symbols in the form of common objects to stand for major values in life. Modern literature at its finest."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"i find it amusing that those who give it so few stars do not get the essence of the book, that of what it is like to be shown the ugliness of the world, the loss of innocence. its not a book about teenage angst or rebellion, if it was then why would it be required reading for so many years? it has carried such a literary torch because it can easily be translated into any era or generation, untill a utopian society is formed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"when i started this book i wasn't sure if i was going to finish it but as i continued reading it, i quickly learned how interesting it was. you can not only have your own opinion on what is really going on in this book but you can learn a lesson from it."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This review is going to come of as arrogant and elitist but it has to be said so here goes. This novel has created, in my experience, only two general responses: why is this a classic or wow. The later response has always disturbed me as an adamant fan of the Catcher in the Rye. However, I believe that this difference of opinion stems from the trouble some readers have empathizing with Holden. This is not to say that due to this their opinions are invalid but instead, I believe, it points out something at the novel's core. Holden is not some sort of man of the people or every-man; instead, he is something more narrow. When someone cannot understand the perspective offered by Salinger, they often miss the point of the novel because they do not understand Holden, just like most of the people Holden himself meets throughout the story. If these statements seem incredibly evasive, as to what Holden is, then I will be happy with my review. Essentially, I believe that this novel and its characters should be left to there elusive ways and then and only then can we as readers reify the ubiquitous ideals and emotions that make up this masterpiece."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"A great book about a few days in the life of a cynical teenager. Instead of accepting everything around him and &quot;going with the flow,&quot; as so many people do these days, Holden Caulfield chooses to judge everyone and label everything he dislikes as phony. This book made me think a great deal about how I look at other people--people I disagree with and prefer to avoid, and makes me wonder if I am like Holden in some ways. Be warned, though, this book uses a mass of profanity."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GOUNG BOY NAMED HOLDEN CAULFIELD AND HIS LIFE DURING HIS TEEN AGE YEARS. IT TALKS ABOUT HIS MANY ATTEMPS AT HAVING ... AND GETTING GIRLD. HLDE GOES TO A PREP SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT IS BEING KICKED OUT BECAUSE OF BAD GRADES. HE EVENTUALLY RUNS AWAY BEFORE HE CAN BE KICKED OUT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HIS ROOM MATE DOES. HE END UP IN NEW YORK IN A HOLTEL. FROM THERE THINGS REALLY TAKE OFF.I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT. IT DOES A GREAT JOB OF SHOWING WHAT A TEEN AGE BOY GOES THROUGH AS HE IS GROWING UP. THERE IS SOME SLIGHT CURSING IN THE BOOK SO I DON'T RECAMEND IT AS A BED TIME STORY FOR KIDS. IF YOU WANT LAUGHS AND A BOOK YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO PUT DOWN THAN PICK UP A CATCHER IN THE RYE."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This book had a toughness to it when I first read it. Like many teenagers, it &quot;spoke to me&quot;.I'm a long way from being a teenager these days, but I've discovered something - teenagers are basically the same. They still swear they're parents don't understand them. They still are amazed at what they perceive as the &quot;phoniness&quot; of the world around them. Holden &quot;speaks&quot; to many people who feel they don't have an important voice in the world.The amazing thing about this book, though, is simply that so many people have read it. More than 1500 reviews are posted here. That is a lot of opinions!So, does it matter if someone thinks this book is terrible or terrific? Personally, I think it's amazing that so many have read, and had an opinion, on such a landmark book.Love it or lump it, people have been discussing Holden Scofield for more than 50 years. He shows no sign of slowing down or growing up.May we still be discussing him in 2051."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"You'll see this book come up over and over again on the highly recommended list of &quot;classics&quot;. Not having heard much about it (thats surprising, I know), I decided to read it because again, it ALWAYS seems to show up on list after list of debated over, recommended classics. It's rated among the best, mostly older novels, which are usually deeper and take more effort to understand, what many people think of when they think &quot;classic&quot;. This book is different. It's a lighter read that really made me smile. At different times throughout the novel, I guarantee you will see at least SOME of yourself in Holden.The Catcher in the Rye is written in casual languauge, and uses slang. Several times throughout the book I almost forgot I was reading a book in the first place! It's very easy to understand, which makes it more enjoyable in my opinion because you won't find yourself struggling to understand anything, allowing you to enjoy the content. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I've read books that are more powerful than this, but that certainly doesn't mean that this one isn't very good!The only problem is, if you haven't already read this book, you've probably read several like it.. books about teens growing and maturing, changing and learning lessons. I've noticed it's become quite a popular topic in the last decade. Most of the newer ones are just plain trashy, shallow, and most are identical in plot and style. I assure you A Catcher in the Rye will be much better. While reading it, it's helpful to keep in mind that this was the breakthrough book in this genre, one of the very first, if not the first.It's very good overall, and a classic at that (much different from other &quot;classics&quot;). You have nothing to lose from reading this book. It's not a difficult read, it's not long, and you'll smile at least a few times:) I highly suggest reading this book, and adding it to your personal library."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"This has got to be one of the most thought provoking books ever. Basically, it's about Holden Caulfield, who is expelled from school and goes on an eye-opening odyssey through New York over the weekend. However, the book goes much deeper than that story. His obsevations on parts of his life convince him to try to save people who are beginning to sucumb to society's corruption, and he becomes the catcher in the rye, determined to save as many people as he can. This quest gradually drives him insane, and we get numerous hints that he is narrating from a mental institution. It all comes together to make the reader question what his role in life is. Read The Catcher in the Rye. You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"It's the second most STOLEN book in the world. (First being the Bible, which ain't so bad neither :OP) If you buy this book, you'll know why. Mark Twain once said, that a classic is a name for a book which everyone praises but no one reads. This, on the complete other end of the spectrum, is a book for the human being, not for the bookworm or the bored. It is not a book souly for people who like to read, either. It is quite possibly the most accessable novel ever written. You WILL identify with these characters, you WILL, maybe for the first time, like to read. Please read this book, it is for everyone who has ever felt alone."},{"Title":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. Hilarious and poignant. It is everything that an excellent book should be. Those who haven't read it - are missing out on one of the best books of the century."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"I love this book. I wish something like this was in print when my mother was dealing with her alcohol and drug addictions. Not to discredit Dr. Babbit's field of psychology, but I am usually skeptical of psychology theories defining my behavior. The personal accounts in Dr. Babbit's fortify her method of healing and put the reader at ease. Any reader will know they are in good hands when they read this book."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"In a nutshell, this book was one of the elements that SAVED MY SON'S LIFE!! If I hadn't read about the stages of addiction (easily described and organized within the book for quick intervention)I wouldn't have realized how serious a situation he was in already. There he was, crashing through the wall to the final stage (despair/suicidal)of addiction and, because he had woven such a web of chaos (balls in the air for me to keep busy catching)I was totally missing the desperate truth, that he was going to die if he wasn't stopped! If I hadn't reacted quickly I truly know he would not be here today.Babbit describes the ways addicts and abusers foil our best efforts to find out what they're up to. Our kids are experts at manipulation, and will go to great lengths to \\"protect\\" their addictions. They distract us from our instincts, avoid our attention, and unfortunately can plummet downward in a deathly spiral, under our very noses. Babbit describes ALL THE POPULAR DRUGS, the corresponding paraphernalia that can identify each one's use, and the symptoms displayed by someone using them. YOU WILL BE SHOCKED as you read the myriad of ways our children have found to get high! Have you ever grabbed a can of whipped cream out of the fridge only to find it's gone flat?? (they \\"huff\\" the gas out of the can!)...some even unscrew the gas cap and huff gas fumes right out of your car (keep a locking cap on yours!)Nikki Babbit's well written, non-judgemental book is an ESSENTIAL primer for Parents of substance and alcohol abusing teenagers!! This is NO-NONSENSE, \\"IN YOUR FACE\\" information, effectively organized for quick reference to deal with your individual situation (stage of chaos) quickly! I am ordering several copies now to distribute to those is immediate need, and to display while speaking at parent's groups/community outreach, etc. Sometimes the despair and pain we parents go through is best channeled back into the world by sharing a story or insight or knowledge. Once you've \\"interrupted\\" their progression and gotten them help, your kids basically have a long process to recovery and have to work their programs on their own. If parents then try to channel their pain and worry back into community involvement it helps keep you a little more sane and helps the effort to reduce the distribution of drugs. God bless, and good luck to you!"},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"This book will provide a lifeline to parents struggling with children who they suspect, or in fact are, abusing drugs or alcohol. It provides a lot of useful information on resources and approaches for help but most importantly speaks from the author's years of experience working with youth and families involved in drug abuse. The personal stories are very helpful. This book doesn't point the finger at parents but provides instead some very practical help. If you have found out your child is abusing drugs,read this book first before any others-it will definitely get one moving in the right direction to get further help. I would recommed this book to all parents as its principles apply to other struggles parents encounter with teens and none of us are immune to our children getting in trouble with drugs."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"This book is replete with good quality advice and information, The short personal anecdotes compliment the central narrative convincingly, rather than as mere literary frills. It deals with the problem from both the drug user's perspective and importantly also from that of the family. Often overlooked in the whole troubling saga is the need for the family to continue functioning even without the presence of the drug abuser. The book is strong in this area and many parents will nod their heads in agreement with its points. All in all a very useful guide."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"I can't say enough for this book! It was clear, easy reading that helped me to understand what it means to be an addict. I have recommended it to other family members who are dealing with just this problem. It has been hard watching them struggle with this problem. I truly believe that they can begin to empower themselves and help their addicted adolescent if they read this book. I think that they could eliminate a lot of the misery that they go through by learning about their son/daughter's addiction and how it effects all family members. I learned about the role I play as an extended family member and how not to be an enabler. I recommend this book not only to parents, but to grandparents, aunts, and uncles. This is the most important book they will read to learn how not to enable their loved one to continue their addiction. The resources are valuable to those who don't know where to turn for help in dealing with addiction. The author, Nikki Babbit, not only has professional experience and training in working with adolescence and families; she, also, is the mother of a recovering son. I would highly recommend this book to all parents, not just those who are dealing with a teenage addict, because it will help you to be aware of and spot the signs of drug abuse before it becomes a problem in your family. Like the book says, it can happen in any family. Once again, BUY and READ this book! You will be thankful you did."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"Dr. Babbit's book for parents with children who have a problem with alcohol and drugs is accessible and comprehensive, covering the disease concept of addiction, nature of assessments and treatment for children, and tools for personal recovery for parents. The book's appendices provide an excellent overview of descriptions of drugs and their effects, along with a guide on resources for further reading. Babbit brings to life this roller coaster ride parents experience from having children who abuse alcohol and drugs by providing the voices of parents who have gone through it. Information is always essential for recovery, but the private hell parents experience often entails isolation, guilt, and despair. And there is nothing more powerful than identifying with others who have rode that same roller coaster-a crucial step for parents' own recovery in gaining the awareness that they are not alone with and not unique in their feelings. But why this book is a must for parents with or without children abusing alcohol/drugs is Babbit's insistence on parents taking care of themselves. This recurrent theme of taking care of yourself at the end of each chapter is the constant reminder needed to parents that getting off the seemingly unstoppable, uncontrollable roller coaster is possible. Babbit's book is empowering to and breaths hope for parents in knowing a new freedom and a new happiness."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"I have recommended this book to parents in our school system that I know need it. The problem is the kids continue to manipulate them and lie about their drug use. This book is a life saver! It takes you through the initial assessment of the problem, to teaching you how to live with it. It is easily readable and so much of it applied directly to our situation."},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","review":"This book should be back in print, it addresses all of the issues of an adolescent addict."},{"Title":"Elements of Hebrew by an inductive method","review":"The contents of this reprint are actually Elements of Hebrew by an Inductive Method by Rainey, not Elements of Hebrew SYNTAX by an Inductive Method by Rainey.

Perhaps I am missing something in the translation from the Danish, but I could not complete this book because its major character irritated me more and more with each turned page. Maybe this will be one of those rare stories that do better in film"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. I thought \\"What a wonderful, fresh piece of writing!\\"But then something happened when I came to the middle and I completely lost interest, so much so that I found myself skipping big chunks of it just to get to the end. Even the end I couldn't digest properly.Perhaps I just didn't like the setting on the ship. Perhaps because it started to get too wordy. Don't know."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I haven't read the book yet but I did manage to watch the movie that was made for Bravo! It was VERY good and was very well portrayed. I often times am dissapointed with movies that don't come close to the book (it's difficult to include all the nuances) but if the book is anything like the movie, and my guess is that it's even better, then I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Oh, how I wanted to really love this book...and after 18 years in Michigan, 5 in Caribou, Maine, and 4 in Colorado, I think I've seen enough different kinds of snow to give Smilla a run for her money. BUT. She makes Holden Caufield sound like a cheerleader with &quot;Up With People&quot;, and the underlying plot would make Chris Carter blush. (In fact, the Grand Guignol finale seems strangely similar to the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Ice&quot;....)The evocation of nature is weak in the extreme (has Hoeg ever **really** been in the snow??), Smilla needs a s***** job and a 30-year mortgage if she wants something to bitch about, and the &quot;Mechanic&quot; may as well be named &quot;Mr. Plot Device&quot;. The writing is &quot;literary&quot; as in &quot;self-conscious to the point of pretentious&quot;, but I will assume some of that is due to the translation. Obviously some readers are entranced by a strong-willed heroine, but Smilla gets old REAL fast - her motivation is obscure at best, and most of the time she seems to behave contrarily just for the sheer piss-and-vinegar of it. Better books with similar themes: Literary mystery: Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; Arctic horror: Lovecraft's &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; Strong-willed female detective: Any PBS &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; episode Life in the snow: Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; or Solzhetisyn's &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; If I give the book a &quot;5&quot;, the film gets a &quot;4&quot;, but only because of the beautiful cinematography: the plot is reduced to incoherence, and the ending requires a total suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"What's all the fuss all about? This is one of the most boring books I ever couldn't finish. The only thing going for it is a catchy title."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I never bothered to read the middle. The ending was ridiculous and dumb; it was also depressing and made me wonder why we couldn't have a happier ending after the heroine had improbably survived several violent episodes. The beginning sounded too much like a sex and shopping novel, and the sex described sounded anatomically impossible. Too bad, because it might have been an interesting book if it had been less trendy and less materialistic.I am once again thankful that I check out the endings to see if the book is worth reading. I find that a good book is still good when I know whodunnit or what happens."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I see Mr.Hoeg rather vividly as a brooding northerner who could benefit from a lot more sunshine and a smile or two. He treasures his intellectual insights too much and would be very displeased if someone calls them halfbaked. To edit his prose for Peter Hoeg is like carving his own live body with a knife. Clarity and restraint are not among his virtues.His earlier work, pretentiously named The History Of Danish Dreams was published in English after Smilla's success and confirmed my suspicions.It seems that Mr.Hoeg was disappointed with the public's reaction to that masterpiece and infuriated that someone may like his work less than he does. It's a fact that any writer sees in his book the merits of far grander scale than these accesible to a reader. To evaluate the result the reasonable writer makes that adjustment rather routinely but that's not the case with Peter Hoeg - he is so preoccupied with his Intellectualism and Eloquence.Writing Smilla he planned to give public what it wants. Peter Hoeg is rather sarcastic to the requirements of commercially successful fiction. That's why well into last hundreds pages the plot looks more and more like a parody - who can take seriously that stupid asteroid!Smilla is Mr.Hoeg himself. He is so self-centered that in his next novel - Borderliners - the writer did not bother to give a different name to his new incarnation - the main character is called Peter Hoeg, plain and simple.Ms. Smilla is a socially awkward type, she is a specialist in something of a very limited interest - the structure of snow. Bored with herself, exhausted by these incessant flashbacks, Smilla seeks adventure. Just like her erudite creator, who made a decision to venture in the unfamiliar terrain of mass literature, Smilla goes on a quest that must stop the buzzing in her head and make something happen.There are the key ingredients of mass literature - the action, the mystery, the exotic. Smilla is a potentially reach heiress, The Mechanic is a former Special Forces hunk - the central figure in 75% of mass market fare. There are corrupt cops, money-crazed villains and quite a few good people, who helped the dark forces unwittingly and now are eager to repent.The gloomy streets of northern city see killings, blackmail and burning alive. Then the ship sails on to the imminent showdown.All that is watered down by brooding, flashbacks, ethnography.Is it a &quot;serious&quot; literature or a thriller? None of these.I do not think that thriller consumers are happy with the knowledge that there are 673 words for snow in the Innuit language and other equally captivating bits of information. And the serious reader will find a lot of happenings and characters ridiculous.I was lured by a promising title, read the whole book, that looked for the first third like the literature I normally like, but well into the last hundred pages my appreciation turned to contempt and I was totally devastated by the ultimately stupid finale."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"While I have to admit that this book was very gripping in some ways, I was pretty irritated by the time I was done reading it, for the following reasons:1. The later chapters are unnecessarily and unpleasantly violent.2. The story is told in a somewhat circular fashion; facts are laid out in a non-linear sequence and stories are started, hinted at and returned to. Many authors use this device to make their narratives more \\"feminine,\\" and sometimes this works really well; for example, Jeffrey Eugenides does a quite good job of this in Middlesex (and tells you that he's doing it). In this book, though, it felt forced and stilted; every chapter starts by hinting at its main action, then winds off in a different direction before returning. It reads as if the author was thinking linearly and had a formula for turning this into a more circular story.3. There's very little that's human about the main character. She's supposed to be cold and mysterious; I found her trite and irritating. Especially when she talked about math (I like math, so I expected to find this part of her character interesting rather than off-putting). Smilla is more like a man's fantasy of an alluring, distant woman than an actual human woman."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Contary to most people's opinion, I truly did not like this book. Sure, it was ok (I'm trying to go easy and be nice), but it lacked any real suspense - I did not feel a single twinge of suspense while reading this book, not to mention the strange coldness of Smilla, yet at SOME moments she seems to almost be human (with emotion). I have no idea why it is a ny times bestseller, but I supposed there haven't been any good books in the past 10 years so this was the best they could come up with (pretty sad, actually). The story was alright, but the ending I'm still &quot;ehh&quot; about. It makes sense (I think?) and I'd like to comment on the ending, but to do that I'd have to give away the ending of the book, which wouldn't be too fair of me. Overall, a tolerable story (in periods of ten minutes per day) with an extremely disappointing ending and strange characters. My suggestion would be to head down to your local bookstore and sip some coffee while reading the book so that you won't have to buy the book (that is if your bookstore has a cafe inside)."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla's seems to be the only person who realizes that the death of a young boy is not an accident, and she persues the truth relentlessly, and I mean relentlessly, until she uncovers a vast conspiracy. In the meanwhile, she gets bruised and banged up, nearly dies several times, and has the weirdest sex I have ever heard of. (Don't get the wrong idea, there's nothing particularly titillating in \\"Smilla' Sense of Snow.\\")I gave this book 2 stars because I like intelligent protagonists. Other than that, I thought it was way too long and I had a hard time keeping all the bad guys straight. Plus, I like mysteries where the reader has a least some small chance of figuring out what's behind it all, and with \\"Smilla\\" I had little to go on. My advice: say \\"no\\" to \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow.\\""},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"For someone who doesn't normally read fiction, I was impressed by this book, which is most noteworthy for the interesting life insights offered by the main character, Smilla. I can see how someone might get frozen in the heavy technical language and &quot;iceology,&quot; but it's a small price to pay for a perspective that is fresh and creamily Danish. The translation is obviously masterful, but a little more editiing might have been good for Hoeg's sales.

Her profound alienation, her deep understanding of science and the subtle way she uses it to interpret her world are all stunningly achieved. Hoeg's earlier book, Borderliners, is less satisfying. But if you liked Smilla don't miss Mating, by Norman Rush"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"(256 pages in my 1993 PB Dell Edition, although already by p. 161 it starts to go gently downhill), and you'll feel your time was well invested.From then onwards, ... .The plot is summarized too many times, in this page's \\"Editorial Reviews\\", and by fellow reviewers, for me to repeat it here.I was utterly fascinated by all the snow and ice lore contained in the book, even after it starts turning sour. Thus, I don't regret having read it. But:1) The plot, as it develops, is both ill-thought out and absurd, both as a mystery/thriller, as biological extrapolation, and as a hint of unknown phenomena. If you want speculations about the cosmos, read \\"hard\\" SF. Also, the narration's unfolding is jarring: characters are needlessly developed and then abruptly disappear from the story; two reappear (one so implausibly as to totally defy any common sense) at the end.2) I can't bear spoiled brats (even if 37 years old) like insufferable quasi-midget superwoman Smilla, who can do everything, has read everything, but can't get over her emigration from Greenland to Denmark when she was twelve, and the taunts the Danish teenagers subjected her to (she's half Inuit, and dark). Gosh, how many people emigrated and were uprooted and discriminated against, but got over it, and more importantly dindn't make life miserable for their guiltless fathers in order to seek an outlet for their frustrations?3) Smilla (and also Hoeg) want to dazzle the reader with their erudition. Every situation is interlaced with philosophico-mathematical ruminations totally unrelated to what's happening: for example, in pp. 114/115, to explain to a perhaps future lover, who's cooking a delicious dinner for them, why she's afraid to go to jail, Smilla launches herself into a page-long dissertation about the number system, luckily stopping at the complex (what if she had gone on to the hyperreals and ... ?). This fake profundity may impress some readers in the short term, but to me, 468 pages of it were very irritating (somewhat akin to reading Lacan's disgressions on his \\"discovery\\" that for example [(-1) exp ] equals the male organ), although everything she says in those 2 pages is correct and makes sense, suggesting that Hoeg in this particular case knows what he's writing about.But in p. 458/59, entering a cave full of stalactites and stalagmites, she describes a series of scientific papers on details of their formation, ending with a fictitious one she coauthored, which \\"demonstrates\\" (with an absolutely unnecessary formula, obviously inserted to impress the laymen with demeaning and dishonest showmanship) how to calculate ... the mass of a cylinder! If anyone in the real world tried to publish anything containing such obvious nonsense (ie: the derivation of an elementary formula known for more than 2,000 years) anywhere except in a high school textbook, she would be laughed-at to death, totally discredited as a scientist/expert, and kicked out of any institution. So here Hoeg doesn't know what he's writing about, or didn't interpret what his advisors told him. And if here, why not elsewhere in the book, the fascinating snow and ice lore included?So, unless you're real keen about those two materials -or empathize with Larsson's Salander character, who is however mercifully not prone to unwarranted metaphysical speculation-, don't buy, on pain of coming down with a severe case of Smilla (and Hoeg) dislikitis."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It's amazing, or shocking I suppose, that this book could be compared to the works of Melville and Conrad. It begins well enough, and the first section, the City, is fine; but the next two are extremely disappointing. My greatest problem with the book, though, are the author's pretensions to greatness. Each time Smilla finds herself in a new situation, she first recounts a &quot;poignant&quot; parable/incident from her past that oh-so-perfectly casts a philosophical light on the new situation. Hoeg also has the habit of ending every third or fourth paragraph with a &quot;deep thought&quot;; at the beginning it works, but about 150 pages in, Smilla's character is sublimated beneath an avalanche of &quot;deep thoughts&quot;. One cannot help but notice that she is not a convincing character; rather, she is a vessel for the author's pretentious musings, a block of ice to be sculpted into the image of Hoeg, the Thinker, a Writer to Be Admired. The pretentiousness is even more apparent in the ineffective and pointless occasions when events are rendered non-chronologically. Do not read this book; it only barely edifies and does not entertain."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"A friend and I often swap books we thought were superb. We've swapped John Fowles, Jim Thompson, Dornford Yates, and many others.It was with excitement that I started this book, and I enjoyed the first 100 pages. But then it seemed to me that the author got bogged down in what he wanted to write. The second half of the book - The Sea, and then The Ice, was disjointed and tedious. The end was pathetic.In conclusion, the book starts well, but ends badly. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg displays some original insights during the reflective moments of this novel, however, this is neither a 'thriller' nor is it purposeful. As is often the case with poor storytellers, you never get a feel for where this story is going, and that alone makes for evenings of masochism with this book. I rate this as the worst book I read in 1997; Joseph Heller's 'Something Happened' was a close second"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book because I liked the movie with Julia Ormond and wanted to read the source.

Interesting stuff."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is one of those multiculti books for diverse author reading lists and I say hip, hip, hooray! Hoeg may not be a Greenlander, and his Smilla-delivered Greenland info may be occasionally inaccurate and overromanticized, but that's what happens to us mixed kids when we're out of one element for too long!

It's an incredibly profound novel, pivotong on intriguiging characters, a very clever plot, fast and witty dialogue. A double cheer for the heroine too, a woman with dark depths and a thought-provoking perspective on Europeans (from me, a European). This book has a great many layers and is wonderfully written. A great read - I practically gulped it down!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla's Sense of Snow is an intelligent and fast-paced mystery. Although the many subplots and diversions are all ultimately tied to the main plot, they are, at times, quite confusing.I thought the character of Smilla Jasperson was quite well-drawn, although she sometimes accomplished physical feats the seemed impossible. I didn't particularly like Smilla, but I did find her both memorable and unique. Sadly, the character of the mechanic, who was quite fascinating, was terribly sketchy. In my opinion, this book would have benifitted greatly had the mechanic been more fully fleshed-out.Personally, I enjoyed reading all the details of the snow and ice, but there were so many of them I think some readers were no doubt bored with it all and probably began skimming over them. This would have been a mistake because, to some extent, it was necessary to understand these details in order to understand the book.I've noticed that many readers had problems with the ending of this book. I didn't. I thought the ending fit the story perfectly. It was quite complicated and would have been confusing to anyone who wasn't following the story carefuly, but it was perfect.For me, the most annoying thing about this book was the translation. I found many words used out of context and worse, meaningless phrases and sentence fragments thrown in here and there. It was quite annoying. The author is such a skilled and intelligent writer, I can't believe this was done deliberately in the original Danish.If you like classy, intelligent thrillers and are willing to absorb a wealth of detail, you're sure to love this book. Readers looking for something light and relaxing should probably skip this one...at least for now."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book was recommended to me by a colleague, and it sounded like a neat way to learn more about Greenland and its people. The beginning of the book was most promising; the narrator, Miss Smilla, talking about what it is to be a Greenlander in (almost) the same rich terms found in 'Memoirs of a Geisha' (..of course this book instead captures the Japanese psyche). But then Miss Smilla gets involved into a rather complicated thriller-type (espionage, bio-warfare) story and, well, much of the original goodness and purity of the character is wiped out. And Miss Smilla turns out to be a heartless (but not brainless) female Rambo. Ridiculous? Yes, but certainly not boring.Peter Hoeg is obviously a gifted writer. The prose is of high calibre, which is especially remarkable considering it's an English translation. But in &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; he is definitely trying to do too much and, as a result, almost ruins what could have been a truly remarkable book.Bottom line: an interesting book which offers an insight into the rather complex people of Greenland. Just be advised that the bulk of this book turns into a Danish Tom Clancey-type thriller, and not a terribly good one at that."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I thought Smilla was one of the best female characters in modern fiction. She isn't a 23 year-old corporate executive; she is a 37 year-old with a scattered life. She makes mistakes, and she takes some lumps. The mechanic could have been developed a little better, but the first person format doesn't really allow that. Through the skillful use of the first person, the reader develops a true sense of what it is like being both from Greenland, and being an outsider. The language is often almost like poetry. It is this very intimate form that draws us into the book, and makes us care. BUT that ending-he got tired of typing or what? That is not an end, but the opening of a sequel. If my dog had written this book I'd be saying, &quot;Bad Dog! You know better than that.&quot; I liked it in spite of the ending, and will rent the movie to see how Hollywood deals with the characters and the end."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg is an amazing storyteller of the modern day. He wwraps you into it with intriguing characters (even the villans are interesting) and heavyweight concepts. Smilla's is his most well-known work, and probably his strongest for general audiences. I read this coming off of Borderliners though, and thee up-in-the-air ending among a few other things made it seem diminished comparably. But still one of the best out there these days. I recommend this as an introduction to Hoeg.

I highly recommend it to anyone who has some time to spend on it and doesn't only want a book that's easy to read.

Also, since the fall of the Soviet empire, I have felt suffocated but the smugness of all us capitalists-- at last, I read about a character who is not the least impressed with our hollow victory. What a relief!

This is no Dick Francis romp (which I also enjoy). Iappreciated the story for its suspense, but more for the intellectualand emotional pleasures offered up by the fascinating character ofSmilla. She had a most engaging knack for detecting and solvingsubtle problems which I might characterize as a stubborn, intuitivebrilliance. Hoeg excelled in presenting psychological observations ofhis characters, which, at their best, reminded me of passages inTolstoy. Another interesting facet of the novel is that it offers a rarechance to understand an ethnic minority unknown outsideScandinavia - Greenlandic Eskimos residing in urban Denmark, whoare 20th century consequences of Scandinavian hegemony inGreenland which dates 10 centuries back to the Viking age. Yes,the ending was a little disappointing. But I argue that it would be amistake to judge this book by its tail, and miss the enjoyment of allthe rest."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book 3 or 4 years ago, and it has been one of my all-time favourites since then. I find it extremely interesting to note the wide range of ratings the book gets from you customers. But this was only to be expected, because Smilla is not an easy book to read. Since the movie people seem to have mistaken the book for an easily read thriller, which it definitely is not. Smilla is a book that makes demands on the reader. One has to read it word by word, sentence by sentence and many times I've backed a page or two in order not to miss anything. Don't focus too much on the plot, it's really not that important. The beauty of the book lies in the author's style and his rather objective approach to the characters of the story. Forget about the movie. Give yourself plenty of time, peace and quiet. Read the words, the sentences, not the story. Let the ominous and mysterious moods develop around you and the characters in the book grow with each sentence.

I didn't. I hated and then in total admiration, I was awed by her courage, coolness and quick assessments of some pretty hairy situations. The fact that a man is choosing to depict a woman, especially as the central character, gives me many things to wonder about. I can say with assurance that Smilla is not like any woman I have met so far, although she does remind me somewhat of my former neighbor who could make me feel several ranges of emotions in a sitting of ten minutes or less. Just as I was ready to give up completely on Ms. Jaspersen, she revealed herself to be a very knowledgeable person on snow and ice and a few other things. I was amazed at her levelheaded handling of several near death experiences.

I found it on a clearance rack for around 2 dollars a few years later, and have been reading it ever since. It is one of the few books that I take wherever I travel. Smilla is not always a nice person; most of the time her past envelopes her present and makes her almost unlikeable. The other characters in the novel, the mechanic, her father, the coroner and the blind linguist are so well written that you begin to feel that you know them. I can't agree with the 2/3's assessment,because I find it gripping to the end, even though I have read it many times. The atmosphere of Copenhagen in winter, the language of snow and ice, and the mystery surrounding a young boy's death may not move ahead like an American mystery, but the slow unraveling of the plot is perfect for a novel set in a country where life is lived at a different pace than ours."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg proves that serious literature can be both entertaining and artful. On the surface, &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; is genre fiction. But dig a little deeper, and there is a character study of great sensitivity, a setting with symbolic value and profound themes about loss. Unlike other densely-plotted thrillers, this book rewards re-reading"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I probably wouldn't have read this book if it had not been gifted to me at Christmas by my best friend - she had seen the film, and knowing how much I like to read, felt that it would be \`right up my alley'...and once again, she was right in her judgment concerning my tastes. One of the quotes on the back cover (from The New Yorker) puts this novel \`...in the league of Melville or Conrad' - while I'm not sure I would go quite that far, Heg is a fine writer, and his talents for keeping the reader in suspense as he spins this tale are pretty impressive.The central character, Smilla, is of mixed Greenlandic and Danish parentage - and the conflicts between those two cultures, one colonial, one native, are alive within her constantly. The dialectic that exists between these two forces - which has so often transformed and rent the fabric of human society - tears at her life. She is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who is not really sure what she wants or expects from life - she trusts her instincts, but not necessarily her heart. When she comes upon the body of her six-year-old neighbor Isaiah crumpled in the snow outside their apartment building, dead from a fall from the roof, she is immediately suspicious - and when the police almost instantly rule the death an accident, Smilla's initial doubts increase. They continue to do so almost exponentially as she begins to look into the case - and her investigation leads her into one dangerous situation after another.The author balances the emotional with the sociological and the scientific elements nicely in this story - there are plenty of references to Smilla's inability to trust, and to love (and the reasons that lurk behind), background on the treatment of the Inuit people by the Danes (both in Greenland and in Denmark), and plenty of science as well. The author has done his homework. In the note about the author, it's mentioned that before turning to writing, he worked as a professional dancer, an actor, a sailor, a fencer and a mountaineer - and it's pretty evident that he pursued these activities with attention and zeal. You can see elements from several of them within this work.The writing is intelligent, and flows very nicely - and Heg is masterful in giving away just what he wants to give away as the story progresses. Fans of the literary thriller should give this novel a good, long look."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Authors are all too often struck by the dreaded 'Two-thirds syndrome' -- the problem of how to maintain the suspense of a good book until the very end. All too often, about two-thirds of the way into a novel, you can almost hear the question reverberating around an author's head: &quot;How on earth am I going to end this?&quot; One of the best examples of this must be Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, a mystery which also does a superlative job of charting the alienation of a Greenlander in Copenhagen. Just as you're gearing up for a fantastic conclusion, the author turns it into a cheap spy novel and ruins much of what he has achieved. I am still puzzled by how bad the ending of this book is when you consider what went before"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read all the reviews before writing my own because I was curious about the general consensus. People complained about the unsatisfactory ending, what they perceived as the author's intellectual showboating, as well as the narcissistic, cold-hearted selfishness of the main character. I understand the criticism leveled at the ending; I was looking for more resolution in terms of the main character's relationship to her rootless life, but ultimately I accepted that as part of the book, for better or for worse. On the other two counts I couldn't disagree more. What might be taken for pretentiousness is perhaps the author's expertise in many wide-ranging interests. And as for the main character--well, that was what drew me to this book and made it one of my all-time favorites. What I found interesting in the negative reviews was the almost angry vehemence with which readers built their case.I first read this literary thriller when it was published in 1993. Smilla Jaspersen--half Greenlander, half Dane, an unconventional loner and brilliant scientist who struggles with her conflicted upbringing--is devastated when a young boy she has befriended mysteriously falls to his death from the roof of their apartment building. Unsatisfied that it was an accident, she follows a trail from Copenhagen to the bleak Arctic reaches to solve his murder. Since that time I've probably read it a half a dozen times--and not for the incantatory power of the prose. Don't get me wrong--the writing is terrific and the story is compelling, complex, and extraordinarily well-plotted--but what gripped me most about this book was the main character. And she still grips me.Smilla is undoubtedly the first contemporary fictional female character who isn't a wife, mother, saint, or a whore. Imagine a grown-up cross between Nancy Drew and Pippi Longstocking--if they'd been kicked out of every school they ever attended, hitchhiked around the world, maybe did some low-level smuggling, and somewhere along the way managed to pick up a couple of graduate degrees. Smilla is clever, bold, smart, independent, funny, adventurous, slightly reckless, and feels no qualms about telling the men who get in her way to shove off. She's a boat-rocker, whistle-blower, a rule-breaker who thumbs her nose at authority and refuses to submit, like a well-behaved girl, to the ancillary role society would like her to play (e.g., wife, mother, saint, whore). Which, of course, drive the men whose power she challenges into a fury that makes them want to annihilate her. The irony is that she was created by a man.But Smilla's rebellion does not come without intense self-scrutiny and the painful knowledge that she's a lone wolf; at one despairing point in the book she even calls herself a loser. She admits her freakishness, the fact that she cannot find deep connections with others. She usually refrains from getting involved with men because she's terrified of becoming too dependent, of losing herself. She's terrified of being vulnerable, of being loved, of being left. And yet despite all of her fears she plods forward. She laments her inability to make a permanent place for herself in the world, and yet that doesn't deter her from what she feels is her duty--to solve the death of a little boy who may be the one person to whom she had what came close to a true connection. But the greater, unspoken challenge is how to live in the world as a black sheep, particularly if you are a woman.Perhaps the intense dislike some feel towards Smilla stems from her daring to challenge the established structure of society which, despite all the advancements women have made, still places men on top and women underneath. Men dislike her because they can't abide a woman who doesn't know her second place; women dislike her because it forces them to address the power they give away by seeking validation from men. Plus, the world does not show any love for those who tell the truth or root out corruption--they are, more often than not, eliminated in one way or other. And yet, without those who exposed secrets or took the unpopular stand, who took the heat and bucked convention, we'd still be toiling in some medieval gloom.I also loved how Hoeg, in comparing Denmark to Greenland, underscores how the \\"progress\\" and \\"development\\" of the modern world have all but destroyed the integrity of ancient cultures, the beauty of the wilderness, and the deeply-ingrained rituals that lend meaning to life as well as binding people together. He weaves examples into the main plot as a kind of elegy to the world as it was before man's maniacal drive to improve it. Some improvements come to mind that did indeed improve the quality of life for mankind--fire, penicillin, and efficient farming methods--but there are so many more that can only make you weep.Now, if only America would produce a heroine as bold, rebellious, and independent as Smilla Jaspersen--and her little sister, Lisbeth Salander."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. Yes, Smilla is a strange woman, but perhaps no stranger than any other human being if they are truly honest with themselves. Smilla questions her own humanity and her capacity to love, but answers those doubts in her actions. It is this very honesty combined with her love of snow that makes this book so intriguing. The passages about her chidhood are quite poignant and you can really feel the little girl inside the disappointed adult remembering her mother and understand the effects of loss and cultural schizophrenia. What is most remarkable is that a man tapped so deeply into the emotions that I suspect many women feel about themselves, their childhood and their attempts at adult relationships. The ending was not so much a disappointment as a deferral, as though someone came into the room, told the writer he had to pack to leave on a UFO and had 5 minutes to write the ending. However, in his defense, I truly did not expect Smilla and the Mechanic to go home, get married and have a few kids. The period spent on the ship is more technical and not quite as emotionally intimate as the earlier chapters, and felt credibility was stretched a bit, but it was still a wonderful story.Interestingly, the temperature outside while reading this book was about 60 degrees. Despite polarfleece, heavy socks and a down comforter, I still couldn't get warm. This is a book that stays in your thoughts long after you put it down."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla Jaspersen is half American and half Eskimo/Greenlander living in Denmark. She is 37, unmarried, and filled with a quiet caustic rage that overflows occasionally into determined action. She is also an expert, thanks to her Inuit mother, on the properties of snow and the significance of tracks left in snow.Smilla is befriended by a pitiful child, Isiah, and the novel begins with the discovery of his body on the ground below a 7-story building, from the roof of which he apparently fell. But Smilla isn't so sure. For one thing, he was afraid of heights. For another, it appears that a needle biopsy of his leg muscle was taken after his death. But most of all, there are his tracks, only his, in the snow, but Smilla can see his panic, his running, his fear in the properties of those tracks.Smilla is nothing if not determined, and she embarks on a quest to discover the truth behind the child's death, a quest that nearly costs her her own life.Excellent, nail-biting suspense and powerful, literary-quality writing. Superb."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"A unigue premise, an unusual heroine, and the author's back-ground combine for a great book. Learn more about Greenland andmore words for snow than you ever thought you needed. This bookalso contains one of the all-time-greatest lines ever spoken bya character. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is not your typical mystery where there's blood and gore ~~ this is a mystery where there is a dead body that leaves a trail of clues for Smilla to find and a cliffhanger of a book that leaves you wanting more. It is superby written and translated very well ~~ I enjoyed Hoeg's descriptions of snow, ice and the studies of glaciers. I was left reaching for my blankets at night whenever I picked up this book ~~ it's so cold and so impersonal in the Artic! Smilla's neighbor Isiah was found in the snow dead. And Smilla thought there was something fishy about his death ~~ for one thing, the boy was terrified of heights. And there were other clues as well ~~ that lead Smilla on a terrifying chase for the truth. She didn't intend to play detective ~~ but she didn't trust the police in Denmark either, especially since Isiah was a Greenlander. I must say, if you need to read this book, read it on a hot, sweltering day. Don't read it in the wintertime as you'll never look at snow the same way! And I would recommend this book as a good mystery read ~~ but it's not your typical mystery either. It goes much further than that ~~ combine a good story with a good mystery and good writing ~~ you have a book that is enjoyable in every way!!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Before writing this review, I read all of the one-star reviews with great interest... at least now I can understand why some people hate this book. But for me, it was a once-in-a-lifetime trip, from page one till the very end. I enjoyed every paragraph and every sentence. I have to agree though that some of those angry readers had a point: you can't just consume this book the way you would a regular two-dimensional genre thriller. In Smilla's Sense of Snow, Peter Hoeg expects his readers to pull their weight, too. You need to read this book slowly, properly, taking in every word and every idea. I read it a few pages a day because the book is so dense with ideas and imagery you can easily overdo on this artistic feast.I agree with those reviewers on the book cover who called Smilla a female Hamlet. She is a remarkably complex and beautiful individual, a true heroine. Most importantly, she's a rare example of a true-to-life female character in literature and I'm amazed at Hoeg's insight into a woman's psyche. Next to her, such supposedly realistic literary heroines as Anna Karenina and Scarlett O'Hara are finally revealed for what they truly are: a couple of petty, materialistic, greedy little nincompoops, an insult to all real-life women out here.The ending worked just fine for me although probably not for those who're used to expecting the authorial cavalry save the day (and the book) on the last page. The moment I put it down, I started rereading it. A true work of art and indisputable food for the soul.If I had to find something wrong with it, I'd say that, IMHO, the conspiracy-theory plot wasn't really needed. It's the book's world that's important, its characters and their complex life stories... the murder mystery is secondary to it all. As if it was added as an afterthought, really. But it was tight and engaging -- an additional plus to this literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I started on this a bit tentative, thinking it may be a slow read. What a surprise it turned out to be. I was not aware of the book or the movie and stumbled on it while doing some book research on Amazon.When the story starts, you dont really understand what's going on - the story unfolds layer by layer. And by the time you do, you feel like you have been hit by an avalanche and you cannot stop. A very cerebral read. You have to remember all small things, seemingly ordinary comments, that the writer brought in to make the book more enjoyable. The character of Smilla is brought out slowly in an understated way.Some of the action scenes that she is involved in during the later half are a bit over the top and are not really necessary. Still a great read."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"\\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" is a rare and fantastic book. Rich, deep, realistic and intriguing, this is a book that offers many good things for a wide audience. Having lived in Scandinavia, I can attest to the realism of place and feel put forth by Peter Heg.One part character study, one part suspense novel and one part thriller, this is a book worth reading. Heg makes many references to mathematics, an interest of mine. Moreover, Heg exposes many facets of Scandinavian and Greenlandic cultures through the characters in this book as well as through his general historical narrative.I highly recommend this book as a novel that entertains, informs and stimulates thought."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is an excellent novel with a female protagonist who is complicated, interesting, and ultimately very likable."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla is 37, half-Greenlander on her mother's side, and half-Danish on her father's. She is also an ice expert. When Isaiah, a child who lives in her building, dies after falling off the roof, the police rule it an accident. Not Smilla - she has one look at the snow on the roof and knows Isaiah was running away from someone. Of course, nobody believes her, so she decides to take matters into her own hands.For once, an intelligent heroine who doesn't spend half her time fighting off blind dates set up by an overbearing mother or spends most of her time shopping and mooning at every guy she meets ! This character is well-rounded, full of character and contradiction - and she has a mission : find out why Isaiah died.Every clue Smilla picks up is but one piece of a huge puzzle that makes sense only in the last chapter - every chapter a different piece. This quest will lead Smilla from Denmark to Greenland, then to a remote island in the middle of a sea of ice.I loved the well-rounded characters, especially Smilla, and also her evil Nemesis, the man she must defeat. The pace is taut, the tension ratchets up steadily, the puzzle pieces keep coming, and the locale descriptions are extremely interesting.If you like puzzles, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book several years ago, after picking it up at random. I found it to generally be extremely well written. In particular, I enjoyed the great cultural depths it goes into regarding snow, living in a cold environment, and the treatment of the native people.Relatively speaking, the end was a disappointment, but I still find myself thinking of and referring to this book surprisingly often. I would highly recommend it, particularly to people who are interested in cultures."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book tells the story of Smilla, a half-Inuit woman living in Copenhagen, and her investigation into why a little boy who lived in her building walked off a roof. Smilla is keenly intelligent and hard as nails. She accomplishes physical feats that would put James Bond to shame as the bad guys try to prevent her from learning what happened to the little boy. She is purposefully mysterious as she narrates her story, keeping readers puzzled about her actions and choices until she chooses to explain them. The story ends not with a bang, but a whimper, leaving the reader to figure out what happened as the plot finally drifts out to sea."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"There is something about a translation that appeals to me. Though I've read several of Haruki Murakami's books, this was my first exposure to Peter Hoeg. Both authors share that subtle but surreal twisting of language and character that constantly makes you realize just how foreign other people's lives and perspectives can be. Though I found little to relate to in Smilla, I cared what happened to her on her quest. It was so much fun to follow this woman through her quirky, lonely life that the central mysteries of the book almost became secondary. This may be why, when the book ends abruptly after the final reveal, I felt somewhat robbed. Though the narrative was technically complete, I still wanted to know what happened next, as I had throughout the book. In fact, if it weren't for the excellent use of language and the complicated nature of the characters, it would be possible to read this book simply as a modern thriller: a murder mystery that points to a bigger mystery that ultimately leads to a conspiracy. The cinematic locales and visuals, dramatic confrontations, and screenplay-esque pacing only add to feeling that, more than reading a novel, you're watching a film unfold in your mind."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I was given this book and kept for about one year until I found the perfect opportunity: snowed-in, blizzard outside, in my bed on a cold chicago winter day. I read in one day and enjoyed it. Smilla's journey through her quest to discover who killed her little friend is intertwined with her flashbacks to her past and an all too familiar love story...Unpredictable, although a bit clich&eacute;, the book does manage to keep the reader interested till the end.Some details become a little too tiring and the author gives away too much information about the characters instead of letting us feel who they are through their actions. The end would puzzle and piss off many people but, hey, if only we could design our own end."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is a mystery novel for people who don't normally read mystery novels. Smilla Jaspersin, a Greenlander living in Copenhagen can &quot;read&quot; snow. She can tell by the tracks in the snow that a little boy's death in Copenhagen was not an accident and she sets out to discover what did happen. I enjoyed this novel for its unusual setting and for the snappy personality of Smilla. Some reviewers have complained about the ending. I liked it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I loved this book. It was very convuluted, very dark, but the characterization and the setting were great. It does take a lot of energy and committment to read it; perhaps this is tantamount to the bad reviews posted here. I couldn't put it down. Give it a shot. You'll learn something about Greenland."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg has a writing style like no other author I have read. He is one of the best writers I have read. Smilla's Sense of Snow is so gripping ans suspenceful I could not stop reading it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"For some reason, I just could not get this story out of my mind, once I saw the movie. When I finally found the book, I was again caught up in it. The plot is not the most linear one I've ever read (that's ok...the poetic, hypnotic nature of the prose is why it's great). But I was glad to have already seen the movie so I could keep a grasp on what actually was happening. As for the ending - I had thought for a moment that the last pages were torn out (really!) but when I went back, re-read and pondered about it, it seemed fitting."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"If you're looking for a mind-numbing, action-packed thriller, this may not be the book for you. The plot is interesting, creative, but not extraordinary; the techno-babble is rather impressive, but nothing that Michael Crichton hasn't done a dozen times already. What's most compelling about this book is Smilla herself: her wit, her bitterness, her strength, and all the thoughts she shares with the reader. The whole story is told in the first person, present tense, which I think suits Smilla's narrative very well. Besides, the English translation is nothing short of brilliant: there's style in the narrative, something very often lost in translations. All in all, I'd say have a go at this book even if you're a bit suspicious. If you find the story tiring, at least you'll have learned something about sailing in the Arctic and life in Greenland."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla's Sense of Snow is poetic and highly unusual. It is not simply a 'thriller' or 'crime story', but a truly resonant novel. I don't know why people seem to dislike the ending - it fits perfectly well into the framework built up by earlier parts of the book and the passages describing Smilla's time on board the ship are finely wrought - claustrophobic and terrifying"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I liked this book, even though I found Smilla totally unbelievable as a character, and the early pages rough going. I soon discovered that you did not really have to read every word so very carefully. I wondered if I was reading a bad translation until I read some of the other comments here. But, it IS possible to skim this book and still enjoy it. The Denmark of this book does not remind me of the Denmark I know, and that also bothered me. I read it on the plane to and from Scandinavia. By the time they left for Greenland 3/4s through, I couldn't put it down. The ending is a brief, sharp disappointment, but on balance it's still a good read"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I have started reading this book yesterday (until now I have only read 50 pages) and it's really amazing !

I was filled with admiration for Smilla, her tenacity, her guts, her ability. I am sure the book goes down better for those who appreciate science fiction, not just because of the plot maguffin (which might easily be tomorrow's science fact) but for the notion that there are among us individuals with special gifts that can, given the right circumstances, make all the difference"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"never knew there was somuch to know about snow.Gruesome,pittoresque and could't-stop-reading-but-had-to book.It took me longer than I had expected to read the book, because Hoeg's style is quite difficult. But since the story was so well developed I wanted to finish the book; I had to. Try reading Borderliners, by the same author; very gruesome"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I found this book to be very well written. Peter Hoeg's use of lanuage was wonderful. As an english major in collage I am very particular about what I read. I was kept interested through out the entire novel. And recommended it to several people.However, I was bothered by Smilla. I don't know any women who would act the way she does, or who focus their attention on what she does. I think Peter Hoeg missed on that account. I was very aware through out that this was a man's image of a woman's mind."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book in 1993 and again in 1997 after the movie was released.A page-turner in the Grisham 'brain-candy' sense, yet intelligent with many a red-herring. The cold feel that Smilla gives is memorable; there is no character like her. You feel empathy for her - an empathy you believe she personally would dismiss.Vivid and rivetting."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This story grabs you from the beginning and takes you on a visual feast with words however it gets really complicated and takes many different directions. Some of the information is technical in nature which requires detailed explanation in the book and since this particular author likes to use lots and lots of words, it takes a long time to get through the story. In fact, the story takes many directions, including going backwards but the only story it does not seem to finish is the one that was started. I had to read this for a book club and did not give it good recommendations in our book club review either. I did enjoy the visual explanations of the country it was set in so much that I felt that I was there."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Hoeg has presented a fairly good story and is a capable writer, but there was a bit too much techno-babble for my tastes."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Maybe I'll understand the movie better. The title intrigued me. I generally love to read about Native cultures around the world, their religious beliefs and survival techniques. This book had interesting aspects relative to Native culture but the rest was just weird. It will be awhile before I tackle the reading of another Peter Hoeg novel."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"My favourite companion book.

But the author went on too long, very wordy. convoluted plot that was not necessary. Oh well, the price was right; .01."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"They are habit-forming these Scandinavian thrillers. There is just the right amount of convolution so as to not get lost in that icy fog that so affects these Norse tales. They've been practicing the genre since the Edda and just keep getting better and better. Maybe it's the long nights!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla is different. She's not a people person and since her mother died, the only person she's close to is a strange little boy named Isiah that lives in her apartment building. She returns home one day to find that police have taped off an area where Isiah is lying dead in the snow. The police think he fell off the roof. Smilla knows snow though and she's positive that Isiah did not fall, but was pushed. Smilla becomes determined to find out who pushed Isiah off the roof and why.This story started off well. Smilla is so very different from any character that I have read about before. Her knowledge of snow and ice is fascinating. I actually enjoyed learning some of the science involved. I also enjoyed learning a bit about Greenland and I was intrigued by the murder mystery. The first half of the book flew by. The second half, however, seemed to take me forever to get through. The story just became more and more far-fetched as it went along. I get that you don't want your main character killed off early on unless you're George R. R. Martin, but Smilla's ability to survive the unsurvivable just got ridiculous. And the ending! Well, let's just say that it was too abrupt for my taste."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I first read \\"Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow\\" when I was living overseas in 1997. I have never read a book that described snow and the feeling of being in cold that went right through to my skin. Being a Canadian, I have walked all kinds of snow, in all temperatures, and in all light and darkness. Peter Hoeg's intuitive and sometimes startlingly obtuse characters weave a story as mysterious and brutal as Winter itself. A marvelous read with a cozy throw in front of the fireplace."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book due to it's comparisons with 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'. I must say that the comparison is undue. Stylewise, the author tries hard to converge present,past, and introspections. He falls short. There are mirages of cohesion but he just doesn't quite pull it off. Towards the end the book becomes rather juxtaposed.As far as the story line and character building, it's alright. It's passively entertaining. I did finish it. And was not wholeheartedly disappointed. I might read it again, in a few years."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It seemed like one of those tragedies that can never be explained; the kind that may appear on the back pages of a local newspaper and then disappear forever. A young boy fell from the roof of an apartment building in Denmark.But for a neighbor - Smilla Jaspersen - who had befriended the child, the story is not as simple as an accidental fall. He was scared of heights and - because of Jaspersen's understanding of the complex nature of snow - she observes that the footprints reveal that he was running.But running from what - or who - and why?Author Peter Hoeg develops a complex thriller where lies, conspiracies and cover-ups reveals as much about how a society functions as it goes to solving the mystery. The story delves deeply into Denmark's treatment of its small Eskimo/Greenlander community & the exploitation of resources in Greenland.With the wit of Grahame Greene and the flair of John le Carre, Hoeg digs deep into the morality and politics of life. And the lessons are as harsh as the howling winds on a sub-zero winter afternoon."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The novel is written in a first-person voice, a narrative of a 37 year-old, half-Danish and half-Inuit single female named Smilla. Smilla is determined (she follows the murderers of a little boy she was fond of to the outskirts of the arctic), cynical (nothing impresses her other than dry, cold factoids such as the formations of ice), science-oriented (she authored scientific papers on the growth rate of stalactite; she reads Euclid's Elements to the little boy), has a thing against authority (she had been expelled from every organization she got admitted to), and downright wicked (she will cut open a wound in you without hesitation once she is determined that you are her enemy). But it is really her keen, frank observations that one gets attracted to. Her eyes and tongue would slice and dice everything she encounters and would not spare even herself. Through her narratives one is able to construct an all too humane and ultimately convincing human being. This is what keeps one reading, wanting for more. The plot, on the other hand, disguised as a mystery, serves nothing more than a glue to group together Smilla's manifold observations. Do not expect much from the plot."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Some writers create such great characters that you don't care if the story line is a little murky. My favorite example of this is Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP: I have read the book and seen the movie multiple times, and still have difficulty sorting it all out. Some of Dickens' work falls into this category, as well as some recent mysteries, such as AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST.If the ultimate measures of a work of fiction are that you care about the people and you want to know what happens next, then SMILLA is a masterpiece. To this, I would have to add the novel's sense of place: Copenhagen and the sea off the West Coast of Greenland are sketched in few but deft strokes.Ultimately, it is Smilla herself who is the star attraction. Half Dane, half Inuit (Eskimo), she thinks like a little of both. The Danish half is something of a scientist, while the Inuit half has a sense of snow and ice that is alien to anyone south of the Arctic Circle. While afraid of water, Smilla thinks nothing of taking a stroll on the ice in the harbor of Copenhagen, instinctively sidestepping weaknesses which would plunge her toward an icy [demise].Not since LA FEMME NIKITA have I seen such a dangerous woman in a fight. Her quick disabling of her father's girlfriend Benja and an over-inquisitive crewman aboard the ship KRONOS are memorable. At the same time, her feelings for the Inuit boy Isaac are sincere and credible, such that I almost felt as if the author were female.On the other hand, the ending is not satisfying -- a little too Indiana Jones-y for my taste -- and that while Hoeg's characterization of the main characters is on the mark, he creates too many subsidiary characters, particularly in the Denmark scenes, and too many complications from which to extricate himself successfully.That being said, I look forward to see the direction that Hoeg takes with his future works. Sure it's not perfect, but it's such a fun read that it'll whet your appetite for more."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"There was a time back in the mid 90s when this book first came out in paperback when I couldn't seem to go anywhere without running into a colleague who was reading this book. That struck we as ironic, since I am a scientist and this book is virulently anti-science and anti-technology.Smilla's mother seems to represent a sort of aboriginal virtue while her father represents the decadence of civilization. Smilla is split right down the middle, which leaves her exactly nowhere. She is the ultimate outsider, at home in neither the frozen wilderness of her mother's homeland nor the swishy cocktail-party universe of her father's world (he is a famous surgeon). I suppose that Hoeg wanted Smilla to represent all of us in some way. Her mother is our \\"good\\" pre-industrial self and her father is our \\"bad\\" technological self. I am told that Mr. Hoeg is fond of walking the winter streets of Copenhagen in his bare feet on occasion. He is an eccentric and perhaps even a crank with a axe to grind. He is, however, also a very good writer.He apparently also isn't all that fond of his reading public. This book would seem to me to be a send-up of both the mystery and thriller genres, the two genres that are consumed by the largest slice of the reading public. He is really making fun of that audience by giving them a mystery that doesn't have much of a resolution and a thriller that has all the plot elements of one of those silly movies that they (used to) make fun of on Mystery Science Theater 3000.So the book ends up being frustrating because Hoeg can't really seem to help writing well and yet the structure and plot of the book are essentially a joke. Oh, and the movie was even worse, although I liked seeing Copenhagen in a film for the first time."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"As a writer, I'm interested in style and mood as well as character and plot. &quot;Smilla&quot; is awesome on all counts - a book I would have given anything to write. I've read it twice, which I never do with other mysteries, and seen the movie, which I also liked. The identification between Smilla, torn from her Greenlander roots as a child and left alienated and wounded, and the little boy, whose death she won't allow to be casually dismissed, is moving and satisfying. The digressions about math, ice, and Greenland are half of what makes the book literature instead of genre fiction. The other half is the sensational writing style, bleak,unsentimental, complex and brave like Smilla. True, there are a few stumbles here and there, and especially at the end, but only because the book is so ambitious. The impression I have is of a serious novelist who sets out to write a best-seller and can't help raising all the tired old elements of the genre to new heights. Mr. Hoeg's other books are fascinating but less accessible because they are more experimental. I wonder if he will &quot;descend&quot; to popular fiction again"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read this book when it first came out in paperback and again a few years later. I sometimes have quirky taste in reading materials, though I also enjoy best selling authors such as John Grisham and mystery writing by authors such as Sue Grafton and Nevada Barr I guess I am always looking for something a little different.The fact that most reviewers either loved this book or hated it proves that it is a GREAT BOOK. Few reviewers were lukewarm.As for some of the criticisms \\"Smilla is not a believable character\\" I found her to be quite real (though in a fictional situation) \\"the ending was disapointing\\" I felt like the final statement of the book is something I have always known but never put into words, sometimes I find myself remembering this and reminding myself not to expect too much in the way of resolution in life. I don't feel the book was so much a study of the european mind as it was a first person view of \\"the outsider\\" in any culture or situation.I have some criticisms too, it is long, I felt the sex included in this novel was added just to, as they say, \\"sex it up\\" also I saw the film and thought it was terrible.I would recommend this book for avid eclectic readers. For those who demand serious realism and for those who enjoy pure fantasy, neatly wrapped and tied with a ribbon: just skip it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I read Hoeg's novel in English when it was published in 1993, and plan to one day get around to reading it in Danish. But whichever language you read it in, once Smilla gets on that damn ship, I'm sorry to say, it's all down hill, and the ending is one of the worst I can recall reading - so unsatisfying it will make ya weep for what could have been a superb work.I have the book on my shelf and never tire of reading Part One (The City), but never read any further - I can't bear to see Smilla and the story turn into a silly blockbuster film blue print. Part One however is truly beautiful, and I get both angry, sad, and incredibly homesick (where IS home when you're an immigrant?) You will feel transported to Copenhagen in winter, and you will be given an brutally honest non-fairytale angle on Denmark, including the horrific ways in which the Danes messed things up really bad for the Greenlanders, introducing alcoholism, violence, unemployment, pollution and other delights from the \\"civilized\\" world. In Copenhagen, you will see Greenlanders, like Isaiah's mother Juliane, sitting on city and park benches, drinking up their welfare money, a plastic bag full of Tuborg beer bottles, their faces ravaged by sad lives in a city where they should never have set foot in.Perhaps Hoeg thought he would reach a wider audience if he wrote of these issues in a mystery/thriller format, and he obviously did, it became a bestseller, but I think he did himself and the reader a great disservice, as evidenced by the many amazon[.com] reviewers who loathed Part Two and Three, and were very disappointed by the ending.

Full credit also goes to the translator, Tiina Nunnally.

I was quickly caught up in this story and felt myself, like Smilla, wanting to get to the bottom of the mystery. I found the combination of the mystery of Isaiah's death and the political intrigue to be very compelling.

Quite ironic, considering that I almost didn't read it because the Julia Ormond-movie almost turned me away from it completely.The narrator, Smilla, is, to be blunt, obnoxious, arrogant, mean-spirited, and emotionally damaged. But she also makes for an intriguing guide through the novel. She's very interesting, the way Holden Caulfield is interesting.The plot of the novel begins with Smilla's attempts to unravel the mysterious death of a young boy who lived in the same apartment building. The boy supposedly fell off the roof to his death, but by examining the snow tracks -- Smilla's sense of snow -- she determines that he didn't fall.Long before Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; came around, &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; presented a scientifically-nerdy view of the thriller, packed with all kinds of trivia and even a math equation relating to the density of snow.I recommended this book to three of my co-workers, all of whom raved about it as much as I did. Unfortunately, I didn't find &quot;Borderliners&quot; to be anywhere near the same level. Hoeg may be a one-hit wonder, but that hit is a bull's eye."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"All I can say is that I loved this book completely. It makes you think and care all together. The characters are crafted in such a way that you love them because they aren't perfect not in spite of it, remarkably like life. The best of Peter Hoeg's books that I have read as yet. a truely beautiful book whether you like the snow or not."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Wow...lots of disparities in the previous reviews. I thought the book was great...maybe because I've traveled in those areas and can relate, but mainly because Smilla was a terrific character, tough as nails, smarter than most of the men around her, yet still consumed with her own inadequacies, of which there were MANY. I normally don't read a lot of suspense novels, but I'm glad I made an exception in this case. Now I really want to see the film, which I understand is very well cast."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Well, partly because I can DEFINITELY relate to Smilla Jaspersen in terms of personality. It's told from a very personal point of view, and starts out rather slowly, but the pace does pick up. There's quite a lot to learn from the book if you don't mind all the technical mumbo-jumbo. It seems that people either love it or hate it. I say Grab It!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It took me a little while to warm up to Smilla, the character; however, once there, I couldn't let her go. I read so many books, I can rarely keep track of the plots and characters. However, Smilla stands out in my mind--even after 3 years!I especially liked Smilla's equation of numbers and emotions. That one particular passage will most likely stay with me forever. I've now read the book at least three times and still find it very provocative.Smilla is a thinking book. Don't expect to race through it; you'll miss the subtleties that make this story exceptional.Many thanks also to the translator for her beautiful work."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I don't understand what happened towards the end of this book. We know Hoeg can write, can conjur up some astonishing images, so why did he end it so sloppily and so lazily? Another disappointment"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This story and its unusual heroine lingered with me long after I'd read it. Smilla is a wonder: strong and resourceful, yet quirky, vengeful and darkly cynical. You see her drawn into the case of the little boy's suspicious death, almost in spite of herself, because her instinct is to fiercely protect her solitude and independence. The exotic settings (to me -- never been to Scandinavia)of Denmark and Greenland add to the inscrutable mysteries of Smilla and her story. The plot takes an X-Files-ish twist near the end, but you're so involved with the characters by then that you can forgive this. Sample of Smilla's thinking: &quot;Falling in love has been greatly overrated. Falling in love consists of 45 percent fear of not being accepted and 45 manic hope that this time the fear will be put to shame, and a modest 10 percent frail awareness of the possibility of love. I don't fall in love anymore. Just like I don't get the mumps.&quot; Gotta love her."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story line different from the typical lawyer book representing most fiction these days. Hoeg's writing style and use of words has left me highlighting quotes throughout the book. Be sure to read this book without the purpose of &quot;just getting to the end.&quot; Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I must adnit that Hoeg made a good effort to create a character of his opposite sex, and did it very well. Smilla is the most believable thing in the whole book, if not the only one. She's strong and stubborn, mixing these two kinds of personality to her own advantege. But, unlike Smilla, all the other characters are weak, and boring. The book is divided in three parts, and only the first one, in the city of Copenhaggen, is interesting, telling how Smilla tries to solve the misterious death of a young neighbour. But when she gets into the ship that takes her to Greenland, the plot becomes confused, making the reader want to skip parts. The end is the worst part. It seems that even Hoeg himself got tired of the book, and just ended it putting a final dot in some point he found interestingm thinking that people would think him a genious creating such an odd end like that. Well, that didn't work out with me. I don't know what happened with Smilla, Fojl, Tork. In the movie the producers made the ending different, so people wouldn't throw popcorn on the screen before the lights go on. A good start thrown away. Hoeg is not the modern Shakespeare other reviwers think him to be."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"From the very first page, this book cought me strongly. It's so original, it makes you laugh. So impressing, that any man ever would be able to write something like this. I don't know how it's translated, but the original, Danish version is so pure in quality, and I love every page. A fantastic story, nothing less. I have read it three times now, and i consider reading it for the 4th time. Learn Danish from today and read the book. Or, if you are not Danish, read it afterall. You will love it like... There are nothing like this book. I can't explain it, although I know it so well. It's a must-have. Therefore, buy one in your own language and one in Danish, whether you want to learn Danish or not! That's it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I enjoyed reading this book! It's a pity to read the translation, better read the original! May be in future I'll speak Danish.

I read some review which compared the two books. I did not think the books were similar.

I read it out of curiosity not enjoyment.The ending was a total disappointment."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I found this book to be too long, too humorless and too stodgy to bear.

The ending left me cold."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I felt the book began well with the first few chapters,but the middle 400 plus pages dragged on, and really didnot have any &quot;technothriller&quot; or mystery elements in them.Also, Smilla's &quot;sense of snow&quot; is only scattered in somepages, not as much as I thought would be written."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I am an avid reader of all genres who prides myself on finishing every book I start. This book, however, has broken my track record. The writing appeared forced and its &quot;poetic&quot; prose is garbled. The sequence of events in this story are difficult to follow and I found myself forgeting characters and their names by the time they were mentioned in another chapter. The decription of the indigenous people of Greenland was interesting but was unable to redeem the overall dullness of this novel"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The book was moderately entertaining but way WAY too wordy. The author has Smilla reminisce about everything from her life with &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; to talking out every thought she has ever had or ever entertained. While the writing is good and even entertaining at times, it is impossible not to get lost in the gestalt and miss the plot entirely. Final thoughts, if you like meandering plots and have a year or so to kill, read this book"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"After reading the last page of this book I sat there blankly fuming for about thirty seconds, made a very nasty comment about Peter Heg to my girlfriend, and finally gave in and hurled the book against the far wall of the room. Then I stalked out into the living room, got _The Commodore_ off the shelf, returned to the bedroom and started reading, pausing briefly to say to Grace \\"Patrick O'Brian understands me! And *he* can criticize Europeans and still tell a f**cking good story!\\"I've never reacted this strongly to a book before. On the cover it says \\"NAMED 'BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR' by Time, Entertainment Weekly, and People\\". All I can say is, it must've been a bloody slow year. What on earth... I mean... *sputter*... what was the point? And yes, I get that the point is that sometimes there is no point and that the European mindset doesn't grasp that truth and oh, how drolly appropriate that it's frustrating me. I can just see Peter Heg smirking at my bourgeois reaction. But this goes beyond teaching a lesson. This goes beyond even preaching. This was punishment. To sink multiple hooks into my skin, pull me along, and then purposefully, coldly and brutally leave me hanging... that's just unconscionable. Please tell me that some of you got something out of this book.On to the overall style. I'm not impressed. Oh, the longing for a place in a world that doesn't understand me. Oh, the angst. Oh... bollocks. How am I supposed to care about this character? She's emotionally flatulent and just plain unlikeable. Sure, given the first-person narrative I get to see how self-loathing she is, and that helps me to understand her. But that doesn't make me empathize with her, let alone like her. I kept thinking that if I ever met this nasty, mean-spirited creature I wouldn't want anything to do with her. Is it just me, or did Heg intentionally bar the possibility of empathy for his protagonist? If so, what is the point of that? Don't we want to either associate with or see ourselves as diametrically opposed to our protagonists? Sigh. I suppose Heg was making another one of his oh-so-impressive points by refusing to let his protagonist fall into either category.While I'm being pedantic, let's talk plausibility. Am I not entitled to expect a smattering of the stuff? Just a light spritz? I guess not, because this story sure didn't have it. This emotionally impacted creature wanders around and the universe somehow bends to her will like wheat before a stiff breeze. To judge by her effectiveness at completing her quest she might have been a genetically enhanced Navy Seal, professional detective, and superspy rolled into one. I can't accept that someone as socially reclusive and maladjusted as this could stumble through a chain of events that would be nearly impossible for the slickest operator. And yes, I get that it's a metaphor. The whole bloody book is one big bloody throbbing metaphor. And you know what? I like metaphor. I have no problems with extending a metaphor however far you like, *if it's done well*. Take Mark Helprin's _Winter's Tale_, or Jonathan Lethem's _As She Climbed Across the Table_. The first is hard to believe in the literal sense but that's OK because of the deftness with which Helprin navigates through emotional and spiritual landscapes. When you're done you can't necessarily describe where you've been but you *know* you've been somewhere grand. The second has a believable story despite the extended metaphor. _Smilla's Sense of Snow_, however, contains forced and facile metaphor that makes me think Heg made up a list of every interesting little factoid about the physics of ice formation and then set about to shoehorn each and every one of them into a metaphor regardless of whether it really worked or not. So since the metaphor doesn't really work and since it *feels* to me like Heg is expecting me to buy into the story as it stands, that's what I try to do. And I fail miserably. I suppose it must be very hard to write a mystery story that's believable; after all, the protagonist has to win out against insurmountable odds in order to make the end satisfying. But in this case Heg is hoist on his own petard: his ending makes it clear that I can't expect conventional resolutions, so why should he expect me to suspend my disbelief in a way that might be expected if he were telling a conventional mystery story?"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I heard great things about this book. Frankly, it started off really good. What happened to the little boy? How are all of these shady characters involved? What's beneath the ice up there in Greenland? As this book became more and more confusing, I cared less and less about that stuff. And then when U find out... LET DOWN! The big climax was a big bomb! KA-POW!!! It does get 2 stars. One for interesting sciency stuff. And another for Smilla, who -- after all was said and done -- is a real kewl gurl.

The mechanic is a good figure in the back to support her. I loved reading the book, because it has so many surprising turns. Books by Hoeg are usually very confusing (like 'The history of Danish dreams'), but Smilla keeps your attention focesed on one thing: her. So......excellent book"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Preditcable dialogue structure and an irritating main character make this book nothing more than an average thriller. Smilla's angst would be more convincing to me if she was much younger. In her late thirties, she strikes me as the type that just needs to get over it and move on. Others with her strength of character have been able to rise above the tragic circumstances of their lives."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"A quite brilliant book, keeping you guessing to the end, this is a very different kind of detective story. You really feel that you know the unusual mind of Greenlanders, and the prejudices they have to suffer (or are these phobias?) as Hoeg get right inside the skin of his feisty - INDESTRUCTABLE! - heroine. There are passages easier to read than others, but persevere - you won't regret it and you won't put the book down once you get to the climax!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I first read this book about 4 years ago and have since re-read it twice -- something I rarely do! Despite the fact that the plotting is a little weak -- especially at the very end of the novel -- I love this book because of Smilla's character. She's angry and bitter, but also brilliant -- I would love to have dinner with her sometime! I find it completely amazing that Peter Hoeg could write the voice of a minority woman so convincingly. However, for all those like me who proceeded to read his other works after falling in love with Smilla, a warning -- I don't think any of them measures up. I'm hoping that someday he will decide to tell us more about Smilla Jaspersen. Until then, I just plan to re-read again!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Miss Smilla is a woman &quot;betweenworlds&quot;, who inhabits the uncomfortable margins of Danish life from behind a wall of ice.The ice is her memory of and longing for Greenland, its climate and topography, and the fragmenting Inuit society into which she was born - where her consciousness formed under her mother's tutelage. Since that mother was an Inuit hunter, she is sensible to ten thousand messages about the element of cold - its manifestations, its demands - which most Europeans cannot even begin to see.Forcibly brought home to Denmark at her mother's death by her father- an implausibly wealthy and successful Danish doctor - she has spent most of her life depressed and resentful, a kind of sociopath. Despite talent, intelligence, physical resilience and the availability of apparently unlimited financial resources (thanks to her despised yet doting pater), she can find nothing to hold her life together. But when another displaced Greenlander - a neighbor's neglected child whom she has befriended - apparently falls off a roof, her suspicions and sadness combine, leading her to commit herself absolutely to revealing the truth behind the incident. She begins to investigate the murder.By far the best sections of this book deal with Smilla's Greenlandic consciousness - the minutiae of her &quot;feelings for snow&quot; which are explored in beautiful detail, exploring pack ice, glacier ice, ice-hunting and ice formations; and the pressures upon her to assimilate - lose who she is and what she was born to. It is a very sharp study of alienation, and the battle between the elemental and civilized worlds she represents.But in conceiving a set of conflicts as enormous as these, Peter Hoeg runs into trouble. In trying to contain the forces described within a plausible narrative, he struggles to find a plausible form, and instead reels unhappily between science and detective fiction and the world of James-Bond, which all vie with a somewhat uneven psychological realism for the reader's attention. The combination is not always satisfying.In the end, the territory Hoeg creates for Smilla is better served by film than in the novel. In film, &quot;Ingmar Bergman meets a female Indiana Jones in mukluks&quot; is not quite such an implausible concept, and sumptuous visuals can help the viewer across gaps in characterization or plot. And, of course, this is exactly what happened to the book - it went straight to celluloid."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I found this book so gripping, both emotionally and plot-wise, that I finished it in two days. It made me afraid to go to sleep, it was so tense and menacing, and yet, it had none of the conventions of a usual suspense novel, which is a genre I usually avoid entirely. The main character is so contrary, intelligent and angry at life, yet so uniquely portrayed, with nary a cliche in sight. Hoeg's insight into a woman's psyche was just incredible ---- the book was more about social politics and power struggles between the sexes, told as an undertone adding to the book's sense of menace, yet Smilla is no whiner --- she is strong and resourceful in a believeable way, although once in awhile she seemed too capable, to the point where it got silly. Still, the compassion for downtrodden human beings that develops out of a general misanthropy is believable and touching. The pseudo-scientific gobbledygook plot twist at the end lost me, and I thought the movie was pretty bad, but otherwise I loved Smilla. It's one of my all-time favorite books. I haven't found Hoeg's other books to approach it in terms of depth and compassion, at least not Borderliners or The Woman and the Ape."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Okay, I admit, I saw the movie first &amp; it was so intriguing that I had to go out &amp; purchase the book because I knew it would be that much better than the movie.

I could not remotely imagine where the story was going--the &quot;answer&quot; was a complete surprise and just kept me reading faster and faster.

Intelligently written by Peter Hoeg, Smilla's Sense of Snow is the best depiction of a woman done by a man I've ever read. Kate Cone"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"A thriller that seeks to expand the reader's mind, not just entertain through suspense, Smilla's Sense of Snow is simply put, amazing. The protagonist, Smilla, is one of the most memorable female protagonists from any novel, genre or otherwise. She is deftly characterized by Hoeg, who lets her tell the story with equal parts contrarian wit, scientific analysis, and soul searching depth. The reader walks alongside her, almost feeling the ice under their own feet, seeing the harshness of winter in a new light, and gaining some of Smilla's love for the cold and all things ice in the process.The plot focuses on the mysterious death of a young boy whom Smilla has unintentionally befriended, and her painstaking pursuit of the secrets surrounding his supposed suicide. Relying on her ruthless intelligence and persistence, she vows to see that his death is acknowledged as a murder, and that his killer is brought to justice. The tenacity and resourcefulness she employs, her careful observations and cutting, acerbic wit, and the endearing quality of her rugged yet fragile individuality, elevate this novel far above a typical thriller. The writing itself is fantastic. Tightly wrapped and lyrical, I can only imagine how good it must be in it's untranslated form.Hoeg's obvious love for Denmark and Greenland and the ease with which he portrays the streets of Copenhagen, the decks of an ice breaker ship, Inuit and Dane characters, and his familiarity with cold weather allow the \`place' in the novel to impress with its uniqueness. The novel draws the reader into what for most is new territory with deft skill, letting the reader experience Danish culture through Smilla's observant eyes.A hybrid novel, both character and plot driven, Smilla's Sense of Snow delivers a tightly paced suspenseful page turner that excels as both a thriller and a beautifully crafted novel. Not just a journey into the Arctic and ice flows of Greenland, but a journey into an incredibly fascinating mind and heart."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Reading mystery novels, like reading fantasy or theology, requires only suspension of disbelief in the implausible. And patience - convoluted plots are the norm, with twists and turns the protagonist [and reader] must endure until resolution and clarity appear. Protagonists are, perforce, heroic - people capabable of superhuman endurance, cleverness and insight. All are usually well beyond normal experience. Readers are kept at the page-turning chore to see \\"what happens next\\". With some writers, this is a boring task. In the case of a talented writer, the task turns into a pleasure. When the writer has additional capabilities, which Hoeg possesses in abundance, reading becomes a joy.Hoeg's story of Smilla Jaspersen, Greenland raised but now Kobnhavn resident, turns on his ability to convey a wealth of information. Disturbed by the falling death of a child afraid of heights, Smilla embarks on a quest to learn the truth. The crusade brings her into confrontations with stultifying bureaucracy, ruthless enterprise and conscienceless hostility. There is a deep, underlying situation behind Isaiah's death. Smilla must peel away many layers of obfuscation and conspiracy. It's an overwhelming challenge, but her sense of justice has been offended. She wants answers and will endure much to find them. It all begins with footprints in the snow.Hoeg, of course, has crossed into a \\"forbidden zone\\" - the male writer portraying life through a woman's eyes. Does he succeed? Of course. This issues in this story aren't \\"women's ways of knowing\\", but how a dedicated individual pursues a goal. This isn't the portrayal of \\"woman\\", but of one woman in specific circumstances. Smilla's background is hardly typical of women in general - her Greenlandic, half Inuit roots make her a character of many levels. Are the men Smilla encounters real or the artifice of a male writer? Smilla, a lone woman in her mid-thirties, has few illusions. She's tough, resourceful and vulnerable all at once. The men Hoeg confronts her with have a wide spectrum of attributes. Moral questions are raised and adroitly dealt with. None are simple or readily resolved. Smilla copes in her own manner, not in any generic sense. Among other aspects, Smilla is deeply concerned about Europe's, particularly Denmark's, views on the \\"outside world\\".The author takes us through several new worlds. Few \\"mystery\\" novels exhibit the insights and technical comptence Hoeg displays. It isn't \\"Smilla's sense of snow\\" we encounter, but Hoeg's. The Greenland Ice Cap isn't familiar territory to readers of \\"detective stories\\", but he introduces us to that alien environment. Why must ships not engage in communication at certain times? Hoeg explains this and other aspects of the shipping world with ready intimacy. Each new milieu comes alive and vividly real in his portrayal.Calling this book a \\"mystery\\" is, of course, a gross oversimplification. Hoeg goes far beyond any \\"genre\\" labels with this book. That's what gives it its special flavour. There is a wide readership that would enjoy this book. Pick it up and share the many themes it addresses. You will not be disappointed.

Frankly, I found it more than tedious and mired in murky, self-important writing, and more than boring."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"All the other reviewers of this book should realize that they were reading the words of translator Tiina Nunnally, not Peter Hoeg. He wrote it in Danish. The translation won an award from the American Translators Association for the best translation of the previous two years.Hoeg's book, however, left a lot to be desired.I read it both in Danish and in English, and it'sa shame that Tiina Nunnally wasn't allowed to fixall the holes in the plot. The first third wasextremely interesting, but as soon as Smilla goton the ship for Greenland, the plot started to fall apart. And the finale! You'd have to research the annals of 20s pulp science fiction for a more unbelievable ending. I think Hoeg just got tired and gave up trying in the last half of the book. He should have stayed in Copenhagen.Smilla was not a believable female character for me either. But she was still a lot better than Julia Ormond's movie version, who spent most of her screen time in endless closeups of her in various fashionable outfits (and non-PC ivory jewelry) that the book's Smilla wouldn't have been caught dead in. Movie rating: Turkey.If you liked this book, don't bother with his other ones; this one is by far his best effort to date."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I'd like to give this book 2 1/2 stars out of five, because it's half good. It's stylistically engaging, and a few of the central characters (especially Smilla, as the narrator) are richly drawn and fascinating. And as the plot begins to unfold and the puzzle pieces are laid out one by one, the question of how they will all connect pulls you along relentlessly.But halfway through - when the setting changes from Copenhagen to a large cargo ship heading toward Greenland - the story begins to lose its way. New characters are introduced which are merely caricatures, their motives and actions become less and less plausible, until by the end we no longer believe anything, and the entire plot, rather than being wrapped up in a satisfying conclusion, simply disintegrates into nothingness."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Having recently read a later book by Peter Heg,THE QUIET GIRL, I thought I would go back to the novel that made his reputation. My memory of the movie version ofSMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOWhad devolved into some rather preposterous action sequences in the second half, quite erasing the qualities that make Heg's book so special right from the opening pages. For in Smilla Jaspersen, a thirty-seven-year-old woman, raised by her mother in Greenland, then brought to Copenhagen by her Danish father, he has created a most attractive heroine: intelligent, resourceful, and fiercely independent. Her knowledge of snow is evident even in the first sentence; it leads her to suspect that the apparent fall of a neighbor's child off a flat snow-covered rooftop was not the accidental death of the official verdict. As the book continues, we discover many more of Smilla's special attributes: her knowledge of math and science, her uncanny sense of direction, her ability to get people to confide in her, her tenacity, and her cautious capacity for love. For the first half of the book at least, these qualities lead her into the heart of a mystery that is as much psychological as criminal, dense and totally absorbing.But then things change. The setting shifts from Copenhagen to a ship bound for the ice-pack off the west coast of Greenland. The action sequences that I remember from the movie become more and more frequent, shifting the genre of the book to something more like Alistair Maclean'sICE STATION ZEBRA, or (even closer in its combination of speculative science in the arctic setting)THE TRUDEAU VECTORby Juris Jurjevics. Heg is among the best in this genre too, but I confess to a little disappointment when Smilla relies more on her fighting instincts than her perceptions. At the same time, the closer Smilla gets to uncovering the mystery, including the purpose of this trip to the ice, the more diffuse it becomes, and the non-ending is really a cop-out. I can see that this is a pattern with Heg; THE QUIET GIRL also opens with a striking protagonist -- a circus clown and lover of classical music -- but moves similarly into an action thriller that borders on science fiction; he seems to be writing for two quite different audiences. I keep reading because he is a good writer, even in translation, and his main characters are so strong. But I could easily settle for the first halves of his books, and skip the second."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Having heard both the abridged and the Recorded Books Unabridged versions, the latter is by far the Best Audio Version! First, the abridged version cuts so much out it feels like you are speed reading; no way to enjoy a fine thriller like this. If you have the time, the added details and the better reader, make this a wonderfully entertaining book! Alyssa Bresnahan was the veteran reader chosen by Recorded Books. Her sense of who the characters are, and emotive reading, really bring this version to life! Right now at Amazon this $100 professional edition seems to be available for 10 cents on the dollar! A true reading bargain; God bless Amazon!!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It was a cold, bleak November day. The noiseless, lackluster streets of Copenhagen lie covered in blankets of freshly-fallen snow. Why, if you could imagine the scene, you would almost be tempted to describe it as \\"tranquil.\\" But tranquil it isn't, for somewhere along one of these whitened, desolate streets of Copenhagen lies the lifeless body of six-year-old Isaiah Christiansen. Ruled an \\"accidental\\" death by the local police officials who were convinced that the young boy slipped and fell while playing on the roof of his apartment building, Isaiah was eventually laid to rest. But in the mind of Smilla Jasperson, Isaiah's close friend and neighbor, there were still too many unanswered questions evolving the little boy's death. From day one, thirty-seven-year-old Smilla never believed that Isaiah's death was a mere accident. Telltale signs left by Isaiah's footprints on the snowy rooftop had all but convinced Smilla that little Isaiah--who was petrified of heights and would never have willingly gone up on the roof in the first place--had met up with foul play and she was determined to seek out the truth even if it killed her. What really happened up there on the roof that blustery November day? Who could possibly have wanted this innocent child dead? And why? What secrets did Isaiah carry with him to his grave? Readers will slowly but surely find the answers to these questions (and more) as they embark on an endless and treacherous journey alongside Smilla as she puts forth all efforts in searching for the truth behind Isaiah's untimely death.This novel was the first I've ever read by the Danish writer, Peter Hoeg. I bought it after a friend of mine (whom I admire for his exquisite taste in literature) highly recommended it. Having read the book, the verdict is in: it was an absolutely sensational read!I was pleasantly taken aback by Hoeg's style of writing, which can only be described as \\"profoundly descriptive\\" (I know more about the dynamics of ice and snow than I ever dreamed of knowing!), and \\"culturally educative\\" (I now know as much about Copenhagen and Greenland than I do my own homeland!).I enjoy a good mystery, but for those looking for a Robin Cook-ish whodunit, you won't find it here. Hoeg has a very esoteric style of writing and throughout the 500 pages of his novel, he pens extremely detailed passages that may put some readers to sleep.Hoeg weaves an intricate trail of suspense that expands from the cold, desolate streets ofCopenhagen to the frigid waters off the coast of western Greenland. The character, Smilla, fits so easily into the icy environments illustrated in this book, as she is as cold and emotionless as the snow in which she studies. Because of the way her character is portrayed--apathetic, downright [witchy], and fiercely independent, I found it hard to like Smilla although I admired herspunk and rooted her efforts. The brief sexual encounters with her lover, the mechanic, wereweirdly erotic, yet it was a nice surprise to see that the tough, hard-as-nails Smilla Jasperson has a soft, feminine side to her nature.The novel was \\"bouncy\\" at times in that it was often a challenge keeping up with the manyunscrupulous characters and the roles each played in Isaiah's death. I got dizzy trying to stay focused through some parts of the book as Hoeg jumped from one event to the next withoutany lucid connections. Whew! What a rollercoaster ride!The ending was a bit of a disappointment and left me with the big question of what happened to the villains! At least we find out who killed Isaiah and why. Maybe Hoeg deliberately left the ending open like that in case he decides to write a sequel.Read this book only if you don't mind long, heavily-detailed, drawn-out thrillers. All-in-all, this is a very good novel. I can't wait to read Hoeg's other book, \\"Borderliners.\\" If it's anything like this one, I'm sure I won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla Jasperson is unmarried and facing the prosepct of growing old alone in Copehagen, matching her remoteness from her beloved Greenland with a similar attitude towards the rest of humanity. Only a small inuit boy stirs up Smilla's smoldering self hatred and forces her to look back towards the frozen Greenland of her birth. Young Isiah is meant to mirror Smila at the age before her detachment from home became permanent, and he she becomes the mother figure his own drunken and unemployed mother is not. When the boy dies, Smilla barely hesitates to suspect murder, not only because of her love for him but because he is her only connection to the rest of humanity. Her search puts her in conflict with Copenhagen's police who would like to put closure on the case, and with the boy's father's employer - a large mining company making periodic surveys to Greenland. It also forces her towards her father, a prominent Danish doctor and the man she hates the most.Hoeg has created less a mystery than a complex drama in which the heroine is the most dispassionate charachter. Nothing will bring back Isiah, and Hoeg resists the urge to turn Smilla's antagonists into oppressive and unsympathetic goliath figures. While Smilla never attracts sympathy or reader identification, Hoeg's ecxploration saves her from becoming a cypher. The plot itself, though, when forced to reveal itself, is unsatisfying and doesn't seem to do its protagonist or the prose any justice. The day after you've finished the last page, you've forgotten the climax. But you'll still be shivering."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"this is a real page-turner. there's a lot going on in terms of scientific details and our misanthropic, cruel smilla's cold, cold little heart.as someone with a scientific background i found many of these details kind of pretentious, and didn't really help the story along- but they do fit with smilla's personality, so they're forgivable.hoeg is a frustrating writer- similarly &quot;tales of the night&quot; had great promise but lacked... something. here i can nail it down- the novel self-destructs in the last few chapters, using exposition by characters rather than letting the story tell itself. yes, it's nice to find out what's ultimately going on, but to have it spoon-fed to us after a fair bit of intrigue and suspense feels just lazy."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I was in pain to finish it. The idea is good but the writing is so heavy, long-winded, boring that it was a suffering to know it was still there, waiting for me. The last part, furthermore, is a real torment. Peter Hoeg: never again."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker--raving about the herroine in the plot and how powerful the plot is. WHAT was she talking about? Maybe the plot was lost in the transaltion, but I found the book boring and hard to follow. I kept losing track of what was going on and who was who? After a few chapters of complete confusion, I finally put it down without finishing it. I did happily hand it over to my father--a well-read and educated man. I thought maybe he would appreciate this recommendation, but he as I could not follow the events, and said goodbye to the story before the end."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I was told how great a book this was. I read it, expecting to be enthralled. It was a struggle--Idecided to finish it, but at no point did I get it. The characters were unbelievable; Smilla'spsychobabble was just annoying; her constant commentary on different words for ice and snow waspretentious; her adventures were preposterous; and the plot was ultimately a disappointment. Smillaand all the characters in it are depressing bores. Maybe you need the Scandinavian sense of doomto appreciate this book. In my opinion, it was definitely the worst."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The author weaves a complex tale and stirs some powerful images. Chock full of historical and scientific tidbits, the books falters in character development. The actions and motives of the major players are highly implausible, and glossed over too frequently. And there is no plot resolution at all. I was listening to this book on tape and I was certain there had to be more...but there isn't. A good read, albeit flawed, and entirely unfinished. Write your own ending!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"There something about this book that I do not understand myself, it is undoubtedly a magnificent novel but the end is truly a mystery. I wonder if it is a terrible mistake on the part of the Storyteller or a deliberate move by the Author. I think I would choose the latter ..."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla's search for the reason why a young boy runs to his death while the authorities rule it an unfortunate accident makes for a good story. The most interesting and flowing parts of this book surrounded the characters in action. The development of most the characters is too brief causing acceptance of them versus getting to know them. The scientific and environmental detail while necessary and compelling at some points unfortunately more often detracts from the storyline. A little more editing of the story would have helped, and yet at times the text jumps forward causing the reader to fill in the blanks. These inconsistencies are a bit distracting. Overall this not a bad read, I just was expecting more due to the hype about best book of the year. Plot twists are intriguing and creative. Do enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"If you always wanted to read the encyclopedia all the way through but never thought you had the time, Smilla is the woman for you. She knows something about everything, and don't think for a minute that she won't tell you. This lady has more adventures than you can shake a stick at, PLUS she has a nasty habit of pinching, grabbing and inserting things where they may not belong. I don't think I'm the only one who got an X-Filesish feel from this book, especially at the end. I cheated and listened to Smilla on audiotape, but Alyssa Bresnahan's performance is worth checking out if you have 17.75 hours of spare time or you can listen at work like me."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Even those writing laudatory reviews, here, ding this truly superior work for having a psychologically, rather than literally, explosive conclusion. I can only suggest that Hoeg is an author for whom theme is ever unfolding through his characters, and it is the characters to whom we must look here.The character of Smilla, the heroine of this novel, is developed with such nurturing and painstaking clarity and depth that she is breathtaking. She is so sharply defined that even the remarkable mystery in which we meet her becomes secondary. This book is a work of art of the highest order and it may be read for style alone.But make no mistake, this is a compelling story, which is intellectually demanding of the reader.&quot;Smilla's Sense...&quot; is a story of the strength and determination required by social outsiders in sussing out the underlying motivations of people involved in normative systems of control, and protecting themselves from those systems and the people maintaining them. This novel is about power and survival. Like all of Hoeg's other novels, especially &quot;Borderliners&quot;, &quot;Smilla&quot; takes us on a journey describing characters traveling the real and emotional dialectic of moving away from the social center as they are drawn into a deeper understanding of its aims and of its archetypes. Smilla discovers not just facts, but the mythos underlying them.&quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; is an ontology of the marginalized psyche interlaced within a remarkable story of the lengths to which a system can be bent towards the individual ambition for power and control.I hate to make comparisons, but a good summer's serious reading list might include this novel with titles such as Morrison's &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendelum&quot; and DeLillo's &quot;Libra&quot;."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The book that \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" most reminds me of is \\"Moby Dick.\\"It is epic, jam-packed with interesting thoughts and characters, sweeping, inexhaustible, and sometimes exhausting.Fortunately, unlike \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"Smilla\\" is very approachable. It's written in short, punchy sentences, and even though it's 20 years old, it doesn't seem to date.It will tell you more about snow and ice than you realized was possible, just as MD will tell you more about whales that you really wanted to know.But \\"Smilla\\" is also a goldmine of thoughts on lots of things: alienation, colonialism, the value of technology (or lack thereof), intuition, repression, cultural variation, science, math, and more.That's because the book, and the character of Smilla, are profoundly meditative. \\"Moby Dick\\" is relentlessly meditative, a probing of difficult questions on every page; and so is \\"Smilla.\\"This is why the movie versions just don't work. The movies convey the plot. But the plot is only the tip of the iceberg. Much more, and much more important stuff, lies beneath the surface.Smilla herself is a fascinating character: self-aware, acerbic, clear-eyed yet vulnerable to terrible mood-swings, confident but alienated, brilliant but hamstrung by anger and anxiety.And all the characters are good.Hoeg has the gift of creating characters that are at once believable and slightly, interestingly, grotesque.The plot zings wildly to and fro, and yet is never less than intriguing.A rich, questing, questioning book."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This was one of the most interesting books I've ever read. What I found most engaging about this book is Hoeg's ability to make the reader FEEL what Smilla was feeling - the enveloping fog on a cold Copenhagen night, the endless expanse of snow in Greenland, the internal struggles in someone who is half Inuit and half caucasian.Yes, the ending was bizarre and not fulfilling. But the journey there is unparalleled if you allow yourself to get lost in the feeling of the book.Those reviewers who said the book was boring, gushy, slushy, etc., were probably expecting an action-packed cookie-cutter style book ala Clancy and Grisham. Smilla's sense of snow is definitely a unique experience."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I am baffled by the bad reviews that this book has received. In my opinion, this is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Along with the characters from &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, Smila is unforgettable. She is a real, complex, courageous person. The descriptions of Greenland were astonishing. The author's style was hypnotic and I am very grateful that I got to read this marvelous story!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book took me a long time to finish; mainly because the language, the descriptions and the narratives required my full attention at all times to let it all sink in. Peter Heg is an amazing author, and I was very impressed with the English translation as well. I was born in Norway, and know the Scandinavian languages very well, especially the aspects of them that seem almost impossible to translate into good English, and the translator did a fantastic job with this one! Also, being Scandinavian, I could absolutely understand, and even relate to, Smilla's difficulty in adapting to the ways of the Danes; the obedience, the need to trust in authorities.I have to say, though, after having spent quite a few hours getting through this book, the ending really irritated me. Why not go all the way and come to some sort of a conclusion????Great story, though. Got me a bit homesick."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I've counted six authors to whose prose Hoeg's has been compared, just in reading the first page of reviews here. They are all, to a one, terrible comparisons. The one I expected and, inexorably, found, was the comparison to Hemingway. This is because the prose is genuinely hard-hitting. But Hemingway's is not so. Hemingway's prose is studiedly hard-hitting. In other words, Hemingway's prose is a sham. Smilia, as narrator, is anything but a Hemingway character, standing aside watching bullfights with sadistic pleasure. Hoeg/Smilia is like the polar bear Smilia describes as being the only animal that does no grow tense with the rigor of the flight/fright reaction because it has never had any natural enemies. So you don't expect the punches when they land, as you do with Hemingway. The first droll punch is landed at the beginning of chapter Three, \\"It's the kind of day that might make you wonder about the meaning of life, and discover that there is none.\\" Nice. And, lest you let your guard down, another roundhouse is delivered unexpectedly several pages later as Smilia describes her relation with her father, \\"And the mood he brought with him, which was the sum of the feelings he had for my mother; The same kind of soothing warmth that you might expect to find in a nuclear reactor.\\" Another nice one, Smilia. These nice jabs are in the first hundred pages in the first, and best, part of the book, The City, where Hoeg has Smilia as narrator pull off the impressive feat of giving you the background of her life while weaving her way through a maze of questions and emotions.On the other hand, Hoeg is no Conrad. Smilia's introspective musings have their limits and limitations. By the second part, The Sea, one begins to become bored with Smilia's shipmates attempting to toss her into the drink every few pages, inevitably overcome, of course, by Smilia's omnicompetence at getting herself out of each and every scrape with a display of a new set of skills. As for the ending, about which many here complain, I would have been sorely disappointed had Hoeg NOT left us in limbo. But people (Amazon reviewers included) prefer Hollywood endings. Thus the frustration vented here.There are any number of Smilia's musings which I could set down here. They add spice and nuance to what would otherwise be a typical taut, suspense thriller. While not exactly an intellectual, Smilia is nothing if not cerebral. And readers who prefer not to think best look elsewhere. But I can't quote them all. I think the most indicative cerebration, the one that summarises Smilia's outlook and perspective throughout the book, her constant challenging of the reader and herself is the following:\\"Deep inside I know that trying to figure things out leads to blindness, that the desire to understand has a built-in brutality that erases what you seek to comprehend. Only experience is sensitive.\\"I had fun reading this book, rolling with the punches, learning much about natural phenomena and the worlds of Greenland and Denmark. But I don't feel particularly enlightened after putting it down. It's better than the pseudo-literary: Hemingway. But it's not a work of art: Conrad.Still, a very enjoyable read - especially the first section - with fast, at times splendid prose that is deft on its feet. Recommended for all those who love this sort of thing, are equipped with minds and aren't afraid of descriptions of parasitic worms."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's an intelligent and intricate thriller, well written, with a truly superb (and unique) plot. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"What a book! What a story! Terrific, great! and all other such adjectives. Basically a mystery, but so much more. Philosophical, thoughtful, powerful prose. I could easily read it again. My only quibble is that I didn't buy for one minute the heroine, Smilla, as a woman. Even if she was half Inuit. Hoeg may have given her a passion for clothes, but that does not a woman make. I could only picture a man in the role. But it really doesn't matter what sex the protagonist is. And perhaps that's part of what makes this book so good. Smilla is simply a terrific character, completely fleshed-out in the midst of a page-turning story. A lot of wisdom here too. Hoeg was only in his early 30s when he wrote it. Amazing. Kudos to the translator too."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book is old and it's available for the cheaper-than-a-garage-sale price of $.34 cents used. Get it. If you saw the movie, try to erase it from your mind and read the book instead. The only thing that I want to recall from that waste of film is the beautiful little actor who played Isaiah - Clipper Miano.This book moved me with gorgeous and totally original crafted paragraphs that almost seem pretentious, but somehow, they aren't. A man wrote this novel about a female protagonist. This guy has a grasp on the female intuition that is scary. I wish I knew the author - I'd ask him how he created such a believable heroine. The plot is secondary to the surreal writing. It's confusing, non-linear, don't bother trying to follow along. Just let the words fall into your head and appreciate their beauty."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"An amazing debut of a thriller/mystery. Smilla's Sense of Snow is complex, hard hitting and totally addictive, I couldn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. Peter Hoeg creates a truly believable character in Smilla Jaspersen who sets out to prove that the supposed accidental death of a little boy was in fact murder. The book goes at a cracking pace, jumping back and forth between the past and present, (hence the complexity of the book), until finally all questions are answered and Smilla's sense of snow is vindicated. The film is excellent too; it follows the book pretty well, with one or two deviations, which isn't bad, considering that Hollywood has yet to make a film that follows a book to the letter! Read this book and enjoy it, it's worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book was interesting and at times, it even captivated me. However, the intricate details about ice and snow sometimes got to be a bit much, and the ending of the book is one of the worst I've ever read. Smilla is a strong, admirable female character, but while I know this is fictional, I can't imagine her surviving all that she did. It's a worthwhile read, but not a book I'd pick up again."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This was a wonderfully written novel. I have never read anything quite like it before. Truly original in the rich characterizations, pacing, and story telling. I heartily recommend it. Judging by the other reviews, I would have to say just read through this novel, don't get caught up in answering everything along the way. It is a mystery! If you read it strictly for the sheer enjoyment you will reap the benefits by being thoroughly entertained. It is a difficult book, but just enjoy it. Smilla is a terrific female character. I, too, was impressed with the fact that this literary character was created so realistically by a man! Hoeg certainly has a talent to be savored, read, and enjoyed."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I found this book so gripping, both emotionally and plot-wise, that I finished it in two days. It made me afraid to go to sleep, it was so tense and menacing, and yet, it had none of the conventions of a usual suspense novel, which is a genre I usually avoid entirely. The main character is so contrary, intelligent and angry at life, yet so uniquely portrayed, with nary a cliche in sight. Hoeg's insight into a woman's psyche was just incredible ---- the book was more about social politics and power struggles between the sexes, told as an undertone adding to the book's sense of menace, yet Smilla is no whiner --- she is strong and resourceful in a believeable way, although once in awhile she seemed too capable, to the point where it got silly. Still, the compassion for downtrodden human beings that develops out of a general misanthropy is believable and touching. The pseudo-scientific gobbledygook plot twist at the end lost me, and I thought the movie was pretty bad, but otherwise I loved Smilla. It's one of my all-time favorite books. I haven't found Hoeg's other books to approach it in terms of depth and compassion, at least not Borderliners or The Woman and the Ape."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It's hard not to connect with Smilla, especially if you are the type who appreciates Hoeg's introspective and unassuming style. Smilla is the archetype of post-feminism: completely aware of herself as a person and unwilling to connect with a world she sees as unfair to her (as well as her people). The book is surprisingly character-driven, given its plot line, but that does not hurt the suspense in any way. I was guessing until the very end since there seemed to be so many twists that Hoeg needed to tie up. If you bypass all of the technical mumbo-jumbo Hoeg literally LISTS in the end, you will be satisfied, possibly even touched, by this book. Also, I really loved getting such a subversive look at Denmark. I had no idea there was so much tension between Greenlanders and Danes. I recommend this book to readers who like a little fiber in their literary diet... it goes down smooth but it leaves a lot to think about."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Mixing the lurid premise of a rich mystery thriller with the genuine class of a literate novel, Peter Hoeg immediately captured this reader's attention with the title character. Smilla is a strong-willed, bright, intuitive and deeply sensitive woman (and tries to prove she's anything but) who develops an obsession with the strange death of a neighbor boy who, she's surprised to discover, has had deep impact on her life. Smilla is one of the strongest, most interesting women characters in contemporary literature. Her story is provacative and her need to know what happened to the young boy, Isaiah, is infectuous. When her story takes her improbably to &quot;The Sea,&quot; much of the mystery's fascination sails away with her. Hoeg's beautiful writing (and on-target homilies), fortunately, remains. But the last half of the book is rough sailing and the conclusion can't satisfy too many people -- including Smilla, who finally finds what she's searching for (perhaps that's Hoeg's point). You don't have to be smart or literate to appreciate this novel, but Hoeg manages to create a multi-textured world of spirits that will appeal to many levels of different readers."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I loved this book when I read it a long time ago. I read the British version entitled &quot;Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow&quot; which I prefer, it being a literal rendering of the Danish. I thought the characters a little flat, the story vaguely improbable, but no worse for that, but I loved the insight into a place and people I knew practically nothing of. I had always thought that the Eskimos having 27 (or however many it is) different names for snow was similar to the British having 60 or so names for penis; pointless and a bit weird. I now understand why; to an eskimo there are that many kinds of snow and to specify which is which is a matter of life &amp; death. Living, as I do, in the Middle East, I found it wonderful that Hoeg brought his world of ice &amp; snow to where I could see it &amp; feel it and begin to understand it.Disregard those who disliked the ending, found the prose turgid or too dense, or hated the plot. Read this book for it's eloquence on the subject of a persecuted minority you will probably never get to know."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is not an easy book to read; it is challenging both to the reader's intellect and his sense of what conventions a &quot;thriller&quot; should observe. This is no Dick Francis romp (which I also enjoy). I appreciated the story for its suspense, but more for the intellectual and emotional pleasures offered up by the fascinating character of Smilla. She had a most engaging knack for detecting and solving subtle problems which I might characterize as a stubborn, intuitive brilliance. Hoeg excelled in presenting psychological observations of his characters, which, at their best, reminded me of passages in Tolstoy.Another interesting facet of the novel is that it offers a rare chance to understand an ethnic minority unknown outside Scandinavia - Greenlandic Eskimos residing in urban Denmark, who are 20th century consequences of Scandinavian hegemony in Greenland which dates 10 centuries back to the Viking age.Yes, the ending was a little disappointing. But I argue that it would be a mistake to judge this book by its tail, and miss the enjoyment of all the rest."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Luckily, I had just finished reading this before seeing the recently released film version. &quot;Smilla&quot; is a gem. A first-person story told through the eyes of a smart, cynical female misanthrope, Smilla. This social malcontent's gradual, even reluctant, bonding with 6-year old Isaiah is one of the most touching relationships in print. Her rage at his mysterious death, and her stubborn insistence on justice in the face of bureaucratic indifference and personal danger, form the basis of a ripping good suspense novel. The ending stinks, but it doesn't matter. Smilla's character is so compelling and finely wrought, and her motivations so deeply felt that they more than compensate for any deficiencies in plot. I loved how the author pivots the story around Smilla's digressions on subjects ranging from Euclid's concept of 'absolute space' to the subtlties of snow and ice. A very intelligent work. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"an outstanding random pick off the bookrack. One of the most intelligent, and suspensful novels I have ever read.

Original? Yes. Gripping? Puh-lease!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"When I have started reading this book Smilla's Sense of Snow I really thought it would be interesting...I thought wrong. I was thinking that it would be engaging because Greenland would be similar to Alaska-my homeland. Alaska and Greenland have a large verity of similarities: large, cold winter nights, small villages, and small amount of population. However, there are difference between these two vast lands: the culture, the language, the people are all different. In some ways you can find some similarities within the difference for example some natives that can speak their native tongue can understand the dialect.Although Hoeg tries his best to keep my attention, nonetheless the first part of the novel was slow as a glacier receding up the highest mountain. That is where I put the book down and could not pick it up again. There were times were I could not even relate to what Hoeg is trying to say or what he wants me to find in his book. I thought it was a waste of my time trying to read this book and comprehend of what he has written. Many people fine that his novel is the best thing that they have ever read, as for me it is the opposite...it is the worst novel I have ever read. I agree with Katie London from Albuquerque, NM \\"I found myself rolling my eyes at the page; groaning aloud\\" as it became \\"more and more of a boring mess.\\"Another critic I agree with is Affefrau from Irving, TX he said, \\"the rest is not worth reading,\\" there are no other words that I can use to describe this novel. Another person that I agree with is Lazza from London says, \\"...he is trying to much...\\" to add more characters and put a character with in the character. It got more and more characters the more that there were in the novel the more I got confused. I got \\"really disappointed\\" when I could not find any thing that can hook me and reel me in and continue reading.I think that I couldn't find anything that can interest me into reading this novel again. Once I do not like something I let it be known. I really do not like this book! In fact if I were to read any other books by Hoeg I would not even touch the book because I think that his writing is cursed. Cursed into boring, waste of my time, it does not deserve to be read or even put on the self for others to read. Put the book into a volt and throw the away the key. Throw the book into the fire and watch with joy as the ash blow into the sky. Give the book to the dog and watch with bliss as the pages of the book gets torn to pieces. Give to the book to Hades and yet he him self would reject the book. Whatever you do, who ever you are I would not recommend this novel to any one whom it may be."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"&quot;Unputdownable!&quot;, &quot;great!&quot;,&quot;yahoo!&quot; or whatever they put on the cover, plus theoptimistic feeling that a book recommended by someone I really like couldn't be all that bad... that's what it took me to read the book till its utterly disappointing end.Not that the rest is very good either. It starts rather nicely with a mysterious enough description of a cold morning in Copenhagen; then there's the brooding heroine, miss Smila herself, I mean in real life I quite like depressive people, but Smila's not depressive she's just pathologically egotistical. Then there's plenty more, but the further it goes the more difficult it becomes to give a damn about what's going to happen next or about who miss Smila will stab and get away with (on a ship full of vilains!)in the following chapter.As Mr Hoeg kindly reminds us in the last sentence of the book (I don't think I'm spoiling anything here): &quot;there is no conclusion&quot;.So here we are, having struggled through endless descriptions of extraordinary types: you know the world-famous anesthesist whose house in Copenhagen is the size of a 9-hole golaf course, the 30-something alcoholic who, we are supposed to believe, looks like he's 14 and dived with the Danish marines during his military service, the scientist who chain-smokes Romeo y Julieta havanas in his lab, the oh-so-pious retired executive... just to find out that there's something in the snow on an island that could wipe out the whole of mankind, but, you know, the author having already written 300 pages can't be bothered to make this bit of the story relevant.Books can be hard to put down for a number of reasons, let's check out: dazzling prose (NO); gripping story (mmh); great characters (NO); horrible characters whose death one sadistically expects right at the end (YES!) but then again we're let down: no-one smothers Smila Jaspersen to death as she deserves to be. END"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I ordered this book because it was assigned as book club reading. It was well enough regarded to be translated from the Danish and is about an Icelandic outsider and her quest to find an answer. The mood was dreary and the tone was negative. I actually finished it, but it was not fun. I didn't like the story but other people have--it was even made into a movie."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I just finished reading this book- and I did something I've never done before- I destroyed it. I didn't want anyone else to suffer through it. Don't get me wrong, I think Peter Hoeg did a superb job of romanticizing snow, his poetic sense of the permafrost is what hooked me. But the guy needs to learn some plotting and character motivation! This story is long, plodding, and implausible- AND it doesn't even resolve itself!If you want to enjoy this book- then read the first one hundred pages then throw it away- please trust me."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Too long, too pretentious, too turgid, too boring, too self-important. I don't get all the glowing reviews; it's boring."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I could not get through this book. It was boring and slow moving. Smilla is a smug, cold and rather perverse woman who could not hold my interest."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Why, oh why was I tricked into reading this? The title is beautiful, but I didn't care for any of the characters. I admired Smilla's independence, but in general, the book left me cold."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I will give this book a three because it was obviously well-written. I also found the beginning interesting - who ever knew that Greenlanders are a detested minority in Denmark? Also, in the interest of disclosure, I admit that I much prefer a novel to a mystery. However, I absolutely suffered through this book. Nearly everyone in my book club hated it also. We now refer to it as the Insufferable Smilla!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. But at 499 ice-and-darkness filled pages, it was a bit too long. I also found myself constantly flipping back and forth to understand what was going on in this mystery...the names and dates got a little confusing, but maybe I'm just culturally illiterate. Smilla herself was an interesting duck, but images of Julia Ormond kept flashing through my mind, spoiling her tough, self sufficient character. The end of this book was terrible! After slogging through hundreds of pages of scientific and oilfield-type data, I ended up with worms and a meteorite...what was Peter Hoeg thinking? I give this book a 6 for the great, new heroine and the interesting first half of this story. However, this isn't a book for skimmers, or those with light reading pleasure in mind"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Once you get used to the time shifts in the plot, the book is engrossing. Unfortunately, just around that time the plot falls apart and goes way downhill leaving you with an ending that is disappointing. Not worth the time"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Like many other reviewers, the copious good reviews and high recommendations prompted me to read this book.I feel a bit bad rating this two stars instead of three. I actually loved Smilla's character development. Her background is fascinating and I really enjoyed getting inside her head. The problem I have with the book relates to the story telling. I found myself irritated with Smilla for holding things back from the reader. She constantly tells you she's 'looking for something' but doesn't tell you what. She reads a note, but puts it in her pocket and doesn't tell you what it says, only to reveal it later. Obviously this is a core story telling technique, but the story was so confusing that I found it irritated me to the point of making me at times dislike the story's heroine.For me the writing style was too wordy, but the plot did engage me enough to want to finish it. But because I wasn't really enjoying it, I admittedly rushed through. The plot was confusing, and there were numerous scenarios that were not at all believable. For example the shower scene, and when Smilla calls Ravn at the end. A faint radio signal and she goes on for 2 pages in a cat and mouse game to get the story from him? I found it infuriating. There is extended and extended and extended detail about the ship's various compartments, but then story's climax and resolution is only 20 pages.Obviously other people love this book, but it simply didn't appeal to me. Interesting subject matter and character though. If you aren't hooked by the writing style from the start, I would advise leaving this to the side."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This was a really new book, something surprising, a little bit disconcerting. I saw the movie first and then the book (see the movie! Gabriel Byrne rocks as the mechanic, Julia Ormond is a fantastic, tough, smart Smilla, and it's actually faithful to the book) and I found the book just as memorable as the movie. The writing is dense and thought-provoking: Smilla's judgment of everything she sees around her is relevant to everyone and completely uncompromising, and it slaps you in the face."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book wants to be several things at once: a thriller, a political commentary, a philosophical treatise, an evocation of the aesthetics of snow. Unfortunately for the reader it succeeds in none of these genres. The book is at least two hundred pages too long; the plot is unrealistic and, for long patches, quite boring. Hoeg has succeeded in creating a compelling character, mainly because Smilla is so perpetually cranky and cynical. One also learns about the status of Greenlanders of Denmark, which mirrors that of many other immigrant populations in countries around the world. Overall, however, I found this book immensely disappointing and more or less a waste of time. I did learn that one can appreciate subtleties in the world of ice but had little enjoyment while doing so. For a _real_ novel that successfully marries politics with a stirring story and fine, evocative writing, read Charles Powers's &quot;In the Memory of the Forest.&quot;"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I really hate to be the curmudgeon in the face of all the glittering reviews this book has gotten, but I simply was let down by the whole experience. Hoeg is one of those male writers who thinks he can get inside a woman's head, and he has some successes, but he cannot get inside a woman's skin. Smilla, the protagonist, is a 5-foot-2 Greenlander who is trying to investigate the death of a Greenlander boy. She gets herself into big trouble doing it. Throughout the book she has to battle, punch, throttle, kick, stab, and be beat up by huge men. I, who am also 5-foot-2, am here to tell you that unless Smilla spends all her time in the gym, these feats simply are not possible. I also had a hard time accepting her completely emotionless mind, which feels alien to female thought.Really, this is a man's action novel. It takes you through the mud, the ice, the grease, blood, and finally, onto a ship sailing through icebergs and pack ice. There is simply no letup in the assault of pain, drudgery, and dreariness that Smilla must face. Nor is there anyone she can trust.I found myself weary of her task halfway through the book and hoped she might catch a break somewhere, but I was never rewarded. (And does she ever sleep?) She's a human punching bag--and she seems to ask for it.I'd have liked to see an ending to this mystery, and Hoeg presents the rough outlines of one, but there is no clear way Smilla gets home. Books that have no true endings bother me, especially in a novel as cleverly designed as this one, because it wouldn't have hurt the author to provide a finish.All in all, this book would have fared much better had Smilla been a man, and if it were marketed as an adventure/thriller. The writing isn't good enough to make it literary fiction and the characterization of Smilla is only partially done."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"To be frank, I thought this book was pretty much ... The characters (which there were way too many of) were largely unbelievable, the plot was plodding even as it moved through various locations, and the ending was ridiculous.At first, I was intrigued... the icy landscape and detached narrator pulled me in; I thought I could almost feel the chill of Coppenhagen. Unfortunatly, the book turned into an unbelievable action movie. Smilla, the main character, is 5'2, and self described as small and thin (later in the book, as emaciated), yet manages to kick butt continually, throwing men twice her weight around; getting beat to a pulp and yet still managing to continue on with her crusade.The typical best selling thriller cliches are shaded by a surplus of scientific jargon that only makes for a difficult read. I found myself rolling my eyes at the page; groaning aloud as the plot became more and more of a boring mess.A lot of people liked this book, so the appeal I initially saw in it must suceed and withstand for other readers. My main warning for those of you considering this book is that if you don't like main stream thrillers with the same general characteristics hidden underneath whatever coating the author decides to employ, don't bother with this."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The most this book has going for it is its imaginative title and its use of an Greelander that's an expert on ice and snow. The rest is boring, bogged down, self-important and silly."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I liked this book very much! What else can I say! It's wonderful and my impressiones are so great!!! I'm happy to have this book at my home!!!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I'm journalist from Russia, I've read this book and I liked it very-very much!!! I read russian translation but I'd like to read in Danish! May be I'll study this language to read about Smilla in Danish!"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"As a thriller this book fails to catch fire. With a strong character like Smilla, a bit of humour and some deep reflections the book is more of a force. Much of the first half of the book deals with Smilla's feeling of being uprooted from her close-to-nature Greenlandic culture and the clash with being a modern Dane. I liked the mix of moods in this book. Here identification with the dead Inuit child gave the central character more substance and a high moral standing. A more believeable book results. Another thriller The Big Picture by Douglas Kennedy fails at the hurdle of moral ambivalance. On the other hand it is more readable. The literary weight of the Smilla story should not deter as the second half of the book sees a dramatic rush of action. Overall the mood of the book is pleasing and worth taking time to read."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Intelligent, a good read, with strange perspectives. Foreign and philisophical. At first it looks like a mystery, but there is much more to it. The plot is secondary to the characters. If you like it after the first page keep reading."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Hoeg keeps the marvellous suspense up all through the book. As soon as I finished reading it, I reccomended it to all of my freinds, and they loved it to. Peter Hoeg defined the characters so well. The scretive mehcanic, Pofesser Loyen and of course the determined Smilla. The movie followed the book really well and I would reccomend it to you if you like movie type of books"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I've read another of Peter Hoeg's books, &quot;The Woman &amp; the Ape&quot;, which was one of the WORST books ever; yet, this is one of my FAVORITES of all time. I refuse to see the movie, as it is a bastardization of the book(Smilla is supposed to be middle-aged, not svelte and 20!!) I literally could not put this book down...it lingers in the mind. I loved the story settings: it wasn't just in 1 locale, and it did not take place in either New York, LA, London, or Paris, like every other book. If you only like &quot;fluffy&quot; snow, stay away. But if you take perverse interest in getting frostbitten, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg is a large intelligence, that much is obvious. The book elicits a visceral response--the reader can feel the cold and the ice. The problem with the book for me was a lot of buildup surrounding a great expedition, which turns out to be a large meteor. It took me til the end to realize the book was really about science, more so than a mystery or a love story or a geographical tale. Like Annie Proux's Shipping News, the author studied his subject and was able to express it in marvelous detail--proving the old adage that Eskimos have 100 words for snow, Miss Smilla knows her ice formations. The book must be even more compelling in its native Danish language. It was a treat in the Los Angeles flu-infested winter."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"When you read a novel that has been translated from another language, you can sometimes sense it's a translation. Maybe some forced metaphors or strange syntactical constructs, something always gives it away. But saying that, I enjoyed the book and it was refreshing to see a heroine like Smilla; both ballsy and smart. If anything, the 'translation feel' of the book for me added to its foreignness. I don't think I have ever met an Inuit person and this book definitely held my interest, describing cultures and people I have never encountered."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"It is not the danish, who has 20 ways to describe snow! It is people from greenland, who so many ways to describe snow. Smila is half danish, half greenish ;-) Thats why she know so much about snow. If u want to read a fine book u should look for Michael Larsens &quot;the snake in sydney&quot; another briliant danish writer"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book is beautifully written and translated. The most compelling aspect of &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; is clearly Smilla herself - an intelligent, fascinating, but also cynical character, who is often as emotionally cold as the snow she &quot;smells&quot;. Hoeg has done a wonderful job of creating an intriguing and believable character. As a Swede, I also appreciated the sense of melancholy, which is so very Scandinavian, and I find, an often rather depressing element in the book. As a writer, however, I was not very impressed with the plot. (Worms and meteorites, indeed!) Also, many of the love scenes - if you can call them that! - appear to be more the exercise of bodily functions (one physically impossible!) than acts of affection. This may, of course, only be a reflection of Smilla's emotional paralysis. All in all, a beautifully written book that is strong on characterization and social issues, but weak on plotting."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I had nothing to read and picked this up in the 1 dollar box. At first I didn't like it, but before I could toss it I found that the writing and the character of Smilla pulled me helplessly in.I couldn't stop reading despite some of the long extraneous descriptions of things you could care less about...I couldn't wait to read again each day. Smilla was a great, original and believable protagonist. I liked her and her inward struggles with family and misanthropy and then came the last page where for a few moments I'd thought that the book had been damaged and was missing pages...but then I realized that that was _it_ and felt incredibly cheated...What the hell was this author thinking ?"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"A postcolonial thriller set in Copenhagen and Greenland? Unlikely, but here it is, in all its broody frigidity. Unlike many others, I found Smilla to be a fascinating protagonist. Half-Inuit, half-Danish, she is rapidly approaching middle age, and although a world-class expert on ice, she can't hold a steady job. Plagued by something approaching self hatred, excessive introspectiveness, and stubbornness, she is either nasty or sarcastic to almost everyone, never allowing people to see inside her. Perhaps one of the best female characters I've come across that was written by a man, she is not a nice person, nor one would particularly care to know, but she is tough and resourceful heroine. When her one friend, a little neighbour boy falls to his death from the roof, she doggedly pursues the matter as a murder, rather than the accident the police say it is. Her tenacity leads her along a wending path to the Cryolite Corporation, who were involved in mining in Greenland, and eventually to some very powerful, shadowy figures. The semi-procedural tone of this first section works fairly well, as Smilla manages to get others to tell her what she wants to know, without ever kow-towing to them. Her strained relationship to her rich father is ably worked in, as is a potentially burgeoning love affair. Also woven into all this is the tale of Denmark's colonization of Greenland.Having upped the stakes considerably, the second part of the book is a tension-filled high seas affair. She becomes part of the crew on an icebreaker headed way up north in bad weather, in an adventure that she hopes will uncover the reason for the boy's death. The cat and mouse games aboard the icebreaker with the crew and passengers are outstanding, as she tries to uncover the ship's mission. Unfortunately, the final act is the undoing of all that preceded it, as the book veers off into X-Filesish, sci-fi threats to the world, and then fails to end altogether! It's book rich in both human and natural detail, in an interesting, harsh setting, but due to the awful ending, I can't say that I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I have to give Hoeg credit for keeping the reader in suspense throughout the entire book, from the cookie cutter &quot;murder mystery&quot; beginning to the X-Files denouement. However, for all of Hoeg's brilliance at keeping the pages turning with his twists and turns, the ending is a sore dissapointment. Smilla does not appear to change all that much, and there is little resolution to the development of the interesting characters.I recognize Hoeg's talent at developing the characters and weaving social commentary into the novel, but 450 pages is a lot to slosh through for the dissapointment that comes on &quot;The Ice&quot;."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I loved this book. Hoeg's style to write is very self-conscious and well-thought: at very regular intervals he attaches a line: a wisdom with which the reader can (must!) agree. There is something for everyone: the writer refers to everyday phenomena and expresses opinions that the reader fells familiar. The book is very down-to-earth and mystical at the same time: that is an honourable achievement. For a northern reader this book gives a cosy feeling. There lives a little Smilla in every northern person! I can understand it very well, how Smilla knows snow. Peter Hoeg also says some truths about communication in northern areas: silence means something different in sparsely populated areas, such as Greenland or Finland. Silence is not something unbearable, rather, it has to be interpreted in the right way, too, just the same way as words. Also, an easy book to film! (I have not seen the film, though.)"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Completely and accurately describing Smilla's Sense of Snow is like depicting music using words; it is impossible. Like good music, the nvel fils the reader with countless emotions, sensations, wonders, and in the end engulfs him'her with an overall feeling of awe and jubilance. Like a Beethoven or Mozart, Peter Hoeg overwhelms the reader with masterful wisdom and images incomparable to the brainless &quot;shoot-stab-stalk&quot; books of the thriller genre. Like a fine chef, Hoeg provides the reader with food for thought tastefully blended into an appetizing story line and satisfying characters so that th story is a thriller in a unique way."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"There was a defective tape in Smilla's sense of snow I was disappointed but I will not return it the rest were ok"},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Maybe something was lost in translation, but this story is too convoluted and long, and I could not waste another hour reading it.

Watch the movie if you get tired of reading."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I never thought I'd think an action-packed book like this was BORING--but that's exactly what it was. Hoeg was so focused on jamming in every single twist he could think of into the plot that I lost interest in the characters! I absolutely hated the second half of the book--no reflections, no insights, no interesting character moments."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.Why do I think so? Because the book tells a story that is myth/fairytale/saga, with characters and situations that may not be logical and may be a little beyond real, but that make complete sense and have a ring of the profoundest truth--like a dream. Surreal. That's a popular word today. Look at a surrealist painting by Dali or the paintings of Frieda Kahlo--they reach in and touch at the deepest part of the subconscious, where the archetypes sleep.SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is like the myths and fairytales that have survived the Age of Reason and the Industrial Revolution and the Computer Age. The book is exactly like the ancient legends and fairy tales that live on and on, because they talk about things that are very deep and elemental.SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is just like MOBY DICK--but I could never relate to MOBY DICK, and I can relate to this book in the way that MOBY DICK must have taken hold of many people. The book stirs my unconscious without my conscious mind even having to participate, in the way that a Grimm's fairy tale or one of those wonderful Greek myths does. The image of the sea, of the great, huge white whale speaks to us in MOBY DICK. So do the indomitable icebergs and howling blizzards of the frozen North, and so does the monster that lies beneath.To me, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is about how modern man is destroying what is best in the world with science and technology. I feel very deeply that this is so, and it causes me great pain and sadness, and this book stirred all of those emotions and gave them life and shape and imagery.One of my favorite images is Smilla as a grown woman, remembering nursing at her mother's breast, and how beautiful she remembered her mother to be, and the nature of that beauty. What is more elemental and natural, and removed from modern European man, than a Greenlandic Eskimo pausing to suckle her infant during a hunting trip? What is more removed from modern life than an Eskimo traveling over ice and snow and glaciers to hunt for food, orienting herself by developing intimate knowledge of every detail of snow and ice, plus a special, unexplainable instinct?Smilla remembers life with her mother, living as a Greenlandic Eskimo, as a Paradise, even though life in Greenland is one of the harshest on the earth for humans, and even though the life of the Greenlandic Eskimo is often very shot and fraught with danger. And yet being torn from that life was the worst thing that ever happened to her and being part of that life was the best thing that ever happened to her.Paradise Lost. That is what SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is about to me. What does that feel like to someone who has never been an Eskimo? SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW evokes that. Who are the enemies of one who has lost paradise? Read SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"The strange conglomeration of science fiction, political activism, and suspense treats the reader to a very different kind of book. I could not put it down at times; at other times passages did seem to drag on. Hoag has a gift for character development, apparent in the portrayals of Benja and the Mechanic. I found the description of setting to be fantastic, especially in the flashbacks to Greenland. Someone like myself, who did not know much about Denmark and even less about Greenland, would learn very much from this book thanks to the numerous descriptons of the people, the weather, and their societies. My one complaint is that the transition between the two halves of the novel was not smooth; it almost felt as if two different books. Overall I found this to be a very engaging and intriguing novel."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I stumbled upon this book in a second hand book store, and i bought it because i remember reading great reviews here at Amazon. This was a great book, a good old fashion thriller, especially in the second part when Smilla was on the ice ship. I am a little bit annoyed at the ending, you have to draw your own conclusion at what the final ending will be, will she live, die on the ice, go home with the mechanic, will he die, etc. Overall great book, i hope that more of his books will be translated in English."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Peter Hoeg has done something very interesting in Smilla's Sense of Snow. Not only has he very effectively taken on the difficult task of writing from the feminine point of view, but he has in Smilla created a heroine who does not fit into any neat little preconvention. Smilla shocks the senses and shows the reader things we men never knew/or maybe don't want to know about the personal/hidden side of women- that they can be sliding headlong into social deviancy, wrecklessness, and ammoral proclavities, and we will still see them as sympathetic characters, at least this much is true with Smilla. The book itself is a superbly rendered moral lesson filled with the dramatic dialogue you would expect in an action thriller. But it is also a detective story in the truest sense of the word. It is also a lesson in cultural differences and ideaolgy. I bought the book because I figured it had to be better than the movie. Just a hunch. And it was, so much better. Hoeg has become my favorite new writer."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book doesn't have a genre. It's just literature, and it's good literature. Sometimes it seems to be the general opinion that if a book is entertaining it cannot possibly be a work of art. &quot;Smilla's Sense Of Snow&quot; is another book that proves it to be wrong.The most surprising thing about the book is its genuine feeling, its incredibly surreal and yet exquisitely natural flow. Nowadays most authors feel the need to set a fast pace so that the reader doesn't get bored. And, indeed, people have learned to hurry. &quot;Smilla's Sense Of Snow&quot;, however, allows one to look around, actually experience things, not just rush through them. The book seems strangely dreamlike, reading it is a lot like moving through water - you are awed by the alternate world that can be found underwater, and you cannot move swiftly, and after some time you learn to understand the water and appreciate the beauty of simply being.When it comes to women, literature is full of clich&eacute;s. Peter Hoeg's Smilla is certainly not one of them; she is original to say the least. Still, the essence of woman is there. One cannot help but wonder at the way a man has been able to create a woman who's very unlike most women in literature (or life, indeed) so perfectly that she doesn't need to be feminine to convince the reader she is one, even when the reader happens to be female.&quot;Smilla's Sense Of Snow&quot; is a fascinating book. Books such as this one are rare nowadays."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"\\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" starts off as a mystery and ends as a thriller. I liked it better while it was a mystery. The ending was a huge letdown! (...) Smilla should have stayed in Copenhagen.What makes the ending such a dispointment is the novel had a promising beginning. I was completely taken in by page 2 with Hoag's writing style and the excellent translation. I enjoyed reading of Smilla's memories of Greenland and the historical relationship of Denmark with it's frozen colony. Smilla was a tough, cynical cookie but also a spoiled, shallow brat - definately one of the most interesting, complex female characters ever created.Towards the middle, however, Smilla's constant recollection of her homeland and the endless details about ice became tiresome. Okay, she had a great time growing up in in Greenland and missed it, and her mother, fiercely - I got it the first dozen times. Around this point, the novel starts to fall apart and we're left with that horrible ending. I recommand this book but only up until page 300 or so. The rest isn't worth reading.Mr. Hoag, Smilla is still standing in the snow in the middle of Greenland waiting for you to finish the novel. Please do so."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I watched the movie (a good adaptation, which nonetheless does no do enough justice to the book), and decided to read the novel. This is the best thriller i have picked up ever. The writing is intelligent, the story line is intriguing, the characters are well drawn, and the insights into a culture of which i knew nothing about are fascinating. I am willing to forgive certain 'coincidences' that conveniently take place in the story, because over all this is a satisfying novel. And i very much liked the ending."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"From the beginning till the end, Peter Hoeg takes you on ajourney where you will get glimpses and ideas of the ending during theway. A very flowing book with a protagonist that goes throughpersonal suffering of both herself and the people she knows. Smilla sacrifices everything to bring justice to a friend who she believed was forced to jump off a roof. An enjoyable novel for anyone who likes the work of Peter Hoeg or is interested in a story with more depth."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"All of the reviewers who hated the ending, or said it was no ending, seem to have forgotten the most important thing: Smilla's Sense of Snow. In the end, she is letting Tork to kill himself because he doesn't know what he's doing or where he's heading (and she DOES). So by doing nothing, letting his figure recede into the darkness, she kills him just as surely as if she had shot him. Her ending statement about there being \\"no resolution,\\" I feel is merely a statement of fact, that no matter how much time passes, the world is never in agreement about how to handle the mysteries and problems of science. We learn to split the atom and thereafter plunge the world into a permanent state of dread. The \\"worms\\" of this story are very much like Hitchcock's \\"red herrings\\" in his movies, except in this novel they are mere placeholders for any and every horrific scientific discovery or advance that will always and forever be used for profiteering and the waging of war. I feel very protective of this novel because I identified SO strongly with Smilla. She walks through the world alone because she is so different from other people and has such a hard time finding people with whom she can identify and feel comfortable. No wonder that little Isaih became so vital to her, a real human connection that was the closest thing she had ever experienced to motherhood. I beg of any reader not to be put off by the numerous negative reviews about the ending. It is true that the first part of the book is better written and more deeply satisfying, but if the last bit is not to anybody's taste, at least by then you should so admire Smilla that you will go with her to that conclusion."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Thank you Peter Hoeg for the best book I've read in ten years, deeply sensitive and meaningful characters. Transportive to the point one feels a lowering of body temperature while savouring this expressive writing, every chapter a flurry of impressions that settle in snowy layers. Absolute depth perfection...."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This novel that I wanted very much to like, and which came highly recommended by readers whom I respect. However, even though I tried and tried again, I simply could not get into Smila's Sense of Snow.At first I thought I just wasn't getting it so I redoubled my efforts. The slow pacing, the symbolism, the endless philosophical musing - is there a point? Or am I just missing it? But in the end, this is a novel that tries to be everything at once but simply ends up spinning its wheels.Hoeg tries a bit of everything, from veiled psychological motives to philosophy to action scenes complete with fiery explosions, and even a bit of sci-fi - but the net effect is simple boredom. It was sheer determination that kept me turning the pages. Summary: boring, pretentious, overwritten, unbelievable. Hoeg tries to pull the wool over our eyes hoping we'll mistake the glacial pacing and opaque philoso-babble for profound thought. Thoughtful readers won't be fooled."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Both author and translator are extraordinarily talented. I found myself highlighting passage after passage in this book just for the sheer beauty of the writing. Consider this description of how the sea freezes: \\"The water grows viscous and tinged with pink, like a liqueur of wild berries. A blue frog of frost smoke detaches itself from the surface of the water and drifts across the mirror. Up out of the dark sea the cold now pulls a rose garden, a white blanket of blossoms formed from salt and frozen water.\\"It is also worth noting that petite scientist Smilla is the angriest thriller protagonist I have ever encountered, once she gets going. She makes Dirty Harry look like Charlie Brown by comparison. The novel builds, methodically and with increasing speed, toward a thunderous climax.As several readers have noted, the tinge of science fiction toward the end of the narrative seems extraneous and unnecessary, but the book is so strong in every other respect that I didn't mind at all."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This book wound together the best elements of Scandanavian mystery with the magical realism that I most equate with Pedro Paramo. I just loved it. The only thing I can imagine about the negative reviews is that they're given by people who just want to be entertained without thinking. They'd do better to stick with Janet Evanovich. No disrespect meant to Janet. I enjoy her work, also, but it's clearly meant to be enjoyed with no effort on the part of the reader."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I simply stumbled upon this book while on a Northern European Crime Fiction spree. This is not merely a crime novel. This is a piece of amazing literature with a crime at the core. Beautifully written, this story evokes the cold northern winter and the people that live in it. However, it is also a story that shows how much some are willing to sacrifice for their personal gain and advancement."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"I found this story line very interesting and Smilla as a character completely original. I know some have found the end of the novel disappointing, but the end, to me was simply a continuation of the story--it drifted off into the mysterious snow and I found that as intriguing as the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels. Smilla's story is epic and mesmerizing and her struggle to discover many things in this novel is fresh and unique. I read this many years ago but revisiting it is always a pleasure. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for something different and timeless. Many will find this dense and daunting, but give it a try. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"...or lack thereof. It let the whole thing down a bucketful. Perhaps it's me, perhaps I'm just not sufficiently literate. Up to then, I had thoroughly enjoyed this very unusual thriller with its very unusual non-super but highly intelligent and doggedly persistent heroine, the wonderful atmospheres conjured up and the problems of the second-class Greenlanders in Denmark. I was furiously reading to find out what was there in Greenland and how Smilla would find her way out of THIS one, but no! A five-star read, if you can find a copy without the last page. Better to be disappointed at what you may have missed, rather than read what actually was there and be REALLY disappointed."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Smilla is a fascinating, if obnoxious, character. Her journey to find out what the true cause of her little friend's death holds some real fascination. Frankly if the last two chapters had held up to the rest of the book, I'd be giving it five stars. Unfortunately the author fails to provide any resolutions. At the end all is known, but nothing is settled. Our heroine is stranded in more senses than one; vindicated, but unable to do anything about it. I wanted to send the author an excerpt from Orson Scott Card's book on novel writing - the section where he discusses how and when to end a book - because this wasn't the way to do it."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"This literary mystery, set partly in Copenhagen and partly in Greenland, distinguishes itself from the gamut of mysteries that flood bookstores these days. Smilla, a woman of partial Greenlandic origin, is fascinating, complex, and has a low tolerance for the bureaucracy with which she constantly battles. Her investigation into the death of her young neighbour stems from the strong connection and devotion she felt for the boy. When Isiah turns up dead at the apartment building - he has seemingly fallen from the roof - Smilla instantly senses foul play. Her connection to and knowledge of snow remains a central component to the plot. Smilla's relationship with a reclusive neighbour has more implications than she initially believes which adds to the intrigue. The one weakness of the novel is its tendency to drag, especially in the middle segments of the book. Hoeg sometimes dives too extensively into detail and these technical forays tend to weaken the pace of the novel. All in all, one of the best mysteries around these days. A book that will clearly appeal to enthusiasts of suspense as well as to those who enjoy well-written, character-driven literature."},{"Title":"Smilla's Sense of Snow","review":"Reading this novel was enlightening experience. Smilla's effort to discover the truth about a crime leads her to rediscovering herself. Hoeg creates a new genre - the philosophic detective story with elements of suspense and lyrical self-reflection. What struck me was the Smilla's knowledge of the world. She has such a strong character that it may enchant anybody who, like her, is seeking for adventure and solution of final riddles."},{"Title":"The Emperor Charles V: The growth and destiny of a man and of a world-empire (Jonathan Cape paperback)","review":"No small wonder this biography was the result of a life times dedicated work: Packed with scholarship and human understanding, Brandi reveals the imperial Hapsburg Emperor, Charles V, to have been more constant in his convictions than many other prominent monarchs that stepped upon the fickle stage of the renaissance.A brief perusal of his reign usually brings in all the negative verdicts: He failed to prevent the Protestant split from the Catholic Church; he failed to check Turkish advances into Europe; the sack of Rome in 1527 by imperial troops occurred during his watch; he allowed the inquisition to carry on its work and endorsed the rebellious, barbaric behaviour of Cortez in the New World.Yet it becomes clear that the Popes in Rome and Kings of France and England deserve more the stigma of the first two of those failings.To further French expansion at the expense of the Hapsburg's Francois 1st, \\"The most Christian King,\\" was in open allegiance with the Turks and took what opportunities that came to breathe life into the Protestant resistance in Germany: While Henry VIII challenged the supremacy of Rome not out of any acts of conscience but because the Popes could impede the flow of his revolving marital door by refusing a divorce.The Papacy's refusal to excommunicate Francois 1st for his unholy alliance with the Turk drew scathing criticism from German Protestants and momentarily brought them closer to their Catholic Emperor. Charles himself strove repeatedly for conciliar agreement both in political as well as ecclesiastical matters, calling council after council throughout the different kingdoms of his European empire. Loathe to shed Christian blood, force of arms became the last resort. Yet his personal example to lash out at the Turks (he succeeded in dealing a temporary blow to the piracy of the Sultan's admiral, Barbarossa, in Tunis) was never given continued impetus by others.Again, unlike his power hungry contemporaries, Charles formally retired from his position of Emperor to live the last years of his life quietly in Spain. His vast inheritance bequeathed intact to his son, Phillip II.This superhuman achievement could not be done by Charles alone and Brandi brings into the narrative the Emperor's able advisors, and the resilience of other family members that helped hold together such a sprawling conglomerate of European lands. Why no full length biography exists in English of Margaret, regent of the Netherlands and Queen Mary, her successor (Charles' aunt and sister), is a mystery. Particularly when the Antonia Fraser School of female historians exult any heroine they can find; a dual biography of those two remarkable women whose back to back reigns covered many years is long over due!C.V. Wedgwood's translation from German into English makes reading such a substantial biography nothing but smooth sailing: Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bridge Across My Sorrows: the Christina Noble Story Hb","review":"I had to choose a book for a school Book oral review and I was stuck. I couldn't find a good book to read so I asked my teacher and she recommended this book to read and It truly is the Best Book Ever.It tells a story of great suffering. Christina as a young child lost her mother at the age of 10 and had an alcoholic Father. She was forced onto the streets when her Mother died and her father couldn't look after her and her sisters and brothers. They were sent to different Orphanages and were told that their siblings were dead. Christina went to live with an uncle and an aunt but was sexually abused by the man many times. So too was her younger sister Philomena. She left there and live d ina burrow in a Park where she grew up. She ate card board and drank water from puddles. While she was out obne night she was gang raped by 4 men and fell pregnant soon after.She left for a new life to England where her brother wa. Her suffering was not to end there. She entered into a very violent marriage where she was repeatedly beaten. She was overworked and was sick. She left her greek husband Mario. She had a dream about going to Vietnam and helping the street children of vietnam because she too was a street child.She told her second gusband of her dream and soon she left for Vietnam. Although she had nothing, she had alot to give to the street children of Vietnam. She has built shelters and Medical Centres.

We hear so much of what the world says is &quot;sucess&quot;, yet here is a woman who writes of true success. Taking a tradegy and turning it into a triumph. If this book does not inspire you, challenge you and propel you into action for the world's poor, nothing will."},{"Title":"Bridge Across My Sorrows: the Christina Noble Story Hb","review":"Like many other readers who read this book, I couldn't help myself reading it until I've finished. The story is full of love and at the same time, sadness. The childhood of Christina was really poor, homeless, being abused, lack of love..... However, she didn't give up, she kept on working to achieve her goal/dream -- help the street children in Vietnam. Even though there're lots of problems for her to solve, her experience gave her strengths to over come all these obstacles. Finally, she succeeded, thousands of children in Vietnam got help from her, She's no longer lonely and desperate but enjoying her life surrounded by love.

I am very pleased to add this book to my own personal library, as it is full of well-researched information about kimono and the evolution of kimono fashion in Japanese history.A multitude of full color plates, pages of useful footnotes and references and even sturdy paper (in both paperback and hardback editions) make this a worthy coffee table book as much as a useful resource that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"When Art Became Fashion: Kosode in Edo-Period Japan","review":"If you are interested in kimono: art, culture, and history ...THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!

I loaned my copy to a friend a decade ago; I'll never forgive him for decamping across the country with it and not leaving a forwarding address.This deceptively simple book (it could, and I think should, be used as a textbook for on-the-ball middle school students) discusses the difference between what we say and what we mean, and how separate the two, especially when discussing things that can't be tied back to things in the physical world.In addition to being an utterly practical (of how many philosophy books can that be said?) introduction to metaphysics, the book's closing essay is a wonderous impassioned cry for clarity, wisdom, and tolerance in an increasing crass and muddleheaded world. Find it. Read it."},{"Title":"Language & the pursuit of truth","review":"I read this book as a teenager, as a prior reviewer suggested everyone should.

I reread it this year, and was struck once again by the clarity and usefulness of its approach to getting at the truth of a statement. Basically, its approach follows three steps:(i) Know what the statement means.(ii) Know the right way to verify it.(iii) Collect the evidence.The author then categorizes statements into five types: imperatives and attitude-statements; empirical statements; analytic statements; value statements; and metaphysical statements. He then shows how the foregoing approach applies in each case.I echo the views of an earlier reviewer, who said that it is a great pity that this excellent, and very readable, book has been allowed to fall out of print. It should be required reading for every high-school student."},{"Title":"Transculturalism: How the World Is Coming Together","review":"I imagine this was quite a 'trendy' book to own when it came out in 2003. On retrospect though, it doesn't seem a particularly relevant text to own in the 2010's.Some of the foresights on who are going to be tomorrow's multicultural 'stars' were wrong, the movers and shakers they claimed to be taking over in the world of the arts still largely unknown and some of the features just, well, desperate. There are 'cutting edge' pieces on 'new' subcultures like 'The Aggressives' (Aka Lesbians) and 'Transmen' (Transexuals) as well as 'Space Invaders' (Graffiti artists) and at times it can be cringeworthy in its self indulgence, culminating in an hilariously egoic, insecure piece a director (Michael Power anybody!?) did about himself, encouraging friends to say what they loved and hated about him. There are some interesting moments; most of Claude Grunitzky's articles hold weight, especially the piece about French Hip Hop. Journalist Sara Elise Patterson provides a nice travelogue and Alex Sharkey's 'What is Cool?' is fun. The problem is that the book is SO trendy, it probably only REALLY mattered for the few months after it was published. 2000 and late one might say.Where the book does succeed though is in looking at where the world was in 2003 and is interesting in that, you can see traces (no pun intended) of how we got to where we are now. It's also quite amusing to see how fleeting the world of the fashionista is. Some of the subjects/writers believe in their trends SO much, but with the advantage of being able to look back, the style over substance approach is almost painfully evident.Overall a pretty unique, interesting read, but (I imagine...) not the way they intended it to beJ Pitts"},{"Title":"Transculturalism: How the World Is Coming Together","review":"How provocative, challenging and even optimistic is this anthology of essays, edited by the insightful Claude Grunitzky, you may ask? Very much so on all counts. The writers are well aware of the capability of thinking, visionary individualists to transform and improve an advanced capitalist consumer society that is within a century of decline due to the depletion of resources, overpopulation and incresing intolerance (including that of one \\"reviewer\\" below, Matt, who clearly has not read this anthology). The fusion of cultures is inevitable in a society with instantaneous communications capability, from the McCluhanesque \\"cold\\" medium of television to \\"hot\\" radio and interactive Internet media. The book amkes no claim that other cultures ghave \\"equal\\" voice with or within western imperialism, but that such a voice is subject to the cultural transformation. The book would indeed be offensive if Matt's allegations were true -- but they aren't. Get it. Read it. Judge for yourself.

There is a presumption that you, the reader, are already a bookkeeper or accountant and are already familiar with the basics of bookkeeping.The book goes into aspects of GAAP that are likely pertinent to many non-profits.

Well, this one doesn't seem to be much different - which just goes to prove that accounting doesn't change at the same pace as Information Technology. It has the same chapter headings, and the text also appears to be broadly the same.The printing and the type face is fine for people over 40.

What makes it tick? Why do I have to fill out a friggin' time sheet every friggin' week? Answers to burning questions like those await you.You'll also find it most useful if you have some accounting or financial analyst background, because it does get into the P&amp;L and balance sheet equations a bit, and generally assumes that you know what it's talking about.I have had an accounting class or three (I'm in the process of taking the CFA), but even so, I found myself wondering if i'd bother reading the book every time I hit one of the accounting bits, which I found to be the low points.The most successful parts of this book were the areas in which the author discusses the tradeoffs between the &quot;Creeping Minority&quot; and &quot;Earn-out&quot; methods of acquiring a PSF; lays out the pros and cons of being a product or sector-focused PSF; and the writing on the underlying economics of a PSF, including the bit on organizational structure, utilization and charge-out rates.And mostly, Scott writes about all of this in an unadorned, easily-understood style.

It will be his first time coaching, and even though he is a year-round competitive swimmer, this book is perfect for him. While it is written for the parent volunteer coach it is also perfect for any first time coach - regardless of age and regardless of their swimming knowledge.The section on communication is insightful and outlines quite a few tools for teaching a skill to novice swimmers - tools that can be used for teaching children just about anything. The gifted and experienced educator might think of these things as second nature but anyone new to coaching needs to think about how to go about it and this book provides that information.When reading about how to constructively criticize and encourage young swimmers my son exclaimed,\\"Hey, that's exactly what my coach does!\\"The sections on planning and safety are thoughtful and thorough. The drills and skills outlined in the book are the basics and those that every coach goes back to time and again. The sample practice outline is perhaps a little ambitious for the average summer league team with too little time in the pool, but it is a good outline and can easily be adapted to the limits of shorter practice times.The down side: The section on Conduct of a Meet is so basic that if you don't already know it, you really shouldn't be coaching a swim team.One thing missing that would be helpful is a primer on how to seed a dual meet.The book is exactly what the product description claims: A guide for the first time coach of novice swimmers. I reccomend it to anyone new to coaching swimming."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"The posted reviews giving this a high rating are NOT OF THIS KINDLE EDITION, but are of the printed Latham-Matthews edition.

A modern reader should wait for something better to come along."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"When I started reading the diary, I expected it to be extremely boring and very old fashioned (seeing how it was written in the 1600's) - how wrong I was!!!Samuel Pepys (pronounced 'peeps') is a human, funny, moody man who has his ups and downs like the rest of us. His narrative during the plague records his concern about neighbors, and his real sorrow when people he knows succumb to it. He also records his experiences during the great fire of London in 1666 and his first mention of it strikes me as entirely human - he says that his maids wake him as they have heard of the fire and as it is not near his doorstep he simply goes back to bed as he's tired. He has arguments with his wife, and has cast a lusty eye upon the kings mistress for years! He also has, what I call 'mini affairs' where he kisses and fondles women quite regularly, (including his own maids) and seems to have no guilt about this whatsoever. Most mornings he 'drinks' his breakfast and at one point is outraged that his new wig is teeming with nits! An historical and very human read.

They say far more than my own contribution.I have read in and out of the Pepys' diary more than once. I did this in part because I have read many times that they are the ' best diaries' ever written. Without contending with that I found that they were not for me the most interesting. This probably shows more about my own shortcomings than it does about the work of Pepys.Pepys' work is filled with description of the life of the time. It is rich in perception of the great city of London in Restoration times. It is filled with personal anecdote, gossip including that relating to his prodigious sexual appetite and activity. It is a busy, businesslike work. And it tells more about a world outside than a world in.In the diaries I most love there is the quest of the soul to deeply understand itself and its relation to other people, and God. I find that the flurry of activity in the life of Pepys does not lead to this kind of reflectiveness. And thus for me the 'diary' is not a highly significant work personally."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"Reading Samuel Pepys diary is an extraordinary experience because it blends the intimate personal details of this very public man of the 17th century with some of the most dramatic moments in London history. Pepys moves back and forth in successive daily entries between recording his marital ups and downs , his personal struggles with temptations of the flesh and career successes and the tumultuous events that he witnessed first hand. His descriptions of the Plague of 1665 and the Great London fire of 1666 are unequaled. As an influential minister in the Royal Navy he had access to and was acquainted with much of the aristocracy in the England of his day and had direct knowledge and access to King Charles II during the restoration years. This edition of his diary is abridged and contains the years 1660 thru 1669. From the coronation and return to the monarchy through the Dutch-English war Pepys' perpective is enlightening and entertaining. I can't think of another book that I've read that places the reader in such intimate contact with a time and place so far removed. By the time you are finished with this you will have learned much and become acquainted with a pretty interesting and engaging character in Mr. Pepys. Highly recommended to anyone interested in this period and would enjoy an insiders view of restoration London."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"I ordered this diary because I am teaching history to undergraduates. When it arrived I was surprised that the edition had no publisher, no editor, did not contain the complete diary and had no explanation of why edits were made. The book is surprisingly large and formatted unprofessionally. I returned it to Amazon. I am certain there are better editions out there, and I would be embarrassed to have this one on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"Ever since I found a circa 1950's diary in an old attic rummage sale on a vacation in Maine when I was about 8, I've been fascinated by old diaries. It also helps that I'm fascinated by history in general. So bring together great historical periods (ie the Great Fire of London) with diaries (and such honest ones as this are rare) and you have a classic. The language was a bit challenging at first - but like reading Shakespeare, if you just get used to it, it suddenly seems normal (reading it out loud also helped me get in the 17th century zone). It was interesting to see so much history witnessed by a normal person (albeit one of the upper class). His personal life was quite \\"colorful\\" too, which added some flavor to it, too. Definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"Very entertaining and enlightening. Pepys gives us a glimpse of what life was like in that period before the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" in England which was so important in the developement of democracy in England and the United States. Pepys was on the wrong side of that revolution - a loyalist to King Charles II, although he was never convicted of treason. Good thing, since there seemed to be a lot of beheadings, etc. in that era. Occasionally, it is not absolutely clear what Pepys is talking about, and sometimes the vocabulary is not easily understood,as language and customs have changed, but that is to be expected."},{"Title":"The Diary of Samuel Pepys (11 Vol. Set, complete with Index)","review":"I purchased the audiobook read by Kenneth Branagh. He does a great job with the reading. The diary itself is very revealing. I learned a lot about the times in which Samuel Pepys lived."},{"Title":"In Search of the Lindbergh Baby","review":"Theon Wright should be closer than most to the truth of this enigmatic case. He was a young reporter who covered the Lindbergh case and, according to his book, he uncovered direct connections between Isidore Fisch (linked to Bruno Hauptmann) and members of the Morrow (baby's grandmother's) household. However, the book is a rambling mess, with possibiities hinted at but never set out clearly. The reader is left to infer key connections, probably wrong.The core of the book depends on the little corpse found four miles from the house not being that of the Lindbergh child. He bases this on a discrepancy between the height on the \\"missing\\" poster and the height of the remains found. However, he does not take into account the measurements in a letter from the child's own doctor to the grandmother, eight days before the remains were discovered. Neither does he account for the little shirt found on the body that matched flannel and thread still held by Betty Gow (the shirt's maker).Unless the author has/had very good reason to discount all of this evidence, the book falls down on its key premise.The book should not be discounted in entirety - it raises some very interesting points about the gang (or gangs) involved in the ransom demands, and it throws a lot of doubt on Hauptmann as a lone kidnapper. The book needs reorganising and a stern editor."},{"Title":"In Search of the Lindbergh Baby","review":"The author covered the original trial as a journalist and felt that the true story was never told. This book has pictures but lacks an index and table of contents. \\"History ... consists of events and facts, and sooner or later the truth emerges.\\" Theon Wright believes the conviction and execution of Bruno Hauptmann was a miscarriage of justice. Wright first believed Hauptmann was guilty, until he found gaps in the prosecution's story (p.6). Wright met Harold Olson, who amassed records of the case and believes he is the lost Lindbergh child. Public opinion is not as inflamed as it was during the trial.In Chapter 1 we learn what Harold Olson was told about his parents. Young Olson's pictures are compared to the Lindbergh baby, but we see no pictures of his parents. [The Lindbergh baby seems to have a cleft in his chin, Olson does not.] Wright's oldest daughter, a newspaper reporter, discovered this news, and referred them to her father. Chapter 2 tells of the kidnapping and discovery of the body. There is a question of overlapping toes, and the length of the corpse. Part One has the many stories of the people connected to the case. Chapter 7 quotes the legal journal 'Forum' to question the conviction of Hauptmann. Part Two tells of the investigation that went on for two years. Many false leads were followed. Chapter 10 has many interesting observations, but some may have been taken out of context (Condon's quotes). Part Three covers the trial. Chapter 12 tells about the eyewitnesses. Are eyewitnesses reliable when there is no corroborating evidence? No fingerprints matching Hauptmann were found on the ladder, in the nursery, or on ransom notes (Chapter 13). What happened to the records of the Lindbergh baby's fingerprints? Was Rail 16 tampered with? Who tampered with the shelf that contained the shoebox (Chapter 14)? Wright says the police records needed by the defense were withheld, \\"too late to help Hauptmann\\" (Chapter 15).Part Four covers post-trial investigations, and \\"unanswered questions\\" in Chapter 16. Two important things stand out: Hauptmann had an alibi for that night, and there was a discrepancy in the height of the body. Either would clear him of the kidnapping. Chapter 17 explains the background of Gov. Hoffman's interview with Hauptmann: important people questioned the verdict. Did Reilly take a pay-off to sell out his client? Chapter 18 has questions about the case. Gov. Hoffman had police records that were not made public. Hauptmann was guilty of extortion, the evidence was insufficient for kidnapping and murder. Page 215 summarizes the mysteries of this crime. Chapter 19 tells of the Paul Wendel confession (he was a lawyer who once represented Isidor Fisch).Part Five deals with the question of identity of the body found. If Harold Olson is the lost Lindbergh baby, what then? Fingerprints (or DNA evidence) could resolve this question. Would a psychic then or a profiler now help at all (Chapter 20). What happened to the Lindbergh baby's fingerprints (Chapter 21)? Chapter 22 tells of FBI surveillance of Harold Olson from 1968! Part Six provides some theories on the crime. Wright wonders why Lindbergh assumed full charge of the investigation given his inexperience (Chapter 23). Wright explains the legal reasoning for shifting from a gang crime to a lone kidnapper (Chapter 24). Was John Hughes Curtis in contact with the kidnap gang? Or merely a patsy? Who coordinated the media campaign against Hauptmann? Chapter 25 shows the weakness of this book: emphasis on the predictions of a psychic to solve a crime. How could Lindbergh have controlled the investigation? [Something has been hidden here.] Wright disparages \\"the New Jersey and New York police\\", but they only follow orders from the politicians, as in all other states. Whoever stole the baby also gained the sleeping suit, a proof of guilt. Who was it traced back to? Note how this book, like others, skates over this question. Could someone look like Lindbergh? As a popular figure he would have many admirers. We now know of one girlfriend and three children in Germany! David Wilentz's son Robert was a lawyer, politician, and Chief Justice of the NJ Supreme Court; he was adamantly opposed to capital punishment. That may be the final verdict on this case."},{"Title":"Primary handbook for bassoon","review":"First, my disclaimer! I'm not a music/band teacher, so I really can't say much about the content of this book from an expert's view. I bought the book for my son's music/band teacher who doesn't have much experience with the bassoon but who bravely agreed to help him begin to learn bassoon.The book looks like a good basic overview of teaching a beginning bassoonist. I believe there is a paragraph saying that the book is meant to be a resource for teachers who are teaching bassoon, but not experts themselves. There are several diagrams throughout the book. The writing is clear and the book seems to be well-organized.I offered the book to my son's teacher with the caveat that I didn't know if it would be useful or not, and she chose to keep it so she must have felt the content would be useful to her. And, perhaps, the proof is in the pudding; my son is learning and enjoying the bassoon!It looks like a useful book to me.

I also recommend buying the test data bank, which also runs by the same author and publisher. The depth of the topics covered, do not reach beyond a high school level general biology class.

The introduction breaks down the development theories into three broad categories: one associated with the capitalist West utilizing Weber's theories of Protestant thrift; a second one associated with the communist East, namely the theories of Karl Marx, Lenin, Trotsky; and third the corporatist theories of Emile Durkheim associated with Catholic societies during medieval times. These three approaches to development in Latin America depending if you are on the right, left or in the middle are discussed in detail in this excellent survey work. The section on Marxism is particularly sharp as it explores dependency theory and the modes of production controversy as exemplified by the polemics between Gunder Frank and Ernesto Laclau. The section on corporatist theory examines what is called the bureaucratic authoritarian (BA) model of many countries in South America. A brilliant book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Prehistoric Figurines: Representation and Corporeality in the Neolithic","review":"This is one of the most extraordinary books about archeological discoveries in the last 20 years, and offers great insights into the Balkan neolithic cultures, which are so little known and mysterious outside of their respective regions. these cultures such as Cucuteni and Hamangia are captivating, and as a person originally from romania I am simply amazed. I applaud Mr. Bailey for writing this relevant book- not only its archeological validity, but as a new way to understand the neolithic past, to see that after all, people were not so primitive back then. they culture is totally fascinating. This is a must read book for anyone who cares about the beginnings of civilization, lost civilizations, and the history of art.

Given the failure rate of marriages, I feel like people need to go in with their eyes open, not squeezed shut and just, like, hoping for the best. Tough as it is to read--I mean emotionally--this book should be required reading for engaged couples."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Author Pamela Paul identifies a growing pattern of young marriage and divorce, and documents likely causes (people getting married to complete a 'power couple' life, or to move out of their parents' houses, or out of fascination with weddings, or because they've been dating a long time and marriage is easier than breaking up). She also describes the demographic trends that may have led to younger marriages and easier acceptance of divorce in the current crop of 20-to-30-year-olds. Finally, Paul discusses the emotional wreckage left by these divorces, and analyzes public policy that can minimize the damage.\\"Melissadec\\" complains that Paul is \\"inconclusive about what to do about the problem\\".This book is a serious study of a topic often trivialized by guides to being a \\"buff bride\\" or \\"how to win your dream man\\". It is, at times, heartbreaking. It is also very well written, and worth anybody's time."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"If more of Paul's assertions were substantiated by research (only about half are), I would give this book five stars. Even as it is, her assertions ring so true to me that not having footnotes corroborating her points is utterly forgiveable. Both her descriptions of society at large and her theories of individual reasoning behind decisions are recognizable to me and apply to my own life experiences and decisionmaking processes.This book is excellent for both young divorcees, to help understand what happened and where to go from here, and for not-yet-marrieds, like me, who are wondering how to make the first marriage be the lifelong and the last one. It's a quick read, and I really didn't expect it to ring as true as it does, on so many levels. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Pamela Paul gives her audience an excellent account of the causes and effects of a far-reaching social phenomenon called the \\"Starter Marriage.\\" Paul makes an emotional plea to her readers, whatever their current or past personal status, for opening their eyes and ears about the challenges and rewards of marriage. Her positive message is especially relevant because many of her readers have been actors or witnesses of starter marriages.

Louisville, KY"},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"In The Starter Marriage, Pamela Paul provides an interesting mix of statistics and stories to flesh out an unexplored phenomenon in the world of modern marriage. While several decades have passed since divorce became commonplace, the increase in &quot;starter marriages&quot; is something different.Starter marriages, lasting less than five years and producing no children, are much simpler to dissolve than the traditional divorce, which is followed by years of visitation, support payments, and often legal conflict. Yet the emotional aftermath of a starter marriage is more serious than one might imagine. You will walk away from this book with a new understanding and familiarity which Ms. Paul is particularly able to give, being both a professional in demographics, and a veteran of her own starter marriage."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Pamela Paul does an excellent job here breaking down what she describes as a &quot;starter marriage&quot;: a childless first marriage for someone in their twenties lasting less than five years. In interviews with sixty starter marriage survivors (all white, middle class Gen Xers), Paul explores how, when, and why this generation seems to be rushing headlong into and out of marriage. (For the first generation to be raised in a culture of widespread divorce, we seem to be remarkably optimistic about the raptures of the marriage state.) Her examination is thorough and compelling. Paul strikes an easy balance between research and anecdotes that keeps most of the book moving nicely.While Paul lays out the evidence well, she does a much poorer job tying it together nor does she do a great job objectively presenting the &quot;pro-marriage&quot; point of view. I would be more convinced by her argument if it didn't appear clouded by her political beliefs. For example, after setting up a straw man of the &quot;promarriage camp&quot;, she asks: &quot;Who's pro-marriage now?&quot; Uncalled for.On the whole, a fine book. I would recommend two things: skip the last two chapters and, if you're depressed by the anecdotes, read &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; by Betsy Stone for ways to combat some of the pitfalls Pamela Paul points out."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Paul has done extensive interviews with more than sixty individuals who have had what she terms \\"starter marriages\\"--marriages that end soon, within five years, and are without children. She sprinkles anecdotes from these interviews liberally throughout her book, and they are touching, poignant, and informative. Unfortunately the rest of her book doesn't live up to the anecdotes.Paul cobbles together facts and figures from a variety of sources without an in-depth exploration of what these facts and figures might mean. She also often resorts to unsupported or dubiously supported assertions--for example, at one point she backs up an assertion that modern generations are increasingly impatient and unable to deal with change with the \\"factoid\\" that most people will not wait more than eight seconds for a web-page to load before going elsewhere. I found this a somewhat less than convincing support for her argument.Some have complained that Paul caricatures the pro-marriage movement, which I feel is an accurate criticism of her book, and she is also often inconsistent. For example, she asserts that pre-divorce counseling programs will not stop divorce because her informants essentially felt that their marriage was all over but the paperwork from the time they decided on divorce, but elsewhere acknowledges that many of her informants, in retrospect, felt that their marriage could have been saved if they had worked harder at it, had more understanding of themselves and of marriage, or if they had had a more mature and realistic idea of what to expect from a relationship. This suggests that good marriage counselling might have been able to save some of these starter marriages; after all, even Paul acknowledges that even the best relationships can go through periods where the partners are profoundly disillusioned with each other and the relationship and may be ready to call it quits. If a couple is *really* bent on divorce, a few counselling sessions aren't going to stop them, but for couples who are less sure, counselling sessions or even a waiting period might provide them with the ability to work through their problems and perhaps even emerge with a stronger relationship.In summary, while this book has some good anecdotes, and offers some food for thought for anyone who is contemplating marriage, it is also oddly shallow, and often inconsistent and contradictory. Of course, shallow as it is, it is still better than many books in the field (a sad commentary on the state of the field!) and as such, may be worth reading. Just don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"As a veteran of a &quot;starter marriage&quot;, divorcing after only 16 months, I was able to relate to the feelings and experiences of most people interviewed for this book.

Pamela Paul offers an unbiased, balanced, comprehensive explanation of this trend, while also providing suggestions, based on our modern reality, to increase the likelihood of marital success. Her concept of &quot;new traditionalism&quot; may mean the difference between success and failure as young couples traverse this exciting and challenging path. This is a must-read for anyone contemplating getting married or who has already experienced an early divorce."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Pamela Paul has given us ALL--single, married, divorced--a thoughtful, searching examination of an important social phenomenon.

It didn't help much with that, but did give me a lot to think about. On the positive side, the author's voice is intelligent and she was able to get candid interviews with 60 people.On the negative side, the source material did not include enough beyond those interviews and some quotes from pop culture magazines. The book's analysis covers what happened in these problematic marriages, but didn't do enough to answer what could be done differently to avoid or fix them. Another problem with the book is that the interviews get chopped up and scattered throughout the book, so that it ends up sounding like a Zagat guide to failed marriages. There is still plenty of value in this book; these are real stories from people similar to those I grew up with. I found myself writing down a lot of questions for me to think about later, although the book did not attempt to provide enough answers to the questions it raised. I think the author could have done better to simply transcribe and lightly edit the conversations she had with people."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"I saw a review for this book in a magazine and it described me exactly, so I thought I should check it out. I am a 29 year-old single female, and am surrounded by MARRIED PEOPLE. All of my friends are married. All of my co-workers are married or engaged. I feel like I am the only single person on this planet, and just as she describes in the book, I feel social pressures because of it. The last thing I want to do is get married (to the wrong person) just because everyone else is married. This book has a LOT of facts, statistics, and quotes from other sources... Pamela Paul is more of an expert on research than relationships, and the sheer volume of percentages and numbers in this book can be annoying. However, it's very interesting to read the real-life accounts of how people felt before they got married, and how they realized later that there were warning signs that they had been ignoring. It was very helpful to know that others feel the same societal pressure that you NEED TO GET MARRIED, and it taught me that I need to make sure I don't bow to the pressure, or I'll end up in an un-happy marriage like so many of my &quot;married&quot; friends.There's also alot in the book about recovering from divorce (i.e. the stigma that goes along with being divorced), which I did not find particularly useful since I'm not divorced. All in all, a good read and worth the money in my opinion. It's not a book that I think I'll need to keep and refer to again, so I may give it away to someone else who needs it."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"Marriage is so vital -- why do people treat it lightly? I recently saw author Pamela Paul on an old episode of the television show \\"Politically Incorrect\\" in which she was pitted against a man who was trying to sell marriage seminars based on his patented \\"three As\\". \\"All you need for a happy marriage,\\" he insisted, was for the man to be \\"attentive, appreciative, and accommodating\\". This, he felt, would get a relationship past financial difficulties, ethical differences, family opposition, health problems, loss of mutual attraction, or any other problems the world can dish out on a young marriage (or that the couple can dish out on each other).Pamela Paul knows better, and she cut this guy down in a sentence that had the audience laughing to tears. Her book describes the complex trends that have led to younger marriages in the United States and younger divorces. She confounds simplistic politics by simultaneously supporting marriage and divorce -- even quick divorce if that can minimize the damage to the people involved, and get them apart before they have kids.The \\"reviewer misses the point\\" review mentions a second important dichotomy in this book -- it is both rational and emotional. The book reveals massive research and an understanding of the deep hurt suffered by those who divorce young. You can't help but wish them all better than they got.This is a fascinating book that I recommend to all."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"This book is so good..it helps you to realize as a young adult that sometimes divorce can't be avoided..we need to encourage this upcoming generation to not get married so early.

I understand that the issue of matrimony is a complicated one, but Paul offers few specific points as to why young marriages fail and is inconclusive about what to do about the problem. She points out over and over again that her examples of starter marriages encompass all races, creeds, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds--as well as all ages up to 30. The message I took from this was that no one is safe and no union can last. I thought it was a one-sided investigation and pessimistic observation without enough proof to make me buy into the message."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"This book has received way more hype and attention than it deserves. Perhaps the author has shown up on all the TV shows dealing with marriage and relationships (i.e., women's shows) because the gist of the book can be conveyed in a couple of sentences (or just the catchy title) and is easily grasped. So there's enough of an idea here for a decent magazine article but not a book.I didn't think the book was convincing in its main theses about this supposedly new form of marriage: a) that this is a new phenomenon; b) that it signals some new and important trend about marriage.First, I believe marriages which ended after a few years without the birth of a child have been around for as long as people have been getting married. Researchers have been telling us a long time that infertility is right up there as one of the main reasons for divorce (first or second). Having children within a couple of years of a marriage was generally expected both by society and the marrying pair. In some societies, a marriage wasn't really official until a child came along. Some percentage of couples are just not biologically viable in this regard. When a child didn't happen the couple split up to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Yes, this fact was usually not highly advertised in the community for obvious reasons. It was best to put the episode in the past and move on, especially while the woman was still reasonably young. The introduction of oral contraceptives forty years ago added a new twist to this, namely intentional \\"infertility\\" for a possibily extended period of time (until the couple was ready to have a child). And, yes, more women spending their twenties pursuing careers of various sorts adds yet another obvious twist, but I don't think the author had a sufficiently good grip on the fundamental factors to really impress me; instead she seems distracted by things which are only marginally relevant IMO.I could also add an anecdotal story about someone, a baby-boomer, who ended a \\"starter marriage\\" after 4-5 years exactly as per the definition in the book nearly twenty years ago -- again casting doubt in my mind as to whether this is really something new with the Gen-X'ers; perhaps this couple was just way ahead of their time. (Both shortly found new partners and started having kids.) More demographic data could have made the case the book is trying to make better than the many tales of shattered expectations and broken marriages that are related.Well, if this is maybe not really a new thing then the idea that it's signalling some new trend in marriage is also dubious. I think marriage has been changing in several ways as of late, but this book didn't really nail it from my perspective.I didn't think the book was terrible, just that a lot of it was padded with material which really wasn't needed or made only minor, peripheral points. I give it 2 1/2 stars and round down because it concentrates too much on women's concerns. It might be more valuable as a semi-therapeutic read for someone (esp. a woman) who had experienced a first, childless marriage and was trying to process what it all meant."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"This book is given 1 star for one excellent point.Paul's solutions are that young people should be taught \\"what marriage can and cannot offer\\" and to have \\"realistic expectations\\" long before the engagement party. This is an EXCELLENT point. Her other points will lead to more tragic relationship mistakes and divorces. She suggests the solutions lie in celebrating delayed marriages and more people should accept cohabitation as a method of confirming couple compatibility. Are you nuts???? Delaying marriage (and not marrying at all) is ONLY wise when you are clueless about marriage reality. Hence, it we take your advice, delaying marriage is not the answer. The second suggestion has NO MERIT whatsoever. Accept cohabitation... HA! Those who co-habit are more likely to end up in divorce and with broken marriages and lives, not better."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"I really did not like this book it just simply talks about being married and it just fails there is no way to work it out just divorce and say Yeah I got divorced so I lied to the Preacher. The author got married at 27 and divorced at 28 and now thinks everybody who is in there 20's is going to make that same mistake. When are people going to learn getting married is not a game it is a serious commitment in life probably the most important thing you'll ever do. In today's times people who have no buisness being together are getting married and get out in 12 months because they are bored and simply do not understand what marriage is all about that is the number one problem in this country today."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"I found this to be a great book. I don't think the book is perfect, and, as some other reviewers have pointed out, Paul can make some big jumps in her conclusions. So don't read this as a super-controlled scientific assessment (which it isn't supposed to be anyway). I found that the book wasn't anti-marriage or pro-marriage, but rather just touched up on a lot of the realities, myths, struggles, and ideas that Gen X (and a little older and younger) face when it comes marriage -- like how so many go into marriage with the subconscious expectation that it will make life complete or fix things that marriages just can't \\"fix.\\" I was especially thankful on her section about the \\"wedding industry\\" that markets absurdly expensive weddings (the perfect dress, the biggest ring, the best food... the most important day of your life!) to individuals and couples and that often contributes to a loss of perspective about what the actual marriage after the wedding might involve. One of the most helpful things I got from this book was the articulation of a feeling that I and many of my friends have -- that you are not complete until you are married and that being married will \\"make things okay,\\" which until this book I hadn't recognized as so widespread/generational/cultural. Secondly, I appreciated the feeling from the book that divorce can be okay, is sometimes better, but that sometimes a marriage just takes a little more work. I was glad she made it clear that marriage has had too high of expectations hoisted upon it, that it is hard work, can be great, can be hard, and can be rewarding. She is legitimately hard on the \\"pro-marriage\\" camp that promotes marriage as the savoir of civilization and that advocates staying married at all costs. If you want an anti-divorce book, this is not it. But if you want a fair treatment of many of the struggles that the twenty and thirty somethings face in trying to make a life with a partner, in the face of work, high expectations for marriage, our parents' marriages and divorces and a culture that sends amazingly mixed and strong messages about marriage, sex, and \\"success\\" this is a great place to start. Particularly for those thinking of getting married or struggling in the early years of a marriage, this might be particularly helpful to pique your thinking."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"I had no words to explain the failure of my own Gen X 2 and 1/2 year marriage this last fall.

She zeroes in on character traits that many emergent adults downplay, like loneliness and competitiveness.Paul's description of our generation's sky-high expectations and pitfalls reminds me of a line from F.

As prevalent as the starter marriage (awesome phrase, btw) is in our culture, I plan to do my best not to have one. I found this book instrumental in teaching me -- in a fun, beach-read kind of way -- how to go about making sure that when I marry, it will be right. Reading about other peoples' mistakes (a guilty pleasure in itself) helped me to examine my own attitudes toward and expectations of marriage. And what do you know, I saw some things within myself that I'm now working on changing so that, when I'm ready, I can do this marriage thing right.I am recommending this book to all my single friends so they can all take preventative measures to avoid the pain and heartache of a starter marriage."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"As an ordained person, it has been my privilege to preside at many weddings. Unfortunately, it has also been my sadness to help families pick up the pieces after a marriage ends. Pamela Paul has written an insightful guide not just for those contemplating marriage, but for those who will preside over the service at which vows are made. Many of the points Ms. Pound ennumerates are areas in which many clergy--including myself--choose not to tread because we don't want to inject a shadow of doubt into what should be a hopeful and promising occasion. In her explanation of the penomenon of the &quot;Starter Marriage&quot;, as well as what leads to them, and what results, Ms. Paul shows implicitly that there is a great deal that prepareing for a marriage is much more important, and potentially more time consuming, than preparing for a wedding.After reading Ms. Paul's book, I have come to a better understanding of the types of questions to ask couples who come to me for pre-marital work, but more importantly, I have a new sense of urgency in asking them. Ms. Paul's book is a must for the library of any clergy, and should be on the required reading list of every seminary."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony","review":"I was disappointed with the book. It read like a long magazine piece, something belonging in a woman's magazine. It didn't seem like the writer really interviewed 60 couples - she only mentions about 10 people throughout the book that she actually interviewed. She quotes twentysomething men and women that were quoted by other writers in other articles and books. A lot of her points are actually the points of other writers on this issue, and then she just footnotes the source of the idea or quote. Also, I felt like she was biased - just b/c she married at 27 and divorced at 28 she thinks &quot;young&quot; marriages are doomed, and she doesn't give us any examples of successful marriages among twentysomethings, or constructive suggestions as to how to make a marriage work. Parts of the book were interesting, but I wanted fuller portraits of the people she interviewed, and deeper analysis, because this book just seemed like one long magazine piece."},{"Title":"The Christian Platonists of Alexandria","review":"The Bampton Lectures:The Bampton lectures were established in accordance with an English clergyman who gave his name to one of most distinguished lectureships, the Bampton lectures at Oxford University.

If so, you know this guy is both a film scholar and a die-hard fan of the medium.&quot;Suspects&quot; is a must-read for any film buff. Thomson goes back into movie history and writes short biographies of various film characters, starting early in their life and usually ending with their deaths. These extrapolated bios are fascinating alternative histories of the sort of movie characters whom you want to continue to get to know even outside the scope of the pictures they appear in.So the book is vastly entertaining if you're the sort of person who wonders what &quot;Chinatown&quot;'s Jake Gittes' childhood was like, or whatever happened to George Bailey after &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; ended.But there's more going on in this book than the fantastical and fully imagined bios. Soon various characters from different movies begin appearing in other characters' bios, and the real-life bios of producers and actors and directors start to seamlessly creep into the text.At some point you realize that the narrator is not Thomson but rather a famous movie character (I won't reveal who it is here). This narrator's presence ties the seemingly disconnected vignettes together, and gives the book a darker feel as it progresses.In the end, you realize this is not just a whimsical book about the love of movie characters. It's ultimately an examination on how movies affect the way we think and how film not only shapes our perceptions and our memories but in some ways comes to stand in for them, both for the good and for the bad.And that's why I love this book -- you can read it as an unsettling examination of identity and the construction of self through the medium of narratives, or you can read it simply as a fascinating take on movie fandom. Either way, it's fabulous."},{"Title":"Suspects","review":"This has got to be one of the hardest books to describe I've come across. You could fairly label it any (or all) of the following: meditation on film noir, meditation on the American psyche, film buff fanfic, partial encyclopedia of film characters, or experimental fiction. Thomson is an eminent film critic and biographer, and back in the early '80s, he was approached to put together a dictionary of film characters. As he thought about the project, the more problematic it seemed to him. So he reconceived it by focusing on the characters from a core of classic noir films and planning out how they might have interacted.The book unfolds as brief biographies of almost 100 characters from around 40-50 films, mostly from the 1940s-1970s era. The characters are reimagined as they interect with the \\"real\\" world as well as the \\"reel\\" world of others in the book. So, for example, the characters Noah Cross (Chinatown) and Nora Desmond (Sunset Boulevard) are shown to have been lovers in the 1920s, while Ilsa (Casablanca) dies in the 1963 plane crash that killed U.N. General Secretary Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld . Meanwhile, some characters are revealed to be relatives of others and so forth. As readers of Thompson'sBiographical Dictionary of Filmknow, he is a gifted and incisive biographer, and his fictional work here is equally skilled. All of which makes for interesting (and sometimes amusing) metafare, but there's something deeper at work.It's not at all clear who the first-person writer of these mini-bios is (it's clearly not Thomson), nor how he or she is related to them, or what the purpose of all the succession of bios is. However -- there is a big clue in the form of a map at the very beginning. That said, the clue didn't register with me, and about 1/3 of the way into the book, I was confused enough to start skipping around a bit. At the back, I found a family tree that unlocked the riddle and sent me back into the book, flipping back and forth to connect the dots (one of the book's juicier pleasures arrives once the reader works out the identity of Travis Bickle's (Taxi Driver) father.) As befits a book of such odd construction and narrative, one can interpret it many different ways -- as a statement on identity, a statement on American values, a statement on aging, a statement on the function of film, or even just an odd entertainment.Whatever one's reaction, it's definitely worth checking out by those interested in experimental approaches to fiction, as well as those with a penchant for film noir. It would certainly be to the reader's advantage to be familiar with at least half the films referenced by the book, otherwise the character sketches are going to be hardest to contextualize in the mind. I was familair with about 3/4 of the characters in the book, and found the unfamiliarity with the other 1/4 to detract from the grip of the book."},{"Title":"Suspects","review":"I didn't go into this demanding much - just a series of intriguing fictional biographies that interconnected with each other over the course of the novel. And to be fair, most of the biographies are well-written, and many are interesting. A few are even touching. But there are two major flaws that kept me from really enjoying this book:1) To really appreciate this as a whole, you need to be familiar with all of the characters' source films. This is especially noticeable with some of the less famous films.2) A significant number of the characters have unpleasant histories, with elements that only seemed to be added for shock value. This reaches its offensive peak with the last few bios, including that of the narrator.If those two issues aren't likely to be a problem for you, then you might get something out of this. Otherwise, I'd probably pass."},{"Title":"Suspects","review":"If you are an avid movie buff & have seen a wide variety of movies in the \\"noir\\" genre then you may get more out of this book than I did. As a collection of stand-alone mini-biographies of some of the characters in the aforementioned movies this book does a fine job of filling in their backgrounds very well. In some cases, the \\"whatever happened to?\\" aspect of these characters is expanded upon very nicely.It is in the weaving of these vignettes that I feel the author has gone awry. Or maybe I, as the reader, did not have enough background to follow the authors intent. Admittedly, I have not seen over half of the movies listed in the book. Perhaps this added to my confusion, but is it not the writer's job to eventually explain all?Of the movies I have seen, I noticed the author took some liberties to bend the story his way (which is called \\"poetic license\\")and that makes me curious about the others.For instance, the state in which Bedford Falls exists is never mentioned in the film, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". Having seen this movie more times than I can count, I've always felt that Bedford Falls was in upstate New York. The characters who leave Bedford Falls all have connections to New York City; Sam Wainwright, Harry Bailey & Violet. Had Bedford Falls been located in Nebraska (as the author contends), wouldn't someone had an itch to go to Chicago?And one character that was left out of the book; Mr. Potter is only mentioned briefly, but no background and no what-happened-to?Enjoy the book for the clever mini-bios but don't try to find the plot... it's not there."},{"Title":"A Spy in Canaan: My Life As a Jewish-American Businessman Spying for Israel in Arab Lands","review":"Espionage is commonly defined as &quot;that part of the total intelligence designed for the surreptitious inspection of the activities of foreign countries to ascertain their strength and movements and to communicate such intelligence to the proper authorities. &quot;If only for security purposes, all nations feel the need to discover, by their own concealed methods, the guarded secrets of others. Or as Winston Churchill once wittily remarked: &quot;Sometimes liberty requires a bodyguard of lies.&quot; To establish the personality traits of the &quot;ideal&quot; spy central to the anatomy of espionage is obviously far from simple. A fine study of intelligence gathering catalogs, for example, some 10 traits the &quot;good&quot; intelligence agent must necessarily posess, in order to qualify for his precarious , oftimes life-threatening, assignment. Notable among them, an intelligence agent should be &quot;discreet, have a passion for anonymity, and know how to keep his mouth shut, and preserve a secret. The most effective spy, Mr. Schack shows us is neither freak nor pschopath. He is rather, the 'citizenspy' who acts upon the incentive of enlightened patriotism and to whom deceit and intrigue are only temporary expedients that he knows how to keep under strict control. One such &quot;citizen intelligence agent&quot; was Howard Schack, a highly sucessful American engineer and with a worldwide reputation as a master builder of military installations around the globe.

Even though he has changed the names of everyone, certainly all the people mentioned would recognize themselves and what fools have been made of them. I would think that they, and their governments, would all be out for revenge. This is really a tell-all book of spy methods. I am surprised that it isn't classified, and I would think that it might seriously compromise our own spies in the area of national security, unless spy methods have really changed a lot since that time, and all these methods have become obsolete. But I don't think so, as they mostly involve people skills. Nevertheless, I am thinking about writing a novel,a nd a lot of the information I was searching for was found here.

Mr. Schack, because of his real life construction company, manages to get info into one very big place towards the end.

Historian author, Grace Lee Nute, is a graceful, accessible writer who spent a lifetime doing the research and writing several books. The famous Canadian Voyageurs are what make her stories so fascinating - those burly French-Canadian canoemen who swung through the northern woods toting their great bundles of furs and trade goods and plunged their fat cargo canoes through endless white water rapids, singing at the top of their lungs! They are to Canadian history what cowboys are to America: national icons.Also amazing are the stories of several of the key explorers like La Verendrye, Alexander MacKenzie and that great exploring map-maker, David Douglas, who, in the late 1700s, travelled 55,000 miles over 27 years, surveying everywhere he went. The end result was his creation of two enormous maps, as exquisitely beautiful today as they were incredibly accurate and influential in their time.Nute also takes the story into the 20th century, up to 1941. the reader is dismayed by early twentieth century environment destruction wreaked by lumber and iron ore mining industries but also heartened by the way Canada and the US have continued to cooperate to preserve much of the original deep forest as well as the pristine lakes that make up the border lakes region.

Most of the estate went to his nephew Lord Justin Raventhorpe. Justin's father expected the estate to end up in his hands via his spouse. He is irate with his wife's deceased cousin. Even more surprising is that an expensive estate on Mayfair was given to a non family member, Lady Letitia Deverill. No one seems to know why, including Letitia, August would do such a deed.Letitia is a Lady in waiting to Queen Victoria. Everyone at court ignores her because she is the token Tory while everyone else is a Whig. Justin happens to be a Lord in Waiting to Her Majesty. As he and Letitia come into contact with one another, an attraction grows even though neither welcomes it. However, when Letitia's monkey finds the secret behind her inheritance, the Tory turns to Justin for help because Her Royal Highness may be in jeopardy.Amanda \\"the Great\\" Scott demonstrates why she is a best selling historical romance author with her awesome latest novel, DANGEROUS LADY. The crisp story line is fast-paced and provides her audience with a wonderful glimpse into the early days of Victoria's reign. The characters are warm, witty, and wonderful with the treasured return of an adult Letitia (see DANGEROUS ANGELS). Just like her tremendous \\"Highland\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" trilogies, Ms. Scott brilliantly enflames the passions of love in a world engulfed by treacherous conspiracy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom","review":"George Hart and Hank Heifetz transport us in time to a fascinating ancient Tamil world of honor and valor. As a Tamil who knows Modern Tamil, but does not understand Classical Tamil too well, reading the translation and then going back to the originals helped me gain better insight and understanding of the originals. Wish the originals were printed alongside the translation!!"},{"Title":"The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom","review":"Hart &amp; Heifetz again prove that you don't have to be a dried up, passionless writer to generate fine scholarship. The translations are flawless, retaining all the grace, passion, and subtle flavor of the originals. Poetry has never been so beautiful or so bloody. A haunting loveliness combined with a window the steals an uncompromising glance at the capriciousness and creativety of a forgotten age. If your heart can bare such a relentless look into South India's forgotten past, you must read this book. An excellent source for hardened scholars, armchair Indologists, and poets alike."},{"Title":"The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom","review":"I got this book from one of my friend and the translation was simply superb as it's original version. I have gone through the original version long back. I would say this authors George & Hank should pass this to Hollywood movie makers. If this would be taken as Hollywood movie just like Gladiator, it would be another block buster. Marketing of this book is not so good. I give four stars."},{"Title":"Our Common Ground","review":"What a wonderful collection of photographs and stories. I stumbled upon this photo essay at a book store and had to take it home. For so long the positive role models for and within the African-American community have supposedly been athletes and entertainers. Mr. Caines' vision is broader, deeper and more realistic than that. A female engineer on the Long Island Railroad; a female stonemason creating sculpture for a Harlem cathedral; a fifteen-year-old boy in Oregon chooses not to end up like his mother, killed in a drug deal, stops selling crack in his neighborhood and becomes and honor roll student; one of 11 astrophysicists of African descent in America all are our modern day, next door neighbor role models. The inclusion of a few celebrities in this gorgeous book brought a whole new dimension to personalities like Bryant Gumbel for me.Beautiful photography, and intimate narrative profiles by this author brought joy to my heart and a tear to my eye. Makes makes me wish =I= were African American!"},{"Title":"Our Common Ground","review":"Our Common Ground is the best kind of inspirational non-fiction, because it's not some famous person TELLING us how to live our lives to the fullest, it's a collection of &quot;regular&quot; people DOING just that!OCG is the perfect gift for a young person (or any person for that matter) whom you would like to inspire to become all they were created to be."},{"Title":"Our Common Ground","review":"Not that &quot;I Dream A World&quot; was bad, but in my eyes it clearly lacked something. That &quot;something&quot; was a personal connection with the subjects. Mr. Caines' photographs and text show his obvious appreciation, respect and fascination with his subjects. Unlike &quot;IDAW&quot;, the photography in &quot;Our Common Ground&quot; reflects a sensitivity and loyalty to the individuality of the PEOPLE they depict--not the photographic style of the photographer.Wonderful photographs. Captivating reading.

I would recommed it to people who like serious books with a little kick of funnies. I think it is good for any age. I think the name Kitty is a good name for the dog because it came when Ricky's mom called the kittys. At first I did not like the book but then near the end I liked the book. Ricky was very scared of dogs,but the starvig dog changed that. Ricky kept saying he would run Kitty away,but he never did."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I'm now a 27 yo female and I still love this book. I bought it to pass down to my kids. One of the books I read many times as a young girl. I checked it out of my elementary school library at least 10 times. Now I own it, I'm so proud. Great for kids."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"A few years ago, I read a book called A Dog Called Kitty, by Bill Wallace. This book has by far the best plot of any book I've read. It is great for kids my age, (16) because it teaches you to overcome your fears if it is in good cause.In the beginning of the story Ricky's father announces that the family is moving from the city to the country. This was no big deal really, but when they got there, Ricky really wanted to go back. After a couple of days this puppy was suddenly showing up everyday wanting to play with him. This scared Ricky, because he was attacked as a baby, by a dog. The dog was slowly starving though, so Ricky gradually conquers his fear starting out by giving him scraps and bones to eat. Soon the two become best friends. He then names the dog \`Kitty', because every time Ricky's mother calls the kitties in, Kitty(the dog) comes running.I would recommend this book to anyone who is afraid of something. I think that includes everyone, so go to the nearest library and find this book, A Dog Called Kitty. Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I was repeatedly shocked when I read this book! It is chock-ful of violence and cruelty! There is a cute picture of a puppy on the cover and it has a cute title. Would you ever guess that it starts off with domestic abuse, has characters laughing at a dog's suffering (while trying to teach him a lesson for his own good), a boy's young cousin being killed in a car accident for no reason that has ANYTHING to do with the rest of the book other than to get the boy's father away for a couple days. Then there is the (legal?) baiting and poisoning of coyotes, a horrific dog-pack vs boy and dog fight, which they survive. Then all within 2 pages near the end, the boy and his dog meet a new adult male friend (a stranger who &quot;took a real liking&quot; to the boy and his dog) which is just another bizarre setup having nothing to do with the story other than a method of getting the dog killed in an avalanche of pipe! Not to mention the fist-fights between the boy and another kid.!I cannot believe that this book has won 3 awards! (although I hadn't heard of any of them before)This book may be all right for Grades 7-8 and up, but with the cute title and cover, I find it is very misleading as to the proper age group."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This book has a very graphic scene (one of many) of a dog attack. The boy beats off several dogs (who are mauling his dog) and he breaks a German Shepard's back with a club. The language is very graphic/mean-spirited within the book and I'm not really sure it's suitable for children--maybe older children--but certainly not for children who love animals. Plus, Kitty dies suddenly in the end when he is crushed by pipes. At that point, children won't care about the \\"message\\" within the book at all. Bottom line: I wouldn't suggest this book for sensitive kids, it made my 9-year-old cry and she wants me to get rid of the book."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I liked this book because I love dogs.I did'nt like this book because the dog (Kitty) gets hurt. This book was probably one of the best books I ever read.Ricky was one of the main characters.He was scared of the small dog because of a dog accident that happened when he was really little.The small dog chases him around his barn. Then he feels sorry for the dog and names him Kitty because every time his mom calles the cats that dog comes running."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I don't remember reading any other of Bill Wallace's books but I read this book for the first time when I was in the fourth grade in 1987. This book was so touching and profound that I remembered it 17 years later while book shopping for my son. This was the first book that I remember reading as a child that totally transported me with its words. I was there with Ricky when his fear slowly turned to friendship and his acceptance of loss. I remember crying while reading the last two chapters but I don't think the book would have been as moving and memorable with any other ending. I remember being the most upset after reading the last line because I wanted to read more of Ricky's story. This book is the reason I am such an avid reader today. Bill Wallace took me to another place and let me experience fear, friendship, suspense, loss and acceptance. It is a definite must read for the 4th to 6th grade group."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I read this with my 8 year old twin boys. Reading is not one of their favorite things to do, but they actually enjoyed this book very much. Ricky hates dogs and for a very good reason and one day a stray pup starts coming around the farm and he tells him everyday he is going to run him off.The pup helps Ricky overcome his fear of dogs and helps Ricky to find courage.The way he got his name is cute. I enjoyed this story myself."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This book did not win any awards. My opinion on this book was that I really liked this book.. The caracters in the book are Kitty, the dog ,Ricky,Ricky's mother, and father,Ricky's little brother, Chuckie,and Ricky's friends, Brad,Charlie,and Ben. This book is about a dog who is slowly starving dog and a boy who overcomes his fears. He named him Kitty because every time Ricky's mother called her cats she would say \\"Here kitty,kitty\\", then the dog would come up and eat a little of the cat's food. I really liked this book but I would not reccommend the end of chapter 11 and some of chapter 12 to little kids. If you like startling and surprising stories, then you should read this book and enjoy it like I did."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"this book is a great book it shows love happiness and sad times. Its about a homeless little puppy and a boy who is scared of all dogs. The dog comes around and wants food and love but the boy is to scared to give it to him untill one day he sees how skinny and helpless the puppy is and he starts feedinghim witch leads to a wole new friend ship."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I read this book when I was in fourth grade. It had such a negative impact on me, I cried for days every time I looked at a dog. I can't even remember the plot, just that the dog dies and it's violent and completely meaningless, so upsetting, I would NOT recommend this for children; it should be banned from the little kids' section. Such a terrible book. 15 years later I am still traumatized by this book and tell people about how horrific it is."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I love this book. I was a library clerk in a school when I was reading it. I was sitting there crying and the librarian asked me why and I told her that I had just finished the book. I kept asking her to get it for review. The students picked up on it and they wanted to read the book too. There are some viloent parts in it, but that is what makes a great story. Bill Wallace did a great job making you feel like you were there with Ricky and Kitty. It has been over 20 years since I first read the book and yet it only seems like yesterday. Some books you always remember and this is one of them."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I read have read and re-read this book probably as many as 50 times since I first picked it up in the second grade. Yes, second, I was always ahead of my grade with my reading. I borrowed it from my brother's fifth grade class, and dove right in to one of the best children's stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I loved anything to do with animals, and the picture and title of the book both drew my attention immediately.It's a very good story that is much broader than most children's books. It runs the whole course of emotions that a child deals with in their young life. Hate and fear (In Ricky's terror of all dogs, and his initial mistrust and unpleasant reaction toward Kitty) and learning to change, as he grows to love and bond with his new friend in a way he never has with anything before. There is danger and heroism, when Kitty saved Ricky's life, and there is sadness and loss and despair with Kitty tragically dies at the end of the book.These are all subjects that children will have to experience. While death is the most frightening of these and the most likely to scare off parents from sharing this book with their child, it is also what makes it such a great piece of work. Death is very difficult to explain to children, and it's usually something they've never really been made to think about or understand before it happens to someone close to them. By teaching them about it at a young age, it's a little easier to deal with when it comes along for real. Death has no regard for age, and the subject is not something that is unusual for children's stories. All Dogs Go To Heaven, The Lion King, Bambi (who didn't cry at Bambi? And who would claim that it is unfit for children?), and many more deal with death as very integral plot elements. It helps children understand one of the most fundamental laws of nature. That eventually all things will die, but that it is okay to grieve and be sad, and most importantly of all that one day things will be alright.From top to bottom, I think this is a wonderful book. It has had a profound impact on me, perhaps more than anything else that I read at that time. I would recommend it to anyone, and everyone."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I just love this book. I don't remeber the age I was when I first read it but somewhere around 10. I loved it so much that I read it more than once. When talking to others about my favorite books this is one I always come back to, even now in my early 30's. I plan to purchase this for my children."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"For a children's book it is very well written. I was a huge Bill Wallace fan when I was in Middle School and read all of his books. In fact I'm willing to read some of his new material even though I'm way to old to be reading his books. Every page is full of good detail and you really get to imagine the book the way Wallace wanted you to. There are some violent scenes but I loved that being a middle school aged boy. Something sad happens at the end but unlike other people It's not worth giving such a great book 1 star. This is a good book for everyone to read."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"As a fourth grade teacher I read this book to my class to help display painting pictures with words. Yes, Kitty does die a tragic death; however, this story is a perfect example of a story coming full circle. The story beautifully written, though my students had difficulty understanding the OK setting and farm life it gave me an opportunity to share my life with them, growing up on a farm in MN. After reading this book many of my students were enticed to read more of Bill Wallace's books. For sensitive children warn them that with all things comes an end, but when a door closes a window opens. Though Ricky wanted to give up on dogs he could not."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"My 8 year old daughter read this for AR. She said it was a great book even though there were sad parts. Bill Wallace is a good author and has other great books for children. The book had some funny parts - whenever they call \\"Kitty Kitty\\" and the cats come to eat their food the dog Kitty would come up and pounce on the cats. I think you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I really loved this book"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This is a great book!! I read it as a child and never completely got over it. I laughed until I cried and then cried some more. Bill Wallace is amazing in the way he captures the emotions of a child. I loved the way he wrote in first person. Ricky was given life in a way I don't think would have been possible if you weren't inside his mind all the time.If you have never read this book - please, please - give it a try. And while your at it, combine it with another Bill Wallace story - The Christmas Spur - about a boy whose brother has cancer. Let yourself be swept away into the worlds of two young boys and the story of their first tragic losses."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I remember reading this book over and over again when I was a pre teen, and I still remember almost everything about it (I'm 26 now). In fact, this was probably my favorite book. A tale of a boy and his dog...and what they have to do to a). get to like one another, b). form their strong bond, and c). protect one another against almost anything. Great, great book for anyone!"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"Our teacher read us this book when I was in 2nd grade. Every child in the class was spellbound and half of us teared up at the end. It is a great book, but it is a realistic book. Dogs die, people die, and we all have to move on. Better to learn those facts in a book first than to wait until real life smacks you with it."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"well there is a kid named Ricky. Ricky was scared of dogs ever since he was three years old. He got bitten by a dog.I would give this a five-star rating. That's how awesome this is.

I felt bad for the little pup.I think that if you read this book you would understand it better if you read it with a partner."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I really liked this book, The reason I chose this book is the title stood out! The main character was a dog called Kitty. The book was really exciting waiting on every page, to see what was going to happen.

This book was really good, so I recommend this book to everyone, for all ages."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"The book A Dog Called Kitty was very good. If you love dogs you will love this book!! It was very funny.It is about a boy named Ricky. When he was little he was attacked by a dog that had rabies.

Then he found another dog, and you'll have to read the book to find out the end!"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I read this book at the begining of 8th grade and I loved it! I still love how it makes you feel like a little child again. The book was written very well and I would recomend it to anyone who loves pets and has warm hearts (which i bet all of you have ;) ) Im in 9th grade now and at times i still read the book. The book is about a boy who is scared of dogs from a past experience. When he finds a stray pup who is almost starving to death he wont feed it because he is so afraid of dogs. However if the dog doesnt get food soon he will die. he boy overcomming his fear of dogs is only the beginning of the heart felt friendship.And soon they will be tested. Read the book to find out what happens!"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"A Dog Called Kitty was one of my all time favorites. Although i only read it a few times I loved it.

I would recommend this to anyone but only if they have a good supply of tissues nearby."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"&quot;I read this book when I was in the fourth grade. I loved it and I still do even to this day. The bond between the boy and Kitty grew to be so strong. That special bond is something that I was looking for then, and that I still live for. I give the book a 10+. You must believe me when I say this because I have been looking for this book since I was in the fourth grade. Now that I have finally found it I'm saving it for my children.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This book is a must for all animal lovers. I teach seventh grade English, and I read this story orally to my students. They find the treatment the young boy must endure because he was bitten by a rabid dog very interesting and painful. When we get to the end of the story, there are very few dry eyes (mine included). It shows that time does help heal wounds, but time does not prevent other events from happening. This is truly an excellent coming-of-age story. If you read it orally, please have plenty of tissues on hand."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"It caught my intrest and when I picked it up I couldn't put it down.

I am a huge Bill Wallace fan and I think you will be one too."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I heard of this book and wanted to check it out for a bookclub for 4th and 5th graders. After checking out some on-line reviews, many of which were from people who read it when orginally published in the 80's, I decided to use it. What impressed me most about the reviews was that the people who read it back then remember it making a big impression on them and couldn't wait to share it with their children. I have several books I feel that way about so figured if it had such a strong impression it would be worth a shot.It turned out to be a good call. Most of the children finished it and almost all really liked it. We had a discussion about the fear the main character had of dogs and fears they have. Mnay of them felt a lot of different emotions throughout the book and although it had some diffecult scenes they really liked how the story unfolded and the end of the story."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I remember reading this book perhaps 10 years ago, and that cute innocent puppy on the cover. My mom had had several dogs and I had just gotten a Shih Tzu named Fluffy. He looked like my dog! It's hard to remember exactly what happened, but there was a soccer field, and some bullies, and he had to behave like one of them or be hurt himself. He was already hurting, and I very much identified with the coming-of-age understanding with quite literally, the underdog. I have always had mild cerebral palsy, preventing me from walking normally and requiring me to always act more grown-up. I never really had a childhood, but this book affected me greatly, its pages, its changes, and taught me a little bit about returning to a wise innocence. That it is okay to cry and laugh and to be vulnerable. I have always had problems with girlfriends and the usual social problems, but I have always loved dogs."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This book is way to violent and sad. In the beginning, I noticed a lot of violent phrases, and I started to think that this book might not be the best. Then the part comes where the boy finds a dog. The boy uses very inappropriate phrases towards the dog. (I could understand that the boy does not like dogs because he was once severely attacked.) The story went on, and it was pretty fun to read, and the boy decided to finally keep the dog. Then suddenly in chapter 10 there was something so sad and irrevelant to the main point of the story, that I HAD TO SKIP A FEW PAGES. I COULD NOT STAND THAT PART. That part was so terrible that I started to dislike this book. Later in it, the boy and his dog get badly attacked by savage dogs. Far to violent. Then, they both get better, which is nice, but later, in the next chapter after the fight- the boy's dog gets killed by heavy machinery. This book is so sad that it's depressing. Later, the boy finds a new dog, but that doesn't really make the story much better. Adding to that, the book is like a copy of the classic- Old Yeller. In both stories, the boys find stray dogs and don't want them. Later at the end they love them so much. Both books have animal fights. In both, the boys' dogs die.I would NOT recommend this book. I would especially not recommend it to sensitive people, and people who love animals, and people who do not like violence."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This book is about a boy who's afraid of dogs. A stray puppy comes around looking for food. The Mother of the family always puts out scraps of food for the cats and calls \\"Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!\\" The Puppy comes too, but the cats attack him. He is about to starve when Ricky decides to feed him. In the process of giving him the food, Ricky overcomes his fear of dogs. The dog is called Kitty because he comes running for the food every time Ricky's mom calls Kitty! They become friends. I think the writer has a unique writing style. He writes in the first person. It is so vividly written that you feel like you're standing there listening to the story of his childhood. The book had a great storyline and was vividly described. The book had a funny theme. I'd give this book 6 stars if I could"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"My nine-year old daughter was thrilled to select this book to read for a school project. She happily began reading it on her own, and I with her before bed. When I picked her up from school today she was in tears, telling me she had read ahead in the book and the beloved dog, after finally being united with the boy, dies suddenly near the end of the book. She was so upset she did not want to finish the book nor use it for her project. She is an avid reader and I have never had this experience before. If your child is tenderhearted or has a special love for animals, please read this book for yourself before sharing it with them. You become so attached to the dog that it is just gut-wrenching to have him die at the end (kind of like a downer movie you wish you hadn't paid to see).

Young dog lovers beware, that \\"Kitty\\" DIES unexpectedly, and tragically toward the end of the story. My daughter loves dogs and cats, and was so distraught by Kitty's death, that she didn't care that the boy finds another dog to begin a friendship with. In fact, I don't know that she even read the last several pages of the book right away, because she was so upset. She is okay with it now, and still likes the book, but as a parent, I wish I would have seen the book summary on this site prior to letting her read it."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"Well \\"A Dog Called Kitty\\" is one of the best books I had ever read, it's funny, surprising, and sad. It's a heart-warming story of a dog and a boy. The boy's name is Ricky, and he has had a fear af dogs ever since he got tackled by one when he was little. One day a dog appears on his farm and scares Ricky. He tries to hide on a haystack but the dog tries to jump up! Kitty comes by every day when Ricky's mother calls the cats for breakfeast. And he chases them around the farm; that's why they named him Kitty. Something happy happens at the end and something very sad it made me cry.But I will let you find that out for yourself when you read this. A very exiting, heart-warming, and love between man and dog. I promise if you read this you will fall in love with the Characters mom, dad, ricky, kitty this probably is the best book ever!"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"I really loved this book! It had alot of describing words that you could picture what was happening!!"},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"A Dog Called KittyI thought the book A Dog Called Kitty was a good book. It wasn't the best book I've read, but it turned out better then I thought it would be.The book was about a boy who was afraid of dogs.It semes strange to me that someone could be afraid at such a sweet little animal,but Ricky has a pretty good reason. It was all because a memorable childhood experience. Ever since that time he has never been able to look at a dog the same way until now. It is a pretty good book, and I would read it again. Some parts are funny and others are really serious. I liked it."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"My 8 yr old daughter just finished this book. For the past 2 days she has been engrossed in this book. She kept stopping long enough to tell me what had been happening. I loved to see her enjoying a book so much. She just came to me with tears in her eyes because she had finished the book and Kitty died. We talked about it a little bit and she is ok. I don't like my daughter being sad (at all) but I also realize it is a normal part of life. The strength of her emotions is a testament on how well the book is written. She really connected with the characters and the story. My only issue is that I didn't read the book first (my fault) so I didn't prepare her for the end."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"As some others have noted, this is a very violent book. As a baby, Ricky gets viciously attacked by a dog and is afraid of them ever since. Ricky gets into a fight at school, then gets a dog sicked [sic] on him. The dog might have rabies, but luckily Ricky's test comes out negative.Then another dog shows up and gets into long, descriptive fights with a bunch of cats. Soon after, the area is filled with \\"coyote-getters\\", which means instant death for any dog foolish enough to fall for the trap, including Kitty. Then the Ricky gets into yet another fight and the dog is sicked [sic] on him again. Only this time, the dog-shy boy fights the dog off as well as the bully.Soon after this, Ricky's Uncle gets into a serious car crash, taking Daddy out of the picture for a few days. An enraged cow charges Ricky, not once but twice. Then savage dogs attack Ricky and his dog Kitty, nearly killing them both. Finally, Kitty dies in a freak accident.This book tries very hard to be modern Old Yeller, and the dog looks suspiciously like Benji. In my opinion, it fails miserably. If you've never heard of Old Yeller and like lots of violence, you might actually like this book."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"This a very enchanting story!

I helped her with the words she didn't understand. We were both so completely taken with the book that we actually read it all in one day. Unfortunately the graphic nature of the wild dog attack was a bit much for her to handle and to understand. I tried my best to explain what the book was describing. The worst thing was Kitty's death toward the end. We had spent the entire day getting so close to this dog that we loved him like our own. I feel that for the age group the content was a little harsh toward reality. Perhaps that is the fault of the school for making them read it. But I can't help but feel a little disturbed by the graphic nature in the descriptions displayed within the book.All in all it was a great book but if you have a child that is in the least bit sensitive, don't let them read this. I spent hours dealing with a crying child who couldn't understand the death of Kitty and why it had to end that way."},{"Title":"Dog Called Kitty","review":"It is a lovely book.

Vol.1 was received Friday afternoon, Vol.2 came two days later. Each came in clean and complete order. Even without the dust jacket, the hardcover on Vol. 1 (from kkay03) was in very good (still black) condition and the pages are in very good condition. The hardcover on Vol.2 (from Kismet Books)is in good condition, slightly faded, but with all pages in very good condition. No damage was discovered to the covers, binding, or interior of either book.These volumes were published in the early 1960s by Doubleday and written by William D.

Their greatest challenge happens when they enter the shadow-free, ultra-focused lands of the pre-Raphaelites.Even if the heroes don't find rest, they do find love."},{"Title":"Hearts on Fire: The Tao of Meditation, the Birth of Quantum Psychology","review":"Stephen Wolinsky is known for a school of thought called Quantum Psychology which fuses' ideas from quantum physics, western psychology, religion and eastern meditation (always crediting his sources) and proposes that we are more than our minds. In all of his books he presents the philosophy and rationalizations for his constructs and gives the reader guided exercises so that one has an experience of what he is writing about (&quot;Quantum Psychology is not a spectator sport&quot;) as opposed to &quot;more ideas for the mind&quot;).According to Quantum Psychology, the mind which can be observed as any ideas, concepts, feelings, sensations that we hold about ourselves cannot be us. We are beyond those things even if we don't realize it. The Quantum Psychology approach then is to learn how to observe and put some distance between whom we think we are and become aware of a deeper self.In most psychologies and self help approaches, an attempt is made to superimpose a belief on top of another belief, (an example is affirmations) or reinterpreting/re-framing them (I can turn my aggressive energy into winning at sports as an outlet). Quantum Psychology's approach is to de-construct these ideas by 1.) acknowledging and experiencing them. You can't give up what you don't own. 2.) observe them. 3.) interpret whatever ideas or feelings you are having as objects. No different from any other objects, like say a chair or a tree.Why approach life that way? Our mind, when we identify too strongly with it (fused), is transitory (we change our mind constantly). New emotions, ideas and other things constantly come up, most of which we don't choose, none of which we have any control over (thoughts, feelings tend to &quot;pop up and disappear&quot;). Believing that you are the mind is like saying that you are a roller coaster, separating from it is to beginning to realize that you are a passenger. In this fashion you lessen the gravitational pull of your own ideas and begin to open up more space for yourself to exist. You don't have to be a prisoner of yourself!If you are new to this author, I would suggest starting with Quantum Consciousness, which gives a more complete overview of the philosophy. This book (Hearts On Fire) might be viewed as Quantum Psychology Unplugged, as it was written from workshops that he conducted prior to calling the approach Quantum Psychology. The format is a brief explanation of a subject (i.e. , the mind, emotions, etc.), then a meditation process to experience what is being presented. This is followed by comments from workshop participants and Wolinsky's responses, all serving to shed further light on the experience.I have been using it as a companion guide to Quantum Consciousness and participating as if I was in the workshop. The reader is encouraged to use this material in his/her own world for immediate benefits. There are multiple uses; such as dealing with personal barriers, accomplishments, relationship &quot;problems&quot; or if you simply want to know more about who you are. I saw a broker advocate this approach for people who would like to enter the stock market and are afraid to do so.You probably can't tell but I've become a little involved!"},{"Title":"Hearts on Fire: The Tao of Meditation, the Birth of Quantum Psychology","review":"Hearts on fire, like all Stephen Wolinski's books is a must read for all those who pine for spiritual growth.Hearts on fire will set you on fire."},{"Title":"Hearts on Fire: The Tao of Meditation, the Birth of Quantum Psychology","review":"Stephen Wolinsky's workHearts on Fireis excellent .Anyone interested in Non Duality would do well to study it."},{"Title":"Flying Buccaneers: The Illustrated Story of Kenney's Fifth Air Force","review":"An excellent work detailing the operations of the Fifth U.S. Army Air Force during World War II, &quot;Flying Buccaneers&quot; will appeal to a wide audience. From the basement hobbyist looking to make a more realistic model to the serious aviation historian pulling together hard-to-find facts, this text contains an incredible aount of information about Gen. Kenney and his command.Tapped on the shoulder by Gen &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, Commander of the fledgling Army Air Force, Kenney was instructed to &quot;hold off&quot; the powerful Japanese until help could arrive (i.e., Hitler was beaten). However, Kenney did not want to be placed on the defensive and was determined to take the fight right to Tokyo, if necessary. He and his men developed weapons and tactics that allowed them to maximize their meager equipment and personnel while inflicting the greatest possible damage on the enemy.Steve Birdsall's account of this never-say-die general and the back-breaking work that was performed to bring that part of the war to a conclusion is a great read. Also, the illustrations are meticulously detailed and the photographs are abundant. Many are rarely seen combat photos of aircraft modified in the field to perform a specific mission.The one caveat to a whole-hearted, grade-A, two thumbs-up recommendation is that the book's construction did not match its content in quality. After merely two or three perusals, the pages began to fall out!Overall, this is an engaging representation of the tremendous effort put on by the courageous pilots and crews of Kenney's Fifth."},{"Title":"Flying Buccaneers: The Illustrated Story of Kenney's Fifth Air Force","review":"I bought this book many years ago from the Military Book Club. I have read extensively about air fighting in World War II. This is one of the few books that I had kept through many moves while being in the U.S.Air Force. You can almost feel yourself flying for General Kenney. He would never say die, and unlike many other commanders in WWII, he didn't complain when he didn't get a job done, he took what he had, and made it work. If it didn't work, he would take the blame himself. He never spoke bad of his men, and that is why they were one of the best fighting units in the entire war. I was really touched. Now I can't find the book, I have to have another copy. Any help would be appriciated."},{"Title":"Flying Buccaneers: The Illustrated Story of Kenney's Fifth Air Force","review":"If you are an aviation enthusiest then this by all means is the book for you. It is very well written and profusely illustrated and gives you an insight to Gen.Kinney,s style of thinking and also into his wartime inovations under extremely harsh conditions. For examples, His unit created the first gunships by installing 8 50caliber machine guns into the nose of a B-25 bomber and later installing a 75 millimeter cannon into them that when fired would stop the airplane for a split second,he invented the first parafrag bombs and also improved upon low level skip bombing tactics against Japanese shipping just to name a few things. I very highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Flying Buccaneers: The Illustrated Story of Kenney's Fifth Air Force","review":"Hard to believe this book is now over 30 years old. I had just graduated from college when I first bought it and kept it until it just plain fell apart. It's the only major popular history of the Fifth I know of. It does not have an \\"official Air Force history\\" feel about it so that day-by-day operations are not discussed. If I have any criticism of the book is I wish that Birdsall had put more maps in.

Where are they?!"},{"Title":"Flying Buccaneers: The Illustrated Story of Kenney's Fifth Air Force","review":"This is one of the finest books ever on the Air Force during World War II.

And no Indian ever did either, or even hurt him, and Jacob Hamblin became the Mormons' key to settling among the Indians; he also helped with John Wesley Powell's second expedition down the Colorado River. Hamblin's peaceful demeanor, his ALMOST never-failing honesty, and his genuine kindness to the Indians, as well as people's belief in the special protection that God seemed to have given him, earned him the respect and cooperation of almost everyone he encountered.This book is enjoyable if you're really into Southwest history--but it's not really history...and it's not really that good."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone gunman lashing out at his solitude and failure. Oswald was the patsy in a vast conspiracy to advance shadowy aims.Sailors of the ocean of literature published about November 22, 1963 can expect either one or the other of the above takes on what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas. It's become almost a window into what you really are as a person, what you believe to be the true facts of the crime.The first great thing about Don DeLillo's terrific novel \\"Libra\\" is the fact it posits a third view of the assassination, which can be simplistically described as a blending of the two main versions. In \\"Libra,\\" Oswald is both a lone gunman, following his own idiosyncratic path through an absurd existence of his own design; and the dupe of a small coterie of disaffected ex-CIA operatives and anti-Castro Cubans who think killing Kennedy will shift negative attention on Uncle Fidel and punish the man who disowned their cause after the Bay of Pigs.Ultimately, what killed Kennedy wasn't one man or even a bunch of them, as DeLillo sees it, but a vast pattern of circumstances that gel with the advantage of hindsight into something so intricate and interwoven as to seem preordained. Oswald got a job at a school book warehouse, and the next month the president's motorcade is rerouted right by it. A newspaper ad denouncing the President is published with a funeral-like black border the day he arrives. A rifle and a pistol ordered weeks apart arrive on the same day. And so on.As David Ferrie, one of the conspirators, tells Oswald: \\"Coincidence is a science waiting to be discovered. How patterns emerge outside the bounds of cause and effect.\\"Every assassination conspiracy should have its own philosopher. One failing of \\"Libra\\" is DeLillo's continual use of dialogue like this, apt as it is, to flush out key points. The narrative, disjoined and non-linear to begin with, often verges on the Faulknerian within individual chapters and sections. Fortunately, the overall story is well known enough that this is navigable.Even the best authors can get too pretentious for their own good, but \\"Libra\\" is a great read worth sticking around for to the end. You get vivid characterization, particularly with Oswald and his hyperdramatically self-pitying mother. There's a strong sense of the period, the early '60s before the decade went ker-pow (i.e. before this happened). DeLillo really conveys a sense of what went wrong and what could have been behind it, without offering easy answers or unsubstantiatable blame. It's clear the guy did his homework, covering all the bases as he overlays his fictional vision to the facts we are so familiar with, the story of 11/22 that DeLillo likens to \\"the Joycean Book of America...the novel in which nothing is left out.\\" There are interesting detours, red herrings that tease out various subtleties and, while not essential to the plot, reward repeat readings. Finally, there are some real shafts of humor, as when Oswald, self-exiled in the Soviet Union, is looked over for possible employment by the KGB, and found wanting: \\"The test results were in and only his urine got a passing grade.\\"Does \\"Libra\\" offer the definitive account of the assassination? It's certainly one worth considering. I'm not sure the Jack Ruby angle is explained convincingly (though Ruby is one of the most interesting characters sketched by DeLillo). Most everything else is, though. For the record, I believe Oswald acted alone, but DeLillo does raise some strong points to suggest the contrary. At the same time, there's a lot here to peeve the Oliver Stone crowd.\\"Libra\\" makes for an illuminating introduction to one of our greatest living novelists and to one of the signature events of living memory, which four decades later affects us still. While you and I may not understand everything in the book, it's helpful to bear in mind that comprehensibility is not the object here, and what we get instead is a sense of the things that can happen beyond our ken, and that the belief we control our own destiny is a lie, sometimes fatal."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don DeLillo's Libra is by far the most interesting of the several fictional portraits of Lee Harvey Oswald that have been produced. While Norman Mailer's book Oswald is more immediately accesable, DeLillo's portrait of the reputed assasin is more interesting. In neither book is any real credible motive offered for the killing of JFK, other than Oswald's strange (perhaps pathological) sense of his own place in the great scheme of things. Not to be viewed as contributing to any conspiracy theory, this story is an effort to get inside the head of a clearly demented soul. I found it rather fascinating. It didn't offer any explanations, but it did manage to make Lee Harvey Oswald a real felsh and blood human being to me. Quite an imaginative achievement. A really remarkable book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I put off reading this novel for years despite rave reviews from several literarily astute friends. I simply did not want to read a novel about Lee Harvey Oswald. But last fall I read UNDERWORLD, which I consider one of the 4 or 5 greatest American novels of the past 50 years. As a result, I decided finally to give LIBRA a chance.The bad news is that it doesn't come anywhere near the level of UNDERWORLD, which is an astonishing tour de force. Fortunately, it is still better than the vast majority of English languague novels of the past couple of decades. Any serious reader will be doing him or herself a favor by picking up this novel."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"A fun read, vintage Delillo, loaded with what we've come to expect from an American literary master.A must read for any Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorist.Behind (in order) Underworld, Mao II, and White Noise, Libra is Delillo's fourth best novel."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"In this alternative history, DeLillo imagines what would have happened had Lee Harvey Oswald been a patsy, a failed man who was set up by Kennedy's enemies to take the rap for the 1963 assassination. This is to my mind one of the work's biggest problems, since it trivialises Oswald and turns him into a pathetic almost boring figure who is swept helplessly along by events until powerful forces deliver him into deep trouble and then make sure he is silenced by Jack Ruby. Gone is any indication of how Oswald's sorry life might have moulded him into an individual nasty and disturbed and unstable enough to have picked up that rifle of his own due will and then shot President Kennedy. In this work he becomes a tedious two-dimensional straw man who defies the author's attempts to flesh out his life. DeLillo takes us along the same well-known overtrodden path from Oswald's truancy, then the military, then Russia, then back to the States, and then the trip to Mexico, none of which really adds anything to our understanding of his motives. We don't really care about the man because we know right from the start that he isn't the killer. So the book, in my view, bogs down early and the confusing array of anti-Kennedy characters with their differing motives for wanting him dead do not help the narrative. From the few sources out there, we see Oswald was a deeply disturbed immature daydreamer of a man with a mass of complexes and problems, a man whose dreams of greatness could not have been further removed from the pathetic jobs he fails to hold and his fantasies about doing something important enough to be welcomed and given sanctuary by Cuba. How on earth could he have imagined Fidel Castro would cheer JFK's assassination and then offer the killer refuge? Had he done this, I imagine the U.S. response would have been brutal and violent. In the words of William Manchester, Oswald was \\"a wretched waif\\", yet this pathetic failure of a man is one of the few who will live on forever in history. This book doesn't really explain him, despite DeLillo's best efforts."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"The novel is of an incredible calibur. DeLillo spins this fictional web around historical facts to make it a singular entity. Though the literary effects were a blast (two thumbs), the novel seemed to have a difficult time formulating a plot. The plot is obviously there,however, it did not progress at the usual rate of great novels. It is fortunate that this is not a usual novel. DeLillo focuses more on the little details of an everyday action with a unique effect. Lee H. Oswald was a loose screw without a doubt but through his expertise, DeLillo manages to make the reader think that he was just a dysfunctial intellectual that was dragged around by the invisible leash of conspiracy. This very clever and (for a lack of a better word) creative chronology of JFK's death provides the reader with topics to ponder and question about for it is still a mystery. If the reader is looking for a slow but action packed plot and a thriller to think about, this is the epitome of what you've been looking for."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"From the poetic opening to the climatic ending, Don Delillo doesn't fail to deliver what is promised; a dark piece of history on paper.Character's are expertly crafted and there is rarely the sentence lacking in ingenius observances and irony. Dialogue is extremely provocative and difficult events are pictured with masterful eloquence. The plot itself is very well-crafted if not neccessarily executed to the fullest. The ever-present cynicism is also very welcome and blesses the novel with a unique feel.If there is a flaw with the book, it must be said that there is a lack of consistent progression. You ca devour a hundred or more pages without having a sense of a developing plot. This factor is why I haven't recommended this book any higher. I still believe White Noise is has yet to be toppled over its lofty perch.However, despite this shortcoming, this book is testimony to Delillo's position in comtemporary literature: a master for lesser's to see."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Having read much non-fiction about the assassination over the years and still perplexed over the ambiguities DeLillo writes a brilliant book that conveys the nebulousness, the shadows of a conspiracy that is believable and a delight to read. First read this book in early 90s and liked it even better this time. DeLillo ranks in my top five all-time novelists."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Like to read every on JFK. I do not believe in the single bulletTheory. The Warren Report is so for out in left field, there should be another report."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I must say a lot of the reviews are quite correct in that this is a book that you can fall into and never come out. It is a gripping read. Although I'm skeptical about a conspiracy this book, although fiction, has a gritty uneven real life feel to it. The best laid plans of mice and men usually go awry and often what starts out to be one thing morphs into something completely different. What is most compelling is DeLillo's rather convincing examination of Oswald's personality and actions; it's the only treatment that gets you believably into Oswald's head.Somewhere between the looney theory books and the mind-numbingly tedious factual treatments is this highly entertaining and convincing treatment of November 22, 1963. It's a super read!"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"In the very first chapter of this profoundly provocative novel, we take a ride in a speeding New York City subway with a truant Lee Harvey Oswald. As the young Oswald stares out the front window, little does he realize how much the rest of his life would be just like this: being carried away by a powerful machine and only catching flickering glances of the things and people along the way. Released very close to the 25th anniversary of JFK's assassination, LIBRA does not attempt to seriously propose a conspiracy theory. What he does do is take some of the facts, some of the tempting coincidences, and several of the possible scenarios, and create a labyrinth of intrigue and a world filled with shadows within shadows. This is a creepy book that haunts you, to use a tired cliche but I can't think of how else to put it. (Apparently the assassination is a favorite topic for DeLillo, as the Zapruder film and discussions about JFK conspiracies reappear in DeLillo's later book, UNDERWORLD.) Underneath it all is a dark struggle between what is planned and what occurs: strategy versus chance, conspiracy versus spontaneity, the best laid plans... etc. In LIBRA, the scales tip one way then the other and, yet, the result is the inevitable tragedy of November 22, 1963. This is what historical fiction should be."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"DeLillo's Libra is a fascinating read, not only because its topic is one of America's most traumatizing events in recent history--not the assassination of president Kennedy is the point of interest in the book--but the question: What made this event so terrifying, why had it such an impact?In answering this question DeLillo leaves out the obvious reasons: JFK's popularity and people's hopes connected with his politics. Instead, he puts the focus on a more profound problem: With the assassination of JFK the American people were woken up from their dream of security and regularity. A conclusive explanation of the how and why of the event could have put them back to sleep. Such an explanation is not available though. It is just not the way history works, and DeLillo skillfully shows exactly that in his book. He depicts a conspiracy that gets out of hand and Oswald as a manipulated and constructed individual.Presenting his version of the events, DeLillo at the same time questions its validity. Reading his novel we become aware of the impossibility of drawing the right conclusions of the mass of hard facts and vague hints--the infinite possibilities of what can be held for the truth. Therefore, any historical account can only be a possible version of the real. In so far, DeLillo's Libra places itself somewhere between fiction and history.Libra is a novel that deserves every attention."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"For me, what makes this book so great is not the light it may or may not shed on history; it is Mr. DeLillo's virtuosic prose and the singularly mesmerizing narrative voice produced by that prose.As far as I can judge, DeLillo first achieved this degree of clarity and force with 'The Names,' his sixth (seventh?) novel, and he's continued to refine and improve it ever since. Reading to oneself is a special and private act; DeLillo engages and penetrates this privacy the way few novelists known to me have approached. He expresses a fearless grasp of human nature with language so wondrously charged with poetic energy that the act of reading it is like somehow experiencing fine music through print. This quality pervades his later novels and at least surfaces in all of them, and is the main reason I like DeLillo (not the JFK conspiracy junk that is 'Libra's' narrative pretext).Critics have pointed out, with some justification, that DeLillo's characters are too often like one another. These objectors should be delighted with 'Libra'; the characters are distinct and superbly actualized: Boy Oswald, Win Everett, Jack Ruby, and Marguerite Oswald are all really amazing."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"On the surface Libra is a novel about the history of the assassination of President John Kennedy and an insightful narrative about the man who is said to have pulled the trigger: Lee Harvey Oswald. But as with all such histories, the seemingly clear surfaces merely reflects the latest scriblings on what is really a deeply inscribed palimpist of human chronicle. Based on years of painstaking research and written from the perspective of a CIA historian assigned to produce a complete and secret history of the event, Don Delillo presents an intimate look at the man who has since become the symbol for America's shattered dreams and the subject of countless conspiracy theory scenarios. In so doing Delillo produces an image of Oswald that attempts to transcend the simplistic tropes to which he has been so often cast and, instead, represent Oswald as he really was: a lonely, impressionable, self-contradictory young man with a identity fractured by modernity.In Libra, Oswald is not only the small meek looking man gunned down by Jack Ruby as a stunned nation was instantaneously transformed into subjects of the media panopticon, but also a dedicated Marxist, a US Marine, a husband, father and son. Thus, he gets what most assassins do not: a human face, if not a multitude of them. As the story progresses, Oswald's multiplicitous character is transformed and molded from \\"mere pocket litter\\", a \\"cardboard cutout\\" into a ready-made villain of a fading American ideal. How this transformation is accomplished, rather than the result of Oswald's actions, is really what Delillo is trying to fide an answer for. Whether or not he succeeds in discovering this depends upon the value that is given to history in modern society, and the implicit logic that this type of epistemological inquiry anticipates.In Libra history is not simply an objective accounting of human accomplishment and action, but something constructed by men in small rooms. Libra is about understanding the influence of the apathetic forces of chance, randomness and cosmic disorder, which are then transformed into simplistic narratives that allow us all to sleep at night.Libra is a book for anyone who wonders about the substance of American history and the ways in which this substance is created. It is a novel that throws into question many of our most cherished truths, one that requires the re-examination of the notions of human agency, identity, fate and ultimate nature of our postmodern reality. A great novel that offers many insightful answers as well as being a highly readable and engaging work of contemporary American fiction."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"*Libra* is Don DeLillo's fascinating take on what has become an American version of a classic Greek tragedy: the assassination of John F. Kennedy. You'd think by now that this subject had been pretty well drained of any interest by all the books, movies, TV mini-series, articles, exposes, interviews, etc., but, to his credit, DeLillo has managed to reinterpret this mythic event for the commentary it makes on our contemporary culture. Conspiracy, paranoia, corruption, secrecy, violence, racism, consumerism, moral ambiguity, relativism, the sense that reality itself is up for interpretation, that the center does not cohere, that even with all the tapes and cameras running we still can't say for sure that this happened or didn't happen...this nightmarish landscape is the one DeLillo delineates in this absolutely fascinating novel.DeLillo's Oswald is a construct particularly suited to our postmodern times--the archetype of the outsider as a total enigma, a blank, an empty container, a chess piece neither black nor white, waiting to be given a designation, a purpose, a place on the board of history. He has a gripe, but he's not exactly sure who it's against. Everyone is the enemy. He is the true idealist: good always exists far away, in this case, in the idea of communism, the ideas of Russia, Cuba, Castro. Always in an \\"idea.\\" Reality, however, is something much different, much more ambiguous.I somehow hadn't realized how young Oswald was--24 when he was killed by Jack Ruby. Only 24 and yet he'd already been in the Marines, traveled to Japan, defected to Russia, married and had babies, returned to the U.S., engaged himself as a pro-Castro activist, shot the president of the United States. DeLillo tries to make some sense of this, portraying Oswald as an angry young man burning with purpose and a desire to make his mark on history, but ultimately unfocused, confused, and tragically misguided.*Libra* is a novel, a work of fiction, and as such, DeLillo speaks through all the characters, not only Oswald and other historical personages, but composite, as well as entirely imaginary characters, giving them emotions, thoughts, motivations, obsessions, and memories that he could not possibly verify as belonging to the actual persons, but he does a perfectly credible job of rendering these people believable. You feel they very well *could* have felt and perceived things the way DeLillo describes...and that seems part of the deeper theme running through the novel: that one's interpretation of what happened leading up to and on November 22, 1963 and forever after that fateful date is just as valid as any other interpretation. The events recounted in *Libra* are so compellingly told, so \`realistic' they now seem a part of the official record of not only the assassination, but of \`history' itself. I'll have a hard time from hereon out separating the \`facts' of the Kennedy assassination from my memory of DeLillo's retelling in *Libra.* Reality itself, as DeLillo implies, is a fiction. All plots have their own logic and lead to death.I find it interesting, that nowadays the vast majority of Americans ((last I heard it was something like 75%)) find it more likely that JFK was murdered as the result of a conspiracy and government cover-up than they believe the official government record of the event. What does that say about what we've learned about our government in the days since November 22, 1963? Of what they are capable of doing? What does it mean that we no longer trust authorities to give us the truth, that the very standards for truth have been called into question, that, as a result, no \\"truth\\" is unquestionable, no \\"truth\\" is certain?Underneath the compulsively readable surface of this literary potboiler, this postmodern political thriller, DeLillo, as always, asks the serious questions that matter most. And, as always, the answers are maddeningly elusive.An incredible novel in every regard--five stars easy."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"The Kennedy Assassination, the warp and depth of conspiracy theory, the underbelly of US political life, weird men in small rooms plotting to integrate themselves into the fabric of history. Of course! Lee Harvey Oswald is a perfect subject for Delillo's fiction, which from the off has held all of these themes as an integral part of its fabric.Libra is a compelling read, a convincing fictional hologram of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. Delillo writes his story - opening with his tortured riding of the subway in the Bronx, through his childhood, spell in the marines, the Russia period, his marriage, the weeks and days leading up to Dallas - as part of a conspiracy version. There are plots, there are counter plots, there are freakish creative senior CIA officials wanting retribution for the Bay of Pigs. Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an artist manque 'he wanted to write short stories of contemporary American life' slots into this conspiracy, then at the end, the story slots back to fit the official version of events, the lone gunman story.Some critics accused Delillo of bad citizenship, fanning the fires of conspiracy, the subject of so many cranks and weirdos, the sort of people for whom stories like this are their lifeblood. But Delillo is too intelligent and subtle a novelist to play that game. His purpose was to create a compelling fictional version of events - and compelling they are, his grasp of fringe American lives and tooled down dialogue is immense - which sheds light on the facts from an oblique angle. My understanding of the event that broke the back of the American century was heightened by reading this novel, not because I read it as a true version of events, but because the convincing characters Delillo draws (Libra contains some of Delillo's most accomplished characters, especially women - Oswald's mother and Russian wife, his 'beggar bride'), and the language he uses show just what it might be like to be a tortured, frustrated white man desperate to ingrain yourself with something mega, and the disorienting bewilderment once that is accomplished. Take this paragraph, from after the killing:'Whenever they took him down, he heard his name on the radios and TVs. Lee Harvey Oswald. It sounded extremely strange. He didn't recognize himself in the full intonation of the name. The only time he used his middle name was to write it on a form that had space for that purpose. No one called him by that name. Now it was everywhere. He heard it coming from the walls. Reporters called it out. Lee Harvey Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald. It sounded odd and dumb and made up. They were talking about someone else.'"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don't fault me for quoting Shakespeare. I teach high school kids, I deserve it.The term applied to Paris by Lady Montague is, for me, the best description I can think of for DeLillo's portrayal of Oswald. He is the perfect communist- one ready to be molded in support of his cause.I cannot say enough about this book other than be prepared for a second reading. It's too well crafted a masterpiece for one reading. The puzzle is too intricate.By far DeLillo at his conspiratorial paranoid best.I was in awe of DeLillo's construction. Oswald's life story juxtaposed with the plot being crafted. Each Oswald chapter is meant to parallel the conspirators looking for their patsy. In that vein, let me say that David Ferrie is one of the greatest characters ever put on paper- and yes, I know he was a real person.Once again, it's too amazing for me to do it justice. Don't come looking for history. Come in search of great literature. Come in search of a great crime thriller. Come for the political intrigue. Come for a jaw dropping, skull shattering tour de force. DeLillo at his unquestionable best."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I loved Libra. However, I had a nagging feeling that the last forty or so pages were not as &quot;tight&quot; and solid as the rest of the book. Although it may have been a function of my own sense of the book's end, and a desire for a fantastic finale, and not the writing itself, but there were many questions and plotpoints left unaddressed. Basically - great build-up, disappointing finish. Maybe a follow-up novel built around the plotters' reaction to the Ruby assassination of Oswald or SOMETHING . . . or is this Delillo's point - everyone has a feeling of something left quite unanswered and unfinished."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"In Libra, Delillo deals with one of the most well-known and well-documented events in recent history. The volumes of information, of images, of rumor, of intrigue dominate the story of JFK's assassination. Wisely, Delillo chooses to focus on a more peripheral and much less understood individual, Lee Harvey Oswald. There are so many contradictions in the case for and against Oswald. Was he alone? Was he innocent? Was he part of a team? These questions slide into obscurity as Delillo reconstructs Lee Harvey Oswald/O. H. Lee/A. J. Hidell/William Bobo. The inconsistent Oswald.The book unfolds with alternating chapters between two narratives of the past, and one in the present [1988]. One of the pasts is Oswald's life starting as an adolescent boy in the Bronx, which eventually collides with the other, beginning in April 1963 as a group of disenfranchised former CIA men decide to create a plot to make an attempt on the President. They do not intend to kill him. Shoot and miss is the plan. But as Delillo famously says, &quot;Plots carry their own logic. There is a tendency of plots to move toward death.&quot; So here we have a postmodern explanation for the mystique of conspiracy theory. There isn't an ordered lattice of events and characters, conducted by a deliberate intelligence. There is chaos, only ordered by a downward tendency toward death and destruction. It's Chaos Theory applied to human and political systemms.Libra is also Delillo's most accessible book, at least in the context of the others I have read, (all but Underworld, The Names, and Mao II). Unlike White Noise, the people in Libra seem somewhat real. They are not totally so for that would mean that we understand them, which we don't. Delillo always creates fractured, composite views of his characters. We get glimpses, often contradictory, into their past and their intentions. Maybe it's because I have read a lot of his work, but Delillo's philosophic statements, if you can even call them that, are much more connected to the narrative here than in his other work. For example, Nicholas Branch, in the present day narrative, is a contemporary CIA analyst poring over all the data on the assassination. At one point he begins examining the physical evidence. There are so many abstractions and difficulties in this investigation that the presence of real objects provides a glimpse of something like truth. &quot;The Curator sends the results of ballistics tests carried out on human skulls and goat carcassess, on blocks of gelatin mixed with horsemeat...They are saying, 'Look, touch, this is the true nature of the event. Not your beautiful ambiguities.'&quot; These sections contain some of the most poignant and valuable insight in any of Delillo's work I have seen.Libra is an interesting, if somewhat complicated work that both illuminates and obscures the character of Lee Harvey Oswald. This isn't as frustrating an experience as it might sound. By the novel's conclusion it would be cheap to wrap up such a sad and desolate story with niceties and tidy endings."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"First thing, the larger of the two reviews (I think Publisher's Weekly?) featured by Amazon for this book is very good. Don't expect an explanation of an event disguised as a novel. In Libra, DeLillo is not trying to explain an event in history; he wants to drop us into the lap of that event in all its complexity and nuance. &quot;If we are on the outside, we assume a conspiracy is the perfect working of a scheme. .. A conspiracy is everything that ordinary life is not. It's the inside game, cold, sure, undistracted, forever closed off to us. Or perhaps not.&quot; This is the ambiguous world of the Kennedy assasination, the subject of this jewel of a novel. Particularly vivid in these pages is Jack Ruby: explosive and insecure, cruel in one moment, caring the next. And of course, Oswald. We watch Oswald's slow loss of identity. In Libra he disappears from history -- gradually losing touch, direction, hope, meaning. He does not appear to drive himself, nor is he driven by CIA or FBI or other operatives who, try what they will, essentially find him impregnable. Yet, history it what he makes, or finds. It is the Russian character so much involved in Oswald's ersatz defection, Kirilenko, who best seems to understand Oswald as &quot;some kind of Chaplinesque figure, skating along the edges of vast and dangerous events. Unknowing, partly knowing, knowing but not saying, the boy who had a quality of trailing chaos behind him, causing disasters without seeing them happen, making riddles of his life and possibly fools of us all.&quot; He is encouraged by an operative not to find a place in history -- &quot;wrong approach Leon&quot; -- but &quot;to get out. Jump out. Find your place and your name on another level.&quot; Reading Libra is participating in a waking dream, a graceful juxtaposition of conspiracy and coincidence, coverging at a point in time, at a place in Dallas. Libra is evocative of the whole tragedy, a novel that puts you on edge, not because the outcome is uncertain, but because, at a deep level, one fears to follow DeLillo's exploratory threads. Not a pleasant ride, but a powerful read."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"He lived in the basement with his mother. He adjusted to life in Fort Worth, but not in NYC. Without normal schooling he learned a number of things. Lee's mother, Marguerite, talked to herself. (Don DeLillo's portrait of her is priceless.)Nicholas Branch, retired CIA, writes about the assasination of JFK. David Ferrie is bald. Win Everett, former CIA, teaches at a Texas women's college. Laurence Parmenter, CIA, is part of the Groton-Yale-OSS network. There had been an attempt on the life of Edwin Walker. It is the second anniversary of the Bay of Pigs disaster.Lee feels pity and contempt for his mother. First they lived on French Street in New Orleans with Marguerite's sister, Lillian. Then they lived on St. Mary's Street and next they lived in the Quarter.Laurence Parmenter is five years younger than George de Mohrenschildt. Larry encountered George in Guatemala. George, well-traveled, knows Jackie Kennedy. George thinks he knows who shot General Walker. The boy is grindingly poor. Maybe he is Marxist. George committed suicide in Palm Beach in 1977. David Ferrie was found dead in his apartment in 1967. Branch started to write the history in 1973 and, except for the curator who gets him files, no one knows he is writing the history. Guy Banister has raged against the Kennedy administration. Exile leaders are confined to Dade County. JFK normalized relations with Cuba and the Soviet Union.Mackey, CIA, speaks with Guy after the Walker attempt. Banister complains that Kennedy is in a hurry to be great. Mackey has trained people and he has seen too many people abandoned. Banister is an easier source of weapons than the Farm, a place in Virginia. Win Everett is asked if he knows George de Mohrenschildt. Larry Parmenter wants Win to tell Mackey about Lee.In Japan in the Marines Lee ended up in the brig. He had been on the path to OCS. In Tokyo he lined up lessons in Russian. His teacher, handler, wanted him to stay in the Marines. There was interest in the U2 flights. Banister installed Lee in an office above his in New Orleans. He is anti-Castro, Lee is fair play. Win Everett works on the papers, the false leads, for his shooter. It is just supposed to be an attempt. No one is supposed to die. Not getting a visa extension, Lee had attempted suicide in Russia. After being released from the hospital he visited the American Embassy to nullify his citizenship and to give back his passport. He ate sparingly. There were days of utter loneliness. The state security officer, Kirilenko, liked the boy, but of course idealists were always unstable. He was not agent material. Lee was told he was being sent to the city of Minsk. The Red Cross gave him five thousand rubles.David Ferrie had attended Baldwin Wallace in Ohio. He understood the gestalt of serious talks. He could fly a plane and assist the conspirators in other ways. Carmine Latta and Tony Astorina interested Ferrie. They knew Havana before Castro and wanted to set up a casino afterwards. Ferrie met the men through Guy Banister. Other discontented people, Frank Vasquez, Raymo Benitez, and Wayne Elko were in Florida. Win Everett in Texas had to face up to the fact that Lee existed outside of the plot. Oswald has his own forged documents and his fictitious names. Branch is given a slew of material to get stuck in the web of the assasination story. He is haunted by the twenty six volumes of the Warren Report. Banister dies in 1964, Vasquez in 1966. The latter was shot three times in the head on Flagler Street. The agency pays Branch a per diem rate at his old pay scale.Marina loved hearing English. Lee learns from his mother the Marine Corps have given him a dishonorable discharge. He is stateless, word blind, and he has a wife, Marina, and a baby, June. Mackey doesn't trust Ferrie who knows that Banister has supplied the weapons, can supply the shooters, and has offered to get money for the plan from the New Orleans rackets. Everett figures out that the man they really want is not Castro, it is JFK. Lee likes to talk to George de Mohrenschildt in English and in Russian. George wants Lee to tell him about Minsk and so he can bring information about his stay to the attention of the CIA. Lee is visited by an FBI agent.Jack Ruby has the Carousel Club, strippers. The FBI has opened a file on him as a potential informant. Jack's car is a movable slum. Clay Shaw wants to know Lee's birth sign--Libra. Don deLillo shows convincingly that Lee Oswald is a character out of Dostoyevsky."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I would give DeLillio's Libra one thumb up, and, how should Isay, one thumb down. First of all, I like the novel because it made all the characters come to life. Before I read Libra, I did not know much more about Lee Harvey Oswald than that he was some criminal that shot the president. But now, I see Oswald as a regular person with feelings,ambitions, and disappointments who has been driven into killing by plans of others. It was also frightening, that I actually sometimes felt like the plan to stage a fake assassination on JFK was an okay thing to do. Don't get me wrong, I do not support criminal actions, but through DeLillo's portrayal of the characters, he really changed my thinking during reading. Maybe that is why some see his writing as dangerous: he makes people think things that they do not want to think. DeLillo also makes conspiracies and the cover up of evidence by FBI, CIA (you name it) become reality. Such stories are told in movies, for example the Conspiracy Theory, but we still may not believe them because they are far fetched. But reading Libra brought me a step closer to believing in all those things. Even if it is only fiction and a theory based on history, it really convinced me that the events and characters were reality. Not only does DeLillo bring the characters and plot to life, he also makes the book enjoyable with some of his writing style. For example, he sometimes uses short, insightful, declarative phrases or sentences that stop the flow of a paragraph: \\"There is a world inside a world.\\" (Don't you love this one?) These, seemingly random placed, insightful comments made me wonder about their purpose and so let me sink deeper into the novel. Additionally, DeLillo manages to bring a \\"freakiness and creepines\\" into Libra when he compares Oswald to JFK or Jack Ruby to Jack Karlinski as if they are the same person with exactly opposite lives, for example. More weirdness is added to the literary equation when DeLillo describes coincidences almost imploring that there may be some greater force behind them. Also the \\"glow\\" of JFK is unforgettable and strange. Even though I may sound like I totally loved this book, it is not true. Libra does have some really great twists, vivid descriptions of characters, and also some great language which I liked, but all this is degraded because DeLillo's writing is really tiresome. He jumps from character to character, from one plot to the other, and so makes Libra more confusing than it has to be. Some may argue that this is a form of art and that Delillo should be applauded for it, but I can only say that it made me dislike reading some parts of the book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"After reading the hefty Underworld and the sparse Body Artist, I wondered what DeLillo, a man who has a gifted use of language, would do with a more conventional narrative. With Libra, I began to get my answer and was not all that impressed.Although not completely conventional, the story is more straightforward than the other books I have mentioned. Although a story dealing with conspiracy and assassination, it is basically lacking in suspense and action; for this reason, it must rely more on things like character, in particular that of Lee Harvey Oswald.DeLillo portrays Oswald as a pathetic individual, a malfunctioning human whose failure is inevitable. You don't really empathize with Oswald; instead, you observe him with the same fascination you would give to a train wreck. The other characters in this story are more weakly depicted.There are better novels dealing with the Kennedy assassination and possible conspiracies associated with it. I recommend American Tabloid by James Ellroy, which is much better (and Ellroy's sequel, The Cold Six Thousand, while weaker, is also very good). For DeLillo, while this is not a bad book, he is better off with his more unconventional stories."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Libra (Contemporary American Fiction)by Don DeLilloThe book was recommended by a writer friend of mine who liked \\"Libra\\" very much. I usually do not read this genre, but wanted to give it a try. I didn't enjoy the read that much. Found the characters not engaging enough, the novel a bit disjointed."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"OK, after many years of reading reviews touting DeLillo as one of the greats of modern American literature, I decided to read &quot;Libra.&quot; If this qualifies as great literature, America's literary future is in serious peril. His characters are cardboard cutouts. His dialog is stilted and unrealistic. His descriptive passages are underdone with little evidence of imagination or enthusiasm.Overall, this was a boring book that I would not recommend to anyone. Desperate to understand DeLillo's appeal, I forced myself to read all the way to the end...then wondered why.I've been an avid reader for almost 50 years, reading books and short stories from every genre. I'm always willing to give an author the benefit of the doubt.Maybe I'm just older than most of DeLillo's followers. Maybe it's just that I was old enough in 1963 to understand what was going on. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from DeLillo.This was my first DeLillo novel. It will also be my last."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Well packed and arrived in a timely fashion. A pleasure to do business with."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This book does not in anyway influence the reader, and is one of the worst novels I have ever read. It is written so poorly and is so foggy, I urge the public never to buy this awful book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Reading Don DeLillo's Libra was definitely worth the while. I have found that the style of the author's writing to be confusing but think about it, it was the intensity of the book that kept me so anxious about turning the page. To this day, the exact details to the murder are still not clear, but one thing is for sure: DeLillo has brilliantly depicted his belief of what went on during the time period of the assassination. Don DeLillo did a great job of mixing facts and fictions, making them all seem so real to the reader. Even though some of DeLillo's implications seem unrealistic, the thought of &quot;what if&quot; what Don DeLillo wrote was true is definitely worth some thinking."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This is an impressive book in that it is able to string many different elements of Kennedy Conspiracy theories into a coherant plausible scenario. In terms of the historical grasp of the period the author succeeds. However the writing style is cumbersome by employing a non traditional narrative style of free association by some of the characters. The book is weak on suspense suprisingly so for a conspiracy book. The character development is fairly week outside of Oswald. Also the charcter of Nicholas Branch who was writing a secret history for the CIA should have been expanded.The book is poorly edited even accounting for the unorthodox narrative style. There are grammatical errors and punctuational errors in the manuscript that make it somewhat difficult to read. I give it 5 stars for being a historical novel and 1 star for the writing style."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Murder Kennedy - you wouldn't of course. Never. So, how does DeLillo manage to extend the life of Oswald and the life of the conspiracy surrounding him into a compelling story that makes sense even as it fails reason? The suspense: no, since we already know the ending, and the story itself does not tell itself in some strict beginning to end fashion.Well, try this. Imagine sitting in a cubicle, a cell, or perhaps on a couch, confined to the images of a computer screen or television. Imagine the history that passes by, a history like a metal wall in which the words engrave repel your name. History has no place for you. You watch the television news and it knits your feelings into a vast mass web. But there is a hole in this web, a place where you could perhaps violently wrench yourself into or free. You shoot. Was it right or wrong? As Oswald's mother will say: \\"Your honor, I cannot state the truth of this case with simple yes or no. I have to tell a story.\\"This is one of the main threads of DeLillo's novels: how can we possibly fit or fit ourselves into anyone's story, even our own, let alone the stories of the mass media that turn faces into mere strings of data? It becomes a matter of secrets, of knowledge that resists knowing, that seems always over the edge.In this sense, the pen is not mightier than the sword or the gun but rather the pen is a gun. Oswald, who DeLillo paints, whether true or not, as one of the sorriest malcontents to have roamed the world, signs his name on history: \\"Lee Harvey Oswald.\\" The question, however, remains: not only who is he, but is their or our \\"Lee Harvey Oswald\\" Lee Harvey Oswald's \\"Lee Harvey Oswald\\"?This novel is one of DeLillo's best, in my opinion, it oozes with wonderful lines, it paces itself brilliantly, its twists and turns, its convolutions, piling layer upon layer of a conspiracy that could never end. It evokes the dull-side of Cold War paranoia, the theft of a name, a U-2 without a bomb. And it is this dull side which becomes the day-to-day struggle. So if you could know the secret that would reveal your place or your destiny, what would you do? What could you do? Or is it all really pointless? Will it merely end in headlines, or will Don DeLillo write a book about it later?"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don DeLillo's use of figuritive language and his use of varying sentence patterns made the reading very interesting. This one was deffinately a page turner. DeLillo takes one of the most popular assasinations of world history and tells it from a different point of view. The reader gets to look at the whole incident from the perspective of Oswald. While at some parts I still did not know what was going on in the book and found it very confusing, i loved it, just for that. It was not some easy reading, predictable book. It made you think and thats what I loved about it most.

From boyhood to his young adult death Mr. Dellilo's Oswald is a character in search of self who never gets there. He's a shy, stupid, somehow charming boy who should be protected, but whose grandiose delusions would eventually put any protector off. You'd miss him in a crowd - until he pulled a gun. Oswald and Jack Ruby are the most defined characters in the book, with Oswald's mother weighing in with self-defining monologues that are a pleasure to read, but a pain to sympathize with. She's a whiner with an interesting whine.The remaining characters are thin, never as low-down as you'd expect, and don't seem at all realistic as plotters in the assassination of the century.\\"Libra,\\" is not a mystery, not a thriller, not even much of a drama. If anything it's a meditation on character - or at least on Oswald's character. I'd recommend it for the beautiful writing, (phenomenal dialogue) but certainly not as a page-turner."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Delillo is the foremost poet writing in America today.The fact he writes it in prose means nothing.His dialogue is so brilliant it makes you think you are eavesdropping--on minds.His descriptions of places and emotional states are breathtaking.His relentlessness in seeing the dark side is like Dostoyevsky.BUT!But he wants to make BIG HISTORICAL STATEMENTS, and I am not sure fiction can quite do that. Even Dickens and Hugo have a hard time of it.Fiction, even poetic fiction, like \\"Libra,\\" deals with individuals; history deals with groups.Groups are dull to read about; individuals interesting. Delillo tries to fuse the two (Americana, Endgame, Ratner's Star, The Names, Underworld, even White Noise--better, because less serious), by making his individuals reflect history.But it still never quite works.I applaud his attempt.His writing is always worthwhile, even if his points don't always succeed.Another problem with this particular book--wonderful as it is--is that it focuses on the death of JFK as the Defining Moment for the American Loss of Innocence.But what really broke the back of American Innocence was Vietnam--because American Innocence was and is a self-deception for imperialism, and Vietnam is where the provinces fought back, and won.

In the book Libra we see more of the story of Lee Harve Oswald, in a fictionalized form. But a story behind the imfamous man and his life, and the lives of those around him.When I finished this book I wondered how many people saw Oswald as a victim. How many saw him as a hero? How many still would see him as a villain?I also found myself wondering whether anyone could have been the villain in these events. Could someone else have been in that window that day and shot at President Kennedy, or was it going to be Oswald or no one at all.The author does a good job of blending the stories of the various people in Oswald's life and telling the story through the point of view of various people, from Oswald, to a third person observer, to Oswald's mother. He seemlessly moves from narrator to narrator in the story giving you more than one perspective on the imfamous Oswald and shows what the other people in his life must have thought and gone through in his lifetime.If you aren't interested in this part of history, then this book is not for you. But if you ever wanted to know what make a Lee Harvey Oswald become the man we remember him for, then Don DeLillo's fictional account is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don Delillo is one of the best American writers out there. In Libra, his ninth novel, reflects on one of the most tragic and memorable events in US history: the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He turns his assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, into the protagonist by reflecting upon his troubled life, and an antagonist for obvious reasons. Many conspiracies and coincidences are made evident by Delillo, like Oswald's life in the USSR and the FBI's involvement w/ Oswald, and JFK. It all leads to the focal point of the entire book, though it is predictable since we all know what happens. It leaves you in suspense throughout the entire book and it is very exciting and well-written."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This is the second Delillo book I have read (the other Underworld) and I was not disappointed. Upon finishing the book, I desired to read another by him. His style is incredible, and beyond my own words of explanation. To me, a recurrent theme in this book, and in Underworld, was the theme of freedom and captivity. Did Oswald finally find the freedom in his own life while in his Dallas Cell?Example:&quot;Lee Harvey Oswald was awake in his cell. It was beginning to occur to him that he'd found his life's work...&quot;&quot;This was the true beginning&quot;&quot;His life had a single clear subject now, called Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;&quot;The more time he spent in his cell, the stronger he would get. Everybody knew who he was now. This charged him with strength. There was clearly a better time beginning, a time of deep reading in the case, of self-analysis and reconstruction. He no longer saw confinement as a lifetime curse. He'd found the truth about a room. He could easily live in a cell half this size&quot;Is freedom in the eye of the beholder?I highly recommmend this book to any reader interested in the assasination. Delillo is truly the artist of our time."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don DeLillo has created a masterpiece with Libra. He goes beyond average conspiracy theories by taking the reader through the why,not just the how. From his riveting descriptions of Oswald's troubled adolescent years to a Cuban coverup, DeLillo truely guides the reader through maze of politics, passions, and conspiracy. DeLillo encompasses many literary elements into his masterpiece as well. His short, delclaritive sentences and his allusions to other great works of literature allow the reader to visualize and feel the conspiracy as it unfolds. His constant use of metaphors to show the inner workings of his characters' minds reveal situations with the utmost of clarity. His twisting, apparently disorganized hopping from character to character, from past to present, add depth and understanding to his version of the Kennedy assassination. Lastly, he makes his unverfied facts seem inexonerably truthful and exact through these elements. Libra is truely more than normal conspiracy theory novels and DeLillo deserves much praise for producing such an exciting and plausible novel."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This book isn't so much about coming up with a conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assasination, but about how history itself is fluid, constantly evolving and changing with each new piece of scrap paper.Each of the characters and events in the novel are redefined and reinterpreted as the story progresses, their meanings and implications changing.Oswald and the plot are certainly an interesting enough starting point, but DeLillo's fabrication of the lives of the people in the book and the events leading to the assasination mirror the fabrications that occur within the novel itself.A wonderful concept for a novel and a fun read if your expectations are where they should be (do not expect a historically accurate novel)."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This is one of the most riveting and memorable novels I have ever read. DeLillo is a writer of power, and he has chosen one of the defining events of the century to work his magic. Blending fact with fiction where gaps exist, DeLillo provides a breathtaking and totally plausible interpretation of the forces and people that came together in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It's trip back in time to the days when Fidel Castro, the Soviet Union, the CIA, and the Mafia monopolized the American and world stage, made all the more bizarre because the reader often doesn't know whether he is reading fact or supposition. One thing is sure: The reader will never think of the JFK era in the same way again."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Lee Harvey Oswald walks into your living room sits down and says &quot;Hi, Y'all&quot;.The Assassination, even now after 34 years, has no closure. Into the information gap run Mr. DeLillo, Mr. Mailer and dozens if not hundreds of writers, film directors, columnist, and TV producers. The Assassination remains a cottage industry whose customers are the best of us and also the worst of us.Mr. DeLillo's effort has the advantage of all the intervening years of facts and fiction between November 1963 and now; and he has fashioned a plausible Mr. Oswald and clearly plausible characters surrounding the Southern U.S. in 1963.What you will get here is a Lee Harvey Oswald that is so close that you can smell him, you can also smell agents and low-lifes by the dozens for whom assassination, be it in Haiti, Chile, Cuba or Texas was just another assignment directed by &quot;people of trust&quot;. Mr. DeLillo produces an environment that like Le Carre', he shows how an image is reflected by rumor in a mirror image of a mirror held by a triple agent holding 3 other mirrors.In the end you will comfort yourself in the &quot;fiction&quot; classification of the book, comfort yourself that you have read the &quot;truth&quot;, comfort yourself that DeLillo is just guessing, comfort yourself that DeLillo is exactly right.Put this book up on your shelf right next to your copy of S.Hunter's &quot;Point of Impact&quot;."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Libra is a fictional \\"biography\\" of Lee Harvey Oswald following his life and the plans that were underway during the seven months before the Kennedy assassination to make him the scapegoat. DeLillo, of course, takes liberties with the facts but he has produced a real page-turner and made Oswald into an entirely sympathetic character who may not have had the purest of motives but was not the one who fired the fatal shot.Interestingly, DeLillo attributes an inordinate amount of luck to the fact that the motorcade appeared when and where it did. Several coincidences occurred to make the assassination possible, totally out of the control of those planning it. And yet it still worked.The most fun part of reading it was noticing the ideas presented in the film JFK (filmed three years after Libra was published) appear in this book, making it a familiar territory. David Ferrie, in particular, is a major character and Guy Bannister appears often, also, as does Jack Ruby. De Lillo has obviously done his research.Having just seen JFK again, I picked this up as sort of a \\"companion\\" novel and it worked well in that capacity. I felt that the movie did not really touch on so much of Oswald's life and that Libra filled in those gaps well.DeLillo's sense of time and place are commendable and I think this was probably a good training ground for his epic Underworld, which has sat on my bookshelf, collecting dust for many years and which I will most likely now pick up and read."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"As pointed out in some of the other reviews included here, Delillo's way of dealing with the events around the assasination of JFK mixes historical facts with fictional story-telling. He produces some very ellaborate and strong characters, among which -as the main protagonist- Lee Harvey Oswald stands out: Oswald is shown as a real person with his own life (instead of simply reducing him to the empty stereotype of the assasin of JFK). This leads to what I find most stunning about LIBRA: you'll end up finding yourself on the side of Oswald, who turns out to be a naive but endearing object of manipulation. You'll read the book, mourn for Oswald, and understand that JFK was only one of two victims of the assasination."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Fantastic fictional deliberation and elaboration of the characters and conspiracies culminating in the assassination of JFK. DeLillo pounds out amazing characters and builds nail-biting suspense in his fictionalized account of Oswald's participation in the assassination. Even with profuse editing errors--mostly involving punctuation--this manuscript deserves the highest rating and regard."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I come to DeLillo's Libra via James Ellroy's American Tabloid. Ellroy has his own take on the Kennedy assassination, but he praises DeLillo's take very highly. When Ellroy praises, I listen.I see now why Ellroy loves the book. DeLillo's take is very persuasive and executed with high art. DeLillo's Oswald is an alienated loner, seeking to connect with something important. He's not sure what that is--a momentous event, a large historical process? He distrusts all governments--ours, the USSR's, the Mexicans'--and moves mercurially between ideologies. He serves in the military; he defects to Russia; he leaves Russia; he flees his mother though she is the only steady point in his life; he marries a Russian woman but beats her and drives her away. As those who would seek to exploit him realize, he is both vague and weak but sometimes strong and determined. He has been bullied and brutalized in the past but he has somehow survived; he could be the perfect tool.It is an old principle in literary study that the more you get to know a character the more you like that character, even if the character is radically flawed. DeLillo is working against that principle and he does so successfully. The more we get to know Oswald . . . the more we get to know him. We do not like him; we simply begin to understand him as a figure more pathetic than malevolent, more sad than savage, more lost and doomed than the other characters in the shadows who populate his world.The other dark forces--Castro-hating CIA agents, bitter Mafiosi, uber-weird right-wingers like David Ferrie--are beautifully realized and ultimately part of the strange stew in which Lee Harvey Oswald ultimately finds himself. In capturing the characters DeLillo is capturing the times. He does that very well. He also captures the places, particularly New Orleans and Dallas, though we get a feel for Miami as well.DeLillo's structure is largely chronological, but he switches between characters and points of view and offers an overall impression that coheres very nicely. Much of the character depiction is phenomenological, with a summation of experiences, impressions, insights, glimpses, momentary realizations. This is very Ellroyesque and we can see DeLillo's influence in many ways.Finally, this is a piece of historical fiction which is very plausible, very moving and very, very sad. The writing is generally exquisite. The characters and events (as Conrad would say) have been very carefully contemplated. In Heart of Darkness Conrad writes of the \`brooding gloom' that hangs over London and its environs. If it's brooding gloom that you want, here, in Libra, is God's plenty.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Fascinating look at how the JFK assasination COULD have happened. Excellent blend of fictitious character and real life ones. You get an idea of what some notorious figures like Guy Bannister and David Ferrie must have been like. DeLillo injects you into the mind and world of Lee Harvey Oswald. And what you find is a man who is not easy to like but complelling to watch. Oswald is a moth fluttering around all his life until the light which is Dealey Plaza draws him in to his ulitmate destiny. The book also is gives a look at how a man might truly be in two places at once."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"It feels more centered, more focused than White Noise, in large part since it takes such a specific event and builds a weird, fevered narrative around it. It Shows how a group of extremely powerful but extremely isolated zealots find themselves drawn into a labyrinth connected by coincidence/destiny/large, vaguely defined forces of history. On one level Delillo is offering a very contemporary sort of critique about the nature of conspiracy theories and how people conceive of and develop them as a way of grappling with aspects of modernity that are simply too difficult to rationalize otherwise. But at the same time he can't resist coming up with his own rather elaborate idea of who is really responsible for the Kennedy assassination. And it does a great job of showing what happens when crazy right-wing anti-communist, nativist hysteria runs rampant through people's minds. The anti-castro leagues of the early 60's come across as being the precursors of the tea party movement today"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Author managed to make the subject interesting even as it's been overdone. This might be what JFK would be like had it been done by a director who was more inclined to capture the times rather than promote conspiracies. DeLillo would make a good director himself."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This was a very uneven book in my opinion. It's premise of course is that JFK's assassination was a vast conspiracy plot with many people playing out private agendas. The book delineated those agendas well: exploring/explaining each player's motivations. There was the mafia who resented RFK going after them and interfered with their business or was it just because JFK had an affair with Giancana's gumma? Jack Ruby was a bit player who'd worked with Giacona in Chicago and was in debt to mobsters who used him as a trigger to shut Oswald up. There were many covert government operatives but the main one didn't like JFK's selling out the Cuban rebels after during Bay of Pigs and he wanted to scare but not kill the president into renewing his efforts for the Cuban cause. There were the Cuban rebels themselves who were determined to wreak vengeance. And finally, of course, there was pathetic Oswald. The first half of this book felt disgustingly sympathetic to him with his single parent upbringing, moving all the time, learning disabilities, other kids bullying him, poverty but it started to level out when DeLillo describes Oswald's physical and mental abuse to his wife Marina. Oswald's thinking becomes more and more deranged. I'd forgotten he actually kills a policeman who attempts to detain him soon after shooting Kennedy. I really didn't want to like or even sympathize with Oswald but I did come away from the book with a clearer idea of what might have formed him."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Interesting that a book such as this is categorised as &quot;fiction&quot; when in fact it comes awefully close to the actual account of things...For anyone having read the actual historical account of the JFK case written by Jim Garrison (the D.A that officially investigated the case) &quot;Libra&quot; might seem -even- watered down, or, &quot;mild&quot;.De Lillo overwhelms as he revives (literally, as mostly anyone associated with this case is long dead...) the characters that set the stage for Kennedy's association and takes a brave approach simoultaneously as he doesnt opt for the easy way out.It's an interesting concept the one that De Lillo undertakes: take a historical event and retell the story by letting the real characters do the talking, the living, the plotting, show them in every day life, bring biographical scenes from their lives forth and ultimately , under the guise of fiction, unfold the story again.There would be objections, of course. Anyone would would try the same thing that De Lillo does here would probably come up with a different variation. Some even with a radically different one. The author of this book comes close, very close.As a work of literature it is sometimes repetitive but it mostly wins its bet as De Lillo proves over 350 pages that he's got the charisma of reconstructing characters , but moreover, of understanding human nature and politics. Afterall, one with no understanding of human nature has no understanding of politics, thus, this had to be a given.Allthough i would personally reccomend Garrison's book, &quot;Libra&quot; is not a bad place to start if you feel somewhat &quot;confused&quot;..."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Each chapter of Libra could make a great &quot;Atlantic&quot; article. Written with nuance and a keen eye for the perfect little details, they are individually stunning. What DeLillo fails to do, however, is integrate the pieces in a compelling way. Besides some promising scenes that the reader will identify (for example, the notorious photo of Lee H. posing with a gun in his backyard) and recurring and painfully obvious expositions on the place of coincidence in history, this feels like a loosely related short story collection. Yet I suppose that the greatest failing of Libra is to make the reader feel any pang of sadness or sympathy when its characters so famously die. DeLillo's sober, detatched style backfires in this sense. The pieces of something great are here, but DeLillo doesn't bring them together."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This book is a wonderful example of the way fiction is able to elucidate a level of truth that nonfiction is not able to get at. Written in a dreamlike quality, but more easily digestible than other DeLillo works. A stunning piece of work that will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Libra elucidates one of America's darkest moments: theassassination of J.F.K. DeLillo does an amazing job combiningfact and fiction, weaving them together, where the manyreporters and journalist had failed. But many critics have foundmany faults with Libra. The conspiracy theories, the true showbehind the scene, they find those ideas unrealistic anduncensured. WHY?"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Not being a major scholar in the conspiracies and ideas bouncing around about the Kennedy assassination, I have absolutely no idea how factual Delillo is being in this book as concerned with major figures, events, etc. And I really don't care. The only thing that I used when deciding whether I liked the book or not is whether it entertained me and made me think. And it sure did. Delillo presents another version of the famed assassination, focusing more on the mind and manners of one Lee Harvey Oswald and how he might have got sucked into a conspiracy to kill the President. Or something. As the book starts out, the goal is to not kill the President but to make it seem like someone is trying so that everyone will blame the Cubans (the Bay of Pigs invasion still fresh in everyone's mind). From there, things get . . . strange. The plot flips back and forth from Oswald and how he goes about his short life (his mother gets most of the best monologues) from America to Russia and back again, all the while interspersing it with the various characters who interacted and might have had something to do with the assassination. Which makes everything confusing and earlier portions of the book slow, as you're trying to figure out just where this is all going. However, this is a slow burning intense book, where the suspense leading up to the action is longer than the event itself. Delillo uses his masterful command of the English language to craft an insular paranoid world for the reader, without going nutty with conspiracies, he puts forward a fictional version of how things might have happened and makes you believe it. Everyone is drawn three dimensionally, including Oswald, who is seen as more of a tragic figure but at the same time knows exactly what he's doing and how people will perceive him forever. Delillo's writing is full of surprising phrases, just when you think he's dipping into the waters of Hemmingway and not being that descriptive, he throws out seemingly random comments that make everything fall into place perfectly, or turn everything on its head and make you reconsider. By the end, his writing has been polished to a spare, desolate beauty and ending of the book is one of the most touching I've read in a while. With the events of that grim day in November already spelled out for everyone, Delillo's makes it his task to make you know the people (perhaps) and he passes that with flying colors. If you can keep the time lines (he mucks things up even more by throwing in some guy who is researching the assassination for the CIA years later) and the people straight, you'll have a grand time. Whether you think it was a lone gunman or an army of them, you won't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Libra deals with the Kennedy assassination from Lee Harvey Oswald's perspective. Oswald is presented as one of a number of trigger men, but as only a small player in a much larger conspiracy involving former CIA operatives. At first it appears that the conspiracy's goals are to use a failed attempt on the president's life as a ruse for re-invading Cuba, however somewhere along the line that plan is forgotten and the president becomes the real target of the operation.Oswald is presented as a confused and misguided individual, with big ambitions but little direction and with no clear goals. The story takes the reader through Oswald's service in the military, a defection to Russia, a failed marriage and a number of other misadventures. Libra presents Oswald as a not entirely willing participant in the plot to assassinate Kennedy. This fictional Oswald is a pathetic, but disturbingly sympathetic character.The book is a good one. One of its themes which I greatly appreciated is the banality of evil - while conspiring to assassinate the president, the plotters also deal with their day to day problems, such as taking care of their families, worrying about their careers etc. From this perspective the book is fascinating and unique. However, I never found myself fully gripped by the plot nor did I feel any suspense. Libra is a good book, it may even be great from a literary perspective, however I read novels for entertainment and not for literary genius. From this perspective I feel that the book came a bit short."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"The manner in which the author links up the life of Lee Harvey Oswald (the Libra of the title) with the multiple and convoluted conspiracies to stage an assassination attempt is completely engrossing. Oswald's imagined life on its own is fascinating, and if the depiction of the workings of the CIA is anything like the reality, we should all have a long deep look at how our world works.Unusually for DeLillo, the minor characters, mainly invented, are all brilliantly portrayed and the reader cares about how each and every one of them ends up. DeLillo's notorious way (or lack of it) with dialogue actually works in this novel (whereas for me it fails utterly in a novel like Underworld).The assassination scene finally arrives after 400 pages of intrigue and is well worth the wait. It's so well written that the events seem to flash in slow motion across your eyes as you read.The only bum note for me was the depiction of Jack Ruby, who is written as a kind of afterthought. The author is obviously constrained by the factual basis, but Ruby's own story could have been more thoughtfully interweaved."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"For me, the great novel explaining a political event in the 1960's remains DeLillo's &quot;Libra&quot;, which gets inside of Lee Harvey Oswald, plausibly explaining how Oswald thought while also serving as a biography of his life. Libra joins the novel seamlessly to history."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Before reading Libra, I was curious about the title. Why Libra?It becomes apparent (for those of us that didn't know) that Oswald is a Libra, and like the tipping scales of his astrological sign, Oswald is presented as a mass of contradictions; a confused, idealistic young man who can easily tip (or be tipped) one way or another. Delillo manages to make Oswald (somewhat) sympathetic, reminding us how young he was in 1963 and presenting him as someone prone to manipulation.Libra is a fascinating novel that seamlessly blends fact and fiction. In Libra, the JFK assignation is not a carefully constructed, brilliantly executed conspiracy. Like the tipping scales of the title, the assassination is presented as a merging of conspiracy and chance. There are shadowy secrets and plans within plans that tip the scales one way, while spontaneity and chance tip the scales the other way. The outcome on November 22 was unpredictable; part strategy, part circumstance. In the end there is no overarching plan. Conspiracies are runaway trains that take on a life of their own, hijacked by others and affected by chance.Libra is a brilliant novel, extraordinarily well written. The novel is not, as some might expect, Delillo's attempt to settle, once and for all, what happened on November 22, 1963. History is our collective consciousness. Our reality is what we believe is real. The truth is something else."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"\\"Libra\\", to say this book is about the assassination of JFK is to miss the point of the book. By using basically the same exact cast of characters as James Ellroy does in his The Cold Six Thousand, DeLillo comes to a likewise and evenly frightening conclusion. Unlike many novels relating to JFK assassination DeLillo's attempt details events from two unlike perspectives. The first which explores Lee Harvey Oswald's life is well accounted by the authors fulgurous creativity. The other more schematic plot construes the infamous conspiracy to assassinate the President. By the end the quality of the author's delivery and characterization, we are left with empathizing Lee Harvey Oswald, Who is known to the mass public as one of the most notorious men of the twentieth century.Libra is a fictional novel about the history of the assassination of President John Kennedy and an insightful narrative about the man who is said to have pulled the trigger: Lee Harvey Oswald. This dead obligating novel was found to be confusing by some people, but I really enjoyed reading it. What fascinated me for the most was how DeLillo takes this historical event, tear it up, and remodels it, playing with all different types of stereotypes that were made, and fighting the challenging hypothesis. He follows Oswald life from a young boy, to manhood, and to an assassin (is he?). Don DeLillo delivers many sides of Oswald giving readers a chance to come to their own conclusion. The meaning of the title itself if given a second look, deliver multi-levels of meaning to what DeLillo is actually conveying.The assassination scene finally hails after 400 pages of reading and is worth the waiting. Very well written, I found the events to flash in slow motion. It's gripping and intense, the examining descriptions of his time spent in USSR, his wife and his mother. Libra contains Delillo's most accomplished characterizations, especially of women - Oswald's mother and his Russian wife. The dismaying and scary Mrs. Oswald is a proof of her son's insanity. Mrs. Oswald was demented, and so was lee.His cold and brilliant novel begins with thirteen-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald sharing oppressively close quarters with his mother. Lee was the third of three children in the family the youngest of all, the oldest boy Robert Oswald, was Marguerite's son from her previous marriage. As a single mother, Marguerite was often unable to provide for her three sons. They spent several years in and out of orphanages. Lee's childhood was marked by constant turmoil, as they had to move from one place to another. It was rare for him to attend more than one semester at any given school. His grades were poor and as he grew older, his attendance became less even. He was characterized as a lonely child. And his mother generally refused to comply with recommendations about counseling and other treatments for her son.\\"If she had faced it, if she had seen to it that Lee received the help he needed,\\" Robert Oswald would state, \\"I don't think the world would ever have heard of Lee Harvey Oswald.\\""},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Libra was my first DeLillo read and I found it to be a very compelling one. The first few hundred pages of the book meander menacingly along like a slow movement in a Shostacovich symphony. There is no humour, no quickening of the pulse anywhere: instead we see bleakness, we feel the oppressing humidity of the South and witness the claustrophobic plotting of 'men in small rooms'. At first I was less taken by DeLillo's montage technique, but I honestly can't see how he otherwise would have been able to weave such a dense matrix from which fate leaps forth. This is what is absolutely impressive about this book: as the story unfolds, the assassination plot starts to develop its own logic, with those who conceived it in the first place standing helplessly along the lines. The great engine of Fate grinds its way through History, sweeping the lives of minute individuals and the consciousness of a nation along with it. DeLillo masterfully lets the story run its own course. As a result, this is a novel which really gets under your skin."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don DeLillo's &quot;Libra&quot; does not center on the JFK assassination itself but rather on its prehistory and aftermath.Libra is a masterpiece of criticism. DeLillo criticizes hierarchies and power relations that are getting out of hands as does the orginal plan, i.e. the conspiracy, of Win Everett, eventually developing a self-dynamic which kills President Kennedy. The JFK assassination is not the only significant historical happening in Libra. Besides depicting Cold-War History, DeLillo demonstrates how historical events (the Bay of Pigs Invasion) can leap into the present,bearing negative, even lethal, consequences: President Kennedy is finally killed by an ex-Cuban who was with Castro in the movement of the 26th of July, being a member of &quot;the starved army of beards&quot;.Additional to this rather unpronounced critique of past events (and the failure of dealing with them in an adequate way), there is a critique of manipulation on various levels. First, there are the conspirators who are constructing the future assassin of JFK, &quot;putting together a man with scissors and tape&quot;. Then, there is the omnipresent world of the media that more and more invades our private life, to an extent where we can no longer differentiate between what is real and what is not.This feeling of insecurity is even reinforced by the proliferation of systems and soctieties' fragmentation and brutality that Lee Harvey Oswald is a victim of. The character of Lee Harvey Oswald seems to stand for any individual who does not find its place within society, being pushed from one side to the other, manipulated and abused, aquiring &quot;foolish different characters&quot; that can not prevent the ultimate failure.DeLillo leaves the reader with more questions that she/he had before: with questions about identity, reality and positionality. Who am I, what is my perception of the world, and what is ultimately true?A very inspring book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Oswald appears to the American public as a cipher-the basics are known but his interior life remains a mystery. Because of this, Lee Harvey Oswald proves to be the perfect subject for Dellilo's penetrating examination. Delillo presents the reader with a lost soul; a man searching for something to fill the aching void that is his life and finding only pain; most of which is of his own making. Oswald wanders from place to place; adrift in a life that he constantly tries to control but fails repeatedly. Family, school, the military, and political beliefs all leave him further and further from finding a purpose, and a little further from a rational point of view. Finally he becomes a pawn for conspirators who are trying to make America aware of the dangers of Castro's Cuba, and it is then Oswald realizes that his life is not what it was supposed to be. The conspiracy is only important for the purpose of giving the novel a foundation, just another device to move Oswald forward to his inescapable end. Amazingly, Delillo creates feeling compassion for his character, who while rooted in history, remains purely a fictional being, Dellilo's interpretation of the interior life of one of America's most infamous figures."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Prior to 9/11, the assasination of President John F. Kennedy was the most public of American tragedies. Regardless of an individual's personal feeling toward the President, that person was emotionally drawn into the assasination by television and the other mass media. It might be argued that this event shaped the face of televison journalism for decades to come. The story had everything: drama, tragedy, conspiracy theories and the live televised murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. Few of us who were alive on that fateful day in Dallas cannot remember what he or she was doing at the exact moment the news was first heard.That Don DeLillo decided to treat the event in a \\"fictionalized\\" manner gave him great latitude to combine well documented facts with the novelist's own creative talents. The result is absolutely brilliant. Although DeLillo centers his narrative around Oswald, he uses real and invented characters to give his book the feel of a novel while at the same time the immediacy of journalistic reporting. Although the reader is well aware of what is to come, DeLillo builds up the suspence by his masterful manipulation of time. He interweaves chapters that deal with Oswald's early life with chapters that are in \\"present\\" time as well as with chapters dealing with the period immediately preceeding the assasination. As the reader moves through the book, Oswald and the plotters all move inexorably toward that day on which their fortunes were to meet. By the time of this meeting DeLillo has so developed each of the characters to a point that their actions and the scenario that the author presents are completly believable. Particularly impressive is the way the author developed some of the subsidiary characters such as the disaffected Cuban, Raymo; Oswald's mother, Marguerite; and the G. Gordon Liddy clone, Mackey. The testimony of Marguerite before the Warren Commission is one of the most riveting pieces of monologue I have read, completely defining the speaker's character and all her misconceptions, tenderness, and cunningness.Thankfully, DeLillo avoids falling into the conspiracy theory trap and he neither preaches a particular point of view nor uses the hindsight of history to draw conclusions from events which followed the assasination (as did Oliver Stone).

Rather than telling us completely why he was shot and the complete details of the assassination(which to his credit he does well without giving too many Clancy-esque details)it focuses on the man who's name and face is synonymous with the assassination, the man who allegedly shot the President with 3 bullets from a bolt-axle rifle with a defective aim in less than 6 seconds whilst being a poor shot: Lee Harvey Oswald. His life. the significance of the title being that Lee Harvey Oswald's star sign was Libra.It starts from Oswald's childhood with the rantings of his bizarre mother and how his childhood was spent in poverty which led him to have left-wing ideals. This was one of the factors that led to his downfall, his ideals. It charts his career in the navy, his association with characters involved in the asassination(like David Ferrie) and his rather strange years in Russia and back to the USA again.This book hoever does have a few technical inconcistencies(which I can't help but point out as I am quite an anorak on the details of the case). The main one being that the backyard photos were never taken by Oswald but were of a man with the assassination rifle and holding some left-wing literature and Oswald's face superimposed upon it. This has been proved by certain shadow inconsistencies in the photos.DeLillo does have a gift for writing and his writing style is very poetic. This combined with the historic even of the assassination of a President imposed on some social satire (the satire being the nature and views of the American people in that era and the impact of the assassination in that it deprived the people of a sense of security and of an influencing figure, especially to the youths, to whom JFK was a godfather figure) combnie to make an ever-relevant book which shares the twin badges of being well-written as well as well-regarded."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"To say this book is about the assasination of JFK is to miss the point of the book. JFK's death is merely a pallette for an absolutely brillant work. DeLillo prose is both haunting and fitting. This is possibly my favorite book."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This book put a fascinating spin on the JFK assassination. Seeing the life of Lee H.

This one was deffinately a page turner. DeLillo takes one of the most popular assasinations of world history and tells it from a different point of view. The reader gets to look at the whole incident from the perspective of Oswald. While at some parts I still did not know what was going on in the book and found it very confusing, i loved it, just for that. It was not some easy reading, predictable book. It made you think and thats what I loved about it most. I would recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Don Dellilo with Libra claims the title of the modern master of the Hemmingway iceberg -- a plot that pokes out of the surface of the water, leaving the reader to imagine the massive form below the surface that keeps it afloat... Or, less is more. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"There's a certain school of thought that states that authors generally don't make good scriptwriters; they're too much in love with words, not dialogue. DeLillo falls into this category. His sentences are beautifully written (though some times he seems to be trying too hard), but his characters don't talk TO each other, they talk AT each other. Every person in the book seems to have some knack for speaking like wanna-be nineteenth century poets. Anyway, the novel itself is enjoyable, but DeLillo tries to cover all the angles. Oswald WAS a lone nut. But, unbeknownst to him, the CIA was really pulling his strings, designing their very own &quot;patsy&quot; before the fact. What? Isn't this an either or situation? Or maybe this is closer to the truth than DeLillo realizes; on November 22, 1963, just about anything seemed to have been possible."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I found this book to be acceptably put together with vivid descriptions of settings and emotions. Delillo made a great interpertation of a killers mind. Overall the book has a stirring plot, but I found it slow. The ending was especially slow; I kept on waiting for it to get to the point. I would recommend this book to others if they have knowledge of the political and governmental issues of JFK's time."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"In LibraDon DeLilo takes a factual event (the Kenndey assasination) and adds a fictional twist. He develops many fictional characters which add to the overall conspiracy based plot. In Libra DeLillo not only trys to change &quot;history&quot; by giving plausable insights into what happened before the assaination, he also attempts to depict a man's life prior to the assaination. This 456 page book is attention grabing from the first to the last page."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Prior to 9/11, the assasination of President John F. Kennedy was the most public of American tragedies. Regardless of an individual's personal feeling toward the President, that person was emotionally drawn into the assasination by television and the other mass media. It might be argued that this event shaped the face of televison journalism for decades to come. The story had everything: drama, tragedy, conspiracy theories and the live televised murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. Few of us who were alive on that fateful day in Dallas cannot remember what he or she was doing at the exact moment the news was first heard.That Don DeLillo decided to treat the event in a \\"fictionalized\\" manner gave him great latitude to combine well documented facts with the novelist's own creative talents. The result is absolutely brilliant. Although DeLillo centers his narrative around Oswald, he uses real and invented characters to give his book the feel of a novel while at the same time the immediacy of journalistic reporting. Although the reader is well aware of what is to come, DeLillo builds up the suspence by his masterful manipulation of time. He interweaves chapters that deal with Oswald's early life with chapters that are in \\"present\\" time as well as with chapters dealing with the period immediately preceeding the assasination. As the reader moves through the book, Oswald and the plotters all move inexorably toward that day on which their fortunes were to meet. By the time of this meeting DeLillo has so developed each of the characters to a point that their actions and the scenario that the author presents are completly believable. Particularly impressive is the way the author developed some of the subsidiary characters such as the disaffected Cuban, Raymo; Oswald's mother, Marguerite; and the G. Gordon Liddy clone, Mackey. The testimony of Marguerite before the Warren Commission is one of the most riveting pieces of monologue I have read, completely defining the speaker's character and all her misconceptions, tenderness, and cunningness.Thankfully, DeLillo avoids falling into the conspiracy theory trap and he neither preaches a particular point of view nor uses the hindsight of history to draw conclusions from events which followed the assasination (as did Oliver Stone). That there are among us \\"men in small rooms\\" who deliriously inflate their own importance and who by a single act of violence can insure their place in history is all too real. DeLillo sees it as his task not to try to \\"furnish factual answers\\", but only to \\"fill some of the blank spaces in the know record\\" so that these misguided individuals might be better understood. He has succeeded in his task."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"A brilliant imagining of what may have happened behind the scenes of the 1963 Kennedy assassination. There are no diabolical masterminds here, just confused, pathetic men for whom the weaving of secrets is both a means of control and a natural expression of their own frustrations. There is no intricate conspiracy, rather an accumulation of events that ultimately explodes into a national tragedy. The book makes the point that cause and effect are very slippery concepts when it comes to history."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I picked up \\"Libra\\" as a great Don Delillo fan who wondered how he handled the familiar material of JFK's assassination. I was not disappointed. In \\"Libra\\", DeLillo successfully imagines the life of Oswald, building a believable emotional and historical portrait of the man who would commit this murder. He also creates a believable Ruby, drug addicted and not in control of his life, who would have twisted reasons for shooting Oswald. Finally, he presents a murder conspiracy that is plausible, a marginal operation on the political fringe that needs considerable luck to succeed. \\"Libra\\" is an imaginative tour de force that helps explain how this tragedy happened."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"The most plausible work of fiction concerning the JFK assassination that I have read. The fact that the dialogue (both external and internal) is truncated and unrealistic actually doesn't matter. The author is anxious to &quot;show&quot; us what happened and to &quot;show&quot; us the motivation of his characters (obviously largely based on real people) and is anxious to show us everything and does so, like a dedicated but pressed-for-time tour guide. So the dialogue is sacrificed but in a good cause. There are MANY things about the JFK assassination that argue AGAINST the idea of a wide-ranging conspiracy. Oswald's and Ruby's OPPORTUNITIES to commit their respective crimes both arose by happenstance. Most conspiracy buffs either disregard that or embroider the truth about that. Not author Dom DeLillo - he boldly acknowledges these random elements and cleverly incorporates them into his plot. DeLillo is, in short, an Oliver Stone with integrity and with his feet on the ground. Oh yes, his treatment of all characters, including bit players like David Ferrie, is also more understated and hence more realistic than Stone's. The &quot;conspirators&quot; are not heartless all-powerful manipulators in service of the forces of darkness but ordinary people with limited authority and human foibles who cross their fingers and hope for luck as does everyone who has ever punched a time clock."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"I was seven years old when Kennedy was shot. A sad faced man came on the television screen and announced, &quot;President Kennedy has died.&quot; People were crying everywhere. Libra was my first close look at the whole event that sent America into a tail spin, and DeLillo mixes Oswald biographical detail with his uniquely crafted sentences of flowing, aliterative fiction. I never was a Kennedy assasination buff and I'm stll not, but I loved reading this novel. The story kept me on the edge - this is a real page turner. Part-fiction and part Oswald's world, the story may be close to the truth of what really happened, or it could be a fantasy from DeLillo's vast imagination. It doesn't matter where the truth lies. It doesn't matter that we all know how it ends.

It's one of those books that definitely takes you somewhere else.

I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Really a fun read. Delillo takes you on a wild ride to Dallas,through endless rooms of bizare CIA missions, anti-Castro Cuban enclaves, and the very strangelife of the enigmatic, US Military Intelligence Spy, Lee Harvey Oswald.Delillo brings these very odd characters back to life, as they truley must have been;Captain Dave Ferrie, of the Civil Air Patrol, in particular, God, you will laugh until you cry.His portrayal of underworld figure Carmine Latta, his Carribean network of criminal enterprise, isso good that I am going to re-read the book just to experience that alone.Delillo's decription of when Lee Oswald met Ferrie at a civil air patrol meeting; Ferrie was standingthere, in his underwear, argyle socks to his knees, red-mohair wig and painted on eyebrows, trying tosell Oswald a broken rifle. He explains to Oswald how to transport the rifle through town, saying:\\"That's easy, put it in a blanket...\\" HAHAHAHA...Delillo is the king of this type of fiction.Also, Delillo does a pretty good portrayal of how the CIA backed conspiracy went down. More info hascome out since 1988, but still, it isn't bad, and much more realistic and true to the facts than evenSteven Kings novel 11/22/63 (that came out in 2011), which is complete garbage."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"Fictionalized accounts of historic events, particularly recent ones, make me suspicious. Any author might write a book set during an actual event, of course, but authors who set out to tell a tale about that same event give themselves a whole set of challenges that strike me as unnecessary at best. Just how fictionalized is the story to be? How closely must it stick to historical fact before it becomes nonfiction? What does the fictional element add - that is, why bother to fictionalize it at all? Why in the heck would anyone spend so much effort writing a story the ending of which is a foregone conclusion? And so on.I haven't read enough of Don DeLillo's work to explain why, but there's something about him that leaves me unsurprised at his willingness to face this set of thorny problems. Whatever makes him more likely to tackle this style than others, \\"Libra\\" is one of the novels upon which his reputation rests. It explores the life of Lee Harvey Oswald on the one hand, and the supposed conspiracy to assassinate John Fitzgerald Kennedy on the other. Some of these story elements are factual, many are speculative. Most are spellbinding. I found myself reading the thing wondering if the conspiracy would succeed or not; I had to remind myself that the president would without fail die at the end, and so would the protagonist. DeLillo actually managed to retain some sense of mystery about his climax. That in itself makes this novel a success.Which is not to say that everything about \\"Libra\\" is equally successful, of course. As the title implies, DeLillo evidently intended to tell his tale against a structure about balance and imbalance. To that end, he introduces a character named Nicholas Branch who spends his time with the millions of documents about the assassination - reading, watching, listening, digesting, and allegedly writing an official history of the event for the exclusive use of the CIA. Not at all a bad literary device, and occasionally even shocking; once in a while you run across a passage dealing with Branch and you remember with a gasp that the story you're reading is already over, that people have spent years trying to understand it and have failed. Works well with the balance/imbalance theme, but to my mind Branch doesn't appear often enough in the book to hold up his end, as it were. In other words, the Branch material works, but not the way DeLillo apparently wanted it to.More successful is the back-and-forth between Oswald's life story, much of it taken from the historical record, and the developing conspiracy among old Agency operatives, almost all of it speculation. Much has been written as to why Kennedy died, of course; DeLillo takes on the notion that the real assassins were out to punish Kennedy for abandoning Cuba to the Communists, or maybe just recall America's attention to the issue by threatening the life of the president. Whether the events in \\"Libra\\" are fact or fiction, the author does a decent job linking them; plenty of novels try to do that with two separate plotlines and wind up telling two stories that never quite come together. In this case, DeLillo gives us conspirators who intend to invent a nonexistent man to blame the assassination on, and discover that their man has actually been right there the whole time. At which point Oswald finds himself participating in this conspiracy almost without realizing it. This lack of intention has something to do with his dyslexia, his years as a Russian defector, even his astrological sign. And thus DeLillo loses a certain amount of control over his materials. Still interesting to read, but again, not quite for the reasons DeLillo apparently intended.And that's the big problem with \\"Libra\\", or any novel that deals with a historical event. As I said before, the question arises as to why one would want to deal with such an event fictionally. \\"Libra\\" is a good read, raises good questions and possibilities, and sold pretty well, but I can't help feeling that people read it because they were interested in the Kennedy assassination, what the author calls \\"the seven minutes that broke the country's back\\". In other words, \\"Libra\\" is interesting not for its own sake, but more because of something outside the world of the book itself. It invites a certain lack of imagination; readers must judge it for how accurate they think it is, at least in part, rather than how much it touches them or makes them reconsider their world. Call me a purist, but that's not quite good enough for me. One star off.Not more than that, however. Like all things Kennedy, \\"Libra\\" drew down enormous criticism from certain wings of American life. George Will, for instance, referred to it as a work of \\"literary vandalism and bad citizenship\\" because it speculates on matters that (according to Will and his kind, at least) have long since been disproved. I suppose that the \\"Oswald acted alone\\" side of the argument believes that any attention to conspiracy theories does a disservice to America as it tries to heal from the events of November 22, 1963. Maybe so, but if you ask me, DeLillo's book helped remove the aura of untouchability that surrounded those seven minutes. You can't move on from something you can't touch. So aside from its quality, however ambiguous, \\"Libra\\" actually does help us heal.Benshlomo says, American history belongs to all Americans, and all Americans may come and play."},{"Title":"Libra","review":"This was not my first Delillo novel, I've read Mao II, Underworld and White Noise before this one, no particular reason to wait and read Libra.

I plan to hit 'em all. This is one hell of a STAR TREK adventure. For me it is the satisfying completion of an unrelated trilogy: the other two books areSpock's World (Star Trek)by Diane Duane andStar Trek Vulcan's Gloryby Dorothy C. Fontana (vid. my reviews).This is a good, old-fashioned murder mystery - as Capt. Kirk rushes a young ensign to Vulcan to get him into an experimental treatment that just might save his comatose life and discovers there is murder at the Vulcan Science Academy Hospital. Sad.We meet a charming and interesting Vulcan family, the patriarch of which is an important physician. He has a partner and pal, a human doctor who has invented the new nerve tissue-regenerating treatment with him. We get to know the Vulcan doctor, his two kids - and sadly his wife, undergoing the experimental treatment, is the first murder victim. Only when the ensign is killed do they catch on that it is terrible foul play.Worse yet, Amanda, Spock's lovable mom, is undergoing the same treatment. She is due to come out of it soon - will she make it before the murderer decides to cook her also? This is a refreshing, slightly humorous break from the other two books; you don't need to imagine the old cast working a murder mystery because here it is.Also, if you don't own the other two book titles, GET THEM and read them. While I have called SPOCK'S WORLD the \\"STAR TREK-VULCAN bible\\", this unique trilogy collection is the only collection that features Vulcan and Vulcan characters in such a prominent way. The cream of that crop is still SPOCK'S WORLD; that is why I say get all three at once - because no matter which one you start with, you'll badly want more when one book is finished and you do not want the cupboard to be bare when that moment comes."},{"Title":"The Vulcan Academy murders","review":"This book would deserve four stars for the beautiful setting and all the insight in the life of the people on Vulcan - I loved Corrigan and Sorel.

I think Kirk would have been a more careful detective should the need have ever arisen on the show, instead he lets his guard down all the time and pays the price for it.An enjoyable book, but not the best Star Trek book I have ever read.

Had it been titled &quot;The Vulcan Academy Affair&quot;, or &quot;Trouble At The Vulcan Academy&quot;, or some such similar title, we might have missed the clues that told us who the murderer was. As it is, I was certain of the murderer and the motive before the characters had even begun to suspect that the deaths were not caused by accidental mechanical failure.That being said, I did think that the book was well-written; the characters were well-developed and consistent with previously established character concepts.

Without giving anything away, essentially the plot involves a series of what appear to be sophisticated murders and murder attempts at the Vulcan Science Academy. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are on leave on Vulcan when these occur. As a whodunnit, this one is so-so -- I knew within thirty pages who the real perp was.On the other hand, the author gives us a very interesting speculation as to the nature of Planet Vulcan and its inhabitants, with even a glimpse of Vulcan politics and societal issues. I very much enjoyed this. Further, the author's prognostications about Vulcan ecology, predators, etc. were well-developed, imaginative, and very much held my interest.I was less impressed with the author's portrayal of the interaction between Spock and Sarek. Most interpretations of this relationship show the two never fully reconciled, with Sarek every bit as stubborn as Spock. (Many fathers and sons can relate to this.) Here, however, reconciliation is almost complete, which I thought robbed the relationship of depth. Well, that is my opinion, but after all, it is the author's story to tell.Another quibble: the overuse of telepathy as a story device. This is a phenomena of dubious reality, and if it were as well-developed and powerful among Vulcans as the author portrays here, in my opinion their society would be unimaginably different. Telepathy, like time travel, tends to be overused by science fiction writers, and I thought that to be the case here. I found the author's interpretation of Vulcanian telepathic abilities to be overdone, which detracted from the plausibility of the novel. Again, just my opinion.Overall, I enjoyed this one a lot.

Not only are Kirk, Spock & McCoy written great and recognizable but the characters that are introduced in this book are great. Lorrah does a great job of painting a portrait of all the characters. You actually care about the characters that are introduced not just the familiar Star Trek characters and that is rare. Lorrah also knows the Star Trek universe, especially the Vulcans. There were a whole lot of subtle things that made the book great. The enemies Kirk faced in the desert showed that the author had watched the animated series, plus the customs, information from past original series episodes, and the main three characters, she has done her homework. Lorrah also did a great job of keeping the reader interested. She would give you clues every so often to keep you wondering if your guess is correct.The big thing that I noticed was the fact this mystery was easy to figure out. Since it was a \\"who did it\\" book even though a science fiction book it should have confused me a little longer than it did. I had things figured out by about page 50 or so. Another thing that I noticed was the way Sarek was written. He was a whole lot looser than the Sarek that I know from the Original Series episodes, TNG series, and the movies. He seemed to be a whole lot more vocal with his feelings than I was used too. The plot slowed down every once and a while. There was a lot of mind melding, and explaining the detail the mind melding, sometimes to a fault. The only other thing I noticed was Dr. M'Benga had not been aboard the enterprise yet as he was in the OS episode \\"A Private Little War\\" from season 2. However, apparently this book took place about two years after \\"Amok Time\\" so to say that two years went by between \\"Amok Time\\" and a \\"Private Little War\\" is not accurate.This is not the best mystery that you will ever read. However, it is a great adventure.

The amateur detectives drawn into a crime among friends/family, a small, homey setting for the crime, a red herring or two to misdirect the reader and the mystery element taking a secondary role to the characters and romance.An accident on the Enterprise has left a young crewman horribly injured. His only hope for recovery is an experimental medical technique being researched at the Vulcan Science Academy. After they arrive at Vulcan the subjects of this new proceedure begin to die under questionable circumstances. Soon the questionable aspects become the unthinkable - murder - a crime that simply does not happen on Vulcan.The mystery aspect of the story is quite weak. Most readers will be far ahead of the characters in finding the culprit. So if the mystery is so lacking why five stars? This novel is absolutely filled with information about Vulcan society in general and Spock's past in particular. For fans Trek fans (and who else would be reading this?) in general, and particularly for TOS fans especially those fans of a certain Vulcan this one is fascinating."},{"Title":"The Vulcan Academy murders","review":"I love any story about Spock.

The 1915 original version is available for free in it's entirety at google books.From my quick perusal of the material I gather that by today's standards this text would be considered advanced undergraduate material; whereas, in the preface, the authors (both of Yale University) state, \\"The purpose of this book is to present in a short course those parts of Analytic Geometry which are essential for the study of Calculus.\\" , giving the impression that first year undergraduates are expected to have the mathematical maturity to handle a text of this rigour.In any case, I suggest you do as I will: print out the pdf, get a feel for the style of the exposition and the difficulty (!) of the exercises, and then decide if you would like to purchase a hard copy of the later printings on offer here for nearly the cost of shipping."},{"Title":"Olivia","review":"\\"Olivia\\" is a \\"r&eacute;cit\\"---a short novel told in the first-person by someone with a story to relate or a confession to make, sometimes as observer, sometimes as protagonist. She or he concisely describes a crucial series of simple events with complex depths and resonances, capped by a catastrophe that often combines physical with emotional extremity.The \\"r&eacute;cit\\" was born in France; and Dorothy Strachey Bussy (1865-1960) absorbed its tradition into her blood, as befits a translator of Andr&eacute; Gide, to whom she was passionately attached, and whose \\"L'Immoraliste\\" personifies the genre. Written in French in 1933, \\"Olivia\\" was not rendered into English until Leonard Woolf accepted it for the Hogarth Press: it grips you from first to last.Sent to a finishing school outside Paris well before the Great War, Olivia becomes an unwitting object of contention between the two headmistresses, Mlle Cara and her partner Mlle Julie, after the young Englishwoman contracts a crush on the latter. The gathering crisis is chronicled with an ecstatic ruthlessness, classically contained, akin to the verse dramas of Racine which Mlle Julie reads aloud to her charges with such intoxicating effect.Strachey's astute artistry is exemplified by the moment when Mlle Cara, driven to jealous ranting, makes poisonous use (for a book published in 1949) of the designation \\"Jewess\\"---a cherry-bomb word that sends tremors through the floorboards. But a writer's severest test comes near the end of a dramatic work, when the emotional climax which concludes the main action absolutely must convince the reader of its truth. Here it is the final encounter, after Mlle Cara's illness, between Olivia and Mlle Julie: without a false note or clich&eacute; it sweeps one along with authentic, closely-observed anguish. How apt that Colette wrote the 1951 screenplay.In her foreword, Regina Marler provides the biographical and cultural background needed to appreciate the tale even more deeply. One hopes she will rescue another mislaid classic for us to reappraise. If only more masterpieces were this \\"minor.\\""},{"Title":"Olivia","review":"The brilliant Regina Marler has contributed an elegant introduction in which she very simply and directly lays out the facts about Dorothy Strachey's strange, privileged life, and dashes our hopes at once by letting us know that this is no memoir, it is that rarer more courageous thing, a novel. And yet, Marler continues, the novel possesses an emotional truth which may in fact vie closer to Strachey's own life, her needs, her accomplishments, than she in fact knew. Just as we are now familiar with Dora Carrington, the brilliant UK painter who staked her life and soul to her love for the gay author and flaneur Lytton Strachey, and who killed herself when Strackey died, we now have the example of Dorothy Strachey, who seems to have half-embroidered, half-distilled this example of pure, clear Sapphic enchantment as an offering to the man she was in love with, French novelist Andre Gide, whose translator she had become years and years earlier.Happily she did not kill herself when Gide died, and happily the book that she wrote, \\"Olivia,\\" has a punch and an emotional availability that none of Gide's works possess. So it seems today that sometimes, the lover wins out, while the loved one wraps his shroud of untouchability right into the grave of Lethe. The story of Olivia and Mlle. Julie has one of those tears guaranteed wallops at the end; not just at the end, when you're prepared for it, but at the extreme end, like the hand of Carrie reaching through the grave around Amy Irving's ankle."},{"Title":"Olivia","review":"This novel by Dorothy Strachey, sister of famous biographer and eccentric, Lytton Strachey, is a little jewel of a well-written novel. Probably based on Dorothy's experiences in a girl's school, it describes a English teenager's crush on a school mistress in late 19th century France. This novel is not about sex or being a lesbian. It is about anticipation and the overwhelming need for affection and approval. It is a classic, \\"coming of age\\" novel with (for once!) a young girl instead of a young boy.

Hey, I was desperate to help the fund raiser.I only made it through about 50 pages. It's 266 pages of Dr. McCormack telling about his life as a rural veterinarian in Alabama. No engaging story line, IMO anyway, just page after page of stories about him establishing his business, helping animals and talking with locals in southern, country lingo.The story starts with him coming to the rescue of a cow nearly dead from some gas causing it to bloat excessively, which caused its uterus to protrude. He saved it by releasing the gas, giving it medicine and reinserting its uterus....all in the cold, rain and mud.Pretty amazing doctoring, but not something I care to do or read about.

Over eight chapters he reviews the development in the study of leadership, what is missing from the literature and his opinion on the implications for future leaders. Unfortunately, if the reader does not have the same base knowledge on the subject and breadth of vocabulary as the author, the book is an arduous read. For instance, he refers to over 40 theorists and significant authors. Many of them are mentioned briefly and only in relationship to one another. Also the third chapter mentions functional rationality, but I did not know it was synonymous to instrumental and technical rationality until a footnote in chapter 5. That shows my weakness though, not Starrett's.If you want &quot;Leadership Studies for Dummies&quot; this is not the book for you. For novices in this subject area, it is a good starting point for a scholarly overview of the study of leadership. For scholars, it creates &quot;big picture&quot; connections.(Chapter titles: Exploring Excursions, Excursions into the Sociology of Action, Leadership and Charisma, Leadership of Flawed Institutions, Leadership in the Postmodern Context, Leadership in the Social Drama, The Drama of Leadership, The Education of Leaders)"},{"Title":"A Place for Noah","review":"Josh Greenfeld writes of his multiply challenged son, Noah. Born 7/1/66, Noah never really mastered verbal communication, his toileting remained hit or miss and he could not really be engaged in any social activity. Noah's older brother, Karl (b. 11/64) is, in the author's word, &quot;wonderfully unremarkable,&quot; a normal foil to Noah's challenges. Karl understandably wants a normal, healthy brother and vacillated between anger at Noah and affection for Noah. In one poignant entry, Karl, then 6, tells Josh not to institutionalize Noah because he loves Noah.The Greenfelds leave the suburb of Croton, New York for Southern California in search of a helpful program for Noah. Josh, a screenwriter and his wife, Foumi, also a writer find their niche in California and Karl forges out a group of friends. Noah endures the gamut of programs from operational conditioning to short term instituitionalization, which is outlined in &quot;A Client Called Noah.&quot; Irate over the poor treatment Noah went through, the Greenfelds have their son removed from the institution and a round of searches begins anew.Prior to this drastic decision, Foumi begins an after school program for developmentally delayed children in their community and Noah is one of their pupils.This book covers the years 1972 - 1977 when Noah was nearly 6 until he had just turned 10. The time period shows the woefully inadequate plans and the overall lack of knowledge in austism with multiple challenges."},{"Title":"A Place for Noah","review":"I recently read an update on this family, I think it was from the last 90's.

Tribute Book: Unofficial and Unauthorized-The Complete Story!!! : America's Favorite TV Spies!","review":"Robert Anderson brilliantly takes over where his predecessor leaves off, knowing fully well he was meant to close the door on the topic, grown tired perhaps. There is no need for elaborate, unrequired details; therefore he gets direct to the point over the essential facts without the addition of endless pretty photos. (He has no desire to fuel his own ego, therefore he doesn't include a photo of himself posing with anyone or any collectibles. To do so would be too glamourized, too egocentric.This book, while plain-looking in appearance, deserves to be read especially if his predecessor's book is. It's right on the money and won't disappoint in the least."},{"Title":"The U.N.C.L.E. Tribute Book: Unofficial and Unauthorized-The Complete Story!!! : America's Favorite TV Spies!","review":"Seems this book needed to be published, this time around authored by one Robert Anderson, who obviously was dissatisfiedwith his predecessor's book. Mr. Anderson gives us a good indication that three sources can be written about a spy show that started and ended as a serious espionage thriller, and more than just a small-screen copy of 007. This is politically correct: the show was only a spoof for two annuals, including the spinoff starring a female lead--cocreator Sam Rolfe hated the campy approach and diehard followers would swear in agreement. The fact the show lost its magic touch were the lighter scripts that eventually bored even the leads. Dissatisfication with one's childhood isn't a required to despise a good half of the episodes along with its short-lived spinoff bomb. Some of the third year's episodes are definitely comparable with Michael Myers' Austin Powers. Buy Anderson's book if you like the show."},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"I didn't mind the tangent universe. I liked the story. The characters were strong and convincing. The plot was well-strung, with tension and resolution in the proper places.What I didn't like, however, was that this was just Stardoc, with names changed to protect the innocent. Rebel daughter with genetic anomolies, secret about her birth, controlling father with exact-duplicate-of-my-perfection complex, mother who talks to her after death, issues about reproduction, betrayal by some stranger she trusted the instant she met him, issues with the Jorenian &quot;Choosing,&quot; boyfriend with that strong Jorenian morality code, what about this is sounding one bit different from the first Stardoc book? Um, well, she didn't wisecrack quite as much as Cherijo, but other than that, it was all too similar for my taste.I bought this one, I'd probably get the next one from the library or borrow from a friend. Not one I'd recommend to anyone who had already rad the Stardoc books and was expecting something new and different from SL Viehl"},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"In the far future, Earth belongs to the Allied League, which consists of many different species, but the inhabitants on Terra are very xenophobic. Aliens are not allowed to live there and mating with another race is a crime. The children of that mating are denied citizenship and if discovered are deported, their money and property confiscated. Jory Rask is a world famous shockball player but when it is discovered she is part Jorenian, she is kicked off-planet.She travels to her mother's home planet but on board she meets an assassin from Reytalon who says she could go there for training as she has the moves to become a lethal BLADE DANCER. She thinks it is a fine idea once she accomplishes her mission on Joren but when she leaves she takes six other half-breeds with her, all Children of Honor whose mothers were sold into slavery but were recovered. The half-breeds were treated as pariahs but on Reytalon they are all treated as equals. Their common heritage forges a bond so strong that they become their own clan house, a fighting force that is almost unbeatable.After reading S.L. Viehl's \\"Stardoc\\" novels, reader's curious about the Jorenian home planet and culture will find it is very different than that of Earth's. BLADE DANCER satisfies the audience's curiosity through a story line that details the philosophy that Jorenian is based on. There are many twists and turns in this stand-alone novel and there are some unexpected surprises in store for a group of half-breeds who have become a family.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"Jory was one of the finest Shockball players on Earth, until it was discovered she was half-Jorenian and kicked off the xenophobic planet. When her mother died, she gave Jory an undertaking; to go to Joren and find the rest of the half-Jorenian children who were the results of the same 'raid-and-ravage' from which she was born.Including Jory, there are seven half-breeds. Once Jory delivers her message to them, a message of truth, the others decide to join her in her quest. Jory is off to learn how to become a Blade Dancer, the deadliest of assassins, in order to hunt down and kill the biological father that violated her mother so many years ago.The gang is trained on Reytalon in the Tana, to become Blade Dancers, but in the midst of the tests of strength and endurance, the seven must learn to trust each other also. And even Reytalon is not immune to conspiracy and evil alliances with the warring League and Hsktskt factions. Will what these seven learn at Reytalon be enough for them to avoid the same fate of their parents?S.L. Viehl is one of my favorite authors. Definitely lighter than most of my other fare, Viehl is always able to bring in tense, taunt situations with realistic and likeable heroines, and create a story that I can literally pour myself into.Her worlds are extraordinary, her characters so real that I would know them on the street, her aliens imaginative and believable, and her plots thick with action and adventure.I was introduced to Jorens in Viehl's StarDoc books, and was intrigued to see a darker side of their clannish ways in Blade Dancer. Viehl gave us a little peek at just how stubborn those big blue guys are.If you liked the 'StarDoc' series, you will love 'Blade Dancer'. 'Blade Dancer' is a good starter book to introduce yourself to Viehl's writing also, though I promise you will be running for more of her work when you finish. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"BLADE DANCER is, in many ways, a very fine book. It reminds me of the best qualities of that good ol' action-adventure sf. For the longest time, that area was a male-only genre, until CL Moore and Leigh Brackett proved women were just as capable as men. I rather wonder if one of the names isn't a sort of tribute to Moore's Jiril of Jory.The action is fast and intense, and there's a lot of it, and it seems to go in a direction, rather than be merely a string of incidents. The characters are well-portrayed and one develops affection or the reverse for them. The aliens are sufficiently exotic to match the other virtues.I had only two problems with the book, but they kept me from giving it more than three stars. **SPOILER ALERT** The first was the \\"Luke, I'm your father\\" routine, which was ancient when Lucas used it. The other was the happy ending. I do like happy endings but in this case it seems to not have been a natural development of the characters or even the universe as established earlier in the book, but appears rather like a suspiciously large rabbit being taken out of a very small hat. I'm still glad to have read the book and do recommend it, but with a caveat."},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"Blade Dancer is a novel set in the same universe as the Stardoc series, but with a different set of characters.

Since they are both on Terra illegally, Jory buries her mother in the desert, but is caught by Planetary Residental Commission agents and deported.After departing Terra, Jory bribes the Captain of the liner to take her as close as possible to Jorenian territory. She meets an Alliance Major on the liner who has the tools and skills to repair her damaged knee prothesis.

She has promised her mother to tell her story to the other six ClanChildren of Honor. Then she will be free to find her father and kill him.This novel is written in the same style as the Stardoc tales, but covers a different aspect of Jorenian culture.

However, no mater how skilled an author is I do not believe that their talent gives them license to arbitrarily make a arguably new series by gutting out the characters and perspective of the StarDoc line and slapping in new ones upon the original \\"world\\".In short I gave this book three stars because of SL Viehl's unique talents, not because with a almost immortal character it would become hard to continue a series."},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"I love science fiction as an ideal- I generally hate it in practice.

The interaction between all the ClanChildren of Honor and especially the tension/attraction between Kol and Jory was wonderful. Jory's anger came out great in all her one-liners.

Unfortunately for Jory her mother comes from another planet, called Joren, and therefore her daughter is a half-breed. When Jory's mother dies and her secret is discovered she is forced off the planet. She sets off to her father's homeworld on a mission to find the other six half-Jorens and tell them about their true history - that they are the result of a rape on their mothers.

She and they are forced off the planet and make their way to the Blade Dancer academy - and find themselves in a dangerous and difficult environment as they try to survive and learn to deal with a hostile world.The story moves along really quickly. There is characterisation, plot, description and yet you never feel that it's dragging.

Since the book description thoroughly covers the plot, I will just add some of my own commentary.I really liked the premise of an assassin school and getting good old fashioned revenge and frontier justice but it was more dark than anything else and not exactly enjoyable to read. Quite a fine line to tread since any attempt at portraying at a realistic school of assassins would not be pleasant, after all.I somehow did not connect to the characters as much as I should have. Perhaps because even as they tried to grow or bond, they were not very likable for me. Unfair, really because that is part of the point --- they were products of their upbringing and environments which turned them into the rather unlikable people they were. Despite eventually overcoming their pasts, I did not feel all that glad for them in the end.A good read, but not a keeper for me."},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"Great book, the lead character jory has enough flaws to make you interested in how she fares.

Jory Rask is a shockball player and a very good one. One reason is that she is half alien; a fact that comes out after her mother's death and results in deportation.Jory knows some of her Jorenian heritage and has promised her mother that she will seek out others like herself and let them know the truth. The truth is that her mother and a number of other Jorenian women were captured, enslaved, and bore children of their slavers.Truth can be a painful thing and Jory and the others wind up entering training to become warriors and assassins. But like in many schools, cliques form and rivalries form. But at a school of combat rivalry can be deadly.The plot moves well and at one point you may wonder what the author is up to. Many surprises lurk beneath the surface but the planned shocking revelation is obvious for a hundred pages prior. Still, a good tale set in a rich universe (although medicine seems to be way behind the times)."},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","review":"I stayed up way too late last night reading it.

Also, I had to fight the urge to say &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot;.It was a fun romp. I hadn't read anything by Viehl before.

I learned to care about these new characters too, and to be honest half expected all the characters to meet, since it was same time frame and places.

This is fun."},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"Part autobiography, part titillating sex novel, part scholarly treatise, \\"The Rice Queen Diaries: A Memoir\\" deals with a subject that is obviously very close to the heart of the author: being a gay white male attracted primarily to young-looking Asian men, which is a \\"rice queen\\" in gay slang.The writer traces his attraction chronologically, from his early years in a small Canadian town outside Vancouver, which was best known as being the location shoot for low-budget American films. It was also closest to the site of a Japanese internment camp during World War II, which the author found out his uncle had a hand in running. He conjectures that this knowledge may have triggered an early curiousity about Asians, but his own budding sexuality was solely responsible for his attraction to them. After relocating to the larger city of Vancouver, he is able to more openly pursue his interests as a gay man, and becomes involved in one of the \\"Long Yang\\" clubs, designed for those attracted to gay Asian men. Having already had many encounters with young men from various East Asian countries, he then becomes the proverbial \\"kid in a candy store\\" when he takes an extended vacation in Thailand and Vietnam, where he eventually realizes that the numerous sexual partners he has are the result of economic transactions born of the difference between the cultures of the individuals involved.For those wanting more information than his personal observations, the author includes numerous references to scholarly works on the culture of countries he visits, as well as psychological studies concerning the Interracial atrractions involved. He also makes a realistic assessment of his own behavior in such interactions, and doesn't like what he sees. By the time he is halfway through a later working visit to Thailand, he greatly curtails his sexual encounters, spending more time socializing with other expatriates, which he suggests left him open to find the one individual with whom he is currently partnered.The book was interesting to me, now five years removed from a three year relationship with a slightly younger man from Taiwan. The balance of scholarly analysis and retelling of the author's exploits make it difficult to keep the book as one cohesive work, but the author seems to strike an ideal balance to make the book of interest to readers, regardless of whether you share the type of attraction discussed or perhaps are the subject of it yourself. I'll give it four stars out of five."},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"By MARK V. ROSE, Author of BANGKOK, OH BOY!Daniel Gawthrop's Rice Queen Diaries is more than a memoir. Perhaps confession would be more apt. The largest section reveals sexual encounters and interactions between himself, a farang (Thai for foreigner) sex tourist from Vancouver, Canada and a barrage of interesting Southeast Asian men. But here and there throughout the book, the author's keen intellect catches up with his libido, incorporating fascinating, and very welcome cultural, anthropological, historical and sociological observations and information.Exploring his obsessions with \\"Rice Queendom,\\" Gawthrop is generous and honest in his revelations. For the un-initiated, or if one doesn't know, although considered a pejorative by some, a \\"rice queen\\" is a gay westerner who delights in and seeks Asian men. Gawthrop's passion is king-sized.Early in the book, Gawthrop tells of his boyhood crush on Bruce Lee, how as a ten-year-old he even took up judo to be like the sexy kung fu artist. It didn't take long before he realized he wanted less to be Bruce Lee than to have him.Sent to a private school in the ninth grade, Gawthrop pleasantly discovers that many of the students were kids from Chinese immigrant parents. He witnessed how one of them, \\"Jackson,\\" was given a hazing one night by four, boozed-up, white 12th grade jocks. Lights out, the older boys surrounded his bed in the dorm and held him down while the other boys in the room feigning sleep, watched what turned out to be a kind of erotic initiation rite. Then all five, Jackson included, smoked cigarettes and joked. It left a lasting memory on the impressionable young Gawthrop.Getting past such reflective, childhood experiences, Gawthrop then tells how he went to Vancouver in his early twenties where he experienced the lustful pangs and pining of a young, adult gay man. He moves into Vaseline Towers and his tale begins to take force. In \\"Hongcouver,\\" the author visits the bars and baths, experiencing abundant sex with a variety of men--mostly Asian. He calls his attraction to them \\"yellow fever\\" and, indeed, it does seem at times to be an ailment! Woven into the highly spiced account is a succinct, fascinating background of the Chinese immigrant presence in Western Canada. They, like the migrant Chinese who came to California, built the trans-continental railroads. Such moments of respite give a welcome breather to the rampant sex--one may even say an official pardon.The author goes to Bangkok, works for a major English language Thai newspaper and vacations in Pattaya, Chiang Mai and Vietnam. At that point, he becomes almost a slave to his obsessions.The Rice Queen Diaries strikes me as a sometimes sad but authentic exposure of an alarming descent into a spiral of never-ending searching to quell one's sexual appetite.Like Gawthrop, I've lived and worked in Thailand and was reminded of the temptations and dangers of sexual escape in a foreign country where the potential to besot is available 24/7. Add to this the temporary relief of limitless icy cold beers to deal with the heat and humidity, increasing the fantasy that one may be in a tropical paradise.In the last short sections, Corruption of the Heart and Coming Home, the author faces approaching middle-age and the startling recognition of his capacity for a kind of racism. Gawthrop defines it well: the treatment of an entire group of people as one's own personal playpen. Fortunately, after three years of bedding down with countless men, many of them impoverished and problematic, to satisfy a voracious sexual appetite, and then \\"in one way or another\\" heartlessly casting them aside, the author allows himself to fall in love with Lalune. A migrant worker from Burma, Lalune has a cherubic face, twinkling brown eyes and a personality that is simple, uncomplicated and earnest.Although he had half-heartedly attempted a number of short-lived, serous relationships with Thai lovers--some of whom because of economic depravation, exercised disappointing, exploitive, fiscal and monetary maneuvers, it is a welcome moment when at age thirty-eight, the jaded man no longer expecting to find love, finally lets love in. It is even more satisfying when he commits to an enduring partnership. He starts the difficult immigration process of sponsoring and bringing Lalune to Canada. The reader is left to wonder if the admirable wish is ever realized, but that will require another diary to look forward to. In Rice Queen Diaries, this scant moment comes almost too late in the book, but getting there, although frustrating at times, is well worth it.My Bangkok, Oh Boy! reveals a similar involvement between Mat, a horny farang and a handsome Thai man, comparable discomforting financial transactions between them, and the perils and rewards of bi-cultural, long-distance relationships. Although Mat is not referred to as a \\"Rice Queen,\\" after reading Gawthrop, one can say he certainly qualifies. Bangkok, Oh Boy! depicts a few sexual escapades that parallel Gawthrop's East/West saga, but by comparison with his vast chronicle of sex, my unapologetically horny central character seems chaste and unblemished in that department. But, Mat shares some of the unconscious sexual racism Gawthrop briefly explores, and comes to face it full force in concluding chapters. In any case, Gawthrop rings very familiar bells.Rice Queen Diaries is a highly recommended read. Together with Rafaelito Sy's Potato Queen, Gambone's Beijing, Sulayman K's Bilal's Bread and Kadushin's Wonderlands, it is a welcome addition to a growing and increasingly necessary genre of West meets East.Mark V. Rose, Author BANGKOK, OH BOY! atripress@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"After reading the editorial and Amazon reviews, I had high hopes that this book would provide thoughtful insight from a unique perspective. His narrative reveals more about his partners than about himself and ultimately I found myself more interested in the people he came into contact with than in him. The closest he gets to \\"insight\\" is by providing commentary on other writings rather than commentary on his own assumptions, motivations and experiences. In fact, he uses the word \\"entitlement\\" for the first time on page 241, with only 10 pages left to the end of the book, and then retreats into the same strategy of emotional distancing by telling someone else's story and quoting someone else's text (an appropriation that itself can be considered colonialist). He spends more time presenting himself as the exception to the rice queen stereotype (thereby leaving the stereotype untouched), rather than considering how he may be perpetuating the stereotype himself.I was glad to see that he didn't spend too much time on \\"white guilt\\", but would have loved to see a broader range of emotions- about himself- exhibited in the book. I would have loved to see him struggle more, either by redefining and reclaiming the Rice Queen label or by talking about the inner conflict of shame/pride/delight/frustration of falling in love outside your race. He also describes each of his individual relationships and encounters as if there were no common themes to how he entered into and broke them off. He also seems to differentiate the class/power difference between his (younger, poor)Asian and (sometimes older, sometimes more affluent) Asian-Canadian partners as if to dismantle or excuse himself from the Rice Queen stereotype.In short, his analysis lacked personalization and evaluation. There was a striking difference between the First Person narrative and Third Person analysis, thereby putting a greater (and artificial) distance between himself and the stereotype. In those few passages where he does acknowledge his own \\"racist behavior\\", he does so in passing. This could have been a whole chapter unto itself. His narrative proved to be more a description of the Rice Queen phenomenon, and not an honest, reflective evaluation of the good, the bad and the ugly of his experience of the phenomenon.My recommendations would be that he not depend on quotes from other writers to express his feelings (there is a certain entitlement that comes from this type of emotional distancing) and that he write an entire book based on the last paragraph of page 241, the one paragraph that contained personal narrative, personal analysis and personal evaluation."},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"very awful. White guy can get any Asian guy anytime is the theme in his book. All I see is a stupid white guy in asian country looking for sex sex sex. then he demonstrates readers a list: which one he slept and where and when. very boring book and EGO-expanding book. Not recommend to read."},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"This is a \\"diary\\" with footnotes. Reflections footnoted are thoughts reformed, scrubbed to perfection before being presented. So \\"The Rice Queen Diaries\\" offers readers an exploration of sexual attraction and self-discovery, but without the accidental honesty, the fragmentary nature of a true, real-time diary, those messy shards of broken glass that refract instead of reflect, offering abstractions that lure the reader (and more importantly the diarist) closer to the truth than any polished mirror. But the desire here is race-based, a topic as challenging as it is intriguing, one rarely reviewed in gay culture, and when it is, often sanitized through academia. So even if caution is the only approach available, this is still a book of participation. The author's erotic explorations are loaded with subconscious colonial ambition; it's hard not to imagine him, pith helmet atilt, typing away about trysts with young Asian men. But that's only a surface reading -this is a determinedly self-conscious sex-tour. If he does indeed wear that hat it's a purposeful dunce cap. Daniel Gawthrop isn't looking forward, toward the next sweaty escapade, in his book, but backwards, seriously seeking out what ignited this delirious dive, sent him tumbling until, submerged in a jungle-like bathhouse world of active stereotypes, his cute \\"houseboy\\" bites the hand that feeds, literally. Nothing ruins a vacation so much as the sight of your own blood.This is a ten-year survey of obsession, from the emerging sexuality of a Vancouver boyhood to full-blown racial cruising in Toronto. As his preference for Asian men takes hold Gawthrop notices that certain automatic boundaries and assumptions apply to relationships between gay Caucasian and gay Asian men. As this psychological arena crystallizes, he has love affairs in and with Thailand; he moves there after his first visit. Though the various sexual sub-and-not-so-sub-cultures of Thailand are relatively well-known, Gawthrop expounds on them with a definitive amount of new insight. Plus his chapter on Vietnam is a marvelous bit of actual reporting -it's unlikely you'll read elsewhere of cruising beneath Communist flags at a swimming pool in Ho Chi Mihn City.Well-turned prose and a breezy attitude toward sex makes this book a quick read, almost too quick; rather matter-of-fact observations deserve closer attention, specifically the fetishistic treatment of his lovers. Too many lithe brown fingers mystically caress, too many rose-petal lips purse throughout that, even if stereotypes are recognized and condemned under the rubric of socio-economic injustice, I can't help but wonder if friendship and love forged with the total recognition of such exploitation might not just be a more canny type of exploitation. Then again, what discussion of race isn't a total minefield? Well this one is a minefield laced with footnotes. And I found them a wee bit defensive, a way to fortify an observation with someone else's authoritative-sounding opinion. Quotes from Asian sources are offered as well, which makes even better mortar. In fact, I think I'll do the same thing. I'd like to amend this review by calling for a second opinion as well. Someone from Thailand, please. Let's hear the voice behind the smile oft described in \\"The Rice Queen Diaries.\\" It might offer praise, condemnation or added insight. Though who knows, we might just hear one long, frustrated scream.Previously published in Books To Watch Out For, '05"},{"Title":"The Rice Queen Diaries","review":"The danger of writing autobiography is that you can reveal a lot more than you realize.

The original title in German is \\"Wie heisst Lutherisch?\\" and should have been translated as \\"What is Lutheranism?\\" Hermann Sasse, a confessional Lutheran, successfully resisted the Nazis and lived to tell the tale emigrating to Australia after the second world war. During the Third Reich Sasse refused, on confessional grounds, to sign the Barmen Declaration and unite with the Reformed in their opposition to Hitler. In this little work one receives a fine outline of core Lutheran beliefs as well as a comparison and critique of the Reformed faith, including a critique of Karl Barth's theology in the final chapter. One of the most salient distinctions between the Lutheran and Reformed faiths is the Lutheran understanding of the Law/Gospel polarity as well as the sacraments as means of salvation (media salutis) and not merely means of grace (media gratiae). Another fundmamental aspect of Lutheranism is its unwillingness to go to where it has not been called. Therefore one does not see Lutherans engaging in religious wars actively in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, nor did Lutherans send missionaries to Roman Catholic countries as did the Reformed. Sasse therefore offers a harsh critique of Calvin for seeking to missionize and protestantize catholic France leading to thirty years of religious wars. Such aggressiveness is alien to the spirit of Lutheranism.Overall one of the finest introductions to Lutheranism."},{"Title":"Here we stand: Nature and character of the Lutheran faith","review":"Sasse was a great churchman, even participating in the early formation of the WCC. He was a profilic historian and exegete, and thus his thinking on church issues is very enlightened and profound.Here he wrestles with why the separation between the Lutherans and Reformed.He boils it down to the differing view of the Incarnation and resultant view of the Lord's Supper. On this he is correct. All others basically revolve around this. The attempts which in many cases have been successful in labeling the Lutherans divisive are unfair, says Sasse. They were the champions of getting to the truth of Scripture.He writes saliently and potently, e.g. \\"Calvin was so much a disciple of Luther that he could not but be influenced by the latter's constant admonition to distinguish well between Law and Gospel. But unfortunately he was not enought of a disciple of what Luther meant.\\"Worthy read for all Christians."},{"Title":"Great tranquillity: Questions and answers","review":"Yehuda Amichai is quite probably one of the last warrior poets.

There are better-quality models now available, but the box still usually contains the 'scope and a few dozen glass slides of blood, insect parts, and such. Rarely are the directions enough to keep a child's interest in microscopy alive for more than a few weeks, at best. This book offers a guided tour of the microscopic world, in the form of 59 &quot;adventures&quot; which range from the kitchen to backyard pond or shoreline. More than instructions on how to capture a fly and examine its feet, the adventure includes a discussion of how the fly can walk on the ceiling. The microscope, then, becomes one gateway to rich discoveries in nature study. If there is a problem with this book, it is its age. This is a reprinted version of the 1941 edition. Many of the supplies recommended &quot;for your laboratory table&quot; are no longer easily available, while some are now considered hazardous. The fly mentioned earlier is to be killed with chloroform, for example. There are safer alternatives available, but the reader will have to do some further research. Nonetheless, it's a stimulating book, charmingly illustrated with many line drawings. The language is at times too difficult for younger readers, but a parent/child team of adventurers will find it useful."},{"Title":"Adventures With a Microscope","review":"While it's true that this book was written a long time ago and many of the chemicals will no longer be sold to children, it still teaches science to children the way it should be. I'd recommend this text over any of the recent efforts that compromise the science for political correctness.Furthermore, the author does not talk down to his audience. Adults reading along and helping their children will be just as engaged and informed. Scientific terminology is used in the book but it's explained very well. Since it's written for the intelligent reader however, it's only explained once.Headstrom's insightful observations are as relevant now as they were when they were written, and this should provide a sound basis for further study and exploration for the inquiring mind. The constant use of puns and the style of writing comes from a time when the world was a different place, however this adds to the charm of the book. 142 line drawings are used throughout.I'd highly recommend this book to adults and children of any age taking their first steps in microscopy. I'd also recommend that adults do not give a child a microscope without a copy of this book.Subjects covered include protozoa, algae, diatoms, desmids, flowers, insects, spiders, common food items, mosses molds and lichens, higher invertebrates, blood, and forensic subjects such as fibers, hair and fingerprints."},{"Title":"Adventures With a Microscope","review":"someone has given you a microscope for your birthday or Christmas or some other gift giving day. You have examined it, gone to the pantry after looking at the prepared slides that came with your gift and taken samples of what is available there, then gone out into the kitchen, maybe the bathroom. taken dust samples from other rooms and looked at all of them. You were impressed with what you saw but in most cases that is all it was, impressed, you did not know what you had seen. Now it is time for Headstrom's book, this is the only place where it earns the five stars I have given it. You need to know where to go to get samples, you need to know how to draw those samples, and you need to know what you are looking at in these samples. Headstrom's book does this for many things.There is a caveat connected with all this. The book is old and even when new it needed an additional book to go along with it. The book is written for amateures and gives the parts of a microscope and lists a number of supplies to go with the microscope. Where does one get these supplies? Some can be procured from the manufacturer of the scope but most can not. Some are obsolete, some are unobtainable and some have been replaced by more modern equivalents. Catalogs from scientific supply houses may supply the answer, thus they they become a necessary adjunct to Headstrom's book. However this does not detract from his purpose, a little bit of taxonomy, a little bit of origins, and a lot of information. One of the big faults in his book is his lack of specifying the magnification necessary to be used when viewing the specimens. Even better would be a digression into the uses of different magnifications and what each is useful for in viewing the specimen. There are a lot of books out there, there may be one with this information. If so, anyone who knows of such, please let me know as well as others seeking this information."},{"Title":"Adventures With a Microscope","review":"This book was already a classic when I first read it in the 1950's.

A little card fell out advertising a book that was a diatribe against things like lay Eucharistic Ministers and holding hands at the Lord's Prayer.But, when I actually began to read the book I found that it was a clear, concise, easy to use book on the order of the mass.I will use this with my adult education classes at church. Very nice."},{"Title":"Missal: The Order of Mass in English","review":"This is the Order of Mass approved for use in the United States by the Holy See. There is no opinion here, no \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal\\"--which are false labels anyway, because you either obey your Church's laws or you don't. After all, both the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2089) and the Code of Canon Law (751) define that \\"Schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\\" As canon law also stipulates, it belongs to the Holy See to establish the liturgical books, \\"therefore, no other person, not even if he is a priest, may on his own add, remove, or change anything in the liturgy\\" (Sacrosanctum concilium 22 3). The Catechism of the Catholic Church repeats the principle that \\"no sacramental rite may be modified or manipulated at the will of the minister or the community\\" (1125). And this, as far as I can find, is the only publication of the official Order of Mass produced with the official approval of the ICEL, the Holy See's deputed agency for liturgical books in English. The new revisions, by the way, will not take effect for several years. Get this while you can."},{"Title":"Missal: The Order of Mass in English","review":"The publication quality is very poor.

This Brit should be chewing the scenery in a third rate production of Hamlet somewhere.

He postulates that the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa was an indirect result of the Crusades, and happened when the Portuguese and others sought to sail around Africa and flank Muslims who were invading Europe.I listened to the audiobook version.

It inspired me to rent it out of the library...Guy Waterman's life is worth studying. He traveled to the beat of his own drum. His life was a series of conflicts about depression, alcoholism, heroicism verses self-preservation. Guy Waterman, an extermely gifted individual faught a successful battle with alcoholism. To defeat this deamon Waterman moved to the mountains and insulated himself with nature.Waterman was not as successful with his battle against depression, however. He refused medical intervention. \\"I would rather be a free man in hell than a prisoner in heaven.\\"Waterman ultimately took his own life by freezing to death on top of a favorite mountain. Waterman was 67 when he committed suicide. The reactions of friends and relatives to he suicide make up a good portion of the book. The author tries to sort out the roots of Waterman's depression and creates parrallels between his death and the tragic Mountaineering deaths of two of his sons.What I didn't care for in this book is all the literary referencing. Much of this was lost to me. Several times I almost stopped reading this book because I was not privy to poetry from Milton's Paradise Lost.I am glad that I perservered, however. This biography gives thought to the idea of choosing the manner of ones death. Waterman choose his own path with the knowledge of his wife and some close friends.

Have even ordered a copy from Amazon. What a wonderful book and for more than a few reasons.The reason I was drawn to the book was because we are much like the subject of the book. Homesteaders and one of us suffers from clinical depression. And the subject of suicide fascinates me because living in such a self proclaiming \\"Christian nation\\" the idea of choosing to actually die goes contrary to all that we have been taught.The book also is excellent because it shows that no matter what the visionaries public persona or how they may come across in their writings, there are often deep secrets that the majority will not or may not want to see. Although I also think (know) that many people who live in the most northern states where winters can be grey and dark, and where summers begin and seem to leave as fast as summers arrive, can suffer more from SAD Seasonal Affective Disorder. But Guy Waterman had other demons like alcohol that he may have stopped using but which had done their dirty dead.But its the whole dying is a personal choice sub-topic that is of great value and if nothing else the way the subject is interwoven so skillfully by author Chip Brown into the psychology and life lived of Guy Waterman makes this a book you cannot put down. And if its not to arrogant or uncivil to say so, I think that dying on ones own terms in ones own chosen and loved environment may be more of a celebration of life lived than some are willing to admit.How often I have heard from childhood that no matter what die doing what you love or in a place you love in ways most people can never understand. A very provacative and thoughtful book worth owning."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"This book is great. I literally could not put it down.

It can happen to anyone!"},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"This is a powerful book. Mr. Brown examines the life of Guy Waterman, a man who became the personification of the Old Man Of The Mountain. Guy was an amzing man who workedin fields ranging from speech writing in Washington, to jazz pianist, to winter caretaker of an AMC hut.There is no hero-worship here. The book examines Guy's dark side as well; his early divorce, chronic depression, the deaths of his two sons, and his eventual suicide."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"I can only hope that Guy Waterman's final freezing hours atop Mt. Lafayette were less painful than trying to get through this book.If there's a good story in here somewhere, it will take a search and rescue party to find it among Mr. Brown's endless rambling and superflous language. Here's an example, lifted randomly from the third chapter: &quot;Although the Farm was only eight miles from downtown New Haven, where Professor Waterman taught physics at Yale, it seemed a world apart, a kind of Connecticut Shangri-la exempt from the privations of the Great Depression and far from the portents of the Second World War, and impossible, really, to separate from the enchantment of childhood itself, part place, part time, part the memory of that theater of spirits where Mother is forever calling you home from the woods with a silver whistle and Father is ushering you to bed with a lullaby on the grand piano.&quot;Despite his impressive credentials, Brown writes like a novice who is more concerned with constructing elaborate sentences and displaying vocabulary than capturing the reader's interest and telling the subject's story. Shame on this book's editor for not hacking it to shreds."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"Chip Brown is an exceptionally gifted writer. His prose is fluid, inventive, full of literary allusion and smart. In Good Morning Midnight he has turned his attention to the planned suicide of Guy Waterman, a famous mountaineer and outdoorsman, who froze himself to death one desperately frigid night in February 2000 atop a mountain in the New Hampshire wilderness. Although the book is biographical in the sense that it explores Waterman's life in toto, the central preoccupation is most definitely the motivational matrix of the choice to die made by a sixty-seven year-old man who was in relatively good health for his age and who enjoyed a rich life well worth continuing with in the eyes of those who knew and loved him. Why does a person make the choice of death? Is it a legitimate choice? What life circumstances eventuate in such a choice? How does the choice affect surviving family and friends? These are the questions Brown relentlessly wrestles with throughout his study. Along with the question of whether medical/psychiatric intervention would have made a difference in the final outcome. As a biography of a unique, multi-talented man Good Morning Midnight held my interest until the last page. I particularly liked Brown's attention to Waterman's two eldest sons who died (killed themselves?) in the Alaskan wilderness both before they were thirty years of age. The chapter devoted to middle son John Waterman, a famous climber in his own right, was absolutely riveting and marked the high point of the book in this reader's opinion. Brown posits that for Guy Waterman it was the loss of two of his three boys, and the remorse he felt about his role in their untimely demise, that ultimately drove him to consider his life not worth living. But there is so much speculation and hand wringing about motivation that after a while it became a chore to follow along with this layer of the text. I especially found Brown's concern with whether or not Waterman was clinically depressed and in need of treatment tiresome. Just because it is possible to 'treat' does not mean that we all must choose to be cured. Not everyone desires the intrusion of medical attention under all circumstances just because it is available. And not every bit of every individual's life need necessarily be understood down to every minute fragment of the psyche's intricate web of meaning and motivation. As Waterman's wife Laura wrote after the death of her husband, \\"Why rend the veil?\\" Amen! The idea that we must all live to the very last possible moment of our lives regardless of the quality of those lives is an overbearing injunction that has led to many of the problems of modern society, not the least of which is the all too pervasive, frequently gruesome hospitalization of death. Waterman led a full life and his death was thematically consonant with the overarching trajectory of that life. Although he made mistakes that came to haunt him in his later years, his choice to die at the moment he was ready to go seems a courageous act that might well be respected on its own terms rather than dissected ad nauseum by those without the fortitude to recognize that we are each and every one of us heading for the same destination and that it is the act of taking responsibility for our final station in life that quintessentially defines who we are and what we are in fact really made of. Whatever his shortcomings, Guy Waterman was made of the stuff of legend. May he rest in peace."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"As a resident of Fairbanks, Alaska, I am familiar with Johnny Waterman's legend. By exploring the lives of Guy Waterman and his family, this book provides a very insightful analysis of the family's history and relationships. The book shows a keen understanding of the psychology of mountaineers and those who love the frontier and outdoors. It examines the connection of life and death, the connection of hope with despair and the internal conflicts of one man that eventually led to his taking his own life.What is special about Mr. Brown's biography of Guy Waterman, is that he refuses to paint a picture of pathology. Instead he describes Mr. Waterman as unique and grand in all his eccentricities and human frailties. Here is a man who is connected to wilderness in a spiritual way yet remains existentially alone and unable to connect with his own children in an enduring way.This book is a page-turner, a psychological and philosophical thriller that had me mesmerized from beginning to end.I found Mr. Brown's grasp of Alaskan wilderness accurate. He knows Denali and the Ruth Glacier in a personal way. He respects the power of wilderness without impressing his ego on it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves memoirs, wilderness and psychological mystery."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"I have long been a fan of Guy Waterman - the sort of man that many admire but few emulate. His wilderness ethic was beyond reproach in an era where few mountaineers could make the same claim. Bits and pieces of his family story have been told in article and essay format by such writers as Jon Waterman and John Krakauer. And of course, we are left with several collections by Guy Waterman himself. To that collection we can add this confused book, which seeks to be part Greek tragedy, part love story, mystery, part cautionary tale. In the end, it is only partially successful and the attempts at clinical psychology come across as particularly muddy and new-agey. The frequent asides early in the book caused me to put it down multiple times. Also, we spend much more time trying to get into Waterman's head than we do getting into his beloved home mountain ranges.The first half of the book attempts to make a mystery out of something completely obvious - why Waterman would take his own life. In the end Guy Waterman was a man who chose to live his values. Rare in the world, to be sure. So it is not at all unusual that he would choose to die by those values, as well. Fortunately, the author backs off from this angle in the second half of the book, the narrative improves dramatically, and the book becomes more difficult to set aside. It becomes a father and sons book, touching and revealing, only occasionally bothered by high-reaching prose."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"After just finishing the book I found myself wanting to write the author and thank him for letting the reader into another world, a very personal one, of a man who had experienced so much in the ways of life, love, and death. The book flows with it's constant references to Guy Waterman's own writings as well as great literary works. I felt a part of the waterman clan ,without intruding, after reading the book. It has been a long time since a book made anything so real with out being too heavy handed. The adventures are amazing, both in the outdoors and with the human emotions. A fantastically orchestrated work; Chip Brown has proved himself as an outdoorsman and writer."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"I had read an article about Guy Waterman some time ago and was anxious to know more about him. So, when I learned of Chip Brown's book, I was eager to read it. At the end, I was frustrated. I wanted to know how Waterman LIVED his life; Brown was intent on focusing entirely on why he chose to DIE. Brown makes clear that Waterman was enormously respected and loved by many people. But he fails to explore his relationships with anyone other than his family. Waterman was the legendary man of the mountains in New Hampshire, but Brown tells us very little of why that was true - other than telling us how many times he climbed all the 4,000'+ peaks and writing some books about them, books he describes only very cursorily.Waterman and his second wife, Laura, chose to live, like Helen and Scott Nearing, a very basic, really primitive lifestyle back in the woods in Vermont, but again Brown describes their lives only minimally.I love mountains and forests. I love hard physical effort (I was a serious, competitive long distance runner for more than 40 years until arthritis stopped me.) Like the Watermans, I hate the materialistic way of life favored by almost all Americans. And, like Guy Waterman, I completely believe that a person should have the choice of when to exit this world, if old age and decreptitude make life not worth living.In short, this should have been a made-to-order book for me. But I became weary of Brown's endless psycho-analyzing of Waterman, and in time I skimmed the psycho-babble, looking for the occasional passages which provided information about how he - and Laura - actually lived.Ironically, Brown failed in the one task he assigned himself - to give a clear explanation for Waterman's suicide. Yes, he couldn't do all he had once done, but he still was very fit, fit enough to climb to the top of that mountain in brutal winter cold to end his life. And he left behind - DESERTED - a woman he seemed clearly to love greatly. Why did so many love such a man?"},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"This very artfully told tale was truly page turner for me. Thick with literary references, Brown's story of Guy Waterman reflects the complexity of a multi-talented individual, appreciated by many, but omniouly least of all by himself.I came away with a very strong feeling that Guy Waterman was truly a unique individual. His successes far outweighed his failures. But his ultimate failure was to recognize that hardmen mature into wisemen. Old Men of the Mountain types, who regale their friends and cohorts with lessons and values of challenging and living amongst the mountains. No matter how far flung the challenge, a mountaineer's ultimate objective is to return from his/her adventure to share the experience; the cold, the hard breathing, the colors, the wind and their intimate feelings of wonder or survival. Regretfully, Guy's inner-self, his demons, contested his own outwardly generous, steadfast and friendly personality.For me, Brown's story reacquainted me with several names and places familiar in mountaineering circles. It also cleard my long held confusion between John Waterman the highly acclaimed, albeit daring alpinist, Guy's son and Jonathan Waterman the prolific author of Alaskan mountaineering.HOWEVER, as an end note the publisher editorial and Author INCORRECTLY stated that Krakauer wrote about John Waterman. The book Into the Wild was the story of Chris McCandless, by J.Krakauer."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"If Chip Brown could have kept himself out of this book for more than two pages (exaggeration), I would be nudging it up one or two stars. He does an excellent job of recounting Waterman's life and death, and the effect of both on the people around him. The description of Waterman's homestead, named Barra, in East Corinth, VT is compelling and when he sticks to the action and details of any event or subject, the pages turn by themselves. What irked me throughout was the constant first person references that broke the spell of Brown's otherwise great storytelling.The first few chapters almost turned me off completely with Brown's constant self-reference and judgemental asides about the nature of Waterman's suicide. This was a story waiting to be shown, not told - to break out a dusty but still fundamental edict. Mr. Brown blows his assignment: \\"When I got up to leave Lou Cornell's farmhouse, I was no clearer about the meaning of Waterman's life and death, but I knew about the hold they had, the story-ness of what happend.\\" Then why not just give us the story?The effect of Brown name-checking himself is jarring right up until the end of the book. Late in the pages he has us wound up and, even though we know how the story turns out, we read the words like they were Waterman's last steps up Old Bridle Path. The last hike of this man's life is unfolding before us. It is great stuff. And then, in the middle of the hike, when another hiker sees Waterman heading up and recoginzes that he has an exceptionally long ice axe for that kind of trek - you can hear the clang: \\"'It was at least a hundred centimeters,' he told me over the phone.\\"What are the words \\"me\\", \\"told\\" and \\"phone\\" doing in that sentence?Mucking it up is what."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"I had found the films 'Into the Wild' and 'Grizzly Man' very interesting; then I stumbled upon this, after reading a piece by Chip Brown in the NY Times.It is fortunate for me that my interest was founded on Mr. Waterman's suicide; the strength of the book is the food for thought that helped me come to my own understanding of it.In his preparations to exit, Mr. Waterman showed, beyond good style, some real consideration to those he left behind. It appears that his early trial and error years put him in a situation that later haunted him owing to the early lonely mountaineering deaths of his two sons and the inescapable sense that there was a failure on his part as a father.If Chris McCandless fell under the spell of 'Call of the Wild', Waterman may have embodied Ivanhoe, at least to his two sons. Instead of jousts, the murderous mountains test and certify heroes.The homestead years were a sort of artwork, really. Work, work, work; all the more redeeming because hard; and still some mountaineering.But if your life is about independence, and feeling respected counts for something, old age can be problematical.Interestingly, it was reported that he took two objects with him on his way to his appointed death, mementos of his sons; they were not found on him after his death. I think he decided to reject what that might symbolize. I suspect he had to admit that his final act merely underlined his philosophy, suggested by the phrase 'better free in hell than serving in heaven'."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"Johnny Waterman is a legend in Fairbanks, Alaska.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in wilderness, memoirs, mountaineering, and psychological mystery."},{"Title":"Good Morning Midnight: Life and Death in the Wild","review":"Chip Brown's biography of Guy Waterman is a depressing read. It is also a fascinating, well written biography. Overall, I agree with the review posted here by Lawrence Hauser, which is excellent. In particular, I concur with Hauser's praise of the chapter on Waterman's son John.What most captivated me about Guy Waterman's story was his refusal to seek help, his belief that somehow his life was uniquely different. He seemed to live with all kinds of denial, including his alcoholism, even though he did manage to stop drinking. His ultimate denial had to do with his reason's for killing himself -- the argument that impending old age would be unbearable. 67 and in perfectly good health? Of course, the only health Waterman had was physical. His deep depression and inability to communicate emotionally with his wife suggest a gravely ill man. But Waterman, an otherwise very intelligent person, refused to seek help. As Brown tells it, Waterman's life was truly tragic."},{"Title":"Whose Kids Are These Anyway?","review":"I couldn't put this book down!

He's never failed to make me laugh out loud so I was really looking forward to reading this book. The first three chapters had me laughing so hard that my wife kept poking her head into my office to make sure that I was still breathing. After that the book falls flat and gets repetitive. I think what did it in for me was all of the holiday stories. There's what, about three Thanksgiving stories, two or three Halloween stories, two Easter stories, you get the idea. Also, every time the author's wife is mentioned she is either planning an event with an attention to detail that borders on neurotic or she's locked in the closet hiding from the children. How many times can you use &quot;why is mommy locked in the closet?&quot; as a punchline before it gets old? Another issue that I had was that the stories didn't seem to follow a consistant timeline. The author seems to swing back and forth between speaking about an infant/toddler to school age children, to teenagers and back. All in all I think that the author is a master of the short-story format. Expanding his thoughts into a full-length book needs some work."},{"Title":"Whose Kids Are These Anyway?","review":"I just received this book the other day.

This book is a must read for anyone with children. I especially enjoyed his first chapter entitled, &quot;My Rookie Year&quot;. My oh my, the memories it brought back. The &quot;Poop-Free-Zone&quot; is hysterically funny. This book is wonderful, and Ken Swarner is a master at telling stories about family, I guess that's why he's called &quot;The Family Man.&quot;Again, this is a MUST READ for all who have children.

The film makers would always dub in some unrelated footage of crocodiles running off the muddy banks and sliding into the dark brown rivers. These shots were used to enhance the movies sense of reality.This book brings those crocodiles and alligators out of the \\"black lagoons\\" and puts them up close and personal to the reader.

But when Peck shows no interest Brant snags an important item from Peck's office who sets his bodyguards, Glock & Spiel, on him.This is an intricately designed, intertwining, action-packed, chase story with absolutely stunning artwork by Andi Watson. You can see how Andi's art has developed and evolved from the mini to the one-shot, but his intelligent storytelling whether writing or illustrating remains.Andi knows what to tell and what to illustrate to move the story along. You have to pay attention when you read an Andi Watson book because he inserts so many subtle clues that if you read it too fast you might not get it; facial features, hand gestures, clues in the background, all move the story along. Slow down and enjoy the show.I forgot how much I liked Geisha and how much was going on in this book until I reread it. The best part about the Complete Geisha is not only do you get the 4-issue mini series, but also the one-shot and short stories in one well designed package.Be sure to read Andi Watson's Dumped, Breakfast After Noon, and Love Fights from Oni Press and Skeleton Key from Slave Labor Graphics!"},{"Title":"The Complete Geisha","review":"I was hoping that the art would be consistent with Andi Watson's chic style found in Breakfast After Noon, but I was disappointed that it was used only in the one-shot. I believe the art would have made all the difference, making Geisha a cozier, enjoyable read. Also, the story's theme seems a bit overplayed already, what with Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep and Aldiss' Supertoys Last All Summer Long.

The Titan hits an iceberg on its starboard side and sinks in the icy North Atlantic during the month of April. I wanted to read this story because it was believed by some that this story would foretell the sinking of the Titanic 14 years later. I found parts of the book to be interesting; but I had a hard time trying to follow all of the events without rereading some of the pages. At one point, I put the book down because it became a little boring at times. Overall, Futility is a good book to read, and no doubt was a good sea adventure in 1898! I cannot really say there is any similarities to the way the &quot;Titan&quot; sank compared to the Titanic disaster. I gave this book 4 stars, because Morgan Robertson spoke of important nautical terms (like the Titan's 19 watertight compartments, triple screw expansion,etc). These were on ocean liners of the late 1800's and early 1900's. Futility is not the best book I have ever read, but I think it was a pretty good one. It is hard not to try to compare the events unfolding in Futility and compare it to the events leading up to the sinking of Titanic; since the two events are similiar. It is a story that any Titanic enthusiast or historian must read!"},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"What &quot;Titanic&quot; buff hasn't heard of the infamous story of the &quot;Titan?&quot; Here, at a very reasonable price, is a chance to actually read the fiticious story which has been unavailable for so long. Unfortunately, once having read the story, most will find it a minor disappointment.&quot;Futility&quot; is not the epic story of a shipwreck. Indeed, the actual wreck and sinking of the &quot;Titan&quot; takes place over the course of only five paragraphs.Rather than a maritime disaster, the title &quot;Futility&quot; refers to the events surrounding the main character, John Rowland, before, on and after the &quot;Titan.&quot; Morgan Robertson (the author) uses the ship and wreck only to establish a circumstance in which Rowland's true character can be contrasted with the hypocracy of Victorian society.&quot;Futility&quot; is a novella, easily readable in about two hours. Robertson's writing is flowery by modern standards but always intelligible. After reading it, most are likely to understand why the book has been out of print for so long: it is not great literature. It is, however, part of the &quot;Titanic&quot; legend and therefor deserves to be on every &quot;Titanic&quot; buff's shelf.My strongest complaint with the 100th Anniversary Edition is the complete absence of editing. Mis-spellings abound and words are obviously omitted. Spell-check doesn't catch syntax errors or word substitutions such as &quot;to&quot; for &quot;two.&quot; We've all come to accept and expect this sloppiness in e-mail and on web-sites, but the printed word deserves closer scrutiny and better acuracy.Do buy the book. Be aware of what it isn't."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"History is clear. April 15, 1912, the White Star luxury liner Titanic, on its much anticipated and publicized maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, collided with an iceberg somewhere in the freezing North Atlantic. Several hours later, the Titanic sank beneath its icy-cold waters. Over 1500 people were killed. In 1898, fourteen years before this horrifying tragedy, an American author by the name Morgan Robertson penned a short novel called Futility, which told the tale of a mammoth British liner doomed to strike an iceberg in the North Atlantic, killing nearly all on board. His ill-fated ship was named the Titan. This, nine years before the Titanic was ever conceived. An odd coincidence, maybe, but one peculiar enough to elicit goosebumps on the flesh of even the greatest skeptics of the paranormal. What is absolutely chilling is that Robertson's Titan was in fact nearly identical, detail for detail, to the true-life Titanic. From the vessels' time of sailing to their top speeds, from their dimensions to the number of passengers aboard, statistical data on both ships are hauntingly alike. Morgan Robertson, who died in 1915, surprisingly never received much acclaim or reputation for his book, and very little else is known about the man who claimed to have been inspired by an \\"astral writing partner\\". It is known, however, that he wrote fourteen novels, all ocean-faring adventures (Robertson himself spent his early life at sea). In addition to Futility, Beyond the Spectrum has also been included in the book you are now holding. It is yet another eerie example of his premonition, a short story alluding to a terrible war between the Japanese and Americans, as well as the use of secret super-radiation weapons. This, some forty-one years before the start of World War II, not to mention almost fifty years before the invention of the atomic bomb. Still odd coincidence?

The book also predicts the inquieries which take place after the sinking."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"I first learned of this book when reading Walter Lord's famous \\"A Night to Remember,\\" which was of course later released as a fine film of the same name, and which Lord updated in the early 1980s with the wonderful follow-up novel, \\"The Night Lives On.\\" At the beginning of \\"A Night to Remember,\\" Lord alludes generously to Robertson's novel \\"Futility,\\" about the fictional ship 'Titan' and its uncanny resemblence to the 'Titanic' both in physical dimensions and tragic sinking. From Lord's brief synopsis of Robertson's novel, I got the impression that \\"Futility\\" would be a comprehensive novel that went to great lengths to describe the ship (Titan), passengers, crew, disaster, and aftermath. I was very surprised when I opened the shipping box and instead received a very skimpy novelette, weighing in at a whole forty pages or so.Although \\"Futility\\" does have eerie similarities with the actual Titanic disaster, which makes it immediately of high historical novelty value, as a stand-alone novel in its own right it is simply not a very well-written piece of fiction. It has some nice ideas that should have been further developed. The cataclysmic sinking of the Titan is contained in about 1/3 a page, and amounts to \\"struck an iceberg, fell flat on her side, the end.\\"Amazingly, the extreme cold of the North Atlantic never seems to be an issue, as it is never mentioned. The story centers around a disgraced former US navy officer who, after his fall, became an ordinary seaman on the Titan. The plot revolves around his love affair (or lack of one) with a former girlfriend. The story is filled with cheesy dialog (even for 1890s Victorian standards) and interminable soliloquies that will have the reader rolling his or her eyes and going \\"whatever.\\"The plot of this story can be summed up thus:- Titan is a huge ship and represents Victorian decadence- Rowlands (the disgraced officer) loves some girl who's married to someone else- Girl mistakenly thinks Rowlands is trying to murder her toddler- Ship hits iceberg- Ship founders two paragraphs later- Rowlands rescues his ex girlfriend's toddler- Rowlands somehow defeats a 2,000 lb polar bear in hand to hand combat- no one gets hypothermia- the end.This story is interesting insofar as its similarity to the Titanic disaster, but beyond that, it is doggerel."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"According to http://www.im.gte.com/titanic/fof.html:English writer Morgan Robertson wrote Futility, an imaginary account of a collision between a largetrans-Atlantic oceanliner and an iceberg on her maiden voyage to New York.

Robertson published his book in 1898--14 yearsbefore the Titanic sank.Robertson later wrote a book, Beyond the Spectrum, that described a future war fought with aircraft that carried&quot;sun bombs&quot;.

The ship was far larger than any that had ever been built. The fictional characters on board were mostly the rich and famous. The ship set off on its first voyage. Halfway across the Atlantic, on a cold night in April, the make-believe ship hit and iceberg and sank. There was great loss of life.Robertson's book, entitled Futility, did not do well. Few people read it. Few people even knew about it.Certainly not the owners of the White Star Shipping Line.Fourteen years after the publication of the book, White Star built what was then the largest ocean liner in the world. In nearly every way, it was almost exactly like the one in Robertson's novel. Both were around 800 feet long and weighed between 60 and 70 thousand tons. Both vessels had triple propellers and could make 24 to 25 knots. Both could carry about 3,000 people, and both had enough lifeboats for only a fraction of this number. But, then, this wasn't supposed to matter; both ships were said to be &quot;unsinkable.&quot;On April 10, 1912, the real ship left England on her first voyage. On board were some of the richest and most famous people in the world. On a cold April night, about halfway across the Atlantic, the ship struck and iceberg. With great loss of life, she sank.The real ship, of course, was the Titanic. As for the name of the imaginary ship, the author called it the Titan.Taken from a book entitled &quot;Amazing True Stories&quot; by Don L. Wolffson"},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"Written in 1898, The Wreck of the Titan (or \\"Futility,\\" as it was originally published) contains some creepy similarities to what happened in April 1912. The Titan is described as the largest ship created, and unsinkable. She has watertight compartments and only enough lifeboats to satisfy the law, but of course they won't be needed because nothing can sink this vessel.The book is very much a product of the Victorian era, from language to scenario. The publisher's foreword and introduction were extremely useful in explaining the discovery and reprinting of this story, and preparing me for the step back in time that I would be taking by reading it. There is an appalling, though not surprising, plot point using a negative Jewish character. There are other things that mark the story as being from 1898, but for all that it's a compelling read, and those who study the Titanic disaster should have this one on their shelves simply for its historic interest."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"this book is interesting especially the first story the wreck of the titan.

In fact, the 70-page story contains a few dozen sentences about the Titan and its wreck; most of the rest is unrelated and hard to understand. The style was very abrupt and choppy where the Titan was respected, and too prolific concerning the hero, John Rowland, by the way, who was altogether too heroic. His feminine love was much too perfect, of enough mention was made of her to be able to tell. The story centers selfishly around its hero, who, stranded on an island after the ship sank, one-handedly kills a polar bear with a jack knife to save the heroine's daughter.

Add one more: &quot;If only they'd paid attention to Morgan Robertson.&quot; The &quot;Wreck of the Titan,&quot; is only one of several short stories in the book, &quot;The Wreck of the Titan.&quot; All of the stories deal with the sea, and through them, you can see that Mr. Roberts was very knowledgeable in all aspects of maritime science. Many of his stories deal with Annapolis, and one might assume that he was a graduate, though I have no way of knowing that for sure. Many of his stories show amazing insights - for example, in &quot;Beyond the Spectrum&quot; he speculates on a Pacific war between the United States and Japan, where submarines and secret weapons play an essential role. However, Robertson's main claim to fame was the title story: &quot;The Wreck of the Titan.&quot; Robertson knew everything about the Titanic disaster, fourteen years in advance. He knew where shipbuilding was going; he knew the length, and displacement of the next generation of ships, the power of their engines, the speeds they could achieve, and all about their &quot;safety&quot; features - including electronic control and communications systems and the approximate number of watertight compartments. He also knew that the ships carried too few lifeboats; that they raced at unsafe speeds through dangerous waters, and that watertight compartments wouldn't save a supposedly &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship if it sideswiped an iceberg. He even knew when and where a disaster was most likely to happen. He had his Titan sink in the month of April, just a few miles north of the actual spot where the Titanic went down. Was he clairvoyant? Probably not. In hindsight, his dire prediction should have been obvious to anyone. He realized that the way ships were being run a disaster was inevitable. On the other hand - what about the name of his mythical ship - the &quot;Titan.&quot; Just a lucky guess, perhaps. However, if that's true, then he guessed right twice. In his story &quot;Pirates&quot; he has a ship much larger than the Titan being torpedoed. Titanic buffs know that the Titanic had two sister ships, and that her younger and larger sister, the Britannic, was torpedoed in World War 1. However, &quot;Britannic&quot; was not the original name when the ship was first designed. White Star originally intended to call her the &quot;Gigantic.&quot; They changed the name after the Titanic disaster because &quot;Gigantic&quot; sounded too much like &quot;Titanic.&quot; So what was the name of Robertson's torpedoed super liner? The &quot;Gigantia.&quot; And one more thing - though I admittedly take this out of context - consider the following passage from &quot;Pirates:&quot; &quot;When he looked, the bow was under water, the stern rising in the air, higher and higher, until a third of the afterbody was exposed; then it slid silently, but for the bursting of air bubbles, out of sight in the depths.&quot; For all his insights, however, it has to be said that Robertson not a great writer. In fact, he was mediocre at best. Perhaps that's why his warnings went unheeded. Other than certain facts that turn out to be amazingly accurate, his plots are nonsensical. Still, the stories are entertaining, and there is a certain charm about all of his writings. This charm cannot be found in the great classics, because they are timeless; it can only be found in the lesser-known works of any era. Through Robertson, an average writer, we can gain rare insights into the mind of the average person of the Victorian era. From the way Robertson writes, it must have been an age of romance and chivalry. A world practically inconceivable by today's standards. Case in point: In Pirates, escapees from a military prison steal a supposedly deserted navy Destroyer. Once out to sea, however, the pirates discover that a single naval officer had been sleeping, unnoticed in the galley as they stole the ship. So what do these cutthroats do with him after they find him? Pitch him overboard, perhaps? Not quite. That would be murder; and just because they're pirates and condemned criminals, that doesn't make them murderers. Instead, they make him promise to behave, and and once he'd given his word of honor, they give him the respect he deserves as an officer, and complete freedom of the ship. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"It is strange that reviewers of this book so often obviously haven't read it. The World War II story as it seems to be, appears to have been written in 1912 though the list of three copyright dates in this four short-story book don't specify what date belongs to what story. There is no preface or introduction. No claims are being made no explanations offered. There are no sun bombs in Beyond the Spectrum, the afor mentioned story; just an amazing description of a lazer the Japanese use to cause a temporary blindness in American navel forces. It's as if the writer had a vision of the blinding light of an attomic blast and a lazer and thought the two were somehow related. He refers to the light emited as a radiation three or four times. A description of a WWII submarine and the persecution of American Japanese is right on. The Titan story is just as suprising, but again reviewers site some parallels that don't exist. The link that brought me here said there would be material from Dr. Ian Stevenson included. There isn't."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"The book is actually a collection of Robertson's short sories, including Futility, The Pirates, Beyond the Spectrum, and In the Valley of the Shadow. I have read both Futility and Spectrum, since these stories have gotten a lot of press lately. Much has been made of Robertson's tales about a great steamer named the Titan and the Titanic. Yes, there are a number coicidences between the two, but the stories diverge in a number of ways.Robertson displays an arrogance amongst the crew and the owners that exceeds even that of the Titanic and White Star Line. Sheer hubris sank the Titan; a blend of hubris and ineptitude sank the Titanic (see Lord, W., The Night Lives On). The Titan sinks almost instanstanously with almost no survivors; its demise differs quite a bit from the Titanic's. The story also spends a lot of time on the attempt to make an insurance claim for the loss from Lloyd's of London and where the liability for the tragedy lies. Finally, there is a subplot about a Titan crew member, his emotional breakdown, his heroism during the disaster, and the near tragic results afterward for him.The story was fairly interesting, the writing rather stilted (which I would expect for a story written a century ago), but it was not a great piece of literature. Like most people, my interest was peaked by the hype; the reality makes the story a bit disappointing, except where there is convergence between fact and fiction, which I must admit, are quite intriguing.The innacuracies in the comments about Spectrum make it even more disappointing than Futility. Yes, there is the Japanese attack on US interests in the Pacific, with the attack on Hawaii a component of that attack, and it's not clear to me that a war actually ensued. There are no airplanes and bombs mentioned in the story, and the weapon that blind combatants is designed to do only that. (The reviews intimate that the weapon is actaully a nuclear device, which it is not). The story focuses on bringing justice to the perpetrators, and the story of that weapon offers an interesting twist regarding its genesis.This story is a short read, only twenty pages, and again, the style is what you would expect from nearly a century ago. But beyond the superficial coincidences between the story and WWII, the hype and the reality are clearly disconnected.My suggestion, find the book in a library before investing twenty plus dollars in it. The stories are more intriguing curiosities rather than great literary pieces, and one should be sure they want to add this to their library before they make the purchase."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"I bought this book because it was referanced in an episode of the tv show \\"One Step Beyond\\".

Written 14 years before the tragic voyge of the Titanic. Spooky, isn't it."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"The Wreck of the Titan is far more interesting as an historical curiosity than it is as a work of literature. (You can ignore the ship on the cover: the Titan in the novel didn't have sails.) Robertson wrote the story before the RMS Titanic was designed, let alone built, and the fact that the Titan shared a lot with it historically (three propellers in a time when that was rare, the length that was only a few feet off, and it struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank) is beside the point. As an historical sidenote, there was a copy of this book in the Titanic's library.The story itself is sentimental with many of the literary elements typical of the Victorian era: the gruff sailor with a heart of gold, the little girl who needs saving, and polar bears lurking behind every iceberg to attack unwary shipwrecked sailors.While the story would probably be more interesting to the historian as a chronological artifact, it's still enjoyable as an adventure of survival in a harsh climate following a disaster."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"Either this guy is psychic, or these stories were not written when they are said to have been. The story of the Titanic already was so amazing, so fantastic that it is easy to imagine that it may just be a story. Everything that happened with that ship was so perfectly fitting for a disaster on its maiden voyage, so good a story, that it actually was in &quot;Futility&quot;. But I ask you, how could so many details be so acurately described, even the name of the ship(Titan)? It is truly amazing. And that is why I, or anyone, has reason to believe that this story possibly was not written 1896, but after the real disaster. Think about it- it is just as logical, even more so, that &quot;Futility&quot; was written afterwards. And I see no way to prove either way, really."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"The book &quot;Futility&quot;, if taken alone, only deserves 1 star.

He mispelled the name of the ship by two letters (Titan rather than Titanic) but everything else he got right: month, number of people on board, lifeboat capacity... the coincidences are astounding.

However, many other books, documentaries, and so-called &quot;historians&quot; (e.g. Charles Pellegrino) have blown it out of porportion. Face it, it's a dry Victorian novel. Yes, I have to agree there are many coincidences -- number of passengers, collison with iceberg in April, the name of the ship. But they are JUST coincidences. Robertson was not only a WELL-KNOWN author in America and Britain, but a seaman who most likely kept up with all the shipping journals. It doesn't take much to predict what a ship might be like in the next 11 years. (construction of Titanic began about 1909)And when do icebergs begin to flow down to the middle latitudes? During the spring, of course, when it's warm. Also, most people never bring up the dissimilarities. For example, the Titan was on her third voyage, not maiden. She was heading toward England. The Titan had a hand full of survivors includin! ! g the captain and first officer versus the real ship, which lost over 1,500 people, including those two men. The people on the Titan experienced a haze or fog. The real people on the Titanic had a beautiful, though moonless night. Even so, only the beginning portion of the book is dedicated to the ship. Don't get me wrong, I do recommend reading the book as sort of a &quot;Titanic curiosity&quot;. However, I do think some people will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"This book has a few similarities to the RMS Titanic, but it is just a short story about a man who was on the Titan. It is not the same book that was written 14 years before the Titanic. If that is what you are looking for DONT buy this book. It does have an interesting twist, but not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"This book would not even be of any value. The book had very little to do with the ship, Titan and the storyline that Morgan Robertson applied to the story was scarcely believable. After so much attention was given to the similarities between the Titan and the Titanic, I was expecting more than what I got.I know little about the author but he did write other pieces that had some degree of prophecy associated -- lasers, as US war with Japan, etc. But he could not develop his thoughts and put them down on writing in an entertaining manner."},{"Title":"Wreck of the Titan (Short Story Index Reprint Series)","review":"It was sad and compelling.

With the publication of this book, one of detective fiction's great characters was born with full fledged power and authenticity. If you have not yet read the Nameless Detective novels by Mr. Pronzini, you have a major treat ahead of you. Many of these are now out-of-print, so be sure to check your library for holdings in near-by cities.The Nameless Detective is referred to that way because Mr. Pronzini never supplies a name until the fifth book in the series, Twospot, although he begins toying with the reader about this point in Blowback, which is the fourth book in the series. I won't reveal that name here.Mr. Pronzini presents a world in which many men take evil actions to further selfish interests, and many women and children suffer because of that selfishness. The police and private investigators suffer along with the victims, for evil-doing has painful consequences for everyone. Mr. Pronzini's plots are complex, yet he provides plenty of clues to help you identify the evil-doer on your own. Despite the transparency of many plots, he successfully uses plot complications to keep the action interesting and fresh.But the reason to read the books is because of the character development for the Nameless Detective. Nameless is a former police officer in San Francisco who collects pulp fiction about tough private detectives. Overcome by the evil he sees as a police officer and drawn to the complex imagery of the strong, silent hero who rights wrongs, Nameless tries to live that role as a private detective. But he has trouble getting clients, and operating as a one-man shop causes him to lead a lonely existence. In his personal life, his career keeps women at a distance. Like a medieval knight errant, he sticks to his vows and pursues doing the right thing . . . even when it doesn't pay. At the same time, he's very aware of art, culture and popular trends. And he doesn't like much of what he sees. At the same time, he's troubled by a hacking cough that cigarettes make worse . . . but doesn't really want to know what causes his phlegm to rise. He's been afraid of doctors since he saw them operating on wounded men during World War II.The books are also written in a more sophisticated version of the pulp fiction style, employing greater style through language and plot. The whole experience is like looking at an image in a series of mirrors that reflect into infinity.These books are a must for those who love the noir style, and the modern fans of tough detectives with a heart of gold like Spenser . . . and can live without the wise cracks and repartee.In Blowback, Nameless has finally gone to see a doctor and found out that he has a lesion on one of his lungs. Within a few days, a test will reveal whether the lesion is malignant or not. Nameless is extremely anxious and depressed at the same time. While waiting to hear, Nameless receives a call from an old friend from the service, Harry Burroughs. Harry's having trouble at his fishing camp, and wants Nameless to help out. Nameless agrees to come . . . but cannot promise for how long.Traveling high into the Sierras into the Gold Rush country, Nameless finds an emotional tinder box. The fishing camp is filled with men, except for the flirtatious Angela Jerrold. Ms. Jerrold has every man in camp dreaming of being with her, which enrages her husband to the limits of his emotional strength. Something's bound to give in such a situation . . . but the precipitating event comes from left field and seems unconnected with the Jerrolds and the camp. But is it?During the course of this novel, Nameless must not only help his old buddy keep his fishing camp, he also must face his demons about whether he wants to live or die.Of the first five novels in the Nameless Detective series, this one is by far the best for creating emotional tension and exploring the psychology of the characters.The mystery isn't too hard to figure out, but the clues are more subtle than usual in a Pronzini book . . . so think carefully about everything you read.I especially enjoyed the commentaries by Nameless about how tourism has spoiled the authenticity of the Gold Rush country towns. Mr. Pronzini certainly has that point right.If you haven't had a medical check-up lately, this might be a good time to get one. Early detection of many diseases can make a big difference in whether you live or die."},{"Title":"Blowback","review":"First Sentence: Sunday Morning Coming Down... That's the title of a sad popular song by Kris Kristofferson, about a man with no wife and no children and nowhere to go and not much to look forward to on a quiet Sunday morning.\\"The Nameless Detective\\" is about to turn 50, and is waiting to learn whether the lesion on his lung is cancer. He receives a call from a old Army buddy who now owns a fishing camp in Northern California Gold country. He is concerned his current group of guests, consisting of five men and one very attractive woman, might lead to violence. Bill doesn't expect becoming involved in another case when he witness a van go off a road only to find the driver, transporting a very valuable Daghastan carpet, has been murdered before the crash and the carpet missing.With Pronzini, you get much more than your standard PI novel.Partly because of his age, \\"Nameless\\" is at the introspective point in life where he thinks about his pulp fiction collection and acknowledges they no longer hold the same pleasure they once did, contemplates the soul, his past relationships, his ethics and morality. This adds a depth and richness to the character I enjoyed. I also appreciated the nod Pronzini gave to his friend Colin Wilcox character, Eberhardt.The book has a very solid sense of place. Pronzini not only provides a visual picture of California's Gold Country, but makes a very insightful comment on what has happened to that area today.A solid plot with a surprise is always the trademark of a Pronzini novel. It never feels contrived and he always provides all the clues, if you pay close attention. I was glad he included a brief history of Daghastan carpets as it better integrated that aspect of the story. There is a pulp fiction, noir feel to the book but contains no graphic language and the violence is after the fact.In spite of this being only the fourth book in the series, Pronzini's mastery is apparent. There are a few mystery authors who should be considered required reading of the genre. Pronzini is definitely one.BLOWBACK (Priv Inv-\\"Nameless\\"-No. Calif/Bay Area-Cont) - VGPronzini, Bill - 4th in seriesRandom House, 1977, US Hardcover"},{"Title":"Blowback","review":"Unlike my friend who wrote the above/below review, I didn't find this book that appealing. It's slow to build to any kind of climax, and spends way too much time musing on his ex-girlfriend Erika. Having finally gone to a doctor, he's been told he has a lesion on his lung but he has to wait a week for the pathology report. During the time of this book he never gets around to calling the doctor for a report so he sweats it out over many pages.The story is the same old hat, a man and his wife and her lover(s). He's obsessed with his business, she's looking for love (in all the wrong places, cue music), he's been drinking too much because of her; she comes on to everything in pants, etc. People get killed for no good reason, she gets what she wants (to get rid of him). In between there's a thing about a stolen oriental rug (so that Pronzini can show off what he found in researching rugs) and another murder, which doesn't add to anything but the length of the story.Our friend is still 'nameless' though his army friend loves to call him \\"buddy\\".

Editor Newby says on the back cover, as well as in the Foreword, that readers can teach themselves Sacco and Vanzetti. He says readers can become experts on this disputed case. Maybe so. The Introduction gives a fair summary of the case. Then the reader's job is to wade through several pages of the Dedham trial transcript. Then comes the various opinions about the case by critics. This includes opinions from 1920 to 2000. Which expert opinion can you believe? The Editor says you have to test each opinion according to the testimony in the transcript. The book also has an annotated bibliography. Trouble is, readers who do not know the S-V case extremely well will not be able to appreciate this tail-end information in the bibliography. Previous to the bibliography the editor has put a number of questions for readers to consider. Quite a number of these questions are in the yes-no category. Was Vanzetti carrying the Berardelli revolver when he was arrested? Or was his .38 H &amp; R. revolver the Mogridge gun? Then there are 52 research topics. Some of these topics seem a bit involved or complicated. One topic is on Vanzetti's first trial at Plymouth.The Editor does not say so, but he seems to imply he does not want to dumb down America. The Editor dares to challenge entries on the Sacco-Vanzetti case in encyclopedias and in reference books on American history. Even a genius may be wrong at times, says Newby, quoting Vincent Ryan Ruggiero. Teachers at junior high level can decide if their students can succeed with some of these 52 topics. The question on Rosen looks like a reasonable topic for beginners. Some topics are easier than others. There is even one on a sonnet by the poet Babette Deutsch, which appeared in The New Republic in 1927. The final topic challenges each reader to create something original from all this mess.The cover of the book is attractive. The book has maps used at the Dedham trial. And it has a useful map on the geography of the Sacco-Vanzetti case. There are also photos of the factory buildings in South Braintree. Another good feature is excerpts from a number of book reviews. The reader therefore gets a fair range of opinions on the case. All in all this book--Kill Now, Talk Forever: Debating Sacco and Vanzetti--looks like a good effort to get at the truth of the Sacco-Vanzetti case. But I got lost in some of the research topics. The connection with the Rosenberg trial was not made clear to me. But it must be said that the Editor ties one or two of his research topics to the website of Douglas Linder--Famous American Trials. Linder has information that helps clarify and give greater perspective to items in Kill Now, Talk Forever. Always good to have an expert lawyer to set things exactly right. Book is stronger by revisions. Page 604, for example, now has two new items. One question is directed to the book of 2001 by Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Jerry Labriola. Another question asks readers to look at the 1998 video: True Story of Sacco and Vanzetti (History Channel). Five principals on this video add a little sizzle to the debate. The five are Robert D'Attilio, Nunzio Pernicone, Richard Polenberg, David E. Kaiser, and David Felix--all featured in the editor's research topics."},{"Title":"Kill Now, Talk Forever: Debating Sacco and Vanzetti","review":"Three fourths of the book are excepts from the trial transcripts. They are cherry picked from the 5,000 pages in the Commonwealth ans Appel volumes, and no explanation is given as to what is included, and what was left out. Since what is included is about 10% of the total, this is a large gap.The last quarter of the book is the author critiquing other authors. There is little of substance here. He includes as a ground breaking discovery a letter about Orciani's effort to manufacture an alibi for Vanzetti's pistol. Without any other background on the strategies and tactics of the defense from 1920-27, this is out of context and meaningless for both new students to the case, and researchers.The book is not a comprehensive transcript. It is also not a history of the case. I am beyond annoyed that I bought this book, it is quite useless.

Abraham and Elizabeth tried to make their fortune in the Wild West which was Ohio then ~~ only to lose everything when an Indian killed Elizabeth. The story then focuses on Jared, who was dumped on his uncle's household and made to feel unwelcomed and unloved.

What I noticed about this, one is that Phillip's character has changed dramatically. To the point where I don't recognize him anymore. The scenes of intimate nature in the previous books in the series were not very detailed which I prefer. In this one, however, he not only goes into detail but most of the encounters he spends pages on are horrible! I have never read so many rape scenes in my life!! (one is too many) one of these victims is only 10, the poor girl. It seems to ramble through the early 1800s with no real point in mind. There are places he will stop at and jump forward in time then flashback to where we just left off. I like to read to end my stressful day and go to sleep.

This third installment passes the perspective from father to son, and boy, is Philip Kent a different man through his son's eyes. Abraham sees him as stern, judgmental and seeking only to fit his son into an idealistic scenario with the Kent and Son printing empire. Philip has done well for himself since the end of the Revolutionary War and the hardship of losing Abraham's mother Anne (and truth be told, this dramatic change in his persona was set up by Jakes with Philip's devastation over Anne's death at the end of the second book). But with his wealth, Abraham argues, Philip seems to have become that which he hated as a young man -- the privileged, sanctimonious upper class.Abraham, so put off by that, feels the call to explore the West, where he heads with his rather-unruly stepsister and now wife, Elizabeth Fletcher, who's also seeking an escape. But the West beats them both to a pulp. And really, all of the characters in this book take a severe beating. (Perhaps you've read the references to rape in the other reviews on this page?!) A reviewer of the second book lamented about the continually terrible events inflicting the characters. I didn't see that so much in \\"The Rebels,\\" but boy did I see it in spades in this third one. Wow. Just one awful catastrophe after another. As the perspective changes again to Abraham's half-brother Gilbert, then to Abraham's son Jared, nothing seems to go right for ANY of these people, throughout the whole book. Trust me, it's ugly, and if you're female like me, the ending is particularly horrifying.Is it a good book, a page-turner? Yes, I was kept riveted, if at times revulsed. Jakes is still a very fine executor of the writing craft. And I intend to stick with him to the end of the eighth book.

Heck, I read the first two and I was satisfied. The characters tend to be a bit two dimensional and the \\"history\\" he integrates is often laughable (how many famous people can someone accidentally run into?) I don't expect perfection though, so not a big deal. In fact, I was riveted by the naval fight aboard the USS Constitution that Jared gets to experience. By far it is the most exciting portion of the novel.But seriously, as others have mentioned: the rape scenes. There are more attempted rape (and successful) in this book than I have ever read. There's one about every 75 pages it feels like, including a ten year old girl, told in graphic detail. I understand Jakes wanting to tell it like it was, but when the rape scenes outnumber all other scenes, you're taking a step in the wrong direction. It gets to be where every male Jakes character is a lecherous drunken moron who has no regard for women. I get that women might have been particularly helpless in the late 1700s and early 1800s, but I got that point two books ago. Seriously I just don't see finding this as \\"entertaining\\" when there are so many of these scenes chucked in for no apparent reason. It's not that I feel they should never be in any book, just that this book seems to revel in including them.I had the intent to read this whole series. I'll move on.

It wraps this message in a variety of incomprehensible disguises. But Govoni doesn't even follow his own advice: in his thoroughly botched description of the Java Collections API, he repeatedly uses concrete implementations (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) to declare collections. You are supposed to use the interfaces (List, Map, etc.) to declare, mentioning the concrete implementation only when the object is constructed, so that your whole program doesn't become dependent on which implementation of a collection you are using. In other words, say:(1) List l = new ArrayList();Not:(2) ArrayList l = new ArrayList();It is extremely appalling that Govoni writes every single Collections example using the approach of (2), not one. He can't even follow his own, repeated-to-the-point-of-idiocy advice.

But this book will make most readers think. Certainly one of the best books I have read, but not an entirely pleasant experience.

I yearn for the print of the next step in his evolution."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"This is definitely a return to 'no M' form after Whit, which I was unable to finish. It is relentlessly bleak and devoid of sympathetic characters. Recent Banks' novels have appeared to be constructed as a series of 'setpieces' with fairly weak linking passages, but this novel flows much more smoothly and inevitably to it's climax. It's not one his best novels, but it is a disturbing work and a worthwhile exercise. A mood piece."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I've read all of Iain Bank's books (without the M.) and this is probably one of the most ultimately bleak and disturbing (on a par perhaps with some aspects of The Bridge and The Wasp Factory).

But the language! It reads as if he has swallowed a grammar and some sort of &quot;how to write a classic in one go&quot; instruction manual. I lost all sense of spontaneity, it was murdered by the complexities of the verbal games he played. NOT his best work, by far."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Here is the perfect example of why some authors should be considerably less prolific than they actually are. A stale, tired and souless post apocalyptic story with absolutely nothing new to offer. Shame Iain Banks, shame. Someone of your calibre really should have known better."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Set in the aftermath of a civil war, where bands of looters lay waste to what little remains of civilisation. A couple flee what was once their ancestral castle, only to be stopped and returned there by a psuedo-military unit. The castle now becomes the focus for a dangerous game played between the female lieutenant and the main character, Abel. You can only be gripped by the twists and turns the story makes, hoping against hope, that there is some escape for the couple (now prisoners), and their people camped on the castle grounds. Ultimately the conquest by the unit of an enemy gun brings a celebration, one which unleases the &quot;madness of war&quot; and utimately triggers a typical dark and savage ending. &quot;Song of Stone&quot; is one of my favourite books and again Iain Banks manages to weave a dark and compelling novel which explores some of the moral questions of the world today."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm normally a fairly big fan of author Banks stuff, both SF and mainstream. So I brought some expectations to this book. Rarely have I been so miserably disappointed. ? Overall this seemed like a dumbed-down version of &quot;Canal Dreams&quot;, a war story by someone who has never been in a war, but thinks it's A Bad Thing, but &quot;Dreams&quot; was vastly the better book. Why? Well, for starters, there is not a single remotely sympathetic character in the book... well, okay, I could live with that. Banks indulges in his usual wholesale torture and slaughter, with characters being dropped down wells and then p***d on, gang-raped and then dangled into a moat to drown, and decapitated by millstones; well, okay, I'm not squeamish. If Banks wants to show us a bleak war scene, where ugly decadence meets uglier barbarism, all right; ugly can be interesting. But what broke me, what made this book an utter chore to read, was that it *wasn't* interesting. One dislikes the characters and so feels no sympathy for the various nasty things that happen to them. Worse yet, Banks writes in the first person, and the protagonist's narrative voice is almost unbearably tedious. I know Banks can write crisp, clever, interesting prose, but in this book he has chosen not to. He seems to have been trying to write a Kafkaesque parable of war and decadence (all geographical and temporal references are quite pointedly omitted; the story could be taking place anywhere in Europe in the present or near future), but the unnecessarily convoluted language destroys any chance of success. Another problem is that Banks seems to have written a war story without bothering to learn about war. In one scene, an artillery piece shells the castle to no great effect; the next day, the soldiers in the castle sortie out to where the shots came from, ambush the artillery crew, and capture the piece. Right... the crew, having fired a few shots to announce their presence (but not enough to do any real! damage), and having no air support or other protection, just sat there for a day? Uh huh. Oh, and there are some minor irritants -- a villain who talks American English while everyone else seems to be speaking English English; flashbacks to the narrator's misspent youth that have no relevance at all to the rest of the book; a female character who almost never talks but is inexplicably the object of much desire... oh, I could go on, but why bother? I can deal with Banks writing an ugly book -- hey, I loved &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; -- but an ugly, boring, and stupid book, no. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I am wary of spending time on any of Ian (M) Banks's recent works. He always tries hard to experiment with new ideas and forms. But for quite some time now, he just hasn't been able to come up with any compelling material. This book covers (yet again) themes that are hallmarks of previous work, including a fascination for war and weapons, incest and the eccenticities of the aristocracy. But he has nothing particularly interesting to say about any of these, and no matter how hard Mr Banks tries to re-deal his cards these days, it is from the same old, dog-eared pack. Here, he also tries too hard to intellectualise his threadbare material, making one wonder at the end 'just what did I read that for'? Perhaps this effort could have made a reasonable short story, but I think Mr Banks must have some hardback contracts to satisfy, and so turned his thin material into his annual hardback output. It certainly shows."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Since publication of the undeniably startling The Wasp Factory in 1984, Iain Banks has been extremely prolific, alternating between Science Fiction and \\"straight\\" fiction. 1997, when A Song of Stone was published, was a \\"straight year\\".What is most remarkable about Banks' record is, for all his volume, the quality and inventiveness of the titles has been almost uniformly excellent: Banks has almost single-handedly set the agenda in Science Fiction in the last twenty years, and his straight works (while never quite reaching the clammy gothic heights of The Wasp Factory) have been consistently inventive.While I'm no sci-fi buff, I think Banks is better in Science Fiction mode, at least two of his culture novels (The Use Of Weapons and Excession) for my money being as good as any other fictional works produced anywhere in the last twenty years.So there are my credentials: I'm one of the party faithful. But even so, I pronounce this effort a total stinker. I guess it was inevitable that the creative engine would begin to get low on gas after 13 straight years of constant acceleration, and I think the long decline began here (in 2001, for the first time, Banks didn't publish a new novel in the autumn).The first thing which truly offends the senses is not the dark obsessional interest with death and degradation - one tends to look forward to that in an Iain Banks novel - but the dismally pompous writing style. It's completely affected - it isn't like he can't write crisply, because he's done that in every other book he's ever written, so clearly it's a deliberate strategy, but what Banks expects to achieve (other than perversely aggravating his customers) is beyond me. But just occasionally you wonder whether you're not the butt of some dreadfully ironic tease: consider this sentence as an object lesson in the pot calling the kettle black:\\"I have seen the choice of morning clothes occupy you almost until lunch, been witness to the search for precisely the correct scent, watched it take an afternoon or more of delicate anointing, slow rubbing and judicious sniffing, observed a simple sonnet absorb you for an evening of frowns and troubled sighs, found you intent and serious, the very picture of unaffected sincerity as you hang on every word of some dreadful bore for what seems half the night...\\"Hmmm, Mister Banks. Are you having a laugh?Banks also relies on some tried and true literary devices, including his favourite, the childhood flashbacks, which (sensibly enough) are the only point where he allows himself out of his over-clever adoption of the present tense. Elsewhere, the symbolism is forced: For aristocracy, Abel has spent a lot of his life, apparently being thrown down muddy wells, drowning in filthy water, sliding down muddy banks and being urinated and vomited on from a great height, and at one stage extricates himself - by way of a muddy birth himself, from under an overturned jeep. The construct is - if you'll excuse the pun - somewhat laboured.Ultimately, getting through this book is rather like wading through mud. The final chapter, a pompous, staring-death-in-the-face soliloquy from the narrator (hence, I suppose, the present tense) is where the mud becomes impassable cod philosophy, and it just goes ON and ON.Once again, you get the feeling the Banks knows exactly what he's doing: viz., having a laugh at the reader's expense: at one stage Abel conjectures, supposedly referring to his own death: \\"Do I want an end too tidy? Or too loose? I do not know, my dears, though an answer will dawn on me soon, no doubt. I think I want my death now. Do I?\\"Well, it's almost pantomime, isn't it. I found myself shrieking YES! END IT NOW! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH! IF YOU CAN'T KILL YOURSELF AT LEAST PUT YOUR READERS OUT OF THEIR MISERY! END THIS AWFUL BOOK!Eventually, without a whimper, without a twist, without the unexpected we've come to expect from Iain Banks, without anything clever, arch or redeeming, the Song of Stone fizzles out.Then I noticed the dedication. Now would you dedicate a book of so heavily saturated in decay, degradation and incest to your PARENTS?"},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"first off, let me say i have read all of iain banks' books and this is different. so dont expect sci-fi &quot;culture&quot; entertainment.that said, this is really a great book, brilliantly written with beautiful poetic language. while banks is always a good technical writer, this novel is by far the most lyrical and poetic in language. it is also somewhat harder to follow than most of his as a consequence, but i liked that it made you think a little. also, some aspects of the story are never stated outright but only implied obliquely through the actions of other characters or implications in the main characters interior monologue. again, perhaps a bit challenging for some, but i liked it and found it consistent with the dark, murky tone of the novel. the characters are so close and personal that it really touches you in a powerful way. it reminds me of &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; (Jim Thompson) in that way.this book is disturbing in many ways, but it is also Real. it is a powerful commentary both on age-old human nature and on recent history. the combination of the close first-person narrative and the disturbing topics can be too much for some, but i found it very stimulating. this is one of the few books i read in the last year that i still think about. the themes and images will be with you for a long time. disturbing and dark yes, but brilliantly written and very powerful."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"While Ian Banks is one of the most interesting writers I've come across in the last few years, unfortunately &quot;A Song of Stone&quot; is one of the least engaging novels I've ever finished. Muted, yet overwrought, this tale of dissolution is less shocking than turgid. The extended and tedious stretches of &quot;purple prose&quot; in this disappointing book, which were apparently consciously intended to embody the self-absorbed and effete mental state of the protagonist and narrator, did little but lose my flagging interest repeatedly. Coyly lurid, and basically quite unsatisfying, this dim variation on an apocalyptic, Road Warrior-ish theme goes nowhere and then dies...Read anything else by Banks before or instead of &quot;A Song of Stone&quot;. Though I do rather enthusiastically recommend Banks as an author, I can't in good conscience give thumbs up to this book."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Iain went too far with this book. If you read this, it's good at first (especially with the Lt.'s introduction killing Half-Caste) but when you keep going it gets horribly one-toned.Too many scenes are ruined by its consistently bleak nature. Abel always seems to be the underdog; the loser. When he gets his moment, he ruins it again and the story gets worse and worse. Way too much angst and way too much extremities simply adds up to a bad novel.It's too bad really, because it makes an excellent first impression. However, it has too many flaws as a novel so overall I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Iain Banks' novels are generally not full of bright happy sunshine and singing children (Consider Phelbas has to be the most depressing SF novel I've ever read) but even in the darkest stories there are islands of humors, snatches of dialogue that make you laugh out loud or absurdist situations that can't fail to bring a chuckle to your face. This novel has none of those things. It's just grimness personified, with the tone set right at the beginning and only going downhill from there. It takes place in some unspecified country at an unspecified time during a war for an unspecified cause. Two young lovers, a lord and lady of a castle, try to escape the country. Not too far out, they are captured by a band of soldiers led by a nameless lieutenant, who makes them go back to the castle. The jacket of the book makes it seem more plot centered than it actually is, from that point the book is nearly episodic in nature, with more examples of war and desolation and human darkness, finally ending really in the only way it can. There is absolutely nothing uplifting in this book, even the narrator (the young lord) is decadent and selfish and self-absorbed, and nobody else makes out much better. But for all the bad stuff going on in here, nothing is truly shocking, especially if you've read his other books . . . there are hints of weird relationships, acts of human brutality that in these days of access to world-wide news should be nothing surprising (the most brutal thing I saw was towards the end and involved a mill, frankly, I thought it was well done, really) . . . fortunately that's not really the point, at least as far as I can tell. What works the best here is Banks' writing, which is more fluid and poetic than of us books so far, rich in description and metaphor, yet it rarely becomes bogged down and wordy. It's a different style than he's used so far and it works brilliantly, giving the novel a dense and almost clastrophobic sense to it. In the end, though I'm not sure what you're left with . . . events escalate and go downhill, bad stuff happens and it all comes to a conclusion that you may or may not agree with. I didn't think it was bad as many others on the board, it was highly readable and once you get used to the dark tone it's really not that big a deal, and the prose is beyond excellent. However it shouldn't be anyone's first Banks book, or you're going to think he's this depressing writer out to shock people. I'm pretty sure there's a deeper message to this book somewhere but at some point it gets lost. So what you're left with is a well written very realistic novel that definitely won't give you a warm and fuzzy feeling when you're done. If you can stomach that (even the violence isn't that graphic) then you shouldn't have any problems. But he's done better, for sure. But you can't hit them all out of the park. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I don't know what to make of this book. In some senses it felt very flat and in others it seemed to have a depth of meaning that I couldn't completely unearth. I also had a hard time getting over the use of second person to refer to Morgan. I can see stylistically how it was used and how it developed Abel's character, but it was a bit jarring."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I didn't mind that this book was ugly. But I really hated that it was ugly, boring, and stupid. There was simply nothing to hold the reader's interest in this slow-moving mishmash of sadism and decadence. The narrator is brain-hurtingly tedious; there's not one single character in the book that is either likeable or interesting, nor is there any interesting speculation or a complex or intriguing plot.Furthermore, if you are a Banks fan, you will find large chunks of this book to be unpleasantly familiar. He has recycled, not just themes, but scenes and dialogue from his earlier works. This would be OK if he had improved on them, but he hasn't. Bits that were clever in _Walking on Glass_ or _Canal Dreams_ are just boring in this.I like Banks, and I'll read his next book, but I really hope this one was an aberration and not the shape of what we should now expect from him. And, oh yeah, I found the vaguely American villain pretty irritating, too.Skip this one unless you are an absolute Banks fanatic."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"This novel, set in a bleak, post-war future, is an example of Banks at his darkest, most violent, and most self-indulgent. Quite different from the tongue-in-cheek Gothic nature of his first novel, The Wasp Factory, or the cheerfully introspective and essentially Scottish novels The Crow Road and Espedair Street, this book is full of stomach-turning violence as the protagonist is pushed to desperation by a group of mercenaries. Banks fans will recognize much of the tone and content as being similar to his two other most violent novels, Canal Dreams and Complicity. And in keeping with some of his other works, there are undertones of incest as well.What few redeeming features this novel has are largely to be found in the internal monologues of the narrator. However, even these become long-winded, to the point that the end of the book seems to fade into the distance, rather than approaching at a satisfying speed.This book is a tremendous disappointment from a talented storyteller. While captivating in some of its plot developments, ultimately the unsatisfying conclusion and truly horrible violence throughout condemn this one to the remainder bin. Not recommended."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Iain Banks first novel, \\"The Wasp Factory\\", was published in 1984. In the years since, he's won critical acclaim, topped best-seller lists and has even written Science Fiction books under the cunning nom-de-plume 'Iain M. Banks'. He's also seen this book, \\"The Crow Road\\", adapted for television by the BBC in 1996. \\"A Song of Stone\\" was first published in 1997.The book is set in the aftermath of what appears to have been a long and devastating war - though at no point is any indication of its causes, or even who was fighting. While the war itself may even be over - it's hard to tell, with no real communication between different parts of the country - it's left anarchy behind : food and fuel are scarce, while there are regular skirmishes between a number of roaming factions. The story is told by Abel, an aristocrat with a title - albeit, apparently, a minor one. As the book opens, he and his beloved Morgan are abandoning their castle - hoping to avoid the sort of people it would probably attract. Unfortunately, they are captured early in their journey by a band of partisans who - as Abel feared - viewed the couple's home as an excellent base of operations. Abel and Morgan are taken back to their home - now, as trapped by the castle's walls as they are protected by it.The book is told entirely from Abel's point of view - \\"I wonder at the lieutenant and the history of her men\\". Gradually, hints of his former life are given, much of it involving the development of his relationship with Morgan. Little, on the other hand, is told of the lieutenant or her men - even their real names are withheld. The language and style used is very descriptive at times, lyrical and nearly pretentious in places. For all his attempts to romanticise his thoughts, his feelings and his past, however, I found Abel to be an increasingly dislikeable character : for a member of the nobility, there was very little noble about him. In fact, as the book went on, I wasn't even convinced Morgan felt any real warmth towards him. For someone who hasn't read anything by Banks, I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a starting point - \\"Whit\\" and \\"The Crow Road\\" would possibly be a better introduction. However, \\"A Song of Stone\\" is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"It seems to be generally agreed upon that this is not one of Iain Banks' finest works. In Song of Stone, Banks has plucked some successful elements from previous works and placed them in a new novel. It's not, however, a retread of ideas but some of the imagery might be familiar to Banks fans. Normally, Banks could make something like this work, however the story that he developed in A Song of Stone is not all that gripping.That being said, this is still a piece of Banks' fiction. I don't blindly praise favorite authors' works but there is something inherent in Banks' fiction that exists here as well. Banks is wonderful at making the reader uncomfortable. If for nothing else, this book is a perfect example of Banks' darkness and the quiet horror he can cause readers - something he has in common with J.G. Ballard.My advice - read all the Banks stuff you can get your hands on. Some are better than others but all are worth a read."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Although the use of language is most eloquent, the story doesn't go anywhwere. What story there might be is interrupted by chapters about the main character's sex life, which couldn't possibly be more out of context. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I stuck to the end, even on the last chapter hoping there would be some redemption. But there wasn't. Not only that but it is a very dark and depressing story, to which I failed to see any point.Loved The Wasp Factory, The Bridge, Complicity. Hated this one and Whit."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"A Song of Stone is brutally dark. The writing is beautiful and poetic. The subject matter is horrific. The story takes place during a no name war in a no name country and is told from the view of Abel as a first person narrative.Abel and his lover Morgan are nobles. They attempt to abandon their castle and flee to safety disguised as refugees when they are captured and taken back to their castle by a lieutenant and her band of soldiers. This is where the cat and mouse game begins. The story contains graphic violence, sex, incest, rape and human cruelty at it's worse.The further I got into the story the more it seemed to have a hold on me. The closer I got to the end the more I felt a need to finish it. By the time I got to the last chapter I wanted it to not end I no longer wanted to know, but still I had a need to know.When I finished reading A Song of Stone it felt as if my psyche was savagely beaten and bruised, it may take weeks for my mental health and well being to recover, if ever.When I closed the book I immediately wanted to read something else but I'm not sure if it's to dilute the feeling A Song of Stone left me with or if it's because the writing was so good (and deep) that it ignited something in me that makes me want to read and read and read.I would recommend to ADULTS ONLY that have read the reviews and are still interested. Not recommended as a first Iain (M.) Banks read."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"This book was the worst thing I have read in a long time, not because it is terribly written but because it is so horribly boring and pretentious. Banks is trying to be literary to a fault. The narrator is sort of like Jean Jacques Rousseau, and at one point--where he couldn't remember his since-childhood butler's name--I found myself liking him. But the narrator never offered anything more. And what was the point of there being a breakdown of human civilization when the book simply seems situated in a simple, civil war? The civilians aren't tearing each other to pieces. The only bad guys in the book are soldiers. Thanks to a generator, the castle still has light up until the end of the book; there is simply nothing in this book that feels like total entropy. The soldiers are abusive, yeah, but most people expect an army to be abusive in times of war, especially when they are trying to fight one while mixed with the populace...ugh. And the philosophy behind this book is terrible, and as another review it, pretentious rubbish.The book makes no point about anything, and the writing is the most tautological, bombastic, garrulous, circumlocutory, and pedantic thing I've read in a while."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Doomed by turgid and overwrought prose, this story dies unborn. Banks seems more intrigued by his ability to present the reader with both decadent and debauched imagery than with a functional storyline, or characters that assume any more qualities than cardboard cutouts. Overall, this book comes off as being unfortunately amateurish; Banks is more enamoured with utilising his vast vocabulary than with writing a story."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I don't review many books here but the thought that a little effort on my part would save someone else from having to read this awful book made up my mind to do so.I loved the author's \\"Consider Phoebus\\", and decided to buy some more of his work. If I had read \\"A Song of Stone\\" first, I would have avoided him like the plague.If you like first-person narratives from whiney, incompetent protagonists who spent half their time spouting trite, sophomoric philosophy, then you may just enjoy this book.

Society has collapsed, and technologies exist until machines break. Weapons and fuel are the valued commodities, not gold and fine clothes.Abel and Morgan lived a life of luxury in their family castle, surrounded by riches and servants. Self-indulgence ruled their life... until society collapsed.Eventually, they decided to leave the castle and join the long line of refugees. However, a horse-drawn carriage does not camouflage their status, and a paramilitary outfit takes control of their lives and returns them to the castle, where the soldiers, under the control of the lieutenant (\\"You can call me lieutenant\\"), settle in and battle neighboring military units and trade places with the original inhabitants.Iain Banks doesn't look for the creme rising to the top when humans are tested. Instead, he emphasizes the animals we are. Every act, every behavior, has meaning. \\"I take in the view while expelling my own waste , as, going on a slow curve out, my personal contribution to the moat floats free, golden in the new-day's haze and splashing, foaming on the dark waters below, each sunstruck, brassily delineated droplet a shining stitch within a rope of gold; a glowing sine like a metaphor for light\\" (p. 76).There are no heros... we reap what we sow, Banks would say. Unproductive lives lead to unproductive deaths.Eventually, Banks makes his position clear through the voice of Able:\\"It is my estimation that, unless one's involvement is peripheral, nobody survives a war; the people who come out the other side are not those who went in. Oh, I know, we all change, every day, and each morning emerge from our cocoon of sleep a different person, to confront an unutterably alien face, and any illness, and all shocks, age and change us by their given degrees... yet when the illness is past or the shock faded, we rejoin, more or less, the same society that we left, and recalibrate our selves by it. Such triangulating solace is denied us when that community itself has changed as much as or more than we have ourselves, and we must remake our own beings as well as the fabric of that shared world\\" (p. 273).Peeing in the moat will not be the same for Able. There is no re-calibration for him, nor for Morgan, and not for the lieutenant.The reason for society's collapse is not important. It just happens, and what is left are a million stories of survival and adaptation. This is one of those stories. Unproductive lives...I read the U.K. Abacus 1998 edition, so it may differ somewhat from the US edition."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"To all Banks fans, be warned.This is not a &quot;normal&quot; Ian Banks or Ian M. Banks book. This is a mix of Kafka, Gombrowitch, non-heroic-sinister-second-world-war movies and some of the excesses in the war in the former Yugoslavia, all stirred in a black cauldron. The result is a mix that shook me, but the book is not without positive merits. I did finish it and I was eager to finish it (but not looking forward to reading it), and I liked it in some ways.I would not have given it to my uncle who managed to survived the concentration camps, and not to someone who was depressed. I am not even sure I will ever recommend it to a friend ever. It had to be someone who needed to learn to see that there exist bad alternatives in this world. Maybe someone who needs to be reminded that life under certain conditions in a certain historic setting can be like this. Bleak, another reviewer correctly named it.I recently heard Banks speak at a book festival and he told us that some time ago the Inland Revenue Service had taken an interest in him and his finances. I sort of hope that this was his inspiration to write this book, and that the fact that the IRS discovered that he had paid to much tax (!) and that he would get the surplus back, will be his inspiration for future books, where he would use some of the great humour he has;)I have in my life meet people who reminded me of the main characters, and they scared me. Some of them also obviously scared themselves, but the most scary ones was those who were (probably) not scared by anything, and least by themselves.In this way Banks has written an important book which cannot fail to make an impression. Where the main characters in this book belong, you will have to decide for yourself. If you enjoy Kafka, this may be something for you. If not?"},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"It seems that with every novel Mr.Banks produces, his stories become less and less acessible. A large, large part of &quot;A Song of Stone&quot; is left up to interpretation. This is not at all a bad thing, but it does mean that you'll want to read the book with someone, preferably aloud, so that the two of you can argue out the exact relationship of the main characters, debate the meaningfullness (or lack thereof) of their names, decide where exactly the story is set and then try to agree on the importance of some symbols and the intentional lack of meaning inherent in others.The story itself is terribly self-absorbed and very much, in this manner, unlike anything else of Banks' that I've read. The narrator is a relic of old money and landed gentry slowly being divested of his belongings, home, history and happily snug little world. As it all shreds away, he becomes quite the dislikable character wallowing in his self-pity, pain and disenchantment, but his deconstruction is instructive. Banks demonstrates that nobly sallying forth with a stiff upper lip and the mantle of your history wrapped about your shoulders just doesn't work anymore. This point more than anything else is what defines the book as bleak. The violence, death and incest occur with the same languid remove and jaded inevitability as if the events were unfolding on TV. None of it is particularly horrifying, and that's the most horrifying aspect. Not many stories have morals anymore, and this one certainly doesn't. In fact, I was rooting for the deaths of certain characters by the end, and I do believe that this was the point Mr. Banks was trying to make."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Interesting novel. It has distinct style which could be viewed as either eloquent or wordy. Although metaphors and allusions were intriguing at first, they grew tiresome towards the end."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"As always, Banks is brilliant with words and spins a yarn that gets you tangled quickly and permanently. I could not quite understand what the message is supposed to be if there is one but this might be due to my not being British. This is not his best by far, but you will not be disappointed, whether you have read anything else by him or not."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I love Iain Banks' works. However, this time he may have gone too far on the level of depression and depravity the book reaches?Or maybe that is indeed what makes this book another great one from this author - he shows us the horrors of an &quot;ex-Yugoslavian-type&quot; warzone without filters.Read this book, but don't expect to be in a happy mood afterwards!"},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"As a long-time fan of Iain Banks' novels (particularly The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road, and Espedair Street), I was left with mixed feelings about A Song of Stone. While it is very well written, and was an easy and quick read, it ultimately seemed, to me, to have little real point. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn\`t find this book all that shocking or gruesome but sort of by the numbers in its hinting at the horribleness of his postapocalyptic future. I never really felt the horror that I think he wanted us to feel. Ultimately, I was left with a feeling about the banality of Banks' vision. Still, the totally self-absorbed and cynical narrator was, for the most part, a successful creation--the best part of the novel.A Song of Stone is worth reading, but ultimately seemed to have a void at is centre."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Banks is Scottish not English, as one of the above reviews states. Only read this book if you've read every other Banks novel and are can't do without his books."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"As well-written as ever -- and a stark contrast with the relative lightheartedness of Banks' latest SF volume, &quot;Inversions&quot;. I've had it ever since it came out in the UK, and I haven't been able to bring myself to reread it. &quot;Walking on Glass&quot; was more disturbing -- I couldn't finish it -- but only by a hair, and &quot;Song of Stone&quot; has none of the absurdist, existentialist interludes that made me *want* to finish &quot;Walking on Glass.&quot; &quot;Song of Stone&quot; uses blood, sex, and cruelty to paint a complete picture of despair -- a world where the future extends only as far as the next meal, the world only as far as the horizon, and the past as far as your oldest bad memory.If you can read about atrocities without taking them personally, you should read &quot;Song of Stone.&quot; It's brilliantly written and extremely powerful. But if you have a weak stomach, like this reviewer, go with something more upbeat, like &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; or &quot;The Wasp Factory&lt;&quot;."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"As a great fan of this author, this was the single most disappointing piece of work of his that I've ever read.While the actual writing is near flawless as per usual, the book descends into sheer self indulgence as Banks loses his direction several times and then trys to rescue the focus with some pointlessly horrific scenes.The atmosphere is dark and brooding, and Banks' usual style has the successful effect of leaving you slighly stunned - but at the end of this book you feel as if you were invited to a great gothic horror party only to find that all the people there are desperately uninteresting."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"This book explores the worst of human behavior. It is very believable and I really think these types of things have happened before. It's about refugees trying to escape a war that is encroaching upon the countryside. It happens that they run up on a military unit that takes charge. What follows is what humans do.The book is very grim and explores the dark side of human nature. I found it to be a powerful experience."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I'm a Banks Fan. I've read most everything he's ever published -- but many many people warned me about this book, saying it was no good.I recieved it as a birthday present yesterday, and read it in a few hours, which should give some indication of how quick a read it is. Whilst reading it I felt starved for information and yet inundated with trivia; Banks certainly uses a lot more words than the average author, and his flowery verbiage waffled on in many places, in many instances without getting across a definitive point of view.The story is brutal from the start, and goes downhill, with no light at the end of the tunnel, no hinted at salvation down the road (so to speak).As a fan, I find it difficult to say '1 star, Mr Banks', but I have to; this story had quite a few scenes from some of his other books, reworked whilst not being made 'new'. Bank's ability to shock is definitely there, if you liked the casual violence of The Wasp Factory, then this book might appeal.Having finished the book, I set out to see what other reviewers had said, most of them covered the bases. It is a harsh tale, with no softened blows, very little redemption, and ultimately as pointless as the unexplained background war."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I haven't read any of Iain Banks' novels before I picked up &quot;A Song of Stone&quot; so I can't honestly say if it is his usual standard or if it's better or worse than his other works. Reading some of the other reviews on here, however, I do agree that he has a gift of making people feel uncomfortable. Abel's reflections on violence and incest was troubling to say the least. I thought the story slow-moving and felt like I was going around in the same circle the whole time, but perhaps that was Banks' intention to create a dismal atmosphere where one's trapped, and there's no escape except through death (for us, thankfully, the completion of the novel would suffice!) The underlying sexual tension with the female lieutenant was interestingly dealt with, however, and that was probably the only part of the novel where there was visible progress. I should need to read more of Banks' work to decide if I like him or not....if I have the desire to sink into depression again....."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I nearly gave up on this book six months ago. It was a tough read, and it took me a month of stops and starts to finish. Most of Banks' works are such a delight; this one is not. The story does not move well and the trappings of sex and violence are seemingly gratuitous. The writing is -- as usual for Banks -- nearly flawless and beyond reproach, but the ending is... well, not terribly satisfying. Now it is six months later, and I cannot forget the imagery. The work makes for a powerful commentary on human weakness. By weakness, I mean not our frailties, but our failings. Each of the book's characters is flawed, but I suspect that they are more real that way. I find myself just a bit changed from reading the book, and that is quite to the credit of Banks in my eyes. I think he aimed for a difficult and diffuse target with _Song of Stone_; maybe he missed by a bit, but the result was a book worth my time."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"--------------------------------------I'll make no attempt to avoid SPOILERS in the following.In a future, post-apocalyptic Britain, wrecked by gang-wars, a band of irregulars led by a female Lieutenant hole up in an old castle. They make the Lord and his mistress into half-prisoners, half-pets. The Lord has endless, pointless, boring, amazingly windy memories/internal monologues of what went before. He (strict first person) addresses the memoir to Her, in second person, which works about as well as this usually does, which is to say, a weak, poor and distracting device. Did I mention the brutal, pointless killings, there to demonstrate that post-apocalyptic Gangwar is Hell?The Loot and her soldiers slaughter a rival gang, and take their Big Gun. This is symbolic. The soldiers have a big victory party, get drunk, rape the girls, wreck the Lord's castle, and humiliate him. The Loot has sex with Her Mistresship, a mute, milquetoast boring cardboard 'person'. The Loot shoots the Lord, but he gets away, and (sort of) kills her. Her troops tie him to the Big Gun: in the Lord's words, &quot;For I too am tied, in Mezentian hyperbole, a puppet of [sic] before the cannon's mouth.&quot; You know, a little Mezentian hyperbole goes a long, long way, but it's here by the hundredweight, page after page after page... &quot;It is my estimation that, unless one's involvement is peripheral, nobody survives a war; the people who come out the other side are not those who went in.&quot; Good God.It's hard to believe this sad, purple, preachy, windy book book was written by our beloved, Orbital-smashing, Drone-riding Iain M. Banks -- but I've had pretty poor luck with his non-SF novels. There was a violently-nihilistic spy thriller (Complicity??) that I liked pretty well, but I found The Bridge dull and tendentious, and now this... So I guess I'll stick to the Star Smashers of Special Circumstances, thank you very much, and leave the literary stuff to, well, the literariate?If you'd like a *good* book about post-apocalyptic Britain with castles and gang-wars (kinda), I recommend Edward P.

After I read it I left it with them rather than bother keeping it for future reading - make up your own mind on my enjoyment of the book.The prose was convoluted to the point where you often had to reread passages several times to get the meaning. This is something I expect to need to do if I am reading a book on Calculus, not if I am reading for entertainment.I really didn't care whether the main character, Abel lived or died. This is probably because of his total incompetence in trying to rescue his wife, when he did fortuitously break free of his captors. I found the whole writing style tedious and pretentious.The positives would be the character Loot, who I found the most interesting in the novel, due to her swings from benevolance to total malevolance; and the author's general characterization of war as pointless and anarchaic.My disappointment was such that I may not bother with this author again - however it would appear that the general opinion of the reviews are that this is a rare mistep and that novels like the Wasp Factory may have been a shrewder choice for me."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"A SONG OF STONE (my introduction to the esteemed Iain Banks) presented me with a dilemma, and I'm not quite sure how to describe my thoughts concerning this novel. I liked the narrative voice, I enjoyed the writing style, and I was occasionally intrigued by the characters. But I'm not sure I liked the book. It has some fascinating pieces, yet it also contains portions that I would describe as pure dreck. It contains some shocking pieces of violence and the cruelty of humanity, but they aren't directed in any specific way. The blood and the gore just ends up feeling gratuitous rather than purposeful, and after a while I just could make myself care about it.The book is mostly based upon its setting and two main characters. The setting is an unspecific country (it feels vaguely European) ripped apart by a war, the exact cause of which is irrelevant to the story. The first character of note is the narrator, and the second is a female solider. Both almost reach the point where they feel like real people, yet somehow manage to remain cartoonish. The book relies very heavily upon the strength of its characters, but they aren't quite tough enough to carry the load. They make a lot of speeches and, while some have genuine insight, they just tend to ramble on about life, the universe and everything. When Banks has something to say, the soliloquies work. But when the speeches are there merely there to give the characters something to do, the results can be utterly uninteresting.The plot is rambling. It goes off in several directions, and doesn't really seem to have a coherent structure. People do things because the author makes them do things, but I couldn't quite grasp what anyone's motivation was. The story is basically just a load of small set pieces bound together by the characters' experiences on the fringes of the war. There's nothing inherently wrong with any of them, but there are just too many places where the sledgehammer of the metaphors just become too painful and unappealing. Ultimately, the book seems to think that it is far cleverer than it actually is.And yet, there are hints of a fabulous book lurking beneath the oppressive and incoherent surface. The hell that every person is going through is well realized -- from the physical drain that accompanies the conflict to the mental and emotional scarring that it inflicts. The inability to escape is a theme that keeps being brought home, and for the most part it is effective. Had the rest of the book been as successful as these sections, I think I would have loved this book (and indeed I found myself thinking very positive thoughts towards it at the very beginning). Unfortunately, the quality is not sustained throughout.I doubt I'll ever be bothered to read A SONG OF STONE again, yet I cannot say that I completely hated the experience of reading it once. It's certainly unpleasant, but that's mostly a deliberate choice. Still, by the end of the story, I just couldn't find myself caring about the characters or what happened to them. Sometimes the imagery and metaphors are inspired; other times they are just banal. It feels as though it was written on autopilot -- as though a good author just couldn't get around to putting his full effort into this one. Given Banks' impressive reputation, I suspect that he has written better books. And although this one left a faintly bad taste in my mouth, I think I will end up giving Mr. Banks another try."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I am an avid reader of books containing challenging ideas, and after five reads over a year I am still digesting \\"A Song of Stone\\".This book communicates the horror of the human experience better then anything I've read since \\"The Heart of Darkness\\". Banks uses a morbid and brooding tone similar to that of \\"The Wasp Factory\\" but does so with more maturity and greater lyrical precision. \\"A Song of Stone\\" is not for those readers who seek recreational escapism or morally clean and simple tales. Bank's ability to make the horrid both lovely and beautiful is his greatest strength as a writer and is probably the cause of negative reviews seen here. To enjoy this book requires you to be psychology prepared to enter a dark and occasionally monstrous world, and to allow some of your most taboo impulses to surface into conscience thought.I consider it to be a hell of a good time- definitely a book to own rather then borrow. \\"A Song of Stone\\" along with \\"The Bridge\\" is Banks at his best. Due to it's content, most people do not consider this \\"appropriate\\" reading - I feel that is exactly the reason it should be read."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"Of all the Iain Banks novels I've read (and that's all but 3), this is my least favorite. In fact, I didn't enjoy it at all. The main character is not particularly likeable, drives you nuts with his inability to act, and remains the most likeable person in the novel. The ending is unpleasant, to say the least.In spite of the &quot;M.&quot; in the author's name, this is not a work of science fiction or The Culture (he writes under two names, with and without the M, to distinguish between his science and mainstream fiction). The novel takes place somewhere more like war-torn Bosnia.Of all his books, this is the only one I'll get rid of, because I will *never* read it again. Pick up The Crow Road instead, a much better read."},{"Title":"A SONG OF STONE: A Novel","review":"I disagree with the prevailing sentiment toward this story. I found A Song of Stone to be very insightful, and quite unique from other post-apocalyptic/disaster novels of its ilk. Banks' mesmerizing prose is to be expected and is delivered with the same potency that made \\"The Wasp Factory\\" such a success, but where I imagine most readers lost their taste for the story was the choice of the \\"protagonist\\" more so than the abject misery that is portrayed at every turn of the page. Though I agree that the story is unremittingly dark it is not so without purpose. It deals with war and its brutality so why must it conform to our simplification of the good guys vs. the bad guys? If it was just a thematic matter, consider that Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" is highly praised, but deals with very similar themes of gloom and depravity. This is why I think that the foremost problem is the choice of viewpoint characters: in one case the devoted parent and in this case the self-centered apathetic noble . Abel and Morgan are hardly the typical sweethearts who are victimized by the savage course of events. The flashbacks that Abel has throughout the novel tell a sordid tale of their own. Abel's thoughts and sentiments are egocentric and his character is rotten to the core, but when compared to his brutal and senseless captors or his insipid companion, Abel is the best option, however bleak that may seem. In all fairness to Abel, he is a product of his environment and his upbringing, and if you have the patience to read between the hedonistic and depraved innuendos, there is a treasure of philosophical takes on war and life in general. As Abel himself admits \\"Romance, or our belief in it, is our genuine undoing.\\" If your main character admits such a fact, why would you expect a rosy ending to this story. Even better, consider the people who inhabit this nameless land, and ponder if their actions and ultimately their fates are not of their own doing.So why 4 stars, well in my opinion, A Song of Stone does suffers from one flaw: vagueness. However, if Banks had placed the story in the Balkans or any other conflict-rich region of the world and allowed for a historical foundation and for a broader perspective of narrative, rather than making Abel our only eyes and ears, then the story would not be so monotonous and the senselessness of the violence may have been easier to bear and thus the novel easier to enjoy. Even so, definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Lorenzo in Taos","review":"A riveting psychodrama.

Here, Reich moves into the area of bioenergy and body-based psychotherapy. He presages some modern developments in psychotherapy, and in many respects, moves ahead of where mainstream therapy resides today. His bioenergy/therapy integration was also a forerunner of much of today's alternative mind-body and energy medicine modalities. Reich was not always the most trenchant writer, but here is writing his sharp, direct, and provocative. This is Reich's great contribution, still largely neglected."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"This important work is sometimes heralded as a landmark in psychoanalytic literature, as Reich changed aspects of analytic technique, focusing on character structure and not just the contents of free association, dreams, memories, etc. But any analyst or psychologist familiar with this work will usually say, but he went mad in the middle, and the last third of the book is nonsense. In fact, the last third--when he focuses on new forms of body-based treatment and theories regarding bioenergy, is even more brilliant. Take a gander at this section and you may recognize a mind way ahead of his times; Reich precedes and surpasses modern day notions of biological energy medicine, body-based psychotherapy, and emotional expression in healing. While his writing is usually uneven, here it is quite sharp, clear, and consistent throughout. We still have a lot to learn from Reich."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"The first 300 pages of this book represent Reich's major contribution to Freudian psychotherapy. Reich argues for a new practice of \\"Character Analysis\\" that takes the whole personality under examination, superceding the old therapy that focused narrowly on alleviating painful 'symptoms'.Our characters, Reich points out, are not created by chance or heredity, but represent the habitual strategies by which our egos come to cope with external threats, secure pleasure and sustenance, and regulate the flow of sexual energy. They are most definitively shaped by our interactions with our parents in the first few years of life and sexual development. Moreover, Reich argues, our characters are created and recreated in service of systems of social and class domination; thus sexual psychology and class struggle are inextricable.Chalquist's glib distortion of Reich's project in the comment below is typical of the attacks Reich's work was subject to in the vicious campaigns to to quash his influence by Nazis, the Psychoanalytic establishment, and the Authoritarian left alike. Nowhere does Reich suggest that simply having more sex is the solution to social problems. Rather, he asserts that widespread healthy sex-life is both a necessary condition and an inevitable result of successful class struggle and social emancipation. For those interested in what this means concretely for social movements, his book Sex-Pol is highly recommended.The typology of Characters that Reich draws up in the closing chapters is vague and ill-presented, leading me to suspect that the distinctions and psycho-sexual mechanisms he was describing weren't clear even in his own mind. And yet there are occassional flashes of insight into behavior that I immediately recognized as true of myself and my friends and family.Reich's insights have deep ramifications for parenting, schooling, and political organizing, and were formative on the work of the New Left. this book is highly recommended for people interested in such questions.The last sections of the book are concerned with Orgone research, which I haven't investigated myself but which seem pretty wacky."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"This is a challenging book especially for a lay person such as myself. Reich may have been on to something but he may also have been going mad.The first two parts of \\"Character Analysis\\" cover Reich's move away from classical psychoanalysis as he decided his patients were sustaining their \\"mental\\" illness by means of chronic muscular tensions: the \\"character armor\\". He decided that talk therapy was unproductive: due to resistances people were not reporting genuinely. So he turned to direct physical activities.The third and final part of \\"Character Analysis\\" is as extraordinary as it may be baffling. Reich believed he had found a cosmic life force, \\"orgone energy\\", the disturbance in the flow of which in a person led to neurosis or psychosis. He believed that an invention of his, the \\"orgone accumulator\\", might help a person by providing orgone energy to them. He provides details of the body work he conducted with a psychotic patient in the intense chapter \\"The Schizophrenic Split\\". He concludes with his concerns about \\"emotional plague\\" as an explanation for mass movements such as Fascism. Reich appears to be struggling in this third part of the book, at times he seemed brilliant to me, at times he seemed quite disturbed. To what extent he was reaching to find ways to express important findings is unclear. He seems to have overreached but that may not invalidated some or much of what he presented. It's hard to tell.Although Reich's use of the \\"orgone accumulator\\" led to his imprisonment, body work based on his ideas and techniques has continued. Alexander Lowen developed the psychotherapy Bioenergetics based on Reich's findings. Charles Kelley created Radix, a personal growth practice, also based on Reich's work. Lowen has published exercises for one or two peopleThe Way To Vibrant Health: A Manual Of Bioenergetic Exerciseswhich may be used to become familiar with the kind of body work Reich pioneered. Reich believed that some form or other of character armoring was common among many people, not just the mentally ill: at least some of what he presents in \\"Character Analysis\\" may be useful for anyone."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"This is an important book, but--through the years--I have found it very difficult to wade through, even with a strong psychotherapeutic background. In general, Lowen's or Baker's (\\"Man in the Trap\\") books are more useful, in my experience.Reich's contention that individuals develop tough muscular patterns..e.g., around the eyes and mouth, and in the chest and abdomen (\\"character armor\\") as physical representations of psych. defenses are \\"spot on!\\" What's more, in the psychotherapeutic session, knowledge and use of this by working on the musculature by the therapist can be enormously useful. In short order, the patient is brought into contact with the emotional content of his blocked material. If the client is ready to risk and proceed with \\"the work,\\" for real change...not just useless talking, which is very common in analytic sessions, the way is there. As we deaden our bodies, we deaden our emotional lives, and make change all but impossible. Is is typical, as one improves, that--among other things--sexual response improves; this is one indicator of therapeutic movement. Incidentally, some chiropractic work certainly enhances the Reichian bodywork.Reich is also \\"on the money\\" about the fascist personality type. This is terribly relevant to our history--in the persons of President Nixon, and V.P. Dick Cheney, e.g.,...and with the repressive, warlike policies instituted under the Bush regime, which continue unabated under Obama. Of course the textbook cases of this are the figures Hitler and Stalin, who were rigid and utterly repressed and fascistic. The acting-out of their psychopathology spelled the deaths and torture of many millions.Our fascistic, illegal and unconstitutional policies (and Nazi-like propaganda campaigns) in recent years have meant a lot of killing overeseas, and compromise of fundamental rights at home. 'Twould be exhilarating to see this come to an end, and to see sanity and compassion prevail."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"I have been teaching psychiatric and psychological trainees how to perform psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy for more than 30 years. In this context, CHARACTER ANALYSIS has been an indispensible reference in demonstrating specific techniques for actively interpreting transference. Other parts of the book are also extremely helpful in demonstrating how personality and character develop response to specific parenting styles.What many contemporary psychiatrists and psychologists fail to recognize is that Reich - while a student and contemporary of Freud's - clearly departed from Freud in his belief that psychotherapy needed to focus on the unconscious defenses associated with specific personality styles. Whereas Freud himself was singlemindedly focused on neurotic symptoms stemming from specific traumatic events.Obviously in my view, the chapter on transference is the best in the book, especially as Reich insists on very active interpretations of the transference from the moment it presents. Which, as he explains, is always via some violation of the Basic Rule (the Basic Rule in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy is that the patient makes a contract that he will say whatever comes to mind without self censoring). It's a set up - because every patient breaks the Basic Rule during the very first session by not mentioning thoughts that are critical of the therapist. The example Reich gives is a patient who decides he doesn't like the paintings in your waiting room or the shape of your nose - but is afraid of telling you (usually because of the parental authority you represent).This is where Reich pounces, pointing out that the patient is self-censoring, and asking him to explore why. A classic transference interpretation, which because it happens in the very first session, helps the patient experience almost immediate improvement.Obviously personality types have become a standard feature in the current diagnosistic manual (DSM IV-TR) of the American Psychiatric Association. While others have refined Reich's work (as well as eliminating some of the psychoanalytic jargon), his original observations regarding the early childhood origin of personality traits have stood the test of time.Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE"},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"Wilhelm Reich's Character Analysis was a trail blazing work in progress. Reviewers who are saying it is unevenly written, or flashes of brilliance, etc., need to take into account Reich was a research scientist constantly revamping his theories and therapy. Reich was out on the edge of this new field: bio-energy-psychology and he was constantly pushing that envelope.Reich followed the trail wherever his research lead and soon crossed scientific boundaries: from medicine to psychiatry to biology to chemistry to astronomy to engineering and on and on.Character Analysis is a good book for conventional/mainstream psychologists to begin looking at Reich's work, starting from a psychology standpoint and working toward the bio-energy therapy work.Having experienced Reichian Therapy myself, I know how much physical, as well as mental, work goes into the de-armoring process. This process takes time and, for best and lasting results, shouldn't be rushed. My therapist, Mitch Singer in Seattle, told me most people wouldn't choose to tolerate the full therapy process, which includes the deep breathing and intervention/deep tissue work by the therapist to loosen the body armor. This process would overwhelm them, it would be more than they could tolerate because their body and character armor had such a grip on them. The individual has to want to go through the full Reichian process. The irony is the very armor which is preventing them from experiencing a fuller life and freedom, also prevents them from the willingness to understand and want to try the therapy."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The concepts Wilhelm Reich develops and explains in regard to character are put forward honestly and with the highest integrity. His confidence is based on years of training and a keen analytical ability.I found this book to be complex in nature. Because of the era this book was written, the reasoning and vocabulary chosen it takes a great deal of time and analysis to transform the information provided and understand it in modern day terms."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"Wilhelm Reich was many things in his lifetime- a student of Freud, a political activist, a research scientist, and an inventor. His work was decades ahead of its time and is finally being rediscovered and reevaluated by the public. If, like me, you are interested in Reich and his work, you might want to check out a novel called We All Fall Down, by Brian Caldwell. it draws heavily on Reich's theories, particularly Listen Little Man and The Mass Psychology Of Facism. It's a great introduction to Reich's work and the entire novel draws heavily on his theory. It's very interesting watching an author explore his theories in a fictional setting. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","review":"A disturbing book. Reich's mother committed suicide after she had an affair with the then young Wilhelm's tutor. Then his father killed himself. On page 3 of this book Reich mentions \\"early infantile sexual demands and repressing forces of the age\\". Later, he refers to a \\"simple and double Oedipus complex\\". Reich appears obsessed with the nature of sex in this book.The book was revised in the late 1940s and he appears to have developed ideation of self-persecution that later manifested in The Murder of Christ. Page 501: \\"But it is also true that Jesus was nailed to the cross by a pack of sick, cruel, murderous homines normales.\\"His attempts to treat schizophrenia in the final section of the book seem to have had mixed results. The fact that he resorted to use of his orgone accumulator perhaps suggests that his Reichian therapy was insufficient or inadequate.The section on the \\"emotional plague\\" was fairly interesting. I can see why the authorities were suspicious of Reich as he declares that politicians suffer from the emotional plague. Such a sufferer is \\"incapable of working, but dreams of writing an important book or doing an extraordinary painting, of working a farm; but since he is incapable of working, he avoids the step-by-step organic development inherent in any work process.\\" As defined, it seems to me that Reich suffered from the emotional plague himself as he was incapable of persevering with Freudian psychoanalysis to cure the trauma of his childhood."},{"Title":"Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)","review":"This book offers a highly interesting presentation and analysis of the ways tissues are handled, sold, used and conceptualized. For example blood, umbilical cord blood, cell lines and organs are discussed. Tissue Economies does not only describe the use of these tissues, but has also analytical discussions of biovalue, waste and information. Also the meaning of gift is discussed.The economies of tissues are global questions that are intertwined in many different phenomena. Even nationality and selfhood are at stakes in these interactions.I recommend this book to students of biosciences, women's studies and sociology. Reading Tissue Economies requires some background knowledge, but is not a difficult read."},{"Title":"Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)","review":"I find this book's strongest asset to be the historical discussions of blood banking systems and waste tissue lawsuits in the US and UK. The book outlines where the lines are drawn between flesh and cash: what tissues can be sold, which only gifted, and how else are they entangled? Donation, waste, banking, pools . . . toxic assets, etc.If you love mixed metaphors, surgical theatres and social policy, this one is for you."},{"Title":"A System of Logic","review":"I think this book is very useful in helping you deal with the practical debugging in the real world. I have learned a lot from this book. To my curious, the available title by John Stuart Mills in many bookstores are only rubbish such as \\"on liberty\\". I really can't understand why they don't re-publish this real classics."},{"Title":"The Great Trail Ride: Meeting God in the Wide Open Spaces","review":"I bought this book for a friend because I knew immediately that he would like it.

Beautiful illustrations and very peaceful and encouraging content."},{"Title":"The Great Trail Ride: Meeting God in the Wide Open Spaces","review":"I liked this book because of the content - the strong character & moral issues presented in a cowboy/western context, but applicable to anybody's life.

This is the story about Merlin's daughter Brianna. She is the daughter of the Mist and she has a challange ahead of her that will change her life.Tarek al Sharif is bastard born and does not have the memory of family and love but he is driven by the memory of a golden haired girl that helped him and saved his life. He has loved her from the first moment that he saw her and he plans on finding her again.The path to true love is not a smooth one for these two characters. There is danger in the form of a person that wants control of Inverness and of course \\"the darkness\\" is always on the fringes looking in and waiting for the perfect time to cause trouble. Tarek must choose between the love for his changeling bride or avenging his past. The chemisty between the two main characters is great. They don't just fall into bed and thats the end. Their love grows and I feel that is why most people red romance. This book has it all mystical legends, and romance. This is a not to be missed story. It is well worth your effort and time to get a hold of a copy!"},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Book 2 -Brianna of Scotland, second daughter of Merlin, is a changling who has powers to transform into the creatures of the forest.

But beneath that fragile exterior is a very strong woman. And fortunately she meets, in Tarek, a man who understands strength and her unique gifts. He falls in love with a glimpse of a woman he barely has time to speak to, and arranges things so he has to go all the way back to Scotland, supposedly on a mission for the king, but really to find Her. And find her he does, and claims her for his own.This book is not a formulaic copy of the first. The characters are their own people with their own minds and their own destinies. I was very happy to finally meet Brianna and enjoyed watching her and Tarek get closer. It is yet another fabulous love story! I'm looking forward to the next sister's story."},{"Title":"Daughter of the Mist (Merlin's Legacy, Book 2)","review":"Of all the books I have read I have also found this one the best that I have ever read. I extremly enjoy Brianna's character. Even with all the tradgey that she goes through she finds the courage to stand up for her people and for herself. She hides her feelings and shows how storng she is and that she really doesn't need anyone or at least that is the way she acts. But unfortunately she really needs a strong man to set her free.

This section is really interesting, amazingly complex, and fun. The student can play inside various exercises in which the diverse elements of art move and change shape. Each one follows a similar format, for example, when one clicks on the category, Line, there is an introductory paragraph on what line can be used for, and subcategories, Line Quality, Defining Mass, and Linear Perspective. When one clicks on any of these subcategories, an interactive page appears with more subcategories and windows where the student can manipulate the lines. This section is comprehensive and covers almost everything a student might learn in the first two years of drawing courses.There are so many facets to Elements In Art, that one could spend days or weeks going through them all, and since it is all on a CD one can go through it as quickly or as slowly as desired. The category, Shape, has sub-categories of Defining Shape, Figure / Ground, and Composition. Within each of these categories, there are interactive exercises showing the types of shape, creating shapes, and experiments with shape. There are five or six interactive exercises for Figure / Ground, and for Composition. Then the student goes back to the Elements in Art page and finds other intricate, interactive exercises for the larger categories of Texture and Color. There are sub-categories in Texture of: Actual Texture, Visual Texture, and Pattern. In each of these sub-categories there are four or five additional categories to play around with, and in Color, there are sub-categories of: Function of Light, Properties of Color, Expressive Qualities, and Optical Effects, and as in the other sub-categories, each of these has an additional four or five sub-categories of their own.Section 2, Art Techniques is not as interactive, but just as interesting and educational. In the Art Technique section, the categories are: Painting, Sculpture, Printmaking, New Media, and Glass, Jewelry, and Photography. When the student clicks on Painting the subcategories of Oil / Acrylic, Watercolor, and Silk Painting are available. Choose Oil / Acrylic and there appears an audio-video window (the text for the audio portion is presented below the window so one can read what is being spoken) and the video is a demonstration of how to prepare your canvas, choose pigments in powder or tubes, the various sorts of brushes and their uses, and painting technique. Each of the other categories also has an audio-video discussion and demonstration. In Sculpture the sub-categories are Bronze Casting, Stone Carving, and Ceramic Sculpture. In Printmaking, the sub-categories are Relief, Intaglio, and Lithography, and each of these techniques is presented with a discussion and demonstration. The same with New Media and a demonstration of Digital Imaging, Video Art and Animation, and in the category, Glass, Jewelry, and Photography, a demonstration in a glass blowing studio, a jewelry studio, and a photography studio.The first two sections are amazing and wonderful. They are almost an art education in themselves. They are encyclopedic as they bring the viewer through a basic course in these several disciplines of art. They are imaginative, fun, exciting, and inspiring. These two sections could be very helpful to the student of art. The only drawback is that nothing can be printed out from the interactive exercises.Section 3: Chapter Resources: Overview of Chapters with Sample Tests is divided into four parts, which reflect the chapters in the textbook. Each chapter has the same format: There is a window with a list of Leading Ideas supposedly pertaining to what is written in the textbook. Each Leading Idea is a one or two- sentence, overly generalized statement about a period in art history. Under the list of Leading Ideas is a short list of nine or ten Key Terms which are presented without definitions. There is a Self Assessment test for each chapter and a link to Section 4 - SAWYER flashcards.The concept of Section 3 has the potential to be good, but I don't think it is very helpful as it is now. Buy the book, Responding to Art by Robert Bersson, which is great!!! and forget this part of the CD.Section 4 SAWYER - Study Art With Your Electronic Resources, the student has four activities. 1. Guess the Artwork, 2. Search the Internet,3. Flashcard Generator, and, 4. Quiz Engine for Tests on the Flashcards.Guess the Artwork is something that might be quite helpful if it had been designed by someone who had any experience designing exams or quizzes for actual college students. The questions begin with very vague, childish-sounding, &quot;clues&quot; which might apply to several of the answers, for instance, in Question 15 of 42 from Chapter 14, Clue 1 is &quot;My artist painted in oil&quot; and with that the student has a choice of Portrait bust of Lorenzo de'Medici, Jacob and Esau, David, Resurrection, The Arrival of Marie de'Medici in Marseilles, and Saint Francis in the Wilderness.The activities, Search the Internet, Flashcard Generator, and, Quiz Engine for Tests on the Flashcards, didn't work very well when I tried them. It is awkward to &quot;search the internet&quot; from within the CD, and the Flashcard maker made flashcards which were almost microscopic, and needed to be increased by 3000% or so to be readable.The final two sections, Internet Resources: Understanding the Internet and Electronic Research, and Study Skills Primer: Tips to Enhance Academic Learning, are text based, non-interactive sections with a lot of information for new college students, but not a lot to do with art or the art student."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I bought this CD because I enjoy Lori Lite CDs.

Although counseling is often quite effective for the willing teenager, it is wonderful to give them something tangible that can be used in the privacy of their home with as much frequency as they desire. Teenagers may initially balk at the idea of slowing down and getting into one's body. However, once they make this concept a regular part of their daily living, it undeniably can create a new \\"normal\\" in which the static in their lives becomes much more manageable.Lori's CD's are a fabulous initiative to begin helping parents slow down their teen's crazy-paced world of texting, tweeting, blogging and facebooking. Teenagers often feel that the world is beyond their control, and the concepts in these cd's teaches children and teens to become empowered to take hold of their inner selves and dream their world into existence."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My daughter very much enjoyed this cd.

He is understanding and accepting which is something that teenagers long for every day.

Parents, if you leave it lying around in your teens room after telling them that it is good listening in the evening or alone time...that you dont want to keep track if or how many times they listened to..but if they do and want to share, you are there for them. As always they must respect it as others one day, could benefit from it as well...They will listen to it...They will benefit from it. I promise.As for being childish..there are many a teens who play with Barbie hiding while doing so..many a teens who love to have a chance to babysit or play with a younger child just to be able to be younger again, to read a younger child's books etc..When I Tutored I found that when I gave the kids younger stories to read but sheltered them from the other kids while doing it, then let them do this all together, their reading skills improved much quicker and they really did enjoy the stories..We say too often \\"grow up\\" so they become afraid of critism if they listen to something that may seem for younger children. Remove that stigmatism right away and they will be fine with much more. The ages I gave this too were. on femail aged 17, one male age16...They both enjoyed it as long as I do not tell their friends what they did. Let the kids know this work is Private and then they will listen. I have worked with street teens and as an Early Childhood Educator most of my life. I highly recommend Lori Lite's Products for your children."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I am a psychiatric social worker who purchased \\"Indigo Teen Dreams\\" for our unit. We have utilized this wonderful CD on a twice weekly basis as part of our relaxation curriculum. We have a very diverse population of adolescents ranging from kids who are moderately depressed or highly anxious to severely behaviorally and emotionally disturbed. This CD has reached teens across the board and given them the initial realization that they do have some control over their bodies and how they choose to respond to situations and stressors. I applaud \\"Indigo Teen Dreams\\" CD for its usefulness in everyday life in supporting teens with many diverse needs and challenging issues to find a better way to deal with their stressors."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"As a parent, I would give this CD 10 stars because I think it is so valuable!Lori Lite, the creator of Indigo Dreams and Indigo Ocean Dreams (as well as many other wonderful tools for children) has now created a real gift for teens. This Indigo Teen Dreams CD is a wonderful resource to help teenagers learn to empower themselves by learning how to connect with their inner being and strength, as well as how to deal with this very stressful time in their lives.Considering all the pressures they have to deal with, from peer and social pressures (which often lead to eating disorders),a changing physiology, pressures to do well in school and other activities, teens can benefit immeasurably by learning the techniques presented here.This CD has tracks that contain guided affirmations, deep breathing techniques, relaxation and visualization, tools that will not only help them during the difficult teen years but can also help them build a foundation that can help them for the rest of their lives.By learning to go within and learn how to live from the inside out rather than from the outside in, teens can find a place that is always available to them, a haven to weather the storms of life. Even when they may not be dealing with a specific stressful event, these tools can help with the ability to concentrate and build a general sense of confidence.When you connect with a place larger than the day to day dramas that can often swallow one up emotionally, you can live from a centered place, and that is true empowerment.This program is also a wonderful tool for teens to use in order to relax into sleep after a stressful day (and parents may find themselves wanting a copy for themselves as well to help them deal with their own stress).As with Lori Lite's other CD's, the quality of the production is top notch from the fidelity of the recording, the pacing of the individual tracks as well as the narrators and the music.I only wish I had a tool like this when I was going through those difficult teen years, but I am grateful that my own children have Lori Lite's CD's available for them. My almost 9 year old daughter and 12 year old son have already been using both Indigo Dreams and Indigo Ocean Dreams and now my Son can use Indigo Teen Dreams as well. I will have a copy ready for my daughter so that she'll also have this available to her when she enters those difficult years.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My soon to be 13 year old was having difficulty adjusting to the stress of middle school. Late night homework and projects made it difficult for him to shut his mind down for the night and fall asleep. I tried Indigo Teen Dreams after my nephew told me how much he enjoyed the visualization technique on the CD. He stated that he \\"never felt anything like that in his life\\"!My son loves the relaxation techniques and is now falling asleep quickly and peacefully. I was amazed at how easy it was for him to follow along. The speakers voice encourages and guides you (teens)through each exercise while reinforcing why a teen should want to do affirmations, breathing and muscle relaxing.This is a must have for every teen or pre-teen. It could really ease the transition and stress of adapting to middle school and high school."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"I have the Indigo Dreams CD which I use in my psychotherapy practice with younger children.

Recently, I had a difficult time falling asleep because I was worrying about college and such. I put on Indigo Teen Dreams and almost instantly felt more at ease. The visualizations and images are wonderfully relaxing. The meditation really allowed me to focus in on myself and forget the world around me. And the deep breathing track is something that everyone should do, learning how to deep breathe can make a world of a difference, as I found out. I put the CD on my i-pod and listen to it whenever I need to relax. It's made my overall mood better and I'm happy to have found something that makes me feel better. I do a lot of theatre and once the school year starts up, I plan to use the techniques to focus and relax myself before an audition. These techniques I can carry with me and use forever; I would strongly recommend it to any teen, I think everyone can benefit from it."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"Note: I have two boys that I adopted internationally as pre-teens.Wow! My 13-year old took the CD into his room to give it a try - he's usually pretty good about trying new things anyway so I didn' t think much of it. He'd tried another adult meditation CD and tolerated it. He still hated resting in the afternoon (I homeschool my kids) but if he doesn't get enough sleep he's a bear. OK, so he takes the CD into his room and I don't hear a thing for two hours. When he woke up he came out of his room grinning from ear to ear, saying things like \\"I am a good person,\\" and \\"I make good choices,\\" how the music is wonderful and makes him feel great, AND THAT HE CAN'T WAIT TO TAKE A NAP AGAIN TOMORROW. At first I thought he was joking ... but he was completely serious! He insisted that I listen to it, explained to me what \\"affirmations\\" are and what \\"visualization\\" is (English is his second language so these are big words for my son!). Then he hugged the CD. His attitude continued to be great all evening.You would think that a teenager, especially a boy would think this is ridiculous. This total basketball loving, soccer playing, bow-and-arrow, rock throwing boy loves this CD. He's copied it onto his iPod (it's the only thing on his iPod) and listens to it each afternoon and falling asleep at night. I am amazed.So then my 15-year old boy comes out of his week-long funk and decides to resume his daily 15-minute mediation. He's OK with this but would rather do something else, often fusses about it but then tells me later that he feels better after meditation (pretty typical all-over-the-board teen). I offer him his brother's new CD. He declines. I tell him to suit himself. He can't bear the suspense of knowing that his brother did something before him and tells me he'll try it, but then get out the old CD if this one doesn't work. He fell asleep within minutes of turning it on. When he woke up he tried to argue that it was no big deal, one meditation CD was just like the other. His brother sat on the bed and told him he was full of it, that it was a great CD. He then pumped his iPod up full volume so we could hear it and started chanting the positive affirmations. I told my older son that if the CD wasn't working for him that I would happily take it back. Well, no, he says, he's not ready to give it back to me. He wants to give it another try. Ha! I bet he'll be hooked in no time!Give it a try for your stressed out teen. Give them quiet time to really listen to it. It was a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"My daughter who had been weepy and sleepless, found herself giggling hysterically to this cd the first time I put it on. I considered this a good thing. And although she thought it was dorky (repeating \\"I am a good person\\" while she felt terrible caused much laughter), she vowed to do it each night as the relaxation techniques later on the CD worked for her. I listened for a few minutes and thought the affirmations were a bit awkward and the music was a bit dorky.

When she skipped the 8th grade and went into 9th it was such a change in schedule and class/grade expectations that the additional stress caused some insomnia and the lack of sleep ended up causing more stress.Around that time, through my job, I attended a stress management seminar. One of the techniques of reducing stress was guided meditation. We were encouraged to lie on the floor with a pillow that we were told to bring. The instructor said that some find guided meditation so relaxing that they'd fall asleep. I figured it'd be relaxing but no way i'd fall asleep in the middle of the day. The only reason I did not fall asleep is because I fought it. If I had let myself go completely - I would have been out. It was SO relaxing and I felt so refreshed when the seminar was complete that I immediately starting searching for something age appropriate for my daughter.This is the product I purchased. My daughter is a young 13 and I can still recall the look on her face when I gave her the CD...something along the lines of a mocking 'yeah, whatever.' There was no mocking the next day. She fell asleep before the CD ended and has not had a problem sleeping since. To this day I don't think she's made it to the end of the CD. If she's really stressed she'll follow the guided relaxation, but often she'll just put the CD in and let the voice lull her to sleep. She finds the man's voice very peaceful and relaxing. I bought this 3 months ago and she listens to it nearly every night. Well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Indigo Teen Dreams: Guided Relaxation Techniques Designed to Decrease Stress, Anger and Anxiety while Increasing Self-esteem and Self-awareness (Indigo Dreams)","review":"For over one year, my 12 year old had major problems going to sleep after starting middle school, going to sleep over 1 hr past her bedtime, and getting migraines the next day. It continued even into the summer, and I was getting less sleep too. I tried an amateur CD made by a therapist but it didn't work;I was I went on Amazon and tried Indigo Dreams the night that it arrived, and for 2 months now, my daughter has been able to put herself to sleep in 15-20 min with this CD! We use a CD player that has a sleep function that decreases the volume and turns off at the preselected time. There are different tracks - intro, breathing, muscle relaxation, visualization, affirmation, etc. The techniques the kids use will be helpful to decrease anxiety before test, competitions, etc. The narrator's voice is soothing but not creepy. I'm a physician and have recommended this CD to my teenage patients to help with sleep and not just pop a pill, and the adult Indigo Dreams for my adult patients. I have to burn copies in case the original CD gets scratched because we can't survive without it!!Update - 2 years later, my daughter's favorite uncle just died after a 2 yr bout with cancer. My younger daughter had problems sleeping and the second night, I grabbed the CD and player and put it in her room. She laughed because she thought it sounded silly, but 20 min later, she was asleep.

In this case, the sentiment is honest even if it is not morally admirable. Poetry does not always depict life or human nature as we would like them to be, but rather as they are.Second, the last line of the poem says &quot;these too are your children this too is your child.&quot; So the poem has corrected the speaker's own withdrawal from the scene.

Her poems are feminine in perspective, but probably universally applauded. She doesn't insults. They read like surreal episodes from a dream, having fleeting scenes change in time and place in nanosecond flashes. Words. Words are bended and hammered into concepts seen alien, yet fitting. For example, how does one \\"hear the bright train eye...?\\" What the hell is the bright train eye? But in the context of \\" birthday 1999,\\" not only does it fit, it's clear and above all, enlightening. The same cannot be said for all of Clifton poems. So of them includes miscues that makes them not so clear.Boats is partitioned into four parts, New Poems (2000), From Guilty (1991), From the Book of Light (1993) and From the Terrible Stories (1996).new poems:In \\"moonchild,\\" the author, deals with child sex abuse by a father, but rather than make the reader feel the pain, and anguish towards men, instead she attempts to share she has learned to cope with the memory to minimize, rather than maximize continued pain and suffering.\\"the photograph: a lynching,\\" in her poem on \\"a picture is worth a thousand words,\\" she proves the same can be said for her poem. She describes the stark history of a lynching, and focuses on the stunned witness of the eyes of the children. She questions the whether other kids, black and white, upon seeing the photograph will be taught accurately what happened there or will the story be misinterpreted or discarded altogether.\\"jasper texas 1998 for j. byrd\\" is as plain as it is powerful. The narrator asks, who's inhuman, the dragged or the draggers, clearly knowing the answer -- for the victim was dragged to death, involuntarily. But, so was Rodney King's beating, although some believed that he was in control throughout the ordeal. She concludes that deposits that if singing, \\"We Shall Overcome\\" is all we going to do about oppression, then we can expect more of the same.In \\"alabama 9/15/63,\\" the narrator feels so much for the 4 little black girls will go to heaven, but even that vision is obscured by the memory of a church bombing them to smithereens.\\"Praise song,\\" illustrates the warmth of unconditional love, the idea of welcoming a family member back home against their frailties, even when they appear to have lost their mind.from quilting:In \\"birth of language,\\" we see the proverbial Adam shuddering to whisper, \\"Eve,\\" which is excellent, loaded imagery, given what would be come the most dynamic relationship known to man. His shuddering was fitting.\\"sleeping beauty\\" is funny and typical of the male-female dynamic - she comes out of a sleep and the first thing she notices is man, \\"and she blamed him.\\"book of light:\\"women you are accustomed to,\\" Clifton extols egalitarian gender values: she wants to be the women her man has been accustomed to, because misses his \\"dancing tongue.\\"\\"song at midnight,\\" the poet depicts the loneliness of an unattractive woman, as she extols, love this woman who needs love because if the Black man doesn't, who else will?\\"the earth is a living thing,\\" personifies earth as a \\"black and living thing...in its kinky hair.\\"There are a series of poems that use the metaphor of \\"superman\\" and \\"clark kent,\\" to reveal issues of romance where the expectation is that men have superman powers even though there's no reference to narrator personified as the fabled \\"Lois.\\"from the terrible stories:\\"fox\\" poems are many in which the narrator personifies a fox, fearful of the terrible stories it must tell. These poems are the sex chronicles of a woman lacking and yearning for sex, not necessarily romance.Like \\"leaving fox,\\" in desperation, the narrator drops her guards totally, leaving herself open to all kinds of pain to get the sex she craves. \\"keep the door unlocked until something human comes in.\\" She knows she's exposes her vulnerabilities to the worse that may come in, but she has accepted it apart of her fulfillment.In \\"one year later,\\" the narrator ponders what if she yields to her vixen desires, but pre-empts the thought with fear of what will follow -- how ill it change or impact her life, her home, her poetry?\\"a dream of foxes,\\" the narrator supposes what if women could pursue their vixen dreams without the fear of consequences.In \`amazons,\\" the narrator returns to other issues, such as breast cancer, mastectomy, and more. She had inherited the breast cancer gene from generations of women before her. But, fortunately, there was only a scare, due to early detection.\`slaveships\\" she asks why did God not protect all from the inhuman hypocrites who enslaved her people in the name of God. She questions whether the sins can go on.In \\"memory,\\" narrator recalls a childhood stripped of oppression's shadow, so she will feel like she's done a good job of protecting her child's childhood.A few poems from Boats escaped my level of sophistication. For example, \\"white lady,\\" the narrator cries to cocaine to give her a ransom so she may have her kids back. - cocaine will only tell her to make her kids depend more. I thought those well taken pleas could be better be directed at the government, white supremacy, or the dealers, but not cocaine.And, in \\"poem in praise of menstruation,\\" Clifton uses metaphors that are astounding in that they sound so right even though unless you're in a dream state, they really don't make sense. For example, uses a simile of \\"blood red edge of the moon\\" - the moon isn't red at all. A better simile might have been the sun. Or, it could be something I'm not getting because I am a man. Perhaps that is her point, during that period, excuse the pun, the sun, the moon, they're all the same.Using a prose style, Clifton's words are defined not by Webster but by the context in which she uses them. Her words often take flight from when we've known them to some far off place where she's taking us."},{"Title":"Daughters of Darkness Volume Two : A Gallery Girls Book","review":"First of all, I would like to tell everyone that this book contains BLACK AND WHITE DRAWINGS only.

Every girl should read this book. As a matter of fact, guys should read this too. Definitely a 10!!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One word sums it up: WOW!

Reading it the second time not only helped me to understand it more, but to like even more. Jane Eyre is a wonderful book that comes from out of the blue. To me when I first heard I had to read it as a freshman, it was just another one of those classics that they made you read. However, as the stroy progressed I really enjoyed learning about how Jane delt with everything. Not only did I begin to dislike the people that Jane disliked, but I began to start looking at everyday situation and wonder how she might handle them. Overall, it was a wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I am a 15 year old freshman who was required to read this book for an honors class. At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night. I hope kids and adults alike read this book and enjoy it. It was somewhat of a challenge for me, but it was well worth it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charolette Bronte never seces to amaze me. she seems to bring her characters to life, as they jump off the page and into you head. After reading Jane Eyer, you will find yourself constantly wondering how she is doing. This book will follow you wherever you go, and unconcesly haunt you mind. It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again! I suggest it to all of those who enjoy a good romance, with lots of love and hope!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A classic, I know, and good story line, but very difficult to read - thanks to my Kindle, between the dictionary and translations, I was able to look up words or phrases on just about every page - made for very slow reading - but was still interesting enough to stick with it, even though it was probably the longest book I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"To get right to the point, this book is one that every girl needs to read. Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it. Disney princesses can suck it. Jane takes the crown."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The reader can understand more of the past through the eyes of Jane Eyre.

I have read it at least 20 times through the years, I consider Jane Eyre a must read especially for all females regardless of age."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops!

This is the cloth bound version or the book with the lovely attached ribbon bookmark. This is a very lovely version of this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: \\"Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\\" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says \\"Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. \\"Reader, I married him,\\" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a pretty good book, as far as it captures Jane's character and tells a decent story of romance. Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her \\"station\\", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The \\"idea\\" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult. I'm not a historian of this period or anything, but it seems like this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read it for the first time when I was studing english and loved the book.

Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones. Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story. Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story. It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane. By the end I felt I knew her.The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault. There are many places in the book that could have been shortened. I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.It is a lovely story.

Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love.

It was difficult for me to put down at times and at times I needed to put it down just to process what I had read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading for the sake of reading and who can handle 'deep' reading. If you've not read a lot of classic books this is a good start to add one to your list."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Loved it! I read it in seventh grade. My English teacher gave it to me as a present and I have cherished it since. I still have that copy, in good condition. The novel was wordy and yet not boring. The book to me was not only a classic but beyond what words can describe. I'm in 11 grade and I've read it about five times. I still cry whenever I read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This classic (yes I coin the phrase out of my own true feelings about the book - not because it is old) sincerely touched me and found me out to be a romance reader after avoiding such themes as much as possible. The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Erye, by Charlotte Bronte, is an excelente book. The characters are very well developed. Jane, for example, expounded upon the world her naivity and youthfullness. Her character was that of a dew-kissed lilly-- clean, pure, and forthright. Mr. Rochester was very similar to a bull dog. He had a surreptious character that leaves you wondering about his motives. His growling countenance intimidates and frightens the reader. This book contains numerous metaphors for life-- hardly ostentatious, so the reader must infer to discover these valuable lessons to life. A classical must read, Jane Eyre is not a dustcollector for any bookshelf. You will read it multiple times, appreciating it more as you get older._________________________________________________________________*Note: There is a slight part which may put the reader to sleep. Still, it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is my next favorite Austen after &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot;. Beautifully written. Deeply felt."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is a little girl when her aunt disowns her and sends her off the the lonley school of Lowood where she spends eight years being mistreated and unloved. When she is eighteen she decides to make a life of her own and finds and accepts a situation at Thornfied Hall working as a governess for Mr. Rochester's ward Adele. Though Jane and Mr. Rochester differ in age...They fall in love and are to be married. But fate intervenes.This has got to be the best book in the world. Jane is a wonderful woman with strong character and a inquiring mind. She reminds me slightly of myself.Many people seem to shun this book because it is so old and speaks in a slightly different English than we are used to. It is not a hard read at all. Once you get into the book, everything makes sense. Once again, this is the best book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As a high school teacher, I have heard many students complaining about Jane Eyre. Since I teach math, most students are surprised when I tell them I loved the book!

She is soon sent to Lowood School, a very strict school. There she grows up and even becomes one of the teachers. She soon decides to go out into the world. She is hired by Mr. Rochester to take care of his daughter, Adele. As Jane teaches Adele, she falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When a friend of his prevents their marrige, Mr. Rochester begs her to become his mistress. Throughout it all, Jane remains firm in her belief of pure love and marriage. Though she loves Mr. Rochester, she refuses to lower herself to adultrey. As life becomes unbearable there, she sets off to find herself and to seperate herself from her love.She soon finds that no matter how many miles she puts between herself and Mr. Rochester, she cannot forget him."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is as a great romance and a clever book. It is marked by an intelligent pessimism as opposed to a silly optimism which is also a marked point in most of Thomas Hardy's work. You go through the psychological struggles of Jane Eyre, an orphan first with the oppressive regime at the Lowood School and later with her employer Mr. Rochester and her cousin St.John Rivers. It is strong in the depiction of the environment in which the novel takes place and it also succeeds in making an argument about colonialism and psychology. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I put off reading this book for years - it was sitting on the dusty shelf in my schoolroom, by the Austens, Dickens and Shakespeare and looked like the driest book in the world. However, like those other books, Jane Eyre has stood the test of time, and there's a good reason for that. So 10 years after I left school I finally went ahead and read it, and was delighted to find that it is one of the best written and romantic stories you will ever read. Jane is orphaned at an early age, has a sad and lonely childhood, finds a job and a chance at romance, only to have it all dashed away and she is apparently left destitute....but it's not over yet. Treat yourself to this book, curl up and enjoy the wonderful descriptive prose and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is probably one of my top ten fave books of all time. The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I love the Bronte sisters. You cant beat the price of these free books either. If you're looking for a good read with some underlying commentary of the society in which the author lived (with some feminism mixed in) these are a good option!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The story is told in the eyes of a ten year old who is very articulate and smart for her age. I find that Jane's sassy attitudeand behavior justifiably humurous. Her strength and her personality are beyond her years and make up for her sad cercomstances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I chose to read this book out of a recommendation from a fond friend in high school, and yet I feel it was written for me.

I highly recommend this book to those in search of an escape from daily toils."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"&#34;I am a free person...&#34; I love this book.

Books tell you so much more than movies or TV shows can. I wasn't disappointed. The plot became clear, and the lessons taught in this story were timeless. How does a person come to have faith, when his past has been anything but perfect? How can we endure, when we have bad experience after bad experience? When &#34;bad&#34; things happen, that is when our character is developed, and this story shows that over and over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a great book and a classic.

As an American in 2012 the language is a bit challenging for my teenage daughters but I'm going read it aloud to them as a mother daughter thing over the winter holidays. Jane's character is such an inspiring role model for women today. She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"by far my favorite book of all time.

It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational.

Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words. Read the book, and let Charlotte Bronte describe it to you in her eloquent and heart rendering prose."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was an adorable little book that was very affordable.

It should be required reading for all women, young and old, urban and rural, single and married. A delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised.

After discovering a dark secret on their wedding day, however, she is forced to flee.This book about love overcoming all obstacles. Genuine love, not infatuation."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Why did I wait until I was 57 years old to read this book?

It is a wonderful book and a great love story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read Jane Eyre for the first time in my early 30's. I could not put it down. It is one of those few books where the author's voice gets in your head. I recently downloaded it so that I could revisit it. A marvelous book for anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are \\"The sorrow of young Werther\\", French \\"The lily of the valley\\", Russian \\"Anna Karenina\\" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered \\"Light in August\\" of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It had been years since I read this book. I enjoyed it immensely. No wonder it is a classic and will be forever!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \\"best earthly companion\\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I love this book! Easily my favorite book to date.

As a 28 year old guy I'm not usually accustomed to picking something like this up, but at the encouragement of my wife and the audio book available I was welcome to the opportunity of reading/ listening to it. All in all I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their language and or their list of great books to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Many of us read Jane Eyre in school, and perhaps found the dialects, moody setting, and pace a challenge. What a refreshing experience to re-read the book as an adult, with a lifetime of experiences to add to our understanding.The wispersync function allowed me to continue on with the narrative on long commutes when I couldn't continue reading, and the quality of the audio is wonderful. I encourage anyone who has dismissed Jane Eyre as a book relegated to their past to investigate it for insights into feminism, patriarchy, class, suffering, and forgiveness. I think they will find the human heart has not changed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I read Jane Eyre as a young girl and never forgot it. When I purchased my Kindle I thought of this novel I had so enjoyed reading and decided to treat myself to another read. I will most likely read again before I go..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"As a writer with an MA in literature, I of course read this book as a adolescent and as part of courses in Victorian English writing. The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked. But I'm sure it has something to do with it being an electronic version. But, LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Excellent read - there is nothing like a good period novel - I would recommend this book to all Bronte readers who love a suspense, thriller and romance all in one!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The title says \\"Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)\\" edited by Q.

I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \\"classics,\\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic.

It contains some aspects of our modern literature but the antics from its time of origin.As a book for AP English, I would rather have selected another book, but this is not the worst. Most readers will fare better in this book for school rather than the infamous \\"Invisible Man\\" and other commonly used senior lit. books.Be prepared for a long read, as JE is definitely longer than what a modern book usually will be. Otherwise, read away - this book has its own unique style that is interesting in all its own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I was relatively impressed with it. The plot developed way too slowly for my liking though, and I found myself quickly reading through the \\"stuffing\\" to get to the juicy parts. Throughout the novel the reader gets to know the characters involved very well, and even though they aren't very realistic, they are pleasantly developed, and fun to watch grow; Jane, the main character, proved to be the most satisfying character to follow and watch grow. However, this book is written in Victorian style language, and I found this style to be incredibly boring and difficult to read through or understand at times, but the themes and motifs embedded within this novel are effectively incorporated, and they kept the reader interested in analyzing the text. As for the ending of the book, I must say that I was very satisfied; with most of the intense emotional action happening towards the end of the novel I'm not surprised Bronte found a nice, and pleasant way to end her story. Overall, this book is great for classroom discussions, or to just sit down and read for fun. Enjoy :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is very inspiring piece of literature and motivates women to uprise against the society. I thought this book is very interesting but in some parts they are dull scenes. The language is well written; however, not modernize. The sentence structure is very long winded and contains a lot of imagery and metaphoric phrases. I hope to the outcome of Jane's life in the future, but I thought that its not very appropriate now in our modern society.The characters i think is well develop in the novel, but the only thing that don't convince me is the unfortunate events that the characters done in the novel is not very realistic. Other than that I thought that this book if a fine piece of classic literature so I praise the author Charlotte Bronta for it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"OK, so this is not Wuthering Heights, all drama and stormy characters. So what? Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully. I didn't like much the main character at first, until she proved to be smarter then she had appeared first. This is a classic everyone should read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is wonderful-there is simply no other word for it. From the very beginning, the story sweeps you up and holds you captive. On the first page, Jane is sure to win you over, and keep you on her side throughout the entire book. Told in elegant English, the story feels real and the characters seem to leap out of the pages. When I read Jane Eyre, I felt the lonely misery of her childhood, endured the sufferings of Lowood School, and shivered in the dark as strange noises issued from the attic of Mr. Rochester's house. I too rejoiced at the prospect of marriage to Mr. Rochester, and was filled with dark despair when the secret of the locked third story room was revealed. This book is truly a masterpiece that I would encourage everyone, even teenagers and young adults to read.

We read it in the in the English lesson. Sometimes it was hard to understand, because English is a foreign language for us. Jane is a courageous person and we could understand some of her emotions, because it's the reality and some of us know some of her feelings.

I first saw the film, and that was good for understanding the book better. The book was like the film, natural, sad and a bit romantic. All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live.

When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book.

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his \\"wife:\\" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall.

Bertha had set fire to it and Mr. Rochester was blinded when he unsuccessfully tried to save her life.Jane and Mr. Rochester, never losing any feelings for each other during their time apart, then marry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time. Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine. Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847). Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional. The other characters in this novel are just as memorable. Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister? The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency. This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"A true classic. In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance. She is a modest young woman who has been raised with much turmoil and tragedy, but despite this is able to deeply care for others. A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest. The character of Jane proves that any one can be a heroine, no matter what your physical appearance or character, that any woman is capable of being loved and of vast romance.

She is plain and simple, not very elegant or beautiful. It is fun to read about two characters, Jane Eyre, with her kind and charming but simple personality and the moody and mysterious Mr. Rochester.

A great novel and a beautiful love story, truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"We had to choose between 5 novels in my english 10 honors class and I choose this one. I definitley advise you to read this book, but only if you're up for a challenge. This is a great novel a great story of a woman fighting her way into society and finding out that she must only marry for one reason pure and simple love. I would recommend this novel for age 14+ I dont think others younger than this age would most likley enjoy it. I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions. The plot though is one very well planned and thought out and the last 9 or 10 chapters you race through. If you can get through a few dry parts you will enjoy a truly gem of a book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I absolutely love this romantic classic.

This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him.

Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try.

But wide as pathless was the space that lay our lives between, and dangerous as the foamy race of ocean surges green. And haunted as a robber-path through wilderness or wood; For might and right, and woa and wrath, between our spirits stood.Well that's all that I can remember of the little song Rochester sang to Jane. I realy love the book. I cried when Helen Burns died, and I cried when Thornfield was a ruin, and I Laughed at how [bad] Wuthering Heights [is]! I even made started puting CBJE on my notebook.

It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence.

So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words.

It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled.

But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic \\"tale of woe\\", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like \\"she gives me my meed liberally\\" and \\"collecting all she says with assiduity\\", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.\\"Am I hideous, Jane?\\"\\"Very, sir: you always were, you know.\\"\\"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.\\"(Aside.) \\"Damn him!\\"--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (\\"a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects\\") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The \\"madwoman in the attic\\" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time. Jane would be considered somewhat feisty by today's standards."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This was my first Charlotte Bronte novel, and I want to read it again and again!

I also love Mr. Rochesters way of drawing out Jane from her own self imprisonment of her spirit. I suggest everyone to read this atleast once and then see the new movie out! I just saw the movie today and it was the best yet!! Mia played the part of Jane SOOO WELL!! I was just mad that they left the gypsy scene out,,that was my favorite in the book.I must warn however that this particular copy of the book has extremelly small and strange print which was okay for my eyes but I can see older people having an issue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Jane Eyre is utterly incredible. The expression \\"page-turner\\" usually isn't associated with Victorian literature, but Charlotte Bronte created just that when she penned this masterpiece.

I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys literature of the very highest quality."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the best literary works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in.

Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Words simply can't express how much I love this book. I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my!

I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece.

Yet, as you progress through this story you understand every choice Jane must make, even ones that seem so difficult and painful.Yes, at times it's melodramatic and very dark.

Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius.

Ms. Bronte must have been quite courageous to write about a free spirited woman like Jane Eyre in Victorian Era.

The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda.

Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'. If anything, this is more boring.This dull, mind-numbing book is about as entertaining as watching fungus grow. The fact that its riddled with 'deep symbology' makes it not one bit more interesting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Excuse me? Is this edition a joke?I enjoyed Jane Eyre quite thoroughly, and I will not summarize the plot here. It has been done elsewhere.

She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she?

This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The novel is about a cheap gal called Jane Air who is out looking for the perfect guy to marry, one with a tonne of cash.

She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, \\"'Goodnight my --\\", and Bronte adds, \\"He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me\\". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, \\"Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!\\" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, \\"I LOVE this book!\\"When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards. The strong characters you fell in love with while reading her book, are the same strong characters in this wonderful screen adaptation. Bronte would be proud as was this reader/viewer."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"This copy of Jane Eyre, \\"The Illustrated Jane Eyre\\", from Penguin Classics, is a truly lovely book to read, and look at. The illustrations by Dame Darcy, bring a modern, fearless, and unique look and feel to a very old story. I've read \\"Jane Eyre\\" three times, so it is one of my favorite novels. Of the copies I've read, the illustrations in this one really do the story justice: a modern, gifted, gutsy artist bringing new blood to the novel of a gifted, gutsy writer named Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I bought this book about 10 years ago, and I did not read it till last year, i could not put this book down, This book is so relevant to a woman's heart, to the human being's gemotions, What I love about Jane Is that she always kept fighting through all her trials and never let hate poison her heart, always made the best of everything. I bought the miniseries from BBC, I recommend Pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility by Jane Austen to those who love this genre.Nobody writes this way anymore!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"The Audio was great until I reached disk 14. This disk would not play, no matter what I tried. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I'm amused to have been asked to review this by Amazon.com. The book is a classic, and a rip-roaring good read. This version also has a good introduction and helpful endnotes. And I like the cover."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I always thought that \\"Jane Eyre\\" would be a difficult read, but it isn't. Unlike Jane Austen books which have a lot of flourished writing, this book has more modern language."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Simple English)","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone.
