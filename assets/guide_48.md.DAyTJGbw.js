Join the Air Force and see Texas.&quot; In these two books Tom Alexander takes readers on a tour of Texas to visit 19 of the 65 Army Air Force bases which operated there during World War II.Volume I covers the bases which were at Amarillo, Pyote, Pecos, Sweetwater, Greenville, Waco, Harlingen, and San Antonio (which alone of these still survives as an active facility). Volume II adds to the tour the bases at Pampa, Hondo, Del Rio, Midland, Marfa, El Paso, Fort Worth, Lubbock, Austin, Big Spring, and Houston. Alexander tells how and when each base came into existence, what missions were fulfilled, who some of the people associated with the base were, how the thousands of Air Force men and women, mostly from outside of Texas, interacted with the nearby community, and what became of the facility. In addition the author looks at the nearby Texas communities before and after the bases were established and the impact that the bases had on the state as a whoe.Information about the bases is carefully researched and documented with endnotes. There are scores of histrical and contemporary photographs. The books are rich with ancedotal material. Alexander writes with skillThe heart of these books is Alexander's powerful descriptions of the opening, operation, and disposition of the bases and the resulting impacts on Texas. Those who spent Air Force time in Texas will enjoy these books. Libraries in communities which have or had a military base nearby should acquire them. This goes for communities across the country, not just in Texas, because the lessons they teach are about how war and peach change America."},{"Title":"The Stars Were Big and Bright: The United States Army Air Forces and Texas During World War II","review":"I really enjoyed reading &quot;The Stars Were Big and Bright.&quot; There was so much informative and humorous information in a well written format.

Like a detective, Woscoboinik searches for clues, reiterations, bridges between different Borgean works. He avoids free-wheeling imaginative inferences and personal interpretations. In the course of his research he has gathered information on Borges's life from various and sundry sources, including numerous in-depth interviews.Through close readings of several short stories, Woscoboinik follows Borges's path as he evolved from his &quot;narcissistic solipsism&quot; to the establishment of Oedipal links. He borrows the title of this book from Borges himself, who in &quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot; refers to sexual intercourse as &quot;Secreto,&quot; understanding it only as an act of procreation. Hence Woscoboinik follows the track of fantasy associations, among them those relating to the &quot;primary scene.&quot; Further chapters deal with the treatment of feminine characters in Borges's short stories, with the dreams and nightmares constantly retrieved and reiterated through his work, memory and the challenges of self-identification, and with the Borgean view of the problem of time.Readers of this book need not have specialized knowledge either of literature or of psychoanalysis. Borges fans will find a respectful, non-reductionist interpretation of his work that will increase their admiration for him."},{"Title":"The Secret of Borges","review":"Es un libro muy bien escrito y muy respetuoso.

But this was the book that guided me through the process successfully in 1974. I have been nicotine free since then.The most helpful thing I can remember was learning that my own mind was my worst enemy. It seems that my mind had a 'mind' of its own. My mind would wait till I was depressed or craving a cigarette, then it would parade every happy loving moment in my life (only the moments where a cigarette was involved) and tell me that I could go back to that good life if I would only just start smoking again.But thanks to this book, I was prepared!It's a fast read, very short, to the point, and full of useful tips that helped me quit.The addiction to cigarettes is like no other addiction....it is war and you had better be prepared if you want to win.This book will help."},{"Title":"Breakaway","review":"i was expecting pieces with better piano music, but if you are looking for songs to just sing along with while playing, this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Breakaway","review":"Chord Diagrams, easy to follow along.

She just does Brit droll humor to a T. I was even more shocked when later I learned that Grimes was actually dropped by Knopf Publishing, saying she was not making her advance back on the Jury series. Well, she has gone on to make them eat those words as every one is now a bestseller. I absolutely love to read, but in this instance, I actually prefer to enjoy the audio tapes simply because they are done by the great Tim Curry. As Grimes does Brit humor to perfection, Tim brings Richard Plant, Melrose Plant and his indomitable Aunt Agatha so perfectly. Curry slips into one character after another with such panache - right down to children. The combination of Grimes and Curry is just not to be missed.In the Anodyne Necklace, a violin, an ancent emerald necklace and a severed finger are clue to solving the ghastly murder in the wood of Littlebourne. The town is filled with dotty birdwatchers, a pretentious Peer, and more suspects than Jury can handle. Naturally, the ever-so-helpful, Melrose Plant, a Peer who has shun his titles, tags along to aid his friend - actually, to escape his Aunt Agatha who refuses to let Melrose give up his titles. The key unriddling the Littlebourne mystery is hidden in coded treasure map.It's great full all they way, and an absolutely must for Curry fans! Martha loves the old saying he who laughs last...she has been having one big giggle on the shortsightedness of Knopf ever since!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"This is the book that began the Jury/Plant series, where all of the books are named after pubs. This is one of the very few books in my experience where I remember who the muderer was because it was a flawless mystery, perfectly logical, nothing held back, but still I couldn't guess the culprit! Definitely NOT the &quot;had I but known&quot; school. There are some wonderfully gory scenes, if you appreciate that in your mudrer mysteries, in adition to wonderful character moments and real humor. I found this book to be the best of all of M.Grimes's marvelous books. I hope they republish! I read this book for the first time when I was nine (child of a mystery reader)and it has not lost its charm with successive readings over the years. My old copy finally fell to bits!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"This early Richard Jury novel is more comic than most of the others in this series--the scenes in Littlebourne, despite the fact that this is a mystery, are quite funny, with stock characters who end up being likeable and affecting. However, the strength of this book is in the scenes in The Anodyne Necklace and its surrounding London slum neighborhood, which is full of eccentrics, odd as can be, but fully enjoying their sordid lives.The murderer is a surprise here as well.This is also the novel that introduces Jenny Kennington, who is as enigmatic at the beginning of this series as she is later on. I am not sure of her appeal for Richard Jury!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"This book was absolutely awesome. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading it! I definately suggest any of the Richard Jury books to anyone who likes mystery books!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"The Anodyne Necklace,by Martha Grimes, is actually the third book in this great series. This book introduces a recurring character by the name of Polly Praed. She will become one of the primary love interests of Melrose Plant.

The original copyright is 1983, so don't be surprised by the reference to Princess Di. The settings for the novel are London and the small suburban town of Littlebourne. The Anodyne Necklace is the name of a working class pub in London.The storyline is interesting, with a mugging and a couple of murders that have to be drawn together. The story revolves around a valuable stolen emerald, set into a necklace. The thief, who had been a trusted personal secretary to the moderately wealthy owner, was killed in an accident shortly after the theft. He left a clue to the location where he concealed the jewelry, but the clue itself became concealed.Now it is a year later. People who might have knowledge about the necklace are being assaulted and killed. There appears to be an unknown accomplice to the theft. Richard Jury and Melrose Plant track down the information, and leads take them in various directions, including a Wizards snd Warriors game. It seems that the deceased thief was a master of the game, and the clue seems to be in a game map.The plot is complex and seems, perhaps, to be overly contrived in places. The author seems to have a fixation on flashers (they have shown up in other novels), and in this novel we have Ash the Flash and his young son, Friendly. The flashers seem peripheral to the main plot.The novel has a surprise ending when the identity of the accomplice is revealed. It is not great literature, but provides an interesting whodunit for light reading.A previous reviewer is incorrect in stating that this is the first novel in the Jury/Plant series. The first novel in the series is \\"The Man with a Load of Mischief.\\" I believe that this is the third novel in the series (there is a Listmania listing available, prepared by a different reviewer). A local bookseller has recently stocked the full series, so I believe the full series has been reissued."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"Second book in a row read by me and third book in the series..Still a very good read, though this one wasn't such a pager turner for me but the atmosphere and the charm is still there, and the story/mystery is very interesting. The second time around a little kid, this time a girl Emilie Perk, is one of the main character and a possible victim.. I'm about to read the first one in a series and wonder if i find a kid there too!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"This is the third in the mystery series starring Richard Jury of Scotland Yard, newly promoted to Superintendent (though he seems to spend his time doing the sort of investigative legwork any DC would do, and appears to have no administrative duties at all), and his buddy, ex-earl Melrose Plant. This time the victims (they're always multiple in this series) include a dead woman found with severed fingers in a wood near a village frequented by birdwatchers, a dealer in antique jewelry from a neighboring town, and a teenage violinist trying to earn a few extra bob playing in a London Underground station. It all ties in to the theft of a valuable emerald necklace -- and a treasure map. There's also a precocious twelve-year-old girl who's good both with horses and with retailing information for a consideration (precocious kids are also obviously a staple character type in this series), and a whole family of stereotypical East Enders. The mystery itself is well thought out (and not telegraphed by sloppy writing) but much of the enjoyment in the book comes from Grimes's dry wit and the interplay between Jury and Plant."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"Each mystery takes place around a pub with an unusual name. The reason for the name is explained within the story. This is a grand piece of British pub history. The stories themselves are twisty and turny and hard to solve ahead of the denouement. Supt. Jury and his partner Sgt. Wiggins are fascinating personalities. Add Melrose Plant, Lord Ardry and his Aunt Agatha and you're set for a great read."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"I love the Richard Jury series...witty and challenging to those of us who are mystery buffs...trying to figure out who did it.

A story of murder, missing jewels, new interests, delightful off-beat characters and an unforgetable tour of London's East Side.Richard Jury is investigating a murder, but Lady Jenny Kennington is a lady with real problems. My favorite character was Mrs. Pennystevens who never beamed Sir Miles as I would have like to have done. I know I've met Ernestine Craigie, finder of bodies & bird watcher, on the streets of several small towns.Good read--enjoy.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"A mild little story and easy to read at first.But: All those names? There is Plant and Tree, Wiggins and Biggins; then an obsession with cats and pubs, people's blue eyes and local dialect. After a while, it all gets a bit tedious. There are some amusing moments but outside of Melrose Plant or Emily-Louse, or perhaps Sir Miles Bodenheim (except for the constant egg on his lapel, tie or ascot) , the characters are not all that interesting. The plot and resolution struck me as contrived - a mysterious map which to me was completely unnecessary, a necklace that was easy to hide but took a year to be retrieved. The culprit was pretty obvious to me from about the middle of the book.I checked inside another of this series and it seemed to be almost identical to this one.Give me Agatha Christie any time!"},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"Compared to the John Sanford prey series or the Michael Connelley Detective Harry Bosch seriesthis is pretty dull. There is no getting into the mind of the criminal at all. I also felt no intimaterelation with Detective Jury; there is very little about his life problems or what he is thinking as hetries to solve the murder. It is just aplodding questioning of suspects with little if any real police procedure or scientific analysisof evidence. If you like British dialogue with weird names of streets and towns then this may appealto you. Some of the characters were interesting but that is it."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"The series could use ore dynamic character development between the main characters. It's interesting at first, but as the characters only threaten to change, but never do, after a while it get's dull."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"Anodyne Necklace.This is the third novel in the Richard Jury of Scotland Yard detective series. The first novel in the series is Man With a Load of Mischief and the second is Old Fox Deceived. Each book in this long running series is named after an actual pub in Great Britain.The character development is the best feature of this book, with my favorite character being Melrose Plant, oft-put-upon by his thoroughly nasty aunt by marriage, Lady Agatha Ardry.Melrose gave up his title as Lord Ardry, still lives in his family's ancestral manor, Ardry End, and he doesn't stop his aunt from blatantly pilfering treasures from his home.Oh yes, there is a murder, of a young lady whose fingers are cut off.

Playing a theme from EVITA she is hit on the back of the head. Racer calls to tell Jury he is going to go to Hertford, not Northants, for the weekend. The reader finds Melrose Plant drinking shooting sherry with his aunt, Agatha Ardry, as he tries to sneak off to join Jury in the murder investigation. It seems that a sort of bird watching fanatic, Ernestine Craigie, has spotted the dead body looking through her binoculars. The body of the murder victim rests in the vicinity of an overgrown public footpath in the Horndean woods.The violinist ends up in the hospital in a coma. She is the daughter of the female publican of the village, Mary O'Brien. The pub is called the Bold Blue Boy. The identity of the homicide victim is Cora Binns. There are connections. The girl in a coma comes from the village where Cora Binns's body is discovered. She was playing at the tube station, Wembley Knotts, from which Cora Binns departed to travel to Littlebourne. After a far amount of dithering, Melrose Plant and Richard Jury meet up at the pub, the Bold Blue Boy. It is learned that the girl in the coma, Katie, gave a child a book just in case. The child, Emily, gives the book to Melrose Plant.Then there is another incident occurring at a village fete. It seems the two homicide victims worked at the same secretarial agency. A valuable necklace, stolen previously from one of the inhabitants of Littlebourne, is discovered in a crevice at the Wembley Knotts Underground Station. Katie dies. Her violin teacher plays Pavanne for a Dead Princess at the site, the station. There is a sting operation resulting in the capture of the wrongdoer.Polly Praed and Jenny Kennington are minor characters in this adventure. The title, of course, is the name of another pub having significance to the mystery and neatly coinciding, (necklace=necklace), with one of the clues to the three deaths."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"Honestly, I have no idea why Martha Grimes is so popular. This is the only novel by her that I managed to slog through, and I hope it isn't characteristic of how this author usually writes. This was one of the most boring attempts at a mystery that I have ever encountered. The plot is pretty much non-existent, the characters are completely one-dimensional and often practically indistinguishable. There are endless attempts at very tortured jokes that are supposed to pass for a sense of humor.The only reason I forced myself to finish this horrible book is because I really wanted to know what is it that makes so many people like this writer. Nevertheless, I still have no answer to this question."},{"Title":"Anodyne Necklace","review":"I now have all of Martha Grimes' books.

Published in 1984 and originally sold for $28, it is now long out of print and frequently brings more than $200 at online auction and private sales. The first half of this 168-page book is a highly illustrated history of 4-string resonated banjos entitled &quot;Banjos of the Jazz Age&quot;. It devotes sections to each important brand name, with historical charts showing the introduction and characteristics of the various available models. Next follow a strong section on ukuleles and banjo ukuleles, historical catalog covers from banjo manufacturers, and a short section on classical 5-string banjos, primarily S.S.Stewart, Tsumura's favorite. The following section on the Jim Bollman banjo collection, included because of the importance of it's banjos not available in the Tsumura collection, is a rare and enticing glimpse into the phenomenal collection by this long-time zealous collector. Thereafter follows brief sections on early banjo related music covers, banjo recordings and postcards. Finally there are strong sections on Minstrel Era banjos, curios, and a very important section on banjo related patents. In all, it is one of the very few compendiums of useful and necessary photographic information for the banjo enthusiast, collector and player. It is an aid to identifying and placing specific instruments in their historical perspective. It is a superb &quot;dream&quot; book for those of us consumed by love of the instrument and dreaming about our next favorite possession. The only other books of comparable importance in providing a visual understanding of the banjo are Tsumura's gigantic tome &quot;1001 Banjos, the Tsumura Collection&quot; (out of print and soon unavailable, at $500) and Webb's wonderful &quot;Ring the Banjar&quot;, the highly illustrated and informative catalog of the 1984 MIT Museum exhibition. I highly recommend buying all 3 books, but if you can only choose 2, get Webb and then Tsumura's Red Book."},{"Title":"Broadway Yearbook, 1999-2000: A Relevant and Irreverent Record","review":"For anyone who wants info on some of Broadways most and least known shows currently playing, Mr. Suskin's book is an ideal source.

Great for any Broadway fan."},{"Title":"Pets Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Stained Glass Coloring Book)","review":"Let me begin by saying that many of my colleagues consider me to be a \\"literary snob\\", as I generally only deign to read the classics. The truth is that I do read many contemporary novels, and while they are on occasion diverting, I am overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the progression of the art form in recent years. So often today, we are accustomed to accepting any story with the slightest modicum of character development as being a revelation in the medium of written story-telling. An author with the competence and wherewithal to string together an acceptable number of complete, gramatically plausible sentences is hailed as the next James Joyce. The state of matters is so poor that our literary canon has been superceded by Oprah and the New York Times. People will take any positive inkling of support just to silence the very real fear that we are all flailing in a time of artistic stagnation.I was quite concerned myself, and had contemplated cutting-off all contact with the modern world in favor of subsisting on a small plot of remote land with my beloved authors. In selling all of my worldly possessions, I came across this book. I was skeptical of the diminutive size and the somewhat childish binding, but I am quite aware of the old adage about judging a book by its cover. Additionally, I had some notion, some... feeling that there was something special about this little book.I was right.It took only a few minutes to read from cover to cover, but I spent hours, day pouring over it. I had expected the book to contain the same worn and trite plots that I've seen before, but this was different. Inside the cover the only words written are a list of animals. 8 animals. It was a disply of such elegance as I have never seen! After the third reading I began to understand the significance of this list, though I can say I will never truely comprehend it. The remainder of the book is filled with simple line drawings, each one relating to one of the animals on the initial list. Never has there been such a radical rethinking of concept of a \\"novel\\". To find a work so groundbreaking, and so ultimately successful as this one is a once in a lifetime discovery. Every waking moment of my life is now touched by the (dare I say?) divine inspiration I have found in this book. The whimsical, almost serene expression of the turtle fills me such a confidence, and new zest for life!I can't spoil the rapturous ending which recontextualizes the entire book, and forces the reader to examine their most basic assumptions about life and existance. All I can really say is that every man, woman, and child should read this book. You haven't really lived until you open your eyes to the world...of PETS."},{"Title":"Common Interest, Common Good: Creating Value Through Business and Social Sector Partnerships","review":"Every company I know is interested in getting and providing a great deal. Every nonprofit I know is committed to the greater welfare of the society. But almost no companies and nonprofits know how to link together to multiply their effectiveness in achieving their purposes.This book provides outstanding examples and a superb template for creating partnerships of great value for all involved: companies, their employees, nonprofits, and the communities that everyone serves. Based on the examples in this book, it looks like the benefits can easily be 20 to 1 in the near term from the time and money invested. That kind of return is hard to find in business, philanthropy, or social entrepreneurship. The reason it happens is that the company can add value that the nonprofit cannot, and vice versa. The strategic partnership is not unlike the strategic alliances that companies create all the time with comapnies that offer unique strategic capabilities.The reason these benefit are so large (and growing) is because customers and employees are ever more responsive to promoting a social cause, companies are getting better at partnering with outside organizations, and the expertise of nonprofits is growing.Businesses can gain by getting low-cost recognition from customers that will increase sales, obtaining low-cost resources, making work more meaningful to employees (helping to retain them), attracting employees more easily, and learning how cause-based leadership can transform an organization. When you look at it from a dollar and cents point of view, these partnerships would pass any accounting test you want to use. Not to seek out these partnerships is to waste potential for growth and profits in your company. Corporate boards should be asking company CEOs to develop these partnerships!Nonprofits can gain by learning how to increase outcomes they care about, gaining access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable, getting more exposure, and finding improved ways of meeting their missions.Communities will gain by getting more resources, expertise, and attention from social entrepreneurs in companies and nonprofits.So this is a win-win-win world, but somebody has to get it going. Chapter ten is excellent on that subject: It proposes a 5 step model for the nonprofit -- self assess, identify a partner, connect to that partner, test the relationship idea, and grow the relationship.Although the initiative can come from the company, it usually won't. The executives already have other agendas, are receiving hundreds of requests for assistance, and don't know what many nonprofits can do for them. You can add some corporate executives to your nonprofit board who will understand companies to help you make these connections. The biggest hurdle will be the lack of corporate experience of your nonprofit's staff. Nonprofits are used to looking for a check, not a partnership. But that reliance on gifts alone is stalled thinking that will hold back the development of the public good.The case histories include Home Depot and KaBOOM! (building playgrounds), Microsoft and the American Library Association (adding computers and Internet services to libraries in low-income areas), Denny's and Save the Children (raising money for poor children), BankBoston and City Year (sponsoring volunteers in community work), Ridgeview, Inc. and Newton-Conover Public Schools (creating better public schools and better parent involvement from employees with children), and Boeing and Pioneer Human Services (creating airplane parts by employing those with disadvantaged backgrounds). I found all of them to be interesting and well analyzed. Each one gave me ideas for how to pursue opportunties like these for the nonprofit on whose board I serve.I especially recommend this book to company leaders, human resource executives, purchasing managers, and marketing planners. On the nonprofit side, this book will be a revelation to staffs and board members.After you have read this book, please join the board of a nonprofit (if you are not already on one). Then, please use the processes in this book to create a strategic partnership with your company or another one in your community. You will gain strategic partnering skills and a sense of a job well done. The others will gain the benefits described above. If we each did this, our communities would soon be far more wonderful places to live and work."},{"Title":"Common Interest, Common Good: Creating Value Through Business and Social Sector Partnerships","review":"I'd strongly recommend this book both to corporate executives looking to improve corporate image and morale and to non-profit leaders seeking new funding mechanisms.

It opens some potentially fruitful strategic pathways. Recommended."},{"Title":"Common Interest, Common Good: Creating Value Through Business and Social Sector Partnerships","review":"This book is vital for doing business in today's marketplace. It is a valuable tool for anyone charged with writing proposals or developing publicity plans.Topics range from corporate volunteering and identity building, to how to build value into partnerships between nonprofit institutions and for-profit corporations. With a bit of creativity, it's easy to substitute the words \\"independent contractor\\" or \\"self-employed\\" for the word companies. If you're the manager of a small nonprofit association, there can be big marketing benefits from partnering with a marketing savvy entrepreneur who runs a company of one - and vice versa.If you don't have time to read the entire book, Chapter Ten is especially useful. One section provides a list of nonprofit needs that can be addressed through corporate partnerships. While another section lists business needs that can be addressed through social sector partnerships. There is also list of major obstacles that may arise in cross-sector partnerships, such as differing language, culture clashes, bottom-line goals, and even views of the world.The authors are careful to point out that there are challenges as well as rewards to creating effective partnership programs. Bottom line is to create a win-win situation based on common interests.Even in the best economic environment, there are plenty of good reasons for businesses large and small to partner with charities and other nonprofit organizations, all for the greater good.The book jacket illustration, a handshake shaped like a heart, really says it all!

For example, more women than men develop breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer increases an individual woman's risk. Other factors are subject to limited choices, such as whether or not to reduce your risk by becoming pregnant while young, choosing whether or not to breast-feed, or opting for estrogen-replacement therapy.Factors like alcohol consumption, weight, smoking, stress, exposure to radiation (X-rays), and diet are, however, under the control of most women. Of all these, good nutrition is the most important factor in preventing breast cancer. A diet high in dairy products is exceptionally unhealthy. (Contrary to popular commercials, dairy products can cause a net loss of calcium, leaving no reason to consume them.)Dr. Keon also presents an extensive discussion of how various other foods affect the immune system, either strengthening the body's defenses, or weakening them so that individuals become susceptible to disease.His 7-step program includes eating a healthy diet (one that is free of animal fats), choosing organically-grown foods (to minimize intake of harmful chemicals), drinking pure water (again, to minimize harmful chemicals), reducing the use of toxic chemicals in your home, avoiding alcohol, exercising, and meditating to reduce stress. He provides detailed instructions for implementing all seven steps.Dr. Keon also discusses the fact that girls are reaching puberty at younger and younger ages--some as early as three years old. This significantly increases their chances of developing breast cancer as women. He offers suggestions to mothers on how to protect their children, primarily by starting healthy habits when they're young.Dr. Keon says &quot;the Truth About Breast Cancer will help you understand the ways you may be at risk for breast cancer, and how you can take this knowledge and use it to make real-life changes that reduce your risk and increase your level of health, your overall well-being, and your peace of mind.&quot;It's a book that every woman needs to read.Sandra I. Smith Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"I have been overwhelmed with statistics regarding my chances of getting breast cancer and I had not found any good sources until this book, which (a) demystifies the myths that one can't prevent BC when they can (b) offesr a realistic strategy to fight this scary disease (c) IS written in simple english!! READ IT!!!I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU WANT TO ARM YOURSELF AGAINST THIS DISEASE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF AS WELL AS THE OTHER WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE.

The Truth About Breast Cancer finally offers women the necessary education for us to make informed decisions about negotiating our way through a very difficult issue. The book is written in a professional voice which teaches how breast cancer may be prevented as oppossed to so many other books which simply raddle off scary statistics as well as trendy diets. Please, if you want to arm yourself with vital information and desire a campassionatly written and thoroughly researched book written for WOMEN and not doctors, read The Truth About Breast Cancer."},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"Dr. Keon's book should be required reading for everyone: women, men (and especially) doctors.My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer before Christmas '99 and has healed herself with the information contained in this life-saving book."},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"Ever since my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer I have read almost anything I can get my hands on regarding this dreadful disease. This book is by far the most outstanding I have read. I wish I had looked here first. Joseph Keon's 7-step plan is remarkable and so very easy to read. I've read it from cover to cover 3 or 4 times and have tried almost all of the recipes he suggests. They are just fantastic. I've watched my weight and exercised regularly most of my life....now I feel that, with his help, I'm on the right track with nutrition, too. If only we all would follow his advice, maybe there would be less people having to deal with breast cancer. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"The best defense is a good offense. This book is packed full of what women need to know to protect themselves from breast cancer. For this reason it stands alone in a sea of titles that merely want to help women beat cancer after they've been diagnosed, or help them cope with disease. Cope, schmope. If I can paraphrase Keon: the best way to kick cancer's ass is not to get it in the first place.His point is absolutely well taken. The conventional medical literature believes \\"early detection\\" is the answer - but early detection only detects once you've already got cancer. Keon explains the many actions you can take, such as improving your diet, excercise, stress management, and reducing your exposure to harmful chemicals, to minimize your risks.Although some statistics in the book feel a bit dated, and it would benefit from another round with an editor, the information is presented professionally and frankly without resorting to scare tactics. You should feel empowered after reading this book - not frightened."},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"This is an absolutely great and needed book!!! Breast cancer seems to run in my family and after seeing two grandmothers suffer from it, I decided to take things into my own hands! I decided to research prevention a little more after picking up a pamphlet from the American Cancer Society at my doctors office and under the \\"Best Defense\\" for Breast Cancer they listed only early detection! While breast exams and mammography are important, they only detect cancer once it has hit you!!I thought it was ridiculous that the American Cancer Society would say nothing about diet and excercise, and the multitudes of carcinogenic chemicals, and not give us any concrete ways to actually prevent breast cancer! As the author of this book says - in only about 30% of breast cancer cases do any of the traditional 'risk factors' (such as family history of the disease, late menarche, late pregnancy, etc) play any part! And breast cancer rates in the U.S. have been rising for the last several decades, while there are some groups of women that are not as afflicted with breast cancer! There is so much we can do to help PREVENT breast cancer, which is the topic of this book!This book is a great source of information and a great resource that brings in together many different facets of breast cancer causes and prevention - from alcohol use, to pesticide use, to water filtration, to animal fat and other diet concerns, to excercise and stress reduction, etc, etc.This book has a great section on all the good kinds of food to eat and hints and recipes on how to incorporate them into your diet. It also has a great section talking about excercise programs, and several diagrams of proper stretching techniques. It also has a chapter for parents of young girls - to help even further reduce thier risk of developing breast cancer when they are an adult.I have already bought a copy of this book for my mom and grandma, and am considering getting it for all my aunts and female cousins! This is a GREAT book, and I wish they could somehow get all the information in it to every woman!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Breast Cancer: A 7-Step Prevention Plan","review":"The Truth About Breast Cancer is a thorough book about overall health in general and very in depth regarding Breast Cancer prevention. It will be a valuable assest in everybody's library - whether for yourself or as a gift. Keon details many facts and figures that will astonish most readers. The tone of this book is urgent yet not suffocating. The choice is yours to make - live a healthy life by following Keon's guidelines and his Revised American Diet.

It really makes you feel like you are part of the action, you cheer when Brian conquers and cry with all his suffering and loss. You get to know the main characters, and sence Ireland and the way it was when Boru reigned."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is a wonderful book of a great man. Ms. Llywellyn's love of her heritage and its history just screams out from every page. Brian of Boru was a great and wonderful ruler, and this author has made his life come alive. We see Brian as he lived every day of his life - always in search of the greater good which included a united and peaceful Ireland. We see him as a warriar, a lover, a father, a Christian, and we see the lives that he touched. We also get an intimate portrait of his women who were each as remarkable as him in their own way.The battle scenes in this book are excellent and beautifully written. As I read I felt that I could hear the crash of the swords and the grunts and groans of the dying men. This is an awesome historical novel, and I recommend it whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The Lion of Ireland is the first book I ever read concerning Irish history, beginning a life-long study. Ms. Llywelyn is certanly a good writer, and from what I researched concerning the &quot;real&quot; Brian Boru she sticks to the history. The only negative point I can make is the heavy-handed romance that seems to be throughout the book. Be that as it may, Lion of Ireland is still a great read!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Absolutely incredible is how I would describe this book. Morgan Llywelyn's descriptions of Brian Boru and life in his camp bring the subject alive. It was like being there! You HAVE to read this book!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Being both an Irishman and a descendent of Brian Boru, I have done quite a bit of research into both the myths&legends and the historical records of the events and characters portrayed in this book and I have to say that Morgan Llywelyn writes about ancient Ireland as if she just stopped there for tea. I was thoroughly moved by her prose. From the moment I first opened the cover I was literally unable to put the book down, which was unfortunate because I ended up missing all of my classes for the rest of the day. I was just lucky it was Friday so I had the rest of the weekend to finish the book and then read it again. I whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone I know and I believe it should be required reading in any finishing school in Ireland. If you are into historical fiction or have eyes and are literate I demand that you purchase this book and tell all your friends about it."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I am no Morgan L. fan. I am no Celt fanatic. I am no history buff. Having cleared that up...this is definately one the finest written books I have ever read, and I read quite alot. Like many others writing these reviews, I first read this book when I was around 15 and was amazed and delighted with the story. Since then, I have read the book many times, or just browsed my favorite parts (when Brian is 'ambushed'!), it never fails to capture me and pull at my emotions. I picked it up the other night and discovered that the many handlings of it have placed it in an unreadable condition, so I came here to look it up. If the price had been fifty bucks I would've paid it. It's worth it. I consider my life 'better' with the enjoyment I continue to get from this book. What else can I say? GET IT."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is the first Morgan Llywelyn book I have read and I can't wait to read more of her books. I loved this book from page one. I fell in love with Brian and felt his pain and victories right along with him. It is a powerful story about a powerful man. I've wanted to go to Ireland for a long time to explore my own family history and after this book I want it even more."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Someone please tell me that there is a movie producer out there somewhere with enough sense to realize that the story of Brian Boru is worth being told.I read this book about 6 months before Braveheart came out at the theaters. I don't want to take anything away from Mel Gibson's acting and directing abilities, but the whole time I sat in the theater watching Braveheart I kept thinking to myself that this movie was not nearly as captivating as THE LION OF IRELAND. The similarities were there, but that only made me long for the pages of THE LION OF IRELAND only more than ever.Brian Boru was the kind of leader born of warrior stock whose presence demanded respect and reverance. He was the type of leader who if he only asked, his followers would follow him through a wall of fire and come out on the other side victorious!Read this book! Not one person who has read this book and reviewed it has given it less than 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"A great historical fiction novel of the life of Brian Boru. The Lion of Ireland by Morgan Llywelyn is a keeper. She keeps the readers interest by an every changing dynamic in the story as we see Brian go from the youngest of 12 sons to the Ard Ri or High King of ALL Ireland. Brian grows up and learns how to take care of his own people. He also learns and teaches all the different Irish Kingdoms to think of themselves as Irish first and Munster men or Leinstermen second. He even works to include the Norse Irish and Dubliners into the Irish fold as all have shared the same land for generations. Through his growth as a King his women have helped shape who he is. First we have the lovely Druid, Fiona who is watching and protecting Brian in his struggles for Kingship. Then his wives Deirdre and Gormlaith who are very different women, challenge Brian and make marriage just another battle field for him. They give him his children too who he hopes to pass on his legacy and keep Ireland united. This was a fun and informative read. Very vivid in detail and shifts from historical, to adventurous and action packed battles to amazing fantasy and emotional romance. This book is a hearty and well seasoned stew of storytelling. I am hooked and have started its sequel, Pride of Lions also by Morgan Llywelyn."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The fire, the passion, the gentleness and the ferocity of this book is truly remarkable. It is a treat to the mind, one that develops the verdant landscape of those days, but yet gives hope for the future. If once a King such as Brian Boru could unite Ireland, then surely it can be done again. A man of his talents, finesse and courage will appear again and understand how history plays such an important role, and possibly take lessons from Brian's own life, superbly done by Morgan Llywelyn."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This chronicle contains a slice of just about every catagory a novel may allow. Romance, action, and emotions are distributed amungst the novel that of an back and forth fashion. There is an intreging plot that makes you keep asking yourself questions as the tale unfolds."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Though the book was well researched, it was a little sappy. The characters were quite one dimensional and the four women in the book were devoid of personality. It's hard to believe that a woman wrote this book. Where was the suspense? The drama? The free will? Great history lesson though - more children's book than adult novel."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"just beginning it, of irish decent and this is written by someone I believe is a relative of mine. cool"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This was a gift I got for someone. Its what they wanted but I cant say much about it"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is a great book. The story flows from chapter to chapter keeping you on the edge of your seat. I think some sort of royalties are owed to the author as I believe this book's story was stolen as the screenplay for the movie Braveheart. When I first saw that movie this book came immediately to mind. I think they just substituted William Wallace and Scotland for Brian Boru and Ireland."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Lion of Ireland is one of the most interesting, well-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Llywelyn clearly portrays life in 1000 AD Ireland.I've read it and The Pride of Lions twice and am still entralled. Llywelyn tells Boru's story in a way that both the serious reader and the pleasure reader can enjoy.Even if you're not a history buff, the tangled love story and fantastic battle scenes make it a book anyone can read and revel in.Thank you Morgan Llywelyn.I connected so much with the characters, I named my daughter after Boru's father, Cennedi."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"With dexterity and wit, M. Llywelyn brings medieval Ireland to the glory of the modern English language. Taking characters of the Irish sagas, she creates a fleshed-out cast of characters. If you've read Brian Boru's tales before, you'll find this is true to the basic plot. The story is told of all too human men and women thrust into the heroic situation. This was written as if it were a biography of the great hero. Like many of her novels, she paints her hero as a man, first, and a hero second.Set in roughly the 9th Century, the Danes were settling in Ireland on the east coast; they built cities and were forming settlements. Not all of the Irish kings were happy about this. The Danes put a new skew to the Irish vs. Irish fighting, making it the Irish &amp; the Danes vs. the Danes &amp; the Irish. Brian is called to make more of himself, and eventually tries to gather the Irish to his banner and subdue/evict the Danes. Both sides are out to stop him, for various reasons.The action will keep you on your seat edge, as will the politicial intrigue going on behind the action.If you like this, definately find Llyewlyn's other earlier heroic works."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"You will laugh, you will cry, you will grow hot with rage and yet swoon over two lovers, you will undoubtedly love this book. Emotion packed, this slightly lengthy yet worth-every-word novel is brought to life by Morgan Llywelyn's vivid descriptions of the Irish countryside. You will adore and loathe the lively and realistic characters, always drawing out intense emotions. You will ponder the ethics and debate the morals, and whether the tear-jerking ending is happy or sad is up to speculation. Brian of Boruma is truly a hero, a giant of a man capable of fighting battles, delivering charismatic speeches, forming brilliant strategies, intimidating his enemy and warming the heart of his friends. Whether it's the bloody battle scenes, romances, or the magical air it carries with every word that will inevitably draw you into the spell binding plot, I can gaurentee you will be unable to put down this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is truly a work of art. This the best book on the middle ages and Ireland that I have ever read.

Everyone who loves Ireland or the Middle ages should read this book and the best part about it is that it is just about all true!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I remember reading this book when I was a teenager and being blown away by it. I used to kept it close to hand to read my favourite parts if I was feeling blue and just needed some inspiration. From the moment the book begins, introducing Brian to us as a child, to the last page, I was drawn to this character and felt every agony and exhaltation during the battles and dramas of his life. I have since moved abroad and haven't read this book in a long time. I was delighted when I stumbled upon it here at Amazon. I am counting the days until it will be delivered to me and I had read it again!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Finally had to buy a new copy because the old one fell apart. This is one of my favorite Authors, if you are Irish, or of that line, buy all of her books right now and save yourself from having to come back over and over like I did. If your not, I'm terribly sorry to hear that... go find yourself someone Irish so your kids will have better lives. Loved all of her books. A little bit of history, with a novel built around them.

Brian Boru like all of her books is a phenomenal read. Her ability to intertwine sometimes laborious history into an exciting, informative and enjoyable story is remarkable.

I could hardly put it down and in fact spent many nights reading when I should have been sleeping."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The Loin of Ireland is a book that allows you to experience ancient Ireland without ever leaving your study.

A must read for historical fiction fans"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Very entertaining historical fiction account of the life of Irish high king Brian Boru. Lots of inter tribal conflict between celtic clans, conflict between norse raiders and settlers and local Irish celts, religious conflict between christian and celtic and norse pagan beliefs, conflict in Boru's life.

They pilfer, rape, and randomly kill without a second thought. Observing the cruel attack in shock is a young lad, Brian mac Cennedi. He vows that one day there will be vengeance for the wanton death and destruction that the marauders brought to his clan.As he grows into adulthood, Brian never forgot his vow. He begins his quest of revenge starting with efforts to unite the Irish clans under his rule. His battles with Viking and Irish alike become legendary as no one fights more ferociously than Brian does in battle. Eventually he conquers and unites the land, becoming known as Boru, the High King of Ireland.LION OF IRELAND is an exciting historical fiction tale that cleverly blends known facts, legends, and Morgan Llywellyn's wonderful imagination into a great epic tale. The story line vividly provides a feel for tenth century Ireland without skimping on the action or on character development. The heroic Brian, the three key females, and his foes are fully developed so that the audience understands their motives while obtaining more insight into an interesting era.

Morgan Llywelyn has a wonderful gift for making Brian come to life and staying with you long after the last word is read. I am now planning a trip to Ireland to visit Brian's tomb. I hope to bring home some of his courage and wisdom. Ireland was truly blesed to have such a leader as this."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Its an amazing book. That is if you don't mind the thrilling gorry seens(Such as a Norse axe crashing through an Irish mans head), and those sex scenes.

The author does a fantastic job of allowing us to see Boru's hopes, dreams, and even flaws, drawing further and further into the story. When I finished, I felt ready to go see Tara. I'm amazed that his story is not told to school children in history books. They tell us of Charlemagne, why not Boru? There is action, fighting, joy, thrills, and heartbreak all in one book.

I am reading The Wheel of Times series, Recluce, and Fallon but Lion of Ireland will always remain the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The first 150 pages of this book are terrific, and I couldn't put it down, but then it begins to dwindle. Although 550 pages, it really is sparse. It moves through Brian Boru's life with rapid speed, which would be okay if certain parts were emphasized, but Llewelyn doesn't do this. At the end the reader is left unable to seperate any of the battles or achievments of Boru. They all run together. Boru's achievement of conquering Ireland was a life-long struggle, but Llewelyn writes as if there was never any doubt he would conquer Ireland. War is also romaticized, and Boru is portrayed in battle as he is in life - he can't lose. However, the novel was mostly based on facts, and except for a couple characters, Llewelyn writes what really happened. This is refreshing change from the Braveheart-like stories, where more than half of the content of the stories have no historical backing."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"She has brought Irish history alive in such a way that it captivates both the young (my 8 year old son) and old (myself). The begining of life in ancient Ireland and the strife caused by the many invaders is hard felt but done without the excessive violence of many current writers. I had never realized how close Ireland had come to being made whole, or the pain it took to get it there."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie, Brian of Boruma makes William Wallace look like a child. And if they're lookin for somebody to have a small part like Turlough I'll gladly play the part."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Definatly a classic. Those of us who are Irish/Scottish have something to be proud of in Brian Boru and the man who brings us his story, Morgan Llewellyn."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"this is one of my favorite books. i was fortunate enough to have read it originally 15 years ago, and have read it once a year since. i always start it on good friday, the day brian boru died in 1014. it means that much to me. now when i finish 'lion...' i'll start the sequel 'pride of lions' which is another classic. just be groovy. i rule"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book kept me captivated like no other book has ever done. When I first started it, I was transported to the time of Brian Boru, and the characters became lifelike. I enjoyed reading it, and have passed it on to many of my friends, every one of them enjoying it as much or more than I."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Morgan Llywelyn has done a fantastic job in this novel. She does outstanding research and builds a framework that will have you walk away from this book having a very good understanding of the history of Ireland in terms of its small kingdoms constantly warring with each other to where outside invaders can waltz in and mop up. The greatest king who accomplished what no other could was Brian Boru, Ard Ri (High King) and unfortunately his descendents proved incapable of maintaining what was created. If history had been different then, perhaps today's situation and recent past of continued fighting and occupation would have been different.If that was all there was to offer in this situation, however, then Llywelyn's book would not stand out from much of the common fare in historical fiction. Far too often, characters are developed but left somewhat lacking and no real story develops and stands out.This is not the case here. The characters are rich and personal and capture the spirit of the ages in a way that few historical fictional works ever do.Llywelywn explores the conflict between druidic and Christian culture and religion and personifies it within her characters to where the discerning reader will pick up a lot that is caught more than told.Be aware that some of the scenes are fairly adult in nature. It is not gratuitous. It does add to the story line, but some readers with sensitivities in this area will want to know that in advance.Overall an excellent read with much to recommend it!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I picked up this book knowing nothing about Irish history and going on a single recommendation. I am so glad I picked up because I couldn't put it down, it is easily one of the most engaging books I have ever read. Llywelyn seamlessly combines the heat of battle with the passion of love for women and country. A great read even for folks with no knowledge of Irish history. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Once again Morgan Llywelyn has written a wonderful book. This time she brings you back to the time of Brian Boru, one of the great kings of ancient Ireland.As with many of her books Morgan has spent a lot of time researching her subject before writing the book. This historically accurate book gives you a glimpse of what life in ancient Ireland was like.It left me craving more and dreaming of my heritage."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Lion of Ireland is one of the best books I've ever read; and for the record, I'm not one of those guys who makes that statement when the only other nominees are The Catcher in the Rye and The Cat in the Hat. I read voraciously, averaging a book a week, and this novel gripped and inspired me like few others since my childhood Rauld Dahls. Each chapter is full of well-drawn, 3-Dimensional characters, dramatic (and rarely corny) dialogue, and breathtaking, illistrative battle scenes. It doesn't do much good to keep throwing out superlatives, but I don't know how else to get you to read it. If you're one of those puritans, don't be put off by the smutty back cover. You owe it to yourself to pick up the most gripping royal adventure since Henry V. (Lion of Ireland would make an instant classic of a movie, but I fear that the uneducated public would simply see it as a &quot;Braveheart rip-off&quot;. Not quite. Brian came first, and Brian won!)"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The story starts out with the all powerful, all conquering, Norse attacking the peaceful, sleeping seat of the then relatively unknown and insignificant Dalcassian Clan. The Northmen loot and burn without fear of reprisal. It is a fatal mistake for Norse interests in Ireland. They have made an enemy of a small boy with great dreams.His name is Brian mac Cennedi and he will become the last true High King of Ireland. He will unite his land as no one has done before or since and extract a terrible toll of vengeance from his Viking enemies. The small boy grows up to become the great Boru. A true larger than life hero straight from the pages of history. A good king with an unquenchable lust for life, a keen and prescient sense of justice, and battle rage that even the fearless Norse and Danes recoiled from. Boru is, for my money, the greatest hero of all time.Read this book and compare Boru to any of the heroes of mythology. They will not stand a chance! If you want to feel passion, read this book. If you want to walk in the shoes of greatness for once in your life, read this book. I read it twice and I can't wait to read it again someday."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I read this book (the first time, at least) when I was 15. I agree, some of the content may not be appropriate for adolescents. However, the message the book gave me has changed my life for the better. In Brian, I saw the power of dreaming big, of not forgetting and to never stop persuing your dreams. It opened my eyes and the world became a much more exciting, magical place - much like the wonderful places Llywelyn describes in her books. All of her books are moving, and often leave you shaken and begging for more - but this one contains so many powerful lessons wrapped up in an engrossing, epic, and mostly true story! If you havent read it yet, you are truly missing out."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"All I can say is that is simply the greatest book I've yet to read in my life. I first came across it when I was 6 yrs old, my father was reading it. I wanted to know what he was reading and he began to tell me about this &quot;Boru&quot;. I was fascinated, however I was too young to read a book of this level. I kept a copy of it for 6 yrs until I was &quot;mature&quot; enough to comprehind it. It succeeded my greatest expectations. That was 12 yrs ago and I have hence read it somewhere around 14 times."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The life of Brian Boru is chronicled in this fascinating novel ofIreland. I started reading this novel early in the afternoonand I couldn't put it down until early next morning! You'llfollow this man's incredible journey to unite all of Irelandas one nation, changing forever the destiny of the Irish people.If you want to travel into the history of the emerald isle withoutpaying airfare, you'll want this book!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Having first read her book &quot;Druids&quot; and absolutely loving it, I decided to take a chance on this one. A true masterpiece, this......even though the pace seems to drag midway, it picks up by the end to pick up the slack. From the early days when he was simply Brian mac Cennedi, from the destruction of his home, to his latter efforts to rise an army, and build a kingdom, this story will compell you to finish it. You just can't put this one down.You want to find out how successful Brian's next campaign is, or read on to see who will be the next less than worthy man laughed at by the excessively lustrous Gormlaith (or, for that matter, what machinations she herself is in the middle of, as the story does paint her at odds with the tradition of the day, that being women being mostly subservient to their husbands)Gormlaith defies this throughout, in decision and cunning a man, but the picture of womanhood by appearance. To tell more would give too much away. That which you see here is only packaged snippets of lush plot elements for you to discover upon reading this book. Pick it up today. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a true historical novel, since I learned a lot about Irish history of the times, and also came to very much like Brian of Boruma and all that he felt and accomplished for his country.The characters are vey alive and real and all the facts presented, like wars, marriages are very well presented and not boring to read. The places as well as life in those ages are also very alive and easy to read and learn about.A very good book and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I am glad that this book actually exsisted! I had bought the second book on accident thinking it was the first in its series. I hadn't thought to look on Amazon for the first but when I found it, I knew I had to buy it! Although the book had an older cover, I was pleased with how fast it arrived after I placed my order. The book is in good shape and the old look it has to it adds interest to the story. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Thank you so much, my husband just loved this book, it arrived in just days and was in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is an excellent book and a terrific way to learn some history. The facts and the novel blend together seamlessly. The action and passion are thrilling. I've read it more than once."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is possibly the best book I have ever read. Brian Boru is absolutely one of the greatest subjects for a book ever, and Morgan Llywelyn does an incredible job of bringing him to life. Amazingly, she traces his story from a young boy to his death in his 70's, and yet the book never drags. When I was done, I immediately went out and bought &quot;Pride of Lions&quot; just to keep the story going. Great book from a great author. Also, I agree with the other reviewer who suggested that this would make an even better movie than &quot;Braveheart&quot;. It would be perfect for Liam Neeson."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book is for sure in my typ 3 favorites.. It is dramatic, Action pacted, and puts out emotion to the extreams, throughout every chapter.

I love this book and have read it several times. The only thing I would change is the HORRIBLE back cover! The amount of laughter people have had at my expense because of the back cover is almost unbearable and I am certain it has driven many away from reading it.I am truly torn between wanting to see this brought to the big screen and my fear of what Hollywood would do to it..."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I don't know who the target is for books like this, but I found it painfully bad. As a student of Irish history, I can tell you this book is not only poorly written but historically inaccurate. Not that perfect accuracy should be the goal of a fiction writer, but how about making an attempt at being accurate as well as entertaining? The book rambles on and on with little motivation for the character's actions or substance in the writing. Some of the passages are just laugh-out-loud ridiculous.\\"His face looked like a linen napkin\\" Really? What does that mean? It was in someone's lap? It was covered in gravy?The author makes use of (often misspelled) Gaelic words throughout, but doesn't include a glossary. Are we supposed to be impressed? It just makes the sentences awkward.Avoid this book at all costs.If you want authentic, well-written historical fiction, stick with Pressfield or Rutherford. I just wish I'd read this one first before I'd ordered more by the same author."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I have read many celtic fantasy books, none compare to the works of Morgan Llywelyn. I have read most of her work, but I have been fortunate enough to have read her works sequentially starting with Bard and following the chronology to Lion of Ireland, and Pride of Lions, and in so doing, have gotten a deeper appreciation for being Irish. I love Ireland although I have never set foot on her, Morgan Llyweln has brought Ireland to me. Through The Lion of Ireland I was able to walk on the Hill of Tara, touch the Stone of Fal. and fight for What is Irish. We truly need this kind of work to continue. Morgan Llywelyn is a genius, bringing to life all that is Irish. She is our present day Bard."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Morgan Llywelyn has much talent as a writer and there there are times when she shines. However, overall this novel lacks some luster. As is the general flaw in her work, Llywelyn seems to lose pace halfway through the novel and closes in an anti-climax. However, the deepest flaw in this novel is her description of battle scenes. Many times they are glossed over in summary and when she does write in detail of war she doesn't seem to grasp the grit and grime that was inevitable in the these life and death struggles. In other words, she tends to romantacize the battle sequences. In addition, the characters in the novel seem uni-dimentional and inconsistent. We are left without a clear understanding of Boru's motives and personality that seem schizophrenic at times. All in all, though, its an entertaining read based on an historical period that is fascinating."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"After visiting Ireland, I have longed to go back. Since I was not going back to Ireland in the immediate future, I picked up this book and hoped I could get a taste of Ireland. I definitely was not disappointed. I could see the rolling, green hills, feel the morning mist, and smell the fresh Irish air while I was reading this book. I miss Ireland and I will read Morgan Llywelyn's books until I go back."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is Llywelyn's best work. Anyone interested in pre-Norman Ireland and Celtic history will enjoy this book. She has a very engaging writing style, and weaves fact and fiction into a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I have read and reread this book several times since I was a teenager. It is an epica tale about a man who was the last king to unite Ireland. Historical ficton at its best. Every time I read it I think what a great movie it would make.I recommend it to anyone that likes historical fiction, irish history, or kings who cannot be forgotten."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"If you are interested in one of the most fascinating figures in Irish history, or just want another good book about the Viking Age, I highly recommend Lion of Ireland.The novel tells the story of Brian Boru, perhaps the greatest Irish king who ever lived. He ruled at the end of the Tenth Century, during a time when Norse and Danish Vikings controlled large portions of Ireland, including the Viking towns of Limerick and Dublin. Rich with natural resources and monasteries laden with silver, Ireland had lured the Vikings for two centuries, but their reign ended in large part because of Brian Boru.The story begins when an eight-year old Brian, the youngest son of the King of Dal Cais, discovers his homestead burned and his mother and two of his brothers slain by Vikings. Brian's hatred of the Vikings fuels his ambition. As a grown man, he leads skirmishes against the Limerick Vikings , luring many to their death, and in time becomes the King of Munster and ultimately High King (Ard Ri) of all of Ireland.Llwelyn's Boru is a hero much like Braveheart's William Wallace, faced with as many enemies among the kings of Ireland as he has among the Danes and Norse. The novel is filled with treachery, intrigue, and conflicts, perhaps none more interesting than Brian's volatile relationship with the sensual and cunning Irish queen Gormlaith. Her beauty transfixes Brian, and \\"looking into her face, he sees Ireland itself.\\"In Gormlaith, however, Brian finds more than he bargained for. By the time they wed, she was already famous, having previously married two of Brian's rivals: Olaf Cuaran, the Viking King of Dublin who left her a widow, and Malachi Mor, the High King of Ireland before Boru claimed the throne. Gormlaith also was the mother of Sitric Silkbeard, who succeeded Olaf as King of Dublin, and her fiery relationship with Brian ends up threatening the kingdom he has fought so hard to unite. For her son wants Brian dead, and to kill him Sitirc gathers a Viking army for a battle that will decide the fate of Ireland."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This tenth century novel is based on Irish history with the space between actual historical events filled in by the literary skill, imagination, and conception of the author. In a period when Norsemen and Danes frequently invaded Ireland, Brian Boru and his Queens unite the tribes and minor kings of Ireland to put a brutal end to these invasions. Written in a fast-moving entertaining style, the book has all the ingredients of a 5-star piece of work."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"PRO: The prose is smooth and flows quickly. The detailed sense of history is outstanding.CON: I wished the pacing was a bit faster.CONCLUSION: This is not a fantasy novel, but rather one of historical fiction about Brian Boru, who rose to power in Ireland over 1,000 years ago. If you're into medieval history and Irish history, this is your book!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book, just like her others, is a triumph in bardic tale. It is captivating and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The Lion of Ireland is the first book I ever read concerning Irish history, beginning a life-long study. Ms. Llywelyn is certanly a good writer, and from what I researched concerning the &quot;real&quot; Brian Boru she sticks to the history. The only negative point I can make is the heave-handed romance that seems to be throughout the book. Be that as it may, Lion of Ireland is still a great read!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Since I got the book for either free or 99 cents I can't complain.

The life of Brian and the history that made Ireland."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book is one of those you can't put down, it tells the story of Brian Boru Irelands first king of how when he was a boy he watched his people be butchered by the Norse men and swore to end their reign of terror. It also tells about the women he loved, from a druidess onto a women who was too wild for everyone named Gormlaith. A women who managed to drive her norseman husband into a monastery, this would be a red flag for any guy. It goes onto talk about how he died, one version is he died at prayer at the hands of the norsemen the other is he fought to the death. This is definitely a good read."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Although it is a novel, you find yourself stirred to emotion by the celtic warrior within. If you have a shred of it you will know the your ancestors and feel honored to be descended of their efforts."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Loved the history lesson embellished with a love story and family dynamics! Interesting perspective on an early period of invasions and fights for independence as a nation. Bought this from Amazon.com after reading this authors book. 1949. Which depicts a much later period in Ireland."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"A fantastic journey through the magical-mists of Ireland into the realm of its first king. Morgan Llywellyn surely must have walked the land in the time of Brian Boru to have been able to capture the essence of that era. It will always remain the most prized book in my library."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"One of the best novels I have ever read. In fact I read this novel before the release of the movie Braveheart.I couldn't help but wonder if the movie pilfered Lion of Ireland as its screenplay and replaced Brian B. with William Wallace. Morgan is owed royalties."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"An historic novel that's heavy in history, but unsatisfying as a novel. The history may be accurate, but it's doubtful that the detail presented is anymore than a few facts and a lot of conjecture. There arre some interesting characters, but the conclusions of many of the sub-plots are left dangling. The book moved well and held my interest."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is a history of Ireland told in an adventurous manner. History can be so boring not this time.

Great story. Author brings this man's life to life. I dont read a bunch but this book will be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This is a tale of history and legends as it focuses upon the origins of Brian Boru, the Charlemagne of Ireland who unified most of the Emerald Isle against the Norsemen and more importantly the bickering of petty Irish lords. It's on the slow side at first as we focus on Boru's early years but stick with it and it will pick up. There's a great deal of focus on the political intrigues, the bigger than life presence of Brian Boru and Boru's inner thoughts. The writing is lyrical and the imagery is breathtaking. Since our understandings of Boru are quite limited the author gets to take a creative license with some of the legends. STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; HISTORICAL FEEL: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN READ: April to July 2011."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Brian Boru is an Ireland prince who has big plans for himself and Ireland. Tenth century Ireland is a very volatile and violent place with Vikings raiding and pillaging and the Irish fighting each other. Brian dreams of uniting Irish clans and sending the Vikings elsewhere to pillage and plunder.

I highly recommend this look at Ireland's history."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Having just finished reading Morgan Llywelyn's book, Lion of Ireland, in preparation for a first trip to Ireland, my Irish blood is heated up and ready for the trip! I have longed to visit the home of my ancestors for many years, and with knowledge gained from reading this book about Brian Boru, early High King (Ard Ri), I feel that I will appreciate my journey much more than I would have without it. Very few books can bring me to tears, but this one did, which is high praise from me, a tough critic. Thank you, Morgan Llywelyn!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The reviews for this book were promising so I decided to pick it up. I was not disappointed. Having lived in Ireland for a short time I was interested in learning more of the ancient history of the island and this book was a fun way to do that.

I wasn't sure what to expect of Brian Boru's life, I'd only heard of him as the name of a few bars ... and maybe a couple drinking songs. His story and that of Ireland make you proud to be of such a strong culture and heritage."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"This book is great. It explains, like no other book, the fighting spirit of the Irish. I never understood it but now I do.

Llywelyn has easily become my favorite author. THIS IS A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I have just finished reading this interesting book. It has accurate facts about Brian Boru's life, from his humble beginnings to his ultimate victory. While I truely enjoyed reading this book I found that Brian was too good to be true as a real person. His hatred towards the northmen is too exaggerated for the time as the vikings were becoming a true part of Irish society. However I see that it is all necessary for the dramatic tension of the novel and a little historical fantasy does not go astray. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in Irelands pre Norman history. A fascinating read!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"To anyone who tries to compare this book to the story of 'Braveheart'....these are two totally different men in two distinctly different countries. They had the same ambitions and integrity, but that is where the comparison ends. The Scottish can be pround of William Wallace, and the Irish should be just as pround of Brian Boru. And we should all feel both proud and priviledged to have a fine storyteller as Morgan L. in our midst. Hopefully this will move other writers to follow her example, as well as any authority figures to follow the example of Brian Boru. BORU! BORU! BORU!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I came across this book by accident. I was browsing the store for something new to read and the title caught my eye.

Whether you are male or female, 12 years old or 100, a lover or a fighter, a true fan of rich, historlical legends, a die-hard fantasy fan or anything in between, if you read only one more book in your life, read LION OF IRELAND. It is a long, hard, fast-paced, breath-taking, passionate ride through the life of Brian Boru. And as I ride alongside this man through his battles, both horrific and herioc, I find it quite difficult to believe that His actual life could have been more eventful, or more fullfilling. Nor could I imagine it any less. If you read this book, and are of Irish descent, you will never feel more proud than after you read this book. If you aren't Irish, you will certainly find yourself longing to be. This tale fed my obsession with Irish lore, and Ireland Herself. I can only hope to achieve this quality of writing, and for once in my life, was more than happy to just sit back on the sidelines and read. Again and again. Thank you, M.L."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The carry-me-away interest that Mary Stewart and Marion Zimmer Bradley accomplished in their Arthurian novels of Britain, Ms. Llywelyn failed to achieve for Ireland in the Dark Ages with this book. Frankly, the Wikipedia entry for Brian Boru was more interesting and a lot clearer, despite the difficult Celtic names.A good historical novel engages my interest by giving me a broad sense of the culture, events, and environment in which the book is set. This book feels very generic to me: insert hero into chaotic situation, he fights many battles against cruel oppressors, makes love to several women, wins the coveted position, then dies gloriously. It has none of the crofts and countryside, food and ferries, that infuse Stewart's books on the period; nor the feeling for the religious controversy of the Bradley books."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Won't waste your time with a rundown of the story. Just wanted to say that the saga of Brian Boru is compelling, and the writing transports you to 10th century Ireland -- its battles, its hardships, its pleasures, its climate, you get the idea. Despite being removed from the characters by 1000 years, I still related to them and cared greatly about them. Plus, I think I learned a little Irish history along the way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"The Lion of Ireland tells the story of a Young Brian of Boruma and his rise through the rankings following his dreams of ruling Ireland and beridding it of all Foreigners. All Brian's childhood he looked up at his eldest brother Mahon with awe and respect. Brian later found himself despising Mahon's beliefs and techniques. Brian breaks away from Mahon's army and starts his own band of warriors. Brian learns to show hiw strength not only on the battlefield but at the discussion tables. He pushes himself not only to be stronger but smarter than his foes. Brian becomes an image of Mahon after Mahon is killed. He thinks for his people rather than by the edge of a sword. Brian's biggest battles aren't against the northman or meathmen, but against his closest friends, family, and loved ones. Him and his eldest son Murrough have the biggest conflict. Murrough is just like Brian at a young age so Brian finds himself fighting with himself. The book takes the reader through all the perilous adventures and battles and all the scandalous and seductive women with so much decription its like your next Brian Boru himself willing him on. Morgan Llywelyn tells of the glorious past of Ireland and the great people who roamed the hills and left their mark there. An overall great book for the adventure hungry minds!!"},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"Morgan Llywelyn presents an historical novel of epic proportions in her triumphant &quot;Lion of Ireland.&quot; Each page will grip the reader and leave you wanting more. In an updated style still reminiscent of her beloved bards and seanchai, Llywelyn presents this classic Irish legend in a thoroughly modern and accessible format. Truly a treasure."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I was a Morgan Llywelyn fan before I read it, but it was this book that sealed it for me. I gobbled this book up it was a quick entertaining read that clued me into some of the more ancient Irish history that I really didn't know about. As with most historical fiction this book will be contested by folks who claim they \\"know better\\" but this book works really hard to captures the soul of a king that could not be held back it chronicles his adventures, successes, failures, and the loves of his life. I enjoyed the vivid descriptions she gave of the battles that Brian Boru fought. It also gave a surprising account of Viking history and mythology to go along with the mystique of the Irish which is ever-present in many of her books. A great read."},{"Title":"Lion of Ireland","review":"I had read this book when i was only 13, although the content was a LITTLE too mature for me. I still loved it, I hadven't missed a year of not reading it at least once. &quot;Lion..&quot; has introduced me to the worlds Llywelyn paints and i have remained faithful to her since i was a kid. Ive read every book she has ever published (Good and bad ;) ). Ive recommended this book to everyone. Anyone, not only interested in Celtic or Irish history, but history in general would greatly appreciate this book. The people who gave it anything less than &quot;five stars&quot; must either dislike the Irish or have something against a good book!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I love stories like this. Someone comes up with a harebrained, or possibly a brilliant, idea, such as reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica (Know-It-All), watching a movie in a different theater every day for a year (A Year at the Movies), or eating nothing but fast food for one month (Super Size Me). What kind of obsessed people are these? Maybe I wouldn't take on these crazy projects myself, but I can't resist their stories.Julie Powell doesn't seem obsessive at all, a little prone to mood swings perhaps, and depressed that her job as a temp secretary in Manhattan is so-o-o-o boring and that she is approaching age thirty before she is quite ready for it. Her husband Eric, whose even temper is the perfect counterpoint to Julie's emotional peaks and valleys, suggests that she a) go to cooking school, and b) visit her family in Austin. Julie sensibly takes his advice to get away for a while and rediscovers her mother's forty-year-old copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Why spend money for cooking school when Julia Child has already developed a course in her classic cookbook? An idea begins to form. . .Eric, not only supportive, but also full of good ideas, further suggests that Julie keep a blog of her project, an original idea in 2002. The project has rules now: all the recipes must be completed within one year and she has to post on her blog every day.When I heard about this book, I thought it would be a fun read about Julie's adventures and misadventures in French cooking. It turned out to be rather more than that. It would have been easy enough for Julie to just flesh out her blog a bit and turn it into a book. Instead, she weaves in partly true stories about her friends and family, partly true stories about Julia Child and her husband Paul, and snippets from Samuel Pepys's diaries. Since Julie's temp job is connected with the aftermath of September 11, that hangs in the background as well."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"This book was fun to read and delivered quite a few chuckles. It's a light, quick read to take with on vacation. You do not have to know much about cooking to enjoy this book, but if personal memoirs from an every day young female (note--very different than a history figure's autobiography), swearing, or neurosis are never your thing, then you will not enjoy this book. (Although, some of the reviewers dissing Julie's neurosis seem to have their own problem coughTypeAcough).This book has encouraged me to read up on Julia's life more and to try some French recipes at home. I am a newer home cook than Julie was, and I didn't realize until about a year ago how therapuetic cooking can be--it will erase all memories of a bad day, especially if you throw on some good music in the background and turn your cell phone off. I have done a couple of similar spontaneous, manic projects like Julie's before--most of them have involved fundraising or at-home organizing, though, and I also have PCOS and am going to turn 30 in a year.I thought the book was strangely organized with not much talk about the act of cooking in the first two thirds--only passive agressive accounts about Julie's marriage, friends' personal lives, job, etc. I feel like Julie wants someone to yell at her, \\"Julie, you DO need to lose twenty pounds,\\" \\"Julie, you DO need to get laid,\\" or Julie, \\"you DO need to find a new career.\\" It's unclear at the end if she acheieved the first two, but, congrats to her on completing her project and becoming a successful writer. Maybe someone telling her to solve her problems straight up wouldn't even be the answer anyways--I know this hasn't worked for me in the past, and self-improvement has to be something you decide to do only for yourself one day. The passive agression was pretty annoying at times, but this book taught me to always believe that you can change your life with hard work and to be more direct with those around you. Everyone can be a victim of passive agression. I guess . . . . I just think that Julie looks down on her friends, while she is trying to pat herself on the back for claiming not to judge them. I assume she was initially trying to compare her life to theirs to explain what does not go on in the life of one who marries her high school sweetheart. Sometimes I wish she had dug deeper into the cobwebs of her life for us, than those of her friends. Maybe this was supposed to reiterate how empty her life felt before she completed the project.Julie knew when to persevere in her project and when to make things a bit easier, practical. Her COMPLETETION of a project in a horribly inperfect world of a tiny, messy kitchen, long working hours followed by long at-home hours, and an uncertainty of the future is what actually equaled perfection in the end. In the end, I felt about Julie as Julie feels about Julia--I wanted to strangle her a couple of times, but I really needed her for some new life lessons and laughs.This is a memoir--it is not fully a cooking memoir, though. Any historical figure and talent could have replaced Julia and cooking. I would think those who want to read more about the cooking tasks should check out her blog--Julie couldn't write a 1000 page novel."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

However, being a young working woman myself, I felt like this memoir was closer in substance to a conversation that I might have at the bar after three martinis with a good friend than publishable material. While I really enjoy good, if somewhat trite conversation with close friends over martinis, I don't enjoy plopping down cash for it, unless that cash is for said drinks. This work very much needed an editor, as I found it hard to believe that the author was thirty years old, and not something much closer to my own age of twenty-three (but I guess it just goes to show that age is nothign but a number.)I was advised often in writing classes in college to keep a journal as a method of finding my own voice - with the instruction to read it over again at a later date and critique. Ms. Powell's book has all of the markings of a writer who takes no time for objective critiquing of their own work. What may have seemed at the time to be witty or cute or, in the case of her tantrums, completely justifiable, may come off to the general public as childish and crass. When we write about our selves, we must be very careful to edit for these reasons, and while most of the time it is fine to not care what the general public thinks, it's very important to care when one is writing for them. So, all in all, I wasn't bored, but I really really wish I'd checked this out from the library."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It would have been a charming book if the author had written only about her endeavors in the kitchen. Instead, we were subjected to an in-depth examination of her mundane life, to include discussion of her body hair and odor. That she injected her political leanings into the book was additionally unforgivable. I did not like the author. She struck me as unmotivated, unfocused, undisciplined, and, judging by the maggot episode, crack house filthy. Under these circumstances, the potty talk simply wasn't funny-it just screamed \\"no class, no talent.\\" She whined endlessly about her job working for an unnamed agency involved in providing post-9/11 services in New York City--she found no honor in this public service and seemed to disparage her co-workers as unenlightened. I found her attitude toward her job deeply offensive.

It's so yummy and cheesy and you just can't stop and you really should stop and you kind of slow down and then you feel full and then you have another handful and then you fold up the bag and start to put it where you can't reach it and then you eat another handful and feel kind of yucky and then you wish you'd never seen those Cheetos ever because they weren't really that good to begin with. You don't eat Cheetos again for a long time.

Certainly some of the recipes in \\"Mastering\\" are complicated and even fussy, but the majority are not; they're just good and exceptionally well-written, half a century after Julia Child set out to make French food accessible for American cooks. Julie Powell, however, emphasizes the really complicated recipes (and resulting mishaps)---that's what sells books--and her kitchen catastrophes ultimately give a downright misleading impression of what Julia Child was all about, which was encouraging people to think that they too could cook delicious food. Forego the book for the movie, but take the ten bucks you would have spent on \\"Julie and Julia\\" and put them toward the ingredients for Julia Child's duckling with orange sauce or her chicken fricassee or her creme caramel.

Julie Powell is whiny - yes. She is self-absorbed - yep. She can be a bit of a jerk - absolutely. But she is also real and hysterically funny. If the haters who gave this book a bad review didn't catch the self-deprecation in her language....I don't know what to say. I thought her tone was crystal clear, presenting herself honestly in all her imperfect glory. One reviewer complained that she's mean to her husband. I mean, geez...raise your hand and give yourself a halo if you've never snapped at your spouse. There were complaints about the profanity: really??? A light smattering of f-bombs equals extreme obscenity? Who knew?Like I said above, do not expect this to be a cookbook in any form. You will not learn to cook a thing - not even boil water - from this book. You will, however, be highly entertained by Julie's antics and fits - her struggles with aspic in particular, as she transforms from a girl who won't eat anything (EVER!) to slurping down poached eggs in beef jelly.

Living","review":"I picked this up at the library after hearing from a family member that she really enjoyed the movie. Being someone who is skeptical of movie adaptations of books, I figured I had better read the original first. Actually, that's incorrect; if I wanted to read the original, I would have read her blog. Red flag #1: books based on blogs. This should have prepared me for the self-centered, arrogant, whiny-ness to come.For the record, I love food and reading about food, and I hate chick lit. What I hate even more than chick lit is chick lit disguised as food writing, which is just a travesty. Guess which category \\"Julie & Julia\\" falls into. The premise of \\"Julie & Julia\\" is a 29-year old secretary in a dead-end job realizing she has accomplished nothing in her life, and so she takes on the task of cooking her way through \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in a year. Chapters are interspersed with fictionalized vignettes about Paul Child and how he met Julia, but these are written so amateurishly that they add nothing to the book; they probably even knocked it down a notch in my opinion. What it's really about is Julie Powell whining (and whining, and whining...) about her crappy government agency job, throwing fits of hysteria over pretty much everything, crying, swearing at her husband, and going into tangents about her friends' boyfriends and sexual escapades. It makes you wonder if she hasn't got some kind of bipolar disorder to go along with her hormonal \\"syndrome.\\" Every once in a while, we're treated to a nugget about actual cooking, usually when she fails to do something correctly (cue the screaming and crying). She deliberately paints this unpleasant picture of herself, but there's self-degrading (which can be charming and funny; see: Tina Fey), and then there's just pathetic. So many times I wanted to grab her by the shoulders, slap her across the face, and yell, \\"GROW THE F*** UP.\\"I have to admit, I enjoyed this all in the beginning, and was able to get through the book pretty quickly, but by the end I was groaning at Julie's tiresome immaturity, culinary ineptitude, anger-management issues, and above all, her being rewarded for all of it with a cushy book deal. And there lies the biggest problem I have with this book: a blogger does not a writer make. I mean, it's a pretty bad sign when the author can't even explain why she started \\"The Project\\" in the first place. After recently reading \\"Heat,\\" a food memoir which was not only ABOUT FOOD (whaddya know!) but also humorous and insightful, \\"Julie & Julia\\" just couldn't compete. What's worse is the end chapter, \\"Cleaving,\\" which is included in later editions of the book. I'll sum it up for you: it's a few years later and the same narcissistic Julie, but now she works at a butcher shop, still thinks she's some kind of renegade bad-ass (I literally rolled my eyes when she made a point of saying her iPod was \\"blaring Modest Mouse\\". We get it. You're hip. Now get over yourself, already.), and tries to muse poetically about life or serenity or inner peace -- I don't remember, my eyes were glazing over at this point-- all the while covered in blood and beef liver. It fails to tie up any loose ends (and actually manages to introduce a few more) or offer any more insight to the book or redeem her unsympathetic character. I strongly urge you to pretend these last few pages don't exist. (EDIT: I found out later that this was an excerpt from Powell's newest book, \\"Cleaving\\")All in all, Powell tries to sell us something mundane (her boring life) by spicing it up a little (the \\"Project\\") and distracting us with some fancy sauce (over-writing, a tendency to fall flat when waxing philophical, and liberal swearing), but unfortunately it all comes together about as well as her poached eggs in aspic."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I think it has much more in common with the best \\"chick lit\\" (think Jennifer Weiner) than it does with food memoirs. As a married woman nearing her 30th birthday, I found myself connecting in so many ways to Julie's story. I recognize her anxiety over a seemingly dead-end job, the desire to keep up with your peers when it comes to fashion and flair, and the dreaded biological clock that keeps ticking even when you're not sure how you keep yourself alive from day to day.No, this book is not really about the cooking, it is much more than that. It's about a real woman finding her own personal happiness- Julie herself points to the true joy she found by being wrapped in Julia's world for a little while everyday. Real women drink, swear, mess up recipes, spill things on countertops, and, yes, we whine too. But Julie also writes about her real capacity for love- especially her love for her husband, family, friends and the great Julia Child.While Julia may not have approved of Julie, I certainly do. As so many reviewers have pointed out it may be a generational thing and I can support that. Every book is not for everyone, but I found it refreshing that Julie could be honest enough to document all her imperfections and failures along with her successes. I also hope that it brings the real life persona of Julia Child back to many of us who were too young to really understand what it was that made her so special."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"In anticipation of the movie by the same name and by a serendipitous sale while on a trip to a local bookseller I ended up with a copy of this entertaining memoir. I had not heard of The Project before seeing the film trailer. And once I saw the film trailer I was completely in love with the idea and the intersecting stories of the two women on separate but intertwined journeys. Buying the book seemed like the absolute best idea. Before I continue, though, I need to toss out some caution flags. Caution number one...based on the subject matter and charming cover you'd never guess this book would be full sexuality. It is. I'm guessing if you tossed a few seasons of Sex in the City into a crock-pot, added several chapters of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and folded in a few trade chick-lits, a tablespoon of assorted spices, and a few cups of wine you'd end up with a dish of Julie and Julia en croute.In example, regarding Caution One, two friends actively engaged or toying with adultery, a friend with erotic dreams and lack of filter, a heroine who seems at the edge of her very sanity several times, raw, naked, food, mastering and manipulating and enjoying said food, a move, a despised job not to mention a syndrome and a biological clock clanging on the cusp of a thirtieth birthday, well, all lend themselves to frequent F-bombs and much sexual conversation and shared thoughts.Caution Number Two. I expected more Julia. Julia isn't absent but a bit anemic and in a ratio of about 10% Julia, 90% Julie. Julie's life is definitely one that kept me turning pages, sometimes with apprehension, but turning nonetheless. But if you are seeking half and half or heavy on the Julia you might be disappointed.Julie is clever and writes some terrific sentences. Some of her descriptions are deliciously hysterical. One little tidbit about her poor, sweet husband as a butter mule brought tears to my eyes. Also, Julie gets a little or a lot political and is definitely not a fan of religion and/or God depending on the rants I encountered. Anger, though amusing much of the time, still comes across as anger and added a bitter aftertaste. I loved Eric and the fact that though there were times I wondered if their marriage would survive the slinging, the cursing, the thoughts, in the light of day Julie always managed to find the good and the right in her marriage and attempted to speak positively about her husband, painting him as an unconventional hero.Sarcasm lovers. Those who like underdog stories wherein beaten down and depressed person picks self up by boot straps and through some quirky, self-imposed lifestyle choice ends up changing need to look further into Julie and Julia. The unfolding story is a painful process to watch. But there is something grandly delicious about the final multicourse meal on the cosmic table of a hard won success. Though a thick fuzzy blanket of dust lies beneath the dining room table covering and spiderwebs bind the candle sconces to the wall and each other, though the sink gurgles in protest and the pans cover all available space in the kitchen, the meal ends up being very much like life. Delicious and decadent mixed with sparse and stringy, washed down with joy and tears, and shared with people just as stinking messy."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

However, her condescending and unsympathetic tone toward anyone who does not share her personal worldview, political stance, or dress sense was extremely off-putting; and while I am not the most reverent person myself, I found a lot of the narrative to be excessively crass.____All that said, the biggest problem this story has is that the protagonist is not terribly relatable( okay I know it's nonfiction, but still). Sure lots of us have tedious jobs, are less than tidy, make ghastly mistakes in recipes, and have occasional hissy fits; but this gal takes it all to the extreme. The sarcasm and bitterness about her \\"government drone\\" job are unpleasant. Her descriptions of her housekeeping (or lack thereof) are pretty horrifying. (Really, how many people end up with maggots under their dish drainer!) Everyone makes cooking or baking mistakes at some point, but the sheer number of times this author has problems because SHE DIDN'T BOTHER READING THROUGH THE FLIPPIN' RECIPE FIRST is incredibly annoying. Then, on top of all this, she is constantly whingeing and moaning about one or another of the aforementioned issues...either that or totally freaking out and getting hysterical. I kept wishing she would get on medication already (not that drugs are the answer, but geez, it might be worth a try)!____One final note: she does say f*** way too much. :)"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Then I read the book. Though it was a fast read and there were some good parts, I didn't care for her personal views of politics, society, friends, or Washington, D.C.Nevertheless, I have been inspired to drink gimlets, never attempt the feats of French cooking, and realize people are just different.I was happy to read and finish the book but it isn't something I would run out and share with others."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I'm now three fourths of the way through this interesting, yet tiresome rant.* My partner blogs and I'm used to the sardonic tone that many bloggers have adopted. That said, Julie's endless, over-the-top rants about her life in New York are too much. I'm fairly left-leaning in most of my politics, but I'm also a professionally-minded adult who can handle working with anyone. I agree with other commenters that if Ms. Powell was so sick of working with Republicans, than she should have been an adult and found another job. I also agree that many of the accounts seem exaggerated and I keep questioning her authenticity as I continue to read. A little less \\"snark\\" would make this a far more enjoyable read.*I've since finished the book and all I can hope for is a few dollars from Half Price Books...if they will take it.

It is not about cooking, and as everyone else has said, foodies will not like it. It is not inspiring, and there is nothing to identify with. You can't even root for the author.

The screenplay writers did an excellent job turning a sow's ear into a silk purse (or reasonable fascimile of it.)I barely made it through the first chapter without wanting to just throw the book across the room. Turns out Julie Powell was a whiner far earlier in the book than she was in the movie. At least in the movie, some of the whining is charming. In the book it is not at all charming. You just want to smack her and yell, grow up already! In comparison, Julia's memoir is far more interesting, and while Julia definitely had her moments, it was clear she was far more emotionally mature than Julie. No wonder Julia blew off Julie and her blog."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"OK, if you want to be a writer, then write--don't let endless pop-cultural references do the work for you (\\" . . . his expression blank like a character on South Park before delivering a punch-line\\", or references to the movie Airplane, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Meryl Streep in \\"The Hours\\", and many, many others). Don't assume your readers have seen every movie you've seen, or watched every TV show you've watched. Even though I got most of her references and could form a mental picture of what she was trying to describe, it was rather annoying. I kept thinking, \\"This is the best description you could manage? Can you really be this lazy and still get published? What's happened to the publishing industry?\\" Lazy, BAD writing, with only an occasional humorous remark--most of them lose their humor for their mean-spirited delivery or whining tone. Unfortunately, when not relying heavily on pop-culture references, there is frequent lapsing into over-writing and just trying way too hard. The middle ground would have been preferable. One quickly notices a significant lack of anything resembling depth here.I also wonder, like other reviewers, if perhaps the author could expand her vocabulary a bit beyond expletives. She came across as coarse, unimaginative, and emotionally immature. The end result is anything but a journey of the soul. It's just time spent with someone who comes across as highly dysfunctional, not very likable, and in serious need of an Alcoholics Anonymous group. Their lives sound pathetic, even as we go on what could have been a really fascinating journey of growth and introspection. This is just a bitch-fest that leaves one wanting to send a condolence card to her \\"sainted\\" husband, Eric.She begins early in the book describing a clearly mentally-ill woman in a subway station, who is hitting her head on the concrete as simply, \\"The Loon\\". Not a trace of compassion or empathy, just a dehumanizing, nasty descriptor, repeated numerous times. This narcissist simply saw in that person the set up for her own whining about her life. This made me cringe, and should have been the tip-off, the red flag, telling me this is not someone with whom I want to spend my valuable reading time. I should have listened to my gut in the first chapter.If you want to read about food and cooking, read Julia Child, herself, or I highly recommend anything by M.F.K. Fisher.Will definitely skip Powell's next book . . . and any subsequent ones. You might want to do the same."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I decided to read the book first, since that's usually better than the movie turns out to be. I hope for everyone's sake that the movie is better. Things I didn't like about the book:1) I felt like I was reading a blog. I don't waste time reading self-important blogs day after day (so why did I finish the book?!).2) I'm a liberal (upstate NY), but I felt the constant republican bashing was completely irritating.3) The messy kitchen. A maggot infestation and food smeared on the walls is not normal.4) Frankly (and this will make people question why I would even pick up the book), the French cooking. I'm not a \\"foodie\\". Most of the recipes (no, I've never eaten kidneys and don't plan to) and the excessive use of butter made me nauseous to even read. I guess I won't be buying any of Julia Child's cookbooks either.I didn't mind the cursing. It was a quick read and I did finish the book. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, though.

Living","review":"This book grew out of a blog. I've read hundreds of blogs, and they are either blogs by really boring people sharing excruciatingly dull details of their uninteresting lives, or blogs with a theme. Luckily, this book falls into the latter category.Julie Powell is a good writer, no doubt. Her year-long project, cooking her way through Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" is a great subject for a blog. How could this book NOT get five stars?I really enjoyed reading about Julia's life--her courtship of, and marriage to, Paul Child, and her emergence as a world-class chef. Powell does a good job with weaving Julia's story through the book, and she doesn't split her story with Julia's 50/50, which is what I had expected. Instead, she uses her Julia anecdotes like seasoning, or a thoughtfully-chosen fine wine.Also, she peppers the book with references to \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and its creator, Joss Whedon. We're big Buffy fans in this house (some, like my husband and daughter, moreso than others) and it was really fun to run across Buffy-related comments. Powell also mentions Max Brooks's \\"Zombie Outbreak Survival Guide\\" in her recommended reading list, which is my youngest son's all-time most favorite book in the entire world, so that was cool.Those things were enjoyable.What I did NOT like about the book was Powell's snarkiness. At first it was amusing to read these little asides about her co-workers, but then it started to grate on me. Powell works as a secretary for a government agency during this cooking project, and part of her job involves sifting through suggestions for a 9/11 memorial. People from all over would send her their ideas, and she has to sort through them--which sounds really depressing. But she actually mocks these submissions, and the grief-stricken people who took the time to mail them in. She also has nothing but contempt for fellow employees who don't share her party affiliation. It's very interesting that she views herself as an open-minded person, and yet is such an unrepentant snob. Maybe she thinks she HAS to be mean, living in New York and all, or maybe she thinks this cattiness is cute.I don't know. I am glad I read the book, but I'm also glad I don't move in the same circles as Powell. At one point, she learns that Julia Child has heard about her project, and that Child was \\"a pill\\" when the topic was brought up.Hmmm....kind of like her protegee."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Flippant, ignorant about food and cooking techniques, Ms. Powell is hardly the person to be taken as an expert on food, even if she did cook a lot of Julia Child's recipes (and yet Bon Appetit and other publications, including The Washington Post, are falling all over themselves offering Ms. Powell writing assignments--it goes to show how much such publications really do seek new, fresh voices in food writing--take note, all you food writers out there!).

After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I enjoyed the movie and was thinking of getting a copy of this book as a gift for my sister. I'm glad that I read it at the library first. The book is nothing at all like the movie.What made the movie work is that it was mostly the chronicle of Julia Child's rise to success. The book, however, is Julie Powell's whiny stream-of-thought rant about life in general, in which she fixates on a \\"project\\" of compulsively cooking her way through \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in one year.The book is laced with continuous vulgarity, profanity, and paragraph-long sentences, and goes into disgusting detail about various bodily fluids, plugged sinks and sewage, filth, cat hair-encrusted grime, sexual references, etc. I'm surprised that no one got violently sick eating anything that was cooked under such conditions. I'm not surprised when, toward the end of the book, it's revealed that the kitchen is crawling with a hidden nest of maggots. Whenever life gets hard, Julie always has a few f-bombs to throw around, heavily laced with drinking and bitching, and navel-gazing self-centered ruminations.About the only benefit of reading this book that it solved the mystery in the movie of why Julia Child disapproved of the apparent \\"honor\\" of being associated with such a person. Julia Child had far too much class to be associated with anything so crude and vulgar. In this book, you won't learn anything about her that you didn't already see in the movie, the book has maybe a dozen pages with brief vignettes about her early years with Paul. Julie Powell's \\"mentor\\" is a figment of her own imagination, and in her self-centered world, that's good enough.I see that the next book is going to be about Julie working in a butcher shop. The sample chapter included describes how Julie attempts to wait on a customer, with blood-begrimed hands and clothing, and how she finds it amusing when the customer objects. This is just another example of the crud that readers endure in the first book. I think I'll pass."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I agree with some of the other reviewers that there is less writing about food than I expected and the politics gets old. The whole democrats = virtuous & intelligent, republicans = evil & stupid motif is quite tiresome (not to mention ridiculously peurile) to this political independent.Now that I've remembered it, I will go back and finish this book.

While I've been disheartened with the overwhelming crop of boring memoirs based on a simple, NPR-ish premise (\\"All my Life for Sale\\" for instance), to this book, I thought I could relate. I was wrong. My first clue should have been in the bookstore, when I flipped to a few \\"sample\\" pages and found the text unrelated to food, or even the Julia project. As I started reading, I found this crawling memoir focuses on the mundane daily details of the life of an uninsightful 29-year-old who just happens to try this weird blog thing her husband puts her up to (which eventually leads to this book). When Julie has trouble poaching an egg in wine, missing are any details related to the food itself (did she spin the wine? use vinegar? what utencil did she use to remove the egg?). Rather, what the reader gets is an account of Julie's freakout, and how her husband came to comfort her (complete with details on the comforting thing he said, and how that comforting thing originally came from a movie). After the first few chapters I found myself skipping these parts, then found that most of the book is about Julie's typical little life. She does not learn anything or grow from the project (other than getting a book deal - how's that for life direction?), nor is the project ever really explained in detail. I kept wondering, \\"What order is she going in, if any?\\" \\"How far along is she?\\" Bits of Child's early biography is interspersed, but always followed by an annoying comparison (or contrast, rather) to Powell's own bio: \\"When Julia worked in Ceylon, she probably didn't even have a phone at her desk.\\" (A section that goes on to explain what Powell's day job at a government office entails, not really of any interest to readers wondering the best way to kill a lobster.) My advice: skip this book, unless you really love Bridget Jones, and instead read some real food writing (M.F.K. Fisher, Ruth Reichl), a cookbook, or Child's biography, Appetite for Life."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

However, the concept is flawed by poor execution, both in writing and in surface self-reflection by the author. Julia Child started off as an amateur cook who developed a thorough appreciation for food. I somehow expected that Julie Powell would go through a similar journey, one where she learns about the nuanced pleasure of food in the midst of her life's turmoils. What she offers instead is a consistent stream of stories about herself interspersed with her attempts to follow Child's recipes and her intrusive takes on Julia Child's personal life. No wonder Child refused to meet or talk with Powell.The book could have been much helped if Powell had considered that the food might be more interesting than herself. Instead, what is offered is a personal memoir that is like most other books cluttering the memoir section. The Julie/Julia notion is a conceit only without being integrated into the writing or Powell's final approach to food, which seems haphazard and too much of a fad. At best, Powell's book is a quick cute read but little more than that.In terms of the writing, Child's is far superior. There is joy for food and life throughout Child's piquant yet detailed explanations of French cuisine.

In the end, however, it's nothing more than something Powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms: a catastrophic hissy fit.

I delighted in every tale of preparing a dish and every flashback to Julia Child's story (passages taken from her autobiography) but I never found author Julie Powell herself to be charming at all. It seemed so clearly a ... how to put this ... girl-centric story -- my impression of what Sex and the City or Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants are probably like. I never want to hear another word about Julie Powell's ovary problems or crazy girlfriend problems or lust for David Straithairn. But I could read for hours about her travails with live lobsters or making ladyfingers soaked in amaretto to line a cake pan or digging marrow out of cow bones. It's as though the book had a split personality, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or something. Part of it was fascinating and part of it was excruciating. It reminded me of that Devil in the White City book from which I just drank in all the descriptions of building and operating the 1893 Chicago World's Fair while loathing all the side-story about the serial killer.

But I procrastinated until I saw the movie preview (in which Meryl Streep captures Julia Child *amazingly*). Now that I read the book... I have oddly mixed feelings.The real life story is simple enough: a young woman from New York City, stuck in a going-nowhere office job, decides to cook every single recipe from Julia Child'sMastering The Art of French Cooking, a cookbook that was probably on your mother's bookshelf, if not your own. (My mother didn't own a copy, but then Mom hated to cook; the Settlement Cookbook was more her speed. Or a stovetop dinner whose instructions began, \\"Just brown a pound of ground beef....\\")Anyway, Julie Powell blogged about her experiences, which gathered an avid following. This is the book version of the blog. Happily for the reader, this blog-to-book transition did not try to follow the \\"just print the blog\\" diary style used in, say,Waiter Rant. So it's eminently readable even if you've never looked at a web log in your life.If you'd asked me to rate this book halfway through, I'd probably have given it 5 stars. Julie is witty, and she draws you into her life -- not just into her kitchen. Maybe I didn't need to know about her medical conditions or her worries about turning 30 without getting pregnant, but it was okay. Because the beef marrowbone story, for example, put all the backstory into context and made me laugh aloud. (\\"Perhaps in 1961, when JC published MtAoFC, marrowbones hung off trees like greasy Christmas ornaments. But I did not live in 1961, nor did I live in France, which would have made things simpler. Instead, I lived in Long Island City, and in Long Island City, marrowbones are simply not to be had.\\")But perhaps Julie & Julia affected me like too much cream and butter in my food -- after a while, it was too much for one sitting. For one thing, there was less examination of the cooking experience (with a few good exceptions, such as killing lobsters) and a little too much about Julie's life and friends. It's a little like a singer whose voice you like, but who has a \\"sound\\" that is a bit too much to listen to for an entire album. Instead of being charmed by Julie's observations, I began to feel as though she was whining about her sex life, her apartment's plumbing, the love lives of the people around her -- and that threatened to chase me away. She's a good writer, really she is, so I kept going until the end... but by then, I found it almost depressing. I love to cook, too, but all that matters in your life is meeting a self-imposed arbitrary deadline?End result: I liked this book. I'm glad I read it. But I don't feel as though you MUST read it, and I will not press it upon you.

Julie Powell impulsively decides to give herself 1 year (circa 2004) to cook every recipe in the Julia Child tome Mastering the Art of French Cooking, all the while blogging each night about her experiences in executing this mission and gaining an interesting fan base.As she digs into each complicated and buttery recipes (the amounts of butter and cream and cheese are enough to raise your HDL--or is it LDL?) it becomes clearly therapeutic, comical and all consuming to the author. The subtitle suggests that her marriage was possibly in peril by The Project but all I can say is that her husband is unfailingly supportive and surprisingly non-critical (but then again why should he have been--he ate like a French king for a year). Husband is sent on many a errand to find such ingredients as bone marrow, and often times a team of quirky friends would deploy with him. This book is ultimately about someone who needed focus in her life to distract her from (1) seeming difficulty she may have in bearing children and (2) the mediocrity of her secretarial job, which happens to be at a governmental agency that dealt/deals with 911 victims and aftermath. Yes, she is at times unsympathetic to it all but her complaining is more of the type that everyone complains about their job and not directed at the victims. Imagine dealing with that daily for years, she's just complaining about her job like so many entry/low-mid level employees do. She makes her politcal leanings quite clear, being in the minority at her office and to me, The Project was a way to infuse her life with adventure and challenge in a way that her life wasn't at that point. Is it perfect prose? No and in fact I did skim some paragraphs that went on a bit in overspecifying cooking technique but that did not stop me from enjoying it for what it was--a young woman's journey to connect to her life somehow. The path that she chose, albeit an oily, buttery one, was definitely interesting and this was a good quick read. To be clear, this is NOT a Julia Child memoir, there are no recipes (anyone expecting that would be dissapointed and should just buy the MtFAoFC and get the butter out or a bio book). Yes, the protagonist is young so she slings back cocktails while she's cooking (hello, so did Julia!) and she's a crappy housekeeper.FYI--French women don't get fat but apparently American ones cooking French do!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It egotistically caught my eye because my name is Julia, then I read the synopsis and the idea of cooking through JC's French cook book seemed intriguing, plus I needed a book to read whilst lounging on the beach. I couldn't put it down. 2 days - didn't see a damn thing of Cornwall! Absolutely excellent. Julie's writing is really evocative of New York.

I love her writing style and I love all the f***s and the anti-republican slams. She's funny and witty and self-deprecating. Even after 300 pages it didn't get monotonous or irritating - but continued to make me laugh. I love food and cooking and am not in the least put out that it wasn't fully about cooking and more about her friends sex lives or her husband's headaches. She's not perfect and she doesn't do things perfectly - she's human and that's what I loved about the book. So, for all her f yous and her apartment filled with cat hair and her grotty bathroom - I loved it and can totally relate to it. I feel so much better about myself, my apartment and my cat and my life as a college educated secretary. Now, all I need is a project and a blog and I can get out of my overqualified secretarial job, too. I'm glad you succeeded Julie! I hope to read more from you in the future.

Mere mortal cooks would say \\"Surely you jest!\\" Not Julie Powell. She wasn't attempting to do this for fame (no stint on American Idol) or fortune. She set this goal for herself in an attempt to bring a little flavor (if you will) into her somewhat dull life.Did she accomplish this Olympic culinary feat and remain unscathed? You can hear all about it in her own voice in this delightful audio book edition.As many will recall, Powell kept an online diary of her progress in blog form. Readers were able to keep up with her achievements and disasters. Just as she probably never dreamed that she could master extracting marrow from a bone, she was probably unaware what an able, prolific writer she could be. Thus, her book offers additional insights into her shopping and cooking experiences, as well as descriptions of her patient, encouraging husband, and her own life.Everyone could use a little added spice.

This fact notwithstanding, I dove into this book over a vacation weekend and, though I enjoyed it, I wasn't as blown away as I had hoped. I thought many parts were laugh-out-loud funny and her use of obscenities I found quite natural, not at all forced, and I took no offense. I felt a bit squicked out with some of the sexual references but only because it was a work of fact, not fiction, and I don't really want to know these things about an author when he or she is writing in the first person. I also became quickly annoyed with the constant quirkiness of her friends and her brother, something that always gets on my pecs. They seemed a little too larger-than-life and I couldn't help but wonder just what kind of embellishment they had received. What I did enjoy was her writing style as it seemed very relaxed and friendly, like she truly enjoyed telling her story and wanted to share that feeling with her readers. I guess, in a nutshell, it's not a waste of time to read this book, but don't expect a wealth of insight into either Julia Child or French cooking.

Sometimes you've got to dye your hair cobalt blue, or wander remote islands in Sicily, or cook your way through Mastering the Art of French Cooking in a year, for no good reason.

A lot of very edgy wisdom for such a young author. Her mastery of language, albeit foul from time to time (but who cannot take that, cannot take the world of today), is amazing and parts are just astounding, like her description of bone marrow: \\"It's the center of things. If marrow were a geological formation, it would be magma roiling under the earth's mantle. If it were a plant, it would be a delicate moss that grows only in the highest crags of Mount Everest, blooming with tiny white flowers for three days in the Nepalese spring. If it were a memory, it would be your first one, your most painful and repressed one, the one that has made you who you are.\\" It's not a book for everyone, and it is obvious who will like it and who will not. If you don't, you never will. Julie Powell's is an unusual voice to find in America (I checked several times that she wasn't a closet Brit, but she isn't) and I am more than delighted to find it here. Is it a book about food?

Then again, I had just finished Julia Child's My Life in France, and was definitely hungry for more Julia. At the very least, it could be worthwhile living vicariously through Julie cooking Julia's recipes. In the end, I was in for a fun ride that completely exceeded my expectation. Her instinctive prose and heady humor made the book a thoroughly enjoyable read. I laughed at her as long as with her. And it is her honest recap of her cooking catastrophes and willingness to humiliate herself that make Julie such an adorable protagonist.

If you are looking for an elaborate discourse on Julia Child and her famous cookbook, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a shining example of a candid memoir of life as a thirty-something in the twenty-first century, then you are going to love this book. I would put it into the same category with another of my personal favorites \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" by David Eggers. Ms. Powell and Mr. Eggers both share a refreshing style of writing that breaks through the boundaries and rules of more traditional novels. It is light, it is refreshing, it is dry, witty and poignant. And it is heartfelt. I could not put this book down. I really felt like I was living this woman's life along with her.However, I wouldn't pass this book on to my grandma or even my mother. There's too much on the sexual lives of the friends for their liking, and there are enough pop culture references that they just wouldn't \\"get it\\".

The author is being herself both in her writing style/language and her opinions. That's what a memoir is. Why should she change the way she speaks or modify her views to please anyone? You don't have to agree with her to enjoy the book for what it is, a humorous account of a year-long cooking project and her blog writing that resulted from it and subsequently became the book.If you're any type of foodie, amateur gourmet or even just the occasional home cook, you should really enjoy this book. And even if you're none of these, you should still appreciate the original idea for a memoir and Powell's writing. I found some parts laugh-out-loud funny, like dragging a live lobster home from Manhattan, or interesting such as when she goes in search of bone marrow. I also enjoyed the interstices of Julia and Paul Child that the author imagined and constructed throughout the book. She has a tremendous amount of respect for Julia that comes through regardless of what you think of Julie as a person.I recommended this book for our monthly book club and we're all planning to emulate Julie's efforts by creating some of Julia's recipes ourselves and sharing our experiences (along with the food) at our next meeting.

I enjoy the chatty writing style of the author and find her anecdotes about life's little moments laugh-out-loud funny at times and that's what keeps me interested. But i can't overlook the contempt in her tone for 9/11 families and her frequent peppering of ethnic reference and attribution throughout the book. At one point she refers to Hindu mechanics: FOLKS, LISTEN UP, Hinduism is a religion, not a race. There is nothing that typically would visually distinguish a Hindu from, for example, a Christian. So I'm assuming she was making assumptions based on skin color and that's just stupid and ignorant in this post-9/11 world. Ultimately she's just misinformed in her warped wittiness. At another point, she refers to Japanese sex practices. It's a gratuitous device designed for laughs I suppose, but ultimately it falls flat and comes off as insensitive and immature, especially once this device is applied a little too often.I'm not sure why the editors didn't catch some of this stuff that borders on offensive but that just goes to underscore how instutionalized racism is: we accept it to a point where so many of us don't even notice it for what it is, especially when the product is packaged with the clever hipness of a blog association.As I said earlier, I have been enjoying the light reading that it is, and therein is my confict because I do find some of the material offensive and tacky. Sloppy editing at the very least, I'd say.I'm guessing the blog was more on point in regards to the actual recipes and the experience of making each one, so I find myself wishing more to have read that since I bought the book thinking I would get to read the contents of what sounded like a smart and entertaining culinary adventure.still, an okay read if you can overlook some significant problems."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

If you wanna read real comedic first-world neurosis, don't pick up J&J, just read the J&J Amazon one-star foodie reviews here. If ever there was social commentary surely these posts are it. Here we see people so far \\"up their own\\" that they see cooking as beyond satire, and fail to appreciate how little distinguishes the foodie from the Trekkie. Beyond their understanding is J&J's subtext of a woman seeking to make sense of life through a SENSELESS pursuit. Before you foodies declare a fatwa on me for suggesting Julia Child's book MtAoFC is NOT the Quran / Bible, consider another title she could have penned: Julia & William (Shatner). Imagine the hoots of derision from Trekkies as Julie described yet another convention without having mastered Klingon. Yes we mock Trekkies, but why? Do they not find enjoyment in life where for us only a hole exists? Now ask yourself why food indulgence legitamises life more than indulgence in science fiction. Once you've answered that, you begin to realise that J&J is one woman's account of her dislocation from a society where life has no real meaning beyond the endless pursuit of indulgence and where, for some, food has become a religion. And by religion I don't just mean 'passion', I mean 'that without which, for some, life would be meaningless'. And if you wanna know what happens when religious folks have their religion satirised or their prophet mocked, just look to Europe where Muslims have been insensed my cartoons featuring Mohammad. Alternatively just read the one-star foodie reviews of J&J here. And if food, trekking or any other 21st century indulgence has not yet given meaning to your life, try reading J&J."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Julie is writing about a year in her life anchored by the Julia Project. How many of us, around the age of 30, haven't also gone through the joys and despair and big questions that Julie experienced and wrote about. I am no cook (my favorite cookbook is \\"five ingredients or less\\") but reading about her challenges with the Project has inspired me to give some more serious cooking a try. But the best part is that it is so damn funny. Reviewers are appalled by her course language? Hey, that's the way my friends and I talk too! Mix up some gimlets, turn off the depressing news, and get to know Julie, Eric, and the whole crew. Her nothing's-sacred style of writing will endear her to you by the second page.

Quickly let down when one finds more pages about sex, politics and friends, then about cooking. To some this is better than gourmet cooking experiences.For example, what a neat entry it might have been to describe more the innovative spit arrangement she came up with which doesn't get much more than small paragraph compared to page after page rambling about her friends' love lives and political spewing about memorial opinions.Reichl's book \\"Comfort Me with Apples\\" doesn't even come close to this discomfort, yet she describes sex life and life situations more discreetly and in better prose than sprinkling the f***'s and apparent disinterest really in gaining cooking acumen. Ruhlman's book on making and soul of chef are clear, poignant examples of more of what I was attracted to this title and supposed storyline. If told what this review points out are the emphases, would not have read. So be warned. Any wonder Julia comments so?"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

This was a book that I was looking forward to reading SO much and that I was extremely disappointed to try to read and discover how badly written it was. The author whined and bitched and cooked recipes from Julia Child's first cookbook but didn't even provide interesting stories about the cooking. She also worked with 9/11 survivors and spoke about them with such disdain that I did not finish the book and will not read anything else she writes. The potential was there for a clever book and the subtitle showed promise but the actual reading could not have been more disappointing. I'm surprised that this book found a publisher as Julia Child would not have wanted her recipes discussed by such a poor author and with such lack of style. Julia Child was one classy and innovative woman, this author has nothing innovative about her and seems to have needed an outlet for her complaining."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Not a sentence or two.2: I would like to know who came to her with the idea to publish this Blogging mess? On one page I almost ran out of air reading a run on sentence that filled it's own paragraph.

While it is a book about food, there are some very...icky experiences recounted that killed my appetite.While reading, I was constantly left with the feeling that Powell's words are better left on screen in her blog, or maybe part of a comedy routine. The best passages in the book are her imaginary retellings of Julia and Paul Child's relationship, but those sparse stories can't rescue the rest of it. The writing is overdone with huge doses of navel gazing. And yes I understand this is a memoir, but the amount of bitching borders on the insane. She wrote that a blog is a blank check for whining, and that's where it should have stayed.Julie is so whiny and immature that it's hard to care about her at all, and indeed I didn't by the end of the book. Her husband is a saint for putting up with all the fights, crying fits, and worse that she made him endure over her year of cooking all the recipes in \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I.\\" I'm sure he wanted to kick himself more than once for supporting the idea.Her acknowledgment in the Author's Note that sometimes she just plain made stuff up didn't start the novel off well for me, and I was further disgusted with many of the episodes she described.For once, the movie version of a book is better than the actual book - it's clear the writers of the \\"Julie and Julia\\" screenplay spent a lot of time cleaning up Powell's memoir and making a presentable story.If you're looking for a real culinary memoir, read \\"My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books),\\" by Julia Child.1/5."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"I saw \\"Julie & Julia\\" about 2 years ago and it sparked my interest in Julia Child and learning more about cooking. A couple weeks ago I scored a cheap brand new copy of MtAoFC and I also picked up Child's autobiography, the collection of the correspondence between her and Avis deVoto, as well as Julie Powell's actual book.I read the autobiography first and was absolutely enchanted. Then I moved on to Powell's book.Wow.Another Amazon reviewer put it PERFECTLY when she titled her review, \\"Charming Movie, Ugly Book.\\" I'm not kidding. The movie is SOOOOOOOOO much better than the book because you actually kind of LIKE Julie in the film. After reading the book, I couldn't agree more with Judith Jones when she said that she and Child regarded Powell's blog as \\"a stunt\\" and her \\"writing\\" lacked substance regarding her task. She RARELY describes what she learns and how it tasted. The whole bloody thing is 200+ pages of her whining, flipping out, and acting like an immature brat.I was absolutely horrified that she actually wrote about breaking the dish containing a posh dessert that she was taking to share with her office dominated by \\"Republican bureaucrats.\\" She openly admits to leaving it on the counter with a note inviting coworkers to help themselves, while making sure to go warn the \\"6 other Democrats\\" in the office not to have any for fear of broken crockery in their food. I rarely have moments of wide-eyed, mouth-hanging-open-in-shock when I read a book but this took the cake. All I could think was, REALLY?! YOU ACTUALLY DID THIS?! What kind of a sociopath ARE YOU?! Look, I'm a liberal myself and regularly debate with my fellow conservative friends, but I would NEVER in a million years even CONSIDER serving food to anyone that could potentially hurt them simply because I disagree with their political views.It only got worse when she described a temper tantrum she threw when a batch of mayonnaise didn't turn out. I can sympathize with losing your cool and violently flinging a bowl or a whisk into the sink and slamming a few cooking utensils down on counters. Honestly, who HASN'T done this at some point when their culinary skills are being tested beyond their limits. But screaming, sobbing and literally throwing tools and dishes about the kitchen, like an unrestrained 4 year old, making an even bigger mess, At age 30? I seriously began to wonder if this woman might need a year of professional therapy and possible medication rather than a self imposed cooking project.Somehow, I slogged through the trenches of this woman's hysteria and finished the book. Usually, I always feel a slight twinge of melancholy after completing a story and knowing that there will be no more to enjoy. With Powell's narrative, I just felt relieved that my journey into the mind of an overindulged woman-child of dubious sanity was over. In fact, I had more questions than answers the chief of which being WHY did her husband stay with her this long?While I'm pleased that the blog and film brought Child and her story and cookbook back into public awareness and introduced her to a new generation that might otherwise have never known about her, It grates on me that the vehicle for this were the ravings of a spoiled harpy."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I was very disappointed with it for various reasons, the number one being it is not focused on the Julie/Julia Project at all, which is what I though it would be. Julie tells the story of her life in general mentioning food every now and then, being REALLY narcissistic and annoying while doing it. She talks about trivial things that you would not expect to find in the book if you've watched the movie (i.e. her couch, reading her father's french sex book and and play tickets gone to waste because of her car having to be towed, among others). I never leave a book unfinished, but with this one I felt like I had to, otherwise I might actually die of reading Julie complain about her life so much (I only read three chapters, btw).

Julie made me laugh with her frustrations and mistakes. The lobster scene alone makes it worth reading the whole book. As Julie became more aware of her own shortcomings I became more able to laugh at my own in comparison. She also gives a glance into the love story that was Julia and Paul's life together. This is part of Julia's life we don't often hear about. You fall in love with the Julia Child you never knew, or maybe you did if you read \\" My Life in France\\" as I was compelled to do when I finished this book.

There was not enough time in the day for her to have held down a full time job, as dead ended as it was, to have pounded out on her computer's keyboard a daily blog, as self-centered as it was, and to have slopped her way through the preparation of an evening meal, much less to have conquered from cover to cover every nuance of Julia Child's brilliantly written Mastering the Art of French Cooking. But let's assume for a moment that one of the maggots that she tells us inhabited her kitchen, morphed into a talented sous-chef and took over the cooking chores, leaving Ms. Powell free to soak herself in her beloved nightly vodka. That still would not have left her with sufficient time to shop for all the necessary ingredients called for by Julia's recipes. And how in the world did she pay for them, given the meager income about which she whines and whines? And from whence came the money to buy all the pots and pans, a food processor, and other culinary accoutrements, necessary to accomplish her ridiculously conceived and poorly undertaken goal of trying to emulate the great Julia Child? The entire scheme is a farce. If you are enthralled by someone using the F word over and over and over, ad infinitum, in referring to everyone and everything that irritates her, and in this book that includes everything from her job, to her husband, to her apartment, to her friends, whom she reviles, to every Republican she has ever met or heard of, to the victims of September 11, then this is your book.

The examples are rampant. She lacks empathy for her husband, her mother, the 911 victim's families, a pinioned lobster struggling to escape (she giggles at it flailing around on her cutting board). What kind of person would set out food for co-workers knowing there may be shards of glass/antifreeze in it? She's crying and hysterical on an almost daily basis or laughing inappropriately. She cooks meals for other people in an apartment she describes in the most disgusting of terms; sludge backing up out of the pipes, cat hair stuck to everything, days of dirty dishes piled in the sink. The place is so filthy that a colony of maggots is breeding under her drain board. Beyond disgusting.The title leads one to believe this is supposed to be about food/cooking in some way. The actual cooking part (the \\"project\\"), when she bothers to mention it, is so haphazardly portrayed that one comes away with impression that she isn't really trying to learn how to cook at all. Cooking seems besides the point. She isn't gaining anything either insightful or educational from the experience. Rather, she's using the \\"project\\" as a way to legitimize and aggrandize her appalling behavior. At the end of the book she's a gloating, narcissistic twit, no different than how she started.I can only hope that she was wildly exaggerating all of it in some misguided attempt to be funny. If she wasn't, she really needs to get help. FYI- the character of Julie portrayed in the movie is nothing like the author. Ephron created an idealized version of this mess of book.

The author is so unlikable - she comes off as whiny, annoying, and at times just plain mean and unpleasant. In fact, I can't really think of any time in the book where she was positive, happy, or kind. Also, if you happen to be Republican watch out! She treats that as if you're the Devil himself. Her friends are entirely unlikable as well. In fact, the only likable person is her poor husband.There is also very little detail when it comes to the recipes. She loosely describes the ingredients and techniques (which is fine, I'm not expecting a cookbook) but then after you read through it all she says \\"It was good.\\" or \\"It was delicious.\\" That's it! It did not encourage me to buy the cookbook or even try any of the recipes.The writing style is also not for me. It's very stream of consciousness and the disjointedness shows, I found myself getting annoyed at her random thoughts and stories that go no where.

Living","review":"I purchased \\"Julie and Julia\\" with great anticipation after reading a positive review in a national magazine. The book is based on a terrific premise - author Julie Powell decided to tackle in one year all 524 recipes from Julia Child's seminal 1960s cookbook, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume 1.\\" At the time, Powell was a temp secretary, and she initiated her \\"project\\" as a blog before Little, Brown came knocking. I really enjoy non-fiction about cooking and food. However, what I expected to be an homage to Julia Child turns out to be something else entirely. Really, the premise turns out to be nothing more than a gimmick. In essence, this book is not about Julia Child or even about cooking. It's simply a jokey memoir - the author's musings about her very average life during that year. In the end, \\"Julie and Julia\\" is an expanded blog by an amateur writer.I approached this book imagining Powell as a talented cook trying to perfect her craft through Julia's cookbook. However, Powell apparently has no formal training; as a result, she often botches the recipes. That's not really a problem, because Powell probably spends as much time talking about her friends as she does about cooking. The times when she does discuss making the recipes end in one of two scenarios, 1) Powell and/or her husband somewhat grudgingly admits that the food tastes good or 2) Powell becomes hysterical, throws objects, or screams at her husband because the recipe is difficult. At one point, Powell even calls Julia Child a foul name because she cannot get a recipe to work. Not funny. I don't think that she needed to approach her \\"project\\" as a deadly serious endeavor; Julia Child certainly had a sense of humor. However, hearing her rant and rave is tiresome.It's rare for me to finish a book and feel hostility toward the author. However, Powell essentially has commandeered the good will people have toward Julia Child and used it to justify this book, which really is just a memoir. In addition, it's a rather bad memoir because Powell does not have an interesting life. Powell tries to frame her project as an attempt to find her life's path. If she grew at all, then it's in a way not reflected in this book.The blog probably was very enjoyable; however, a blog does not a book make. The next time I'm tempted to buy a book of this sort, I'll remember this bitter lesson. If you have a burning desire to read the ramblings of a somewhat hysterical New York secretary, then this book is for you. Otherwise, I cannot think of any reason to recommend it. Apparently, before her death, Julia Child heard about the author's \\"project.\\" A journalist asked Julia for comment, and she refrained, noting that the author was not serious. As always, Julia was spot on; even in her nineties, she could tell the real deal."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I am an avid bookworm, chef-in-training, and a huge fan of Julia Child. I have never been one to see a movie and then not read the book so when I borrowed a friend's copy of \\"Julie & Julia\\" I was excited. The movie had been so fabulous and my experience has taught me to think that the book is usually even better.......and boy, was I wrong!There is so little about Julia and about food in this book, it bothers me that it is marketed as such. I am appalled Julia Child's name even appears in this waste of prose honestly, and I can usually find something redeeming in everything I read. The author complains about cooking more than she seems to enjoy it. She spends much more time writing about odd friends with weird sex lives (or her lack thereof) and using an obscene amount of curse words that there is no time to appreciate what Julia did for the culinary world. \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" is seen by Powell as a torture manual instead of the accessible, liberating cookbook it has been for Ameican cooks. The tone is nasty and self-righteous and demoralizing. People probably want to cook less after reading this book, which is not what you'd expect from a supposed cooking memoir.All in all: if you liked the movie, if you like food and/or cooking, if you love Julia Child, even if you like reading anything in general...please don't waste your time! Instead, grab one of Julia Child's books and enjoy the lovely woman who changed American kitchens forever.

Living","review":"Bashing this book seems to be something of an obsession for some people. This may be one of the few cases where I've read so many people insisting that the movie is better than the book. I've seen the movie and read the book, and can say that I liked them both...but for different reasons.The movie is charming, whereas the book is witty. The real Julie Powell can be snarky at times; she can also be an extremely entertaining narrator. She smokes. She swears. And, not only is her husband a marginal character in her memoir, she admits to cheating on him (in her second book, \\"Cleaving\\"). Fans of the movie aren't likely to put up with her antics......which is a shame, since the book is a riot. It's an uninhibited, winding mess that's as profane as the blog that inspired it.Another note: Julia Child only makes it into this book in a series of 1-2 page vignettes--the subplot is nowhere near as developed as the movie, and can be quite difficult to follow if you're not familiar with Child's life already. If you're looking for more Julia Child, check out her own memoir,My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

This book is not for foodies, because there was not enough mention of food. It was bascially a book about her political views (which were too strongly voiced), and her insensitivity about her job (talking to 9/11 victims families only one year after it happened).

I can't believe they even published this book ... really.The book is poorly written and there's no humor in it. I wouldn't be at all surprised if her husband dumped her ... the way she writes about him is not very flattering. Her new loft sounds horrible and while I am no stranger to cussing, this author is very foul-mouthed. I know she's trying to be funny but it didn't work. And where is the editor for this book?I picked this book up for fifty cents at a local hospital gift shop because I had heard so much about it and how many of my friends just rave about it. I got through 75 pages of it before the flu struck our house and I gave it up. It is a major disappointment since I don't know anything about Julia Childs and was expecting more of the experiment that Julie Powell was conducting with different recipes, more on Julia Childs and etc. This book did absolutely nothing for me and I love to cook and bake. Not only that, the author did nothing but whine about her job (which if she hated it so much, then quit! There are millions of unemployed people in this country who would LOVE to have a job!) and about her husband, her friends and their sex lives ... and her cooking experiments. Whose idea was it to encourage this blogger that she is a writer? I've read better bloggers than her ...So is this book disappointing? You bet it is. I cannot believe how disappointed I am to find out that this book is written so poorly.

There are a lot of negative reviews of the hardcover version from readers who thought it was a serious food memoir or even a cookbook.

The idea of living in the squalor and filth proudly described by an ostensibly middle class pair was stomach-turning. When the author revealed that she was trying to create a year's worth of dinners from Julia Child's classic, but somewhat arcane recipes from \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" the reader gasps at the idea of anyone eating anything that Julie and her husband would touch. By her own admission, she and her husband smell bad, maintain terrible personal hygiene, never clean their apartment, have cat hair dusting all surfaces of the greasy, foul, hole of their kitchen, have maggots all over their drainboard and sink, and routinely have sewage back-ups all over their bathrooms. Julie leads the reader on a culinary nightmare. That Julie's quest to cook all of Child's recipes is an insipid idea, let alone the saving lynchpin of her life and marriage is just pathetic. The recounting of the experience is just sick-making. If you have a strong stomach, a high tolerance for foul language (I don't think the author is articulate enough to communicate any other way) and an interest in the macabre, this book may be for you, but I doubt it."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Big waste of time.At one point I thought I had left it on an airplane, and when my husband urged me to talk my way back onboard, I waved him off saying that the book wasn't worth it.

She opined to a reporter that she did not much appreciate immature Julie Powell's precious writing project of crash cooking in one year all 524 recipes in Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\". Not serious. Not professional. Disrespectful. Since Julia at that time before she died had sixty more years of wisdom under her belt than Julie, I'll go with Child. Powell's writing style is technically adequate. But it's so full of snotty Julie,Julie,Julie. Her story can be amusing at times, but her incredibly foul mouth obliterates the humor.I will reserve any higher a rating on this trashy tale until I try Powell's attempt at a recipe on page 220 for Foie de Veau ala Moutarde.That's calves'liver. Mustard version. Powell insists it's unctuous, rich, a silky soul. If she can get the public to eat offal, she may deserve some small recognition beyond her bloggers.Update:I tried Powell's liver recipe. Plain liver and onions are better. Powell's book still is poor. But, wow, of all things, the movie that came out based on her book is wonderful.

Why this is not a good book:a. It is entirely self-absorbed. Which I get, Americans like to be voyeurs. But not when someone is this boring.b. I did not empathize or even sympathize with Julie Powell in the least. She said she moved to NY to act, never even went to any auditions, and yet she COMPLAINS about being a temp. Yet she continues to talk about how she cam to NY to act. I cannot stand to hear someone whining about their circumstance when they have done absolutely nothing to change it.c. This woman BOASTS about how horrible her housekeeping skills are and is not surprised when she finds maggots in her kitchen. And this book is supposed to be about cooking!! It is too painful to read about these kinds of living conditions. This is not the third world, she should be able to take care of her living area well enough so as to not have it be a breeding ground for maggots.d. She complains about being fat constantly, and then makes steaks prepared with a half pound of butter. Every night.e. I love to cook. But this food is absolutely disgusting. Steak sauce made from bone marrow? Aspic? If you like food, you should not be reading this book.f. I feel that this book promotes a high-fat, meat-intensive diet. This kind of eating is in no way healthy. Vegetarians and vegans are often put down in the book because the author is too gluttonous to understand why anyone would not need to eat like she does. Obesity is a serious issue in this country. The fact that Julie Powell is condoning this kind of food is really pretty scary. Perhaps if she had written about becoming a vegan in the course of a year and the wonderful foods she ate and changes in her body, this would be a bit more of an inspiration. As it is, it is a painful reminder of the problems with the American diet and mentality around food. I'd like to hear Mimi Roth's opinion here.I just don't really see what there is to like. I don't think this woman is funny, but I know that I'm supposed to. I just find her to be despicable. I don't want to hear her complain about how her life sucks when she is not doing anything to change it. No, I don't consider cooking your way through a cookbook to be changing it. That could be a fun project and a good way to learn to cook, but I'm sorry, it does not constitute doing something about your life. Community service might have been a more constructive pastime. If she had blogged about that, I might like her more. But as is, she just comes off as a lazy, apathetic slacker who likes to whine about what she doesn't have."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Her prose could portray her as a self-absorbed, conservative-basher, ensconced in a too-lucky-to-be-true marriage, but she's honest and sometimes tongue-in-cheek about it, which is hard to do these days when one is intimidated into tip-toeing around issues and told to be bland about something one's passionate about. If you want to read this book, it's because you want to read about a Texan who moves to The City and for the first time comes to find a project she can dedicate herself wholly to and so tell her story in a voice that is clear, charged, and very humorous. She's a Lucy for all of us post-modern divas. Like an addict, you'll open and close the book between train rides and night-lights, minutes where kids nap--whenever you can slip a slip. You'll close the book on the last page, and as if finishing one of those really good meals where really good wine was served, you'll be pleasantly satiated."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I read this book in a heartbeat and loved it. Don't look at the star-rating because I believe that most of the people that read this book did so after the movie. The movie was totally different that than the book. The book is more in-depth and handles issues that the film couldn't get to. So, ignore the rest of the reviews.

I actually enjoyed the book, it may have lacked some of the charm of the movie, but it was still pretty good.Julie Powell is a secretary who doesn't see her life going anywhere fast. Sure she has a supportive husband, but really, what is she doing? On a whim she mentions to her husband that she should cook through Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking in a year. He tells her she should blog about it. And she does start to do that while she cooks over 500 recipes (not all of them very easy) in a year. Its an impossible task. But its a goal she has set for herself and her devoted readers on her blog. Mixed in with this story are little parts that she borrowed from letters of Paul Child and used to make a story about Julia and Paul Child for some background information.Since these are real people, not characters, it is hard to describe them. Julie is kind of bratty and for a food book, very focused on her biological clock. But I guess this book is about her so she can say whatever she wants to, I just would have preferred she stick to the food. Her husband doesn't actually get a very large role in it and I think even her brother has more description than him. As characters, I wasn't that interested in them. It was also a bit weird that in a book you would think was about food, the whole first chapter was devoted to her visiting the gynecologist.The writing is filled with cuss words and comparisons to sex. Those offended shouldn't tread here. I would also give a warning to Republicans, Julie isn't a big fan of you. Neither of these things effected me so I liked the book. She gives some good detail on the food and the descriptions of when something does go right are marvelous. There are a couple parts that are boring and some description are kind of icky and weren't pleasing when you like a yummy book of food. It did inspire me to want to go out and get the cookbook by Julia Child. Not that I'll ever use it, but at least I'll be able to see it for myself.I will also probably read her blog at some point. It sounds interesting. This is definitely a good book for foodie's and fans of Julia Child.Julie & JuliaCopyright 2005359 pagesReview by M.

I admit I havent read the recent Child bio, so the vignettes Julie fantasized for the real Julia in her own book were fine with me, and the book would have been much less without them.The book fits its intention of being a small amusement about the author's adventures and growth, and not being a book to educate people on how to (or not to) cook. I read a lot and am always on the lookout for something light and humorous without being sarcastic and snarky. Or just plain dreary/whiny. This fits the bill. Its conversational enough to feel as if you are also sitting on the buttsprung couch with a wineglass or cup of coffee chatting with the author and her friends.that said, its not great literature, just a \\"fun read\\" for a lazy evening. If all goes well the movie will be better than the book (usually its the other way around as a movie has to lose a lot of a book's details. If i hadnt seen previews for the movie i would not have picked up and paid for this book. Might have made the library list..yeahi could have done without the profanity (yes I'm over 50) but it wasnt all that frequent, she has an excellent vocabulary.yeahsometimes it felt a bit uncomfortable hearing the sometimes snarky comments about 9/11 and the efforts to come up with a suitable memorial, but anyone that has worked as a small cog in an enormous bureaucracy (or dealt as or with telephone staff in same) will recognize the absurdities that make a person laugh in self defense (beats crying or having a stress ulcer)but it was fun to read, once i got past the enormous amounts of butter the recipes continuously demand.

Living","review":"As Julie Powell was approaching 30, she found herself in a funk. She'd moved to New York to pursue an acting career, yet she was working as a secretary and she was having reproductive issues just as her biological clock was ticking. She decided to embark on a project - in the next year she was going to cook all 524 recipes in Julia Child's original cookbook, The Art of French Cooking. Her husband, Eric was supportive, and even suggested she start a blog to document her progress along the way. While listening to this book, you meet Julie's friends and family and learn of her accomplishments and frustrations. You learn about the recipes she creates and the difficulties she has finding some of the ingredients.Julie & Julia, by Julie Powell is the story of \\"The Project,\\" as she began to call it. This book is about the recipes, her blog and her relationships with her friends and family. I downloaded the audio version of this book from iTunes after seeing people talk about it on Twitter. The author reads the book and she does a splendid job.I have to admit that when I first heard about \\"The Project,\\" my first thought was, \\"Why?\\" We used to live in the culinary capitol of France and discovered food that even Carl wouldn't eat. But, after listening to Julie for a little while, I was rooting for her and \\"The Project.\\" Most bloggers can relate to her joy at receiving 36 hits early on (she knew because she'd checked her stats 12 times that day) and receiving her first comment. This audiobook made me laugh (a lot) and even got me teary-eyed at one point. The author has quite the potty mouth, so this is not one to listen to with your children.

Julie finds her true self by cooking and writing about it. She allows herself to really feel all of her emotions, even the ugly ones and eventually discovers how lovable she is when she is true to herself. So many of the processes that Julie used in her journey reminded me of a beloved book by another Julia - The Artist'The Artist's Ways Way, by Julia Cameron.I literally paused my reading and found myself inspired to return to my kitchen in a whole new way on the Sunday afternoon I began reading the book. I somehow was able to very quickly reclaim my ability to create simple, healthy and delicious foods - and loved that I took the time and chance to put myself back in the kitchen too. I fully enjoyed the \\"Artist Date\\" I took preparing some delicious food quite spontaneously that afternoon and even went on to blog about it in honor of Julie.I have been a fan of Julia Child and have read her biography as well. Although Julie never met Julia Child, what a superb mentor she chose. Julia modeled a similar and very successful soul-searching process many decades before through the same combination of cooking, persistence and writing. Two feisty and entertaining women!

I think the back and forth, interjected stories about Isabel and Gwen, her brother, etc. where well done the majority of the time and not difficult to follow. It further reinforced her style and her literary voice, if you will. Perhaps it's not a style that most people are accustomed to, so they poo poo it. Just because you don't understand it or care for it doesn't mean it's bad.Okay, so I was a little freaked about the maggots, but who knows if Julie was using her literary licence as it were.

Living","review":"So I am really dismayed to see how many people watched the movie, and then read the book and gave it a bad review. Seriously? Did these people wake up yesterday and have no way of realizing that movies made from books are rarely exact matches and, in fact, each really needs to be taken as a separate thing? Did they think they had woken up in alternate book-and-movie-twin universe? Did they possibly not realize, despite the fact that the movie is about writing it, that there is an entire huge available BLOG they could have spent seconds going to and previewing Julie Powell's writing style before buying the book and whining about how it's not like the movie in utterly useless Amazon reviews? No? Really? REALLY?Diatribe aside, I have not seen the movie, and did not intend to see the movie until I'd read the book and put it aside for at least a good three or four months. So now that I've read the book, I'll probably catch the movie on cable sometime next year. Because I don't want the experience of reading the book to taint my enjoyment of the movie (HINT!), and because honestly something about Meryl's Streep's performance in the previews annoys me. Personally, I found the book completely charming. Julie sounds very much like someone who I could be friends with. And I appreciate that even though she decided to step onto a world stage (the internet is a world stage, even if no one is looking in your direction), she did it as herself. Sometimes strong, sometimes full of self-pity, sometimes over expletive-laden in her choice of expression, sometimes stupid in her choice of footwear, always very real and often charmingly witty, she is always herself.This book is written by a real person, about her real life. It is amusing, and painful, and has some honest introspective discussion that certainly makes ME think about some of the food choices I make. And some of the life choices I make. It has also done a great job of rousing my interest in French cooking. Do I want to do what she sets out to do? Hell no? Do I want to make that one recipe with the breadcrumb encrusted liver? Awfully much. This book is NOT the cute PG-13 version of Julie, interwoven with Julia Child's own story. This book is the R-rated, sometimes even X-rated real life version of Julie, the real Julie, with a teeny bit of Julia Child for purposes of clarifying references. Let me say it again, this book is JULIE'S story as told by JULIE. If you want a cutsy Amy Adams version of Julie, watch the movie again. If you want to know more about Julia Childs, read a book about Julia Childs. If you are interested in what really happened to Julie in this year that she took on this amazing challenge, well, this would be a place to start. Did she sound whiny? Sometimes yes. But I think anyone who's ever worked a fulltime job and taken on a big project at home at the same time can kind of sympathize with that. I know I can.On a side note, I read that Julia Child said that if Julie had trouble with the recipes, Julie must not be much of a cook. It kind of makes me wonder what universe Julia Child lives in, because just about any professional chef will tell you that classical French cooking, the kind Julia Child is all about, is one of the more difficult cuisines to master. And saying that about someone who basically revived her pretty mediocre cookbook after years of obscurity, makes Julia Child sound like kind of a self-involved bitch. Which from what I've read, she apparently was, at least in her later life."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

On a whim, she decided to cook her way through the 524 recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in 365 days. In the next year, Julie goes through break downs, blow ups, and blunders, bringing her friends and family with her. She also finds herself and joy in the process.I both like and dislike Julie at the same time. I like that she is so brutally honest about herself. In a venue like a blog, it's very easy to lie about yourself to make you seem better than in real life. I think it's safe to say that Julie did not do this. Every blow up and petty fight with her husband is described, no matter how irrational or bad it makes her look. She even talks about how she neglected her apartment so badly that there were maggots in her sink. I also love that Julie is a nerd. (I can say this because I am one myself.) She is a loyal Joss Whedon fan and plays Civilization PC game. She is kind of foul mouthed, although I know quite a few people who would put her to shame. Julie is like many of the people I hang out with on a regular basis. I dislike her in the same way I would one of my friends for mistreating their significant other or blowing up over trivial details: just enough to be annoyed at them, but not enough to not be their friend anymore.Julie's narrative is interspersed with excerpts from letters and stories from Julia's life. Sometimes these felt a little pointless and I felt that the film accomplished this much better. I think reading My Life in France by Julia Child would be more effective.Julie and Julia is not just about cooking, but about a woman's journey to find herself and her purpose in life.

Now the reason I got a kick out of this story is because my friends and I are about Julie's age (+ a few years,) - we're city people with cramped kitchens, foul-mouths, who cook with cocktail in hand... most lack dining rooms but none lack the will to entertain in style and try new things in the kitchen. While things generally turn out these days, souffles and all, I certainly remember the days when every dish was still an experiment. Great writer? Great cook? Maybe not, but give her time.

I'd especially recommend it to people trying to figure out what to do with their lives, or people who remember how painful that process is.Yes, as many negative reviewers have pointed out, Julie drinks like a fish, talks like a sailor, willingly eats Wonderbread, and is generally terribly irreverant; in short, the girl's got moxie.

While not a book I would normally choose to read, it looked interesting enough that I decided to give it a chance. I do like to cook, and I know that there's the possibility for much success, failure, and hilarity in the kitchen. And seeing as this book was about one woman's quest to cook her way through a famous (if rather formidable) cookbook, I figured it would be entertaining.Sadly, this book was a major disappointment. I went in expecting at least some humor and pathos, and instead got what mostly amounts to a lot of whining.\\"Julie and Julia\\" chronicles roughly a year in the life of author/blogger Julie Powell, who at this stage in her life is a wannabe actress who works a series of temp jobs in New York City. On a whim, one day she decides to relieve the boredom and stress of her empty-feeling life through a self-imposed challenge -- cook every recipe in Julia Child's book \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking Vol. 1\\" in the course of a year, and write a blog about her experiences. What follows is weeks of agonizing over failed recipes, searching New York for a range of ingredients from sugar cubes to marrow bones, and driving friends and family crazy with her newfound obsession.I went into this book expecting to find some amount of humor, as any cook can attest that cooking can be wildly funny, even (and especially) if the recipe gets botched along the way. Instead, \\"Julie and Julia\\" consists mainly of endless whining and tantrums on the part of the neurotic author/protagonist as she realizes she's bitten off way more than she can chew. Instead of giving up or altering her goal to something a bit more manageable (such as giving herself more than a year to make over 500 recipes), she instead swears profusely, throws fits when things don't go her way, and takes out her frustrations on her long-suffering husband and equally neurotic friends. Some people might find this kind of thing funny in a malicious, schadenfreude sort of way, but I found it uncomfortable in small doses and just plain tiresome in a book-sized dose.About the profanity -- I don't particularly care if an author swears on occasion in a book, especially a memoir. But the casual use of the \\"F\\" word bothers me, especially when it's used with such frequency that you wonder if the author knows any other descriptive words. It's not as bad as \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" but it's annoying to me.Also, the book seems to be trying to get a lot of its laughs from shock value. Maybe I'm a prude, but I don't find such things as making light of the families of 9/11 victims, comparing a raw chicken to a sex-crime victim, or describing a homeless person's mental breakdown particularly funny. That's not to say there's no humor to be had from a shocking situation, but that seems to be all that Powell is capable of finding humor in. (Also if someone reads \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and is reminded of \\"The Joy of Sex,\\" I have to wonder if they have other issues...)I really wanted to give this book something other than a one-star rating, as I don't like to throw out single-star ratings right and left. But this book was beyond unfunny and uninteresting -- it was unpleasant to read as well. I only got halfway through the book before finally giving up, and find I really can't recommend it to anybody. It's not a good cooking memoir or a good memoir period, and its reliance on shock value in place of humor gets tiring fast.At least I'm not out anything but wasted time with this book.

Living","review":"Julie can't cook or write! If her mother had not named her Julie or she had not found the confidence to blog, we might have been spared this painfully bad book. I tried to read it, but could barely read the first 100 pages, much less finish it. I wanted to be inspired by Julie's project. I tried to give her a second or third chance, but as a foodie, admirer of Child, and a francophile, this book disappointed me on all fronts. The book was tasteless, bland, and at times nauseating. Is there any humor in 9/11? I think not. Julie's attempt to cook like Julia is as bad as I would imagine it to be if Sarah Palin started to do Tina Fey impersonations.This book has gotten so much attention because of Julia Child's well-recognized name, which translates into great marketing potential. You don't pay Meryl Streep to star in a film AND have Nora Ephron write the screenplay unless you are sure to make yourself some money. From the reviews I have read, it seemed that Ephron rewrote rather than simply adapted the book. Then I realized that the movie combines \\"Julie and Julia\\" with Julia Child's well-written and well-received memoir \\"My Life in France\\". The reviews tell you what a mistake that was. Critics love Meryl as Julia and Stanley Tucci as Paul. On the contrary, even likable, talented Amy Adams can't make Julie a sympathetic character because, frankly, she isn't. One reviewer called Julie's character \\"a bitter pill\\" and \\"a colorless mope\\". Whoever had the idea to combine the two books into one movie should be forced to eat bread and water for the rest of his/her miserable life as penance!!! (Is there a Hell in the blogosphere?)Julia Child's reputation, fortunately, will not suffer due to this insufferable book. On a positive note, \\"Julie and Julia\\" has inspired me to read \\"My Life in France\\", mind you, a copy with Julia and Paul on the cover, not the movie tie-in version (see marketing rant above). I am also going to re-open my copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and make the garlic mashed potatoes. They are simply divine and worth all the effort. My mom and I made them one memorable Thanksgiving.On a final note, I was appalled to see that Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", a fabulous memoir which includes the author eating her way through Italy, contributed a positive blurb on the paperback jacket. Perhaps that's the price one must pay to have Julia Roberts play you in a movie. Without Gilbert's endorsement, I probably would have left Julie and Julia on the shelf."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I know I'm very late to this party so I needn't go on about plot, but I just recently read this book and couldn't be more thrilled. I found myself liking \\"Julie,\\" the author/lead character, very much, though I must say her slovenly kitchen habits made me cringe. (I'm a neat freak and don't drink nearly as much as she does.)I am, myself, someone who loves to cook and bake, particularly for friends, but I think just about anyone would enjoy this tale of a woman finding herself through food, and learning a lot more than just how to make aspic along the way.There's no major journey here. No big life changes (other than going from blogger to published author, but that's barely touched on in the book). No enormous realizations or stunning epiphany, just a woman's slow re-discovery of her own self-worth, self-esteem and passion after being stuck in a dead end job. Something so many people can relate to, especially in the current economic times. (This book, set shortly after 9/11 in New York, was written in a similar job/financial climate.)It's also a touching portrait of a marriage that I really respected. They're not perfect, it's not a fairy tale and you see how close so many relationships really are to the edge--and how worthwhile it is to keep working to bring them back. Again, there's no big fight, no major devastation, just a subtle growing apart that ALL couples experience at some point and you either fix it, or you don't.When I finished the only words that came to mind were \\"utterly delightful.\\"I'm truly surprised to see so many negative reviews. Really, it's not a foodie book, and I don't think ever sold as such. It's also not even really about Julia Child (though the touching eulogy from the author is nice). It's just about one woman and how she used a year of cooking some old, rather out-dated and often over-complicated recipes, to find something new within herself."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I can't believe how many people thought this book would be similar to something by M.F.K. Fisher or Ruth Reichl!! (OK, it is kind of similar to Ruth Reichl, but funnier.)The book is not about food. It is about finding your way through life, finding joy in life, friends, loved ones, family . . . It is also about blogging, and one of the most fascinating parts of the book was seeing Julie's blog \\"catch on.\\" I have little use for blogs and find them tiresomely self-indulgent, so it's a neat look into that word.It's not an expertly written book, but it can be surprisingly touching, even when it is hilarious at the same time, and even more surprisingly, I didn't find it tiresomely self-indulgent.

Living","review":"I read this book when it first came out--and before I was writing reviews here. I stumbled across this page today and was stunned by the number of 1- and 2-star reviews. Apart from the fact that I loved this book, I thought it odd that it was the object of such pure hatred and disdain--as opposed to maybe 3-star reviews expressing reservations or disappointments. The super-negatives seem to fall primarily into three categories: from pepople who saw the movie first and then read the book; from people who didn't like Julie's \\"whining;\\" and from people who have written very few reviews but whose reviews reveal clearly conservative political agendas. Why they should have ganged up on this book in the approved Roger Ailes style is beyond me. But I felt moved to add my voice to those of the people who loved the book for what it is.Many years ago, someone gave me both volumes of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" as a gift. Like so many other people, I had fallen in love with Julia Child via her PBS program that was so determined to get Americans to try cooking and eating interesting foods, something besides processed \\"cheese food\\" in blocks that didn't need to be refrigerated and green bean/mushroom soup casserole and Jell-o salads. To expand our culinary horizons and try new things. I was all for it. My husband and I had just returned to the US from our year-long \\"honeymoon\\" trip to Europe, during which we lived and worked in London and traveled all over. In France, we had discovered the gorgeous simplicity of vegetables served lightly cooked in olive oil or raw--a plate of shredded fresh carrots dressed with lemon, salt, and pepper. Of fish cooked simply in butter, rather than coated in thick batter and deep-fried. In Italy, we ate spaghetti carbonara and discovered frittatas--egg dishes that could be the main course at dinner! So I was eager to get cracking with Julia's books.I made two recipes--her French onion soup and, for a New Year's Eve dinner party we threw, her chestnut tart with meringues. Both recipes exhausted me. They were so complicated and there were so many ingredients and steps--especially for the tart, which came out wonderfully but had cost me so much in time and worry that I couldn't even enjoy it. I put the book on the shelf and didn't open it again for years.Many years later, here comes a young woman, living in a tiny urban apartment with a kitchen the size of the one I had when I made those two Julia recipes, who decides she is going to make every one of those recipes. Because she loves Julia. Because she's in a rut and needs a challenge, and going through each exhausting recipe and not cheating on ingredients and then writing about her experiences will give her some much-needed focus. She fails, she succeeds, she's worn out, she's inspired and invigorated. She writes about all this with humor and sarcasm and annoyance and adulation.What's not to like here? Maybe you had to be there in the 1960s, when American cooking--so rooted in processed foods and bland flavors--began to shift to fresh foods, cooking with wine, pasta intead of canned macaroni, and ingredients once impossible to find and suddenly available at your local supermarket. I loved this book so much that I was inspired to open up those old volumes of \\"Mastering\\" and try Julia's coq au vin. I had a bigger kitchen and was a better cook by then. The dish was perfection, and I wasn't exhausted at all.Less than a book about cooking, per se, \\"Julie and Julia\\" is about enlivening your life with challenges, persevering through difficulties (sometimes sad, sometimes annoying, sometimes hilarious), and achieving your goal. It parallels the challenges Julia Child faced in getting the book published in the first place and in changing the taste of American food."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

This book was gathered from Julie's blog, as she attempts to live one year-365 days-cooking through the legendary Julia Child and her cookbook.First of all, I have to admit this novel has a lot of charm. It is honest, and can actually pass as well-written. However, I do have to say that I did not know if I wanted to root for Julia or simply toss this book of hers to my \\"did not finish, never to be picked up again\\" pile. But I knew that if I did that, I wouldn't be able to write a fair review. So I finished it.The premise is interesting enough, and as I said, the author can write well. But throughout the book, I found her to be a little too self-indulgent, even for a memoir. There was not much humor, not much wit, not much thought. In truth, after reading this, I found myself to be a little bit depressed. Her \\"opinions\\" about her family, friends, politics, 9/11, Republicans, I found, were actually a bit offensive. I understand that this is a memoir, coming from a blunt blog, but please, there is no need to be this rude.On a positive note, I wish I have just passed this one up and just watch the movie, mainly because of Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. And on the other hand, I wish I had just read more about Julia Child and her husband instead of Julie Powell.Spare yourself, try not read it.

She admits that she moved to New York to become an actress and then never really got around to auditioning. She has worked temp job after temp job and she's 30 years old, with no real desire to do anything. The book is all about her all the time. It appears that she is constantly looking for excitement. Oh, and another thing--she must think she is so very funny, but she is not. The tone of the book is sarcastic from the beginning and Julie is so self-involved from word one. The humor is over the top and at times very cutting towards her husband. We find out towards the end of the story that Julie really loves her husband Eric, but it is almost mentioned as am afterthought.The book is about Ms. Powell's experience with cooking her way through Julia Child's cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

In this self-absorbed blog-turned-book, Julie Powell, a self-described government drone, needs a project to make her life a little more interesting and give it some (or any) meaning - she's really not sure. (Someone asked George Mallory \\"Why do you want to climb Mt. Everest?\\" to which he famously replied, \\"Because it is there.\\" Same philosophy here.)Julie sets out to cook all or most of the recipes in Julia Child's iconic cook book \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in one year. Small New York apartment, challenging recipes, supportive beleaguered husband, a hunt for rare or unusual ingredients interspersed with fictional glimpses of Julia Child's life - you can see why the Julie/Julia Project would seem intriguing to readers. An exciting premise certainly, but a poorly-written book. Perhaps that's why Julie and Julia is now a movie starring Amy Adams. Hollywood certainly will improve on the book - tightening up the pointless details, the endless segues and making us care about Powell and her project more.Powell's not a good writer, just as many bloggers are not. (There are so many better memoirs out there I wondered how this even got published.) The inane minutia of her childhood and life leave readers exhausted and hoping she'll get to the point - or any point, really. And the constant pop culture references? Yawn. Okay, already - we know you grew up in the 70s; you watched a lot of TV; you have a crush on Jason Bateman. I kept waiting for the Teen Wolf reference. Powell's like that friend who only wants to tell you about everything that's going wrong in her life and needs you as a friend only so she has someone to complain to. Sigh.The book does have some bright spots. When Powell talks about her friends, you can feel the love and affection she has for them - that's also when the strongest writing comes out. Her co-worker's IM trysts with a married man are hysterical as is the co-worker's ultimate reason for breaking up with him. And while I personally wouldn't compare liver to sensational sex as Powell does, it made a giggling discussion for my book club as we picked a food that compared to sex with our husbands.Powell's blog readers - or \\"bleaders\\" - express many of the feelings that readers of this book will have: \\"Enough already\\" (referring to aspics) or \\"Don't give up,\\" (referring to lobsters).Powell also changes the cooking rules recommended by Julia Child when it suits her - substituting tomato paste for seeded, diced, crushed tomatoes when she feels like it but spending hours making mayonnaise. There was no explanation of why she had to follow exactly some of Child's recommendations for ingredients or why she \\"cheated\\" with other ingredients - and don't forget that Powell explains everything.If you like reading blogs instead of books, and know a little about cooking but don't really care, you will likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Months later, I was trolling the shelves of a bookstore one day, saw the paperback, ignored it, forgot which shelf it was on, decided to go back to it, became frantic because I couldn't remember where it was, treked through the store retracing my steps to find it at last. I bought it and began reading it. I just finished it.It's all about Julie and her personal commitment to a goal. Her quest of making 524 Julia Child's recipes in 365 days would never enter the minds of 99.9% of goal setters - including master chefs. However, it is Julie's goal and she does achieve it. She includes friends, family and the world at large making herself vulnerable and allowing them all to observe her either personally or through her daily blog. Somehow, she doesn't say exactly how - she even gets the attention of the media and Julia Child herself.Her writing reflects the world surrounding her as she often doggedly flails away at each recipe - including her less than desirable government secretarial job, co-workers, home, family, pets, friends, political climate, post 9/11 New York.I came to know and like Julie and her alter ego, Julia, who comes to exist in Julie's brain. Julie's Julia lives in another time and world. Her Julia is brash, adventuresome, young, healthy and bold.These are all traits Julie displays herself as she goes through this year with a 40-year-old cookbook. She finds Julia and finds herself. She is an explorer/adventurer with the mouth of a sailor. That's okay, because that is Julie and she reveals herself through her honest writing.Julie endeared herself to me - I am way past thirty years of age - but I can remember the trials and tribulations of being 29 going on 30. You just have to love someone who wears a Madonna bustier/corset to work and then goes home to work barefoot in her little NY kitchen to perform culinary miracles with a calf's brain, butter, cream and wine.No, this is not a cookbook - if you want that - take a trip to a bookstore and buy yourself one.

Honestly I only read the first 15% of the book, then speed read/skimmed through the drivel and slowed down to read the cooking parts, it was THAT bad. The long parts between the cooking dialogue are filled with the occasional f* word, comments about her sexual frustrations, and depressing and mundane life. She is the epitome of the type of person I would not befriend - not very clean, pessimistic, likes to wallow in her own sorrow, a complainer. This book was a HUGE disappointment. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from a friend or the library. I'd be surprised if you finish it. Now I'm wondering if I should bother seeing the movie. **Update 01/10/10** I saw the movie last night and liked it. Nora Ephron did a fantastic job of leaving out a lot of the bad writing details/plot and spinning it through her lens, not Julie Powell's.

Living","review":"It all began as \\"The Julie/Julia Project\\" --- an insanely clever blog idea by a sharp New Yorker named Julie Powell, who had been frustrated by lackluster career choices. The concept was to take the Culinary Classic of All Culinary Classics --- MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, Julia Child's opus that taught American women everywhere that they, too, could create great French cuisine --- and attempt to make all 524 recipes within one year. And, while doing so, she'd chronicle her adventures in a blog.Starting out with simple recipes like potato soup, the assignments get increasingly more difficult. Throughout the year she is entertained and assisted by an entire cast of extras, including her understanding husband, her brother, her crazy friends, and the growing number of readers who are tuning into her blog with regularity. As Julie delves into increasingly complex recipes, such as Bifteck Saut&eacute;au Bercy (her search for bone marrow for that particular recipe is truly hilarious), she learns as much about herself as she does about cooking.Powell is a talented writer, and her blog remains one of the better examples of that medium to this day. Her writing style --- confessional, self-deprecating, occasionally rambling --- is really well-suited to the blog space, which makes the book version of her story occasionally feel like it's veering off-center. When she's hard at work in the kitchen, her writing is sharp and self-assured --- but Powell strays off-track a few too many times into less central aspects of her life (and especially her friends' lives) that, frankly, aren't that interesting. One wishes she would keep her focus on the food --- but when she does concentrate on that, Powell is so good you're ready to forgive her the errant lapses (at least until they happen again.)At the end of the story, you have a woman who puts a lot of effort into both her cooking and her book. If the end result (in both cases) is a bit uneven, at the very least you're left with a strong and engaging woman who, through much trial and effort, discovers unknown levels of determination and ability within herself.Which, if you think about it, is what Julia Child would have wanted all along.--- Reviewed by Lourdes Orive"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"I am giving this book a 4-star review, but I must explain why in detail because I understand some of the vicious reviews others have given it.First, by now, most of us buying this book will have already seen the movie, and, as others have noted, the real Julie Powell is not at all like Amy Adams. In the movie, Amy is adorable, cute, and attractive, an ideal protaganist to root for. Julie Powell, as she presents herself in this book, is not only a bitch, but a whining, self-pitying, narcississtic bitch--an almost thoroughly unlikable character.Second, as we all know, editors have gone the way of linotype machines--I guess they started disappearing 20 or 30 years ago, and by now, the folks with that title seem to be little more than project managers whose only focus is managing deadlines and maybe expenses. The prose in the beginning of the book is really hard to take; reading it made me as uncomfortable as watching an untalented child screeching for attention from a stage. It seemed as though half the sentences had an extra third tacked on where Julie was trying to prove she was an 'author' who could really 'write'. An editor working on a college newspaper could have vastly improved the book with a red pencil and some strong guidance.Third, this is based on a blog. This means there is only one subject: the attention-starved author whose exhibitionism creates a completely unwarranted sense of self-importance in the author's own mind and heart. The book is not about cooking, not about learning, not even about working through Julia Child's classic cookbook, it is about Julie, and nothing but Julie. I can completely understand why Julia might not have liked the blog: what I wanted to see was, 'Here's what I am going to cook next, here are my adventures and misadventures encountered along the way, here is how it tasted, here is what I learned about cooking and about myself.' That is most emphatically not what this book is about. Julie was given the nickname Sarah Bernhardt from a very young age because she has evidently been given to histrionics and tantrums since birth--that's pretty much what the book is about.Having now confirmed most of the negative appraisals given by those reviewers who only gave this book 1 or 2 stars and probably wished they could have given it zero, how do I get from here to a 4 star review? Let me try to explain.This is, quite inadvertantly, a very adult book. Granted, the language is that of a foul-mouthed teenager, the attitude that of a petulant child, the insights, well, there really aren't any. I would not recommend this book to any under 25, maybe even under 30. Imagine a memoir written by a substance-abusing street person who once worked on Wall Street. This is how grim this book is.Julie Powell is not a drunk, or a drug addict; she is a reasonably sane, functioning adult, but she is deeply damaged, still trapped in some childhood drama that we, even now, know nothing about because she lacks the insight to see it for herself yet.But, even though I did have to skip a few pages towards the beginning of the book that were just unbearable, the book became more compelling as I forged ahead for two critical reasons:1) Julie actually learned to write as she was writing this book. A decent editor would have pointed this out and cleaned up the amateurish, exhibitionist beginning to match the more maturely written last half of the book, but, alas, Julie was ill-served by a project manager. Offhand, I would say the most egregiously bad writing is confined to the first 30-50 pages or so, and seems to disappear almost entirely after page 80.2) The growth I was hoping to see Julie undergo during the project only really began to happen afterwards, while she was writing this book. But she did grow as she wrote the book, although in ways she is apparently yet unable to see. The book is funny, and episodic, and meant to be a number of things, but it is mostly grim and compelling. It's like watching an addict invent rehab on their own without ever even realizing it. When Julie says she was drowing and Julia saved her, she's telling the truth. She was lost in a crappy life, but the only thing that really made her life crappy was her, not her husband, family, friends, job, apartment, or city. All of the crappiness was entirely inside Julie, entirely of her own making, and it was only through committing herself to this journey that she was able to begin to drag herself out of her narcisstic black hole of misery.Nora Ephron based her movie on two books that she essentially threw away in order to make up a beautiful dual story of personal growth. I am so glad she invented the character that Amy Adams realized so well. This book, on the other hand, tells the very adult tale of an immature, un-self-aware, miserable narcissist who began to work her way out of this nightmare of her own making by discovering the joy of learning that Julia so fully embodied. When she writes of this at the end of the book, she is still embarrassed to use the word 'joy', and this alone should give you an indication of how deeply damaged she really is. But, as you get further and further into the book, you begin to see the redemptive power of committment to a project outside of one's own neurotic orbit, a redemption that begins to work its magic even though Julie is too miserable and flawed to see anything more than glimpses of it herself.The movie is cute, and funny, and wonderful, and light. This book is a grim memoir of redemption that is made all the more powerful by the fact that the author is too unperceptive to see what is going on herself. There is a turning point in the book, but it's hard to find because Julie never saw it herself, so she didn't structure the narrative around it. The book is life-affirming and ultimately very positive because it shows that the right mission, diligently followed, can save us despite our attempts to sabotage it."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"\`Julie & Julia' by Julie Powell is a new and welcome addition to a very select class of culinary writing, the \`Personal Memoir'. The only other work I know in this entertaining genre is Amanda Hesser's \`Cooking for Mr. Latte'.The most important thing both books have in common is that neither offers you serious culinary advice. While Ms. Hesser's book has a goodly number of recipes, she presents them more as a look inside her personal favorites than as a major culinary reference. Ms. Powell's book has no recipes, as all the recipes in question come from Julia Child's first and most famous book, \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Both share that exquisite charm in revealing cooking disasters. Ms. Hesser's revelations are a bit more satisfying, as she is a culinary professional at the time of her writing the book.Ms. Powell embarked upon the quest leading to this volume while she was a temporary secretary at an unnamed federal agency dealing with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. She was living with her husband in a smallish and cantankerous apartment in Long Island City (Queens) and was finding herself in need of a direction in life. Since she also felt the need to learn how to cook better, she hit upon the project of cooking every single recipe from Julia Child et al's masterpiece, generally referred to as \`MtAoFC'. There is an odd parallel with Child's life here in that Julia Child took up cooking after World War II and shortly after marrying Paul Child and moving to Paris, where Child was posted with the U.S. Embassy. This left Julia at loose ends, especially after having filled an important and satisfying role in the OSS (Office of Special Services, forerunner of the CIA) during the war, in Ceylon, where she met her future husband.To make this project even more interesting to our current author, she decided to announce the project to the world on an Internet blog and on it record her progress, with the ambition to complete all 524 recipes in one year (365 days). Thus, the lion's share of this book is anecdotes on the preparation of selected recipes or groups of recipes from \`MtAoFC'. Note that Ms. Powell's \`MtAoFC' is really just Volume I and not both volumes.If nothing else, this book is a confirmation of just how huge a cultural, or at least culinary icon is this cookbook by J. Child, S. Beck, and L. Bertholle. Ms. Powell's book would not be half as interesting if it were done on the basis of virtually any other cookbook which comes to mind.I have enormous respect for Ms. Powell's integrity in working through all the recipes in the manner she did, as the author resorted to very few shortcuts, at least on the first or second time with each technique. The fact that the author and her cohorts took the trouble to track down marrow bones and calves hooves made for a doubly interesting story, even if one suspects that the culinary results may not have suffered one wit if the author had relied on Knox unflavored gelatin rather than taking the effort to render gelatin from an authentic animal source. What may be a little surprising is the difficulty Ms. Powell and company had in finding some of the ingredients in New York City, but then, none of them were culinary professionals familiar with insiders' knowledge of Gotham's provisioners.Unlike Ms. Hesser, Julie Powell had no direct contact with her subject, Julia Child. The only documented contact was a short note from Ms. Child to Ms. Powell wishing here well and expressing gratitude that Ms. Child's work had a positive effect on Ms. Powell. Since Ms. Powell's culinary Labors of Hercules were finished in August 2003; this event roughly coincided with the death of Julia Child. It is understandable that this event had less emotional effect on the author than it did on some of the author's family.In writing this book, Ms. Powell got access to letters between Paul Child and his future bride and wife, Julia McWilliams / Julia Child and publishes a selection of these letters from 1944 in Ceylon to 1949 in Paris. While I am familiar with much of the general information in these letters from reading Julia Child's biography, \`An Appetite for Life', some of the details of the salty language used between the lovers is almost worth the price of admission.Some of you who have little taste for culinary memoirs may react to the notion of book with indifference, but I do suggest you consider it if you have any thoughts of embarking upon making any recipes from \`MtAoFC'. I should also warn you that Ms. Powell's chapters often deal with some of the most difficult recipes in \`MtAoFC', as it is the problems arising out of these which make the best reading. My own experience with Ms. Child's book is that most of the recipes are, indeed, relatively simple. But, as Ms. Powell clearly states, echoing an important precis by Richard Olney in \`Simple French Food', \`simple' is NOT the same as easy, and nothing worth doing is likely to come easy to the inexperienced.Ms. Powell (and her copy editing handlers at publisher, Little Brown seem to be much more experienced at writing than they are at cooking, as Ms. Powell's exploits make good, if not necessarily scintillating reading. Like the candid comments from Paul Child's letters, Ms. Powell seems to have held little back, except for those confidences connected with her government job and the identity of her friends.Ms. Powell is not quite the expert writer like M.F.K. Fisher, Ruth Reichl, or Amanda Hesser for that matter, but her stuff is engaging. I was just surprised Ms. Powell did not give us the URL for her blog or the page references in \`MtAoFC' for her recipes used in each chapter."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"Don't buy the book based on your opinion of the movie. I took my niece to see the movie and we loved it - Meryl Streep was, naturally, beyond amazing, while Amy Adams was charming. Nora Ephron was wise to do what she did with this story, because the real Julie Powell is quite insufferable, hardly an ideal role model for waking up one's life.As far as the foul language goes...a well-placed swear word can add realism and punch to a story, but overuse of profanity by an author is, in this writer's opinion, not only offensive and jarring, but worse, downright lazy. If you have to rely so heavily on swear words, then you're only proving that you are unable to express yourself in print with any degree of finesse.A lot of reviewers who gave this book a bad rating used the word \\"whiny.\\" It is not misplaced, I assure you. I love humorous life stories in which a protagonist tries to make sense of things by embarking on journey of self-discovery through a special project, but, rather than being full of fun foibles, poignant moments, and growing insight, this author shows a character who is narcissistic, snobbish and insufferable. I'm not a republican or a Bush fan, either, but I absolutely LOATHE people who exhibit such blatant disrespect for other people's views, opinions, and beliefs (reminds me of Helen Goode on \\"The Goode Family,\\" who whines to her husband, that it IS good to respect others, just \\"not them!\\"). Apparently, if you disagree with Julie Powell, you're just stupid.I didn't come out of this too badly myself: I enjoyed the movie, am relieved I didn't spend money on the book, and interested in learning more about Julia Child, who sounds like an amazing person as well as an exceptional cook. As far as this trite goes, however...well, now it makes sense to me that Julia Child reacted to it the way she did (I'll give Powell this much: she was very gracious about Child's reaction, though she should be, since Child turned out to be her bread and butter). Too bad such a great idea was handled by such an emotionally immature individual."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

She writes about her friends' dysfunctional sex lives, about her own barely-controlled anger management issues, and about how much city life sucks for the less-than rich. But she writes very little about cooking.She also has a rather limited vocabulary, substituting liberal amounts of profanity. This gets old quickly, too.I threw this away unfinished; I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else wasting time on this book by giving it away. Fortunately it was cheap."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I have to admit that few things make me more suspicious than a book that derived from a blog. I also have a pretty low tolerance for chick lit in general, and this smelled like chick lit to me.But anyhow. Despite going into the book with poor expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. I found it well-written and it felt honest. It had several laugh-out-loud moments. Best of all, I found myself genuinely liking the narrator/author. It was good fun. And that was exactly what I wanted it to be.Although you can get some foodie kicks from Julie & Julia, it is not really about food. Do not read the book if you are looking for technical details, deep reflection about Julia Childs and French cooking, or kitchen tips and tricks. It is not that kind of book. Think light read with cooking as a kind of character quest.One quarrel-- in her author's note Powell declares that \\"sometimes she just makes stuff up\\". That made me less comfortable with the book, honestly. As a memoir it has a lot of charm. As a novel, it has much less interest. I am not sure why that should be the case, but it took a little bit of the shine off for me to see that note at the beginning.Anyhow. If, like me, you are looking for some cheering up then this could be a book for you. Bonus points if you find yourself an urbanite with a foodie-wannabee cooking habit, because then the funny parts are going to be even funnier. I had to wince when remembering some of my own attempts at homemade mayonnaise. Recommended."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"Because this project has what I consider to be an irresistible premise and because a friend described the book as \\"funny,\\" I was excited to read it. On the surface, I have a good deal in common with Julie Powell. We are close in age and background, similar in work history, and both enjoy good food, good drinks, cursing and leaving the cleaning to someone else.After reading this book, if someone were to tell me I reminded them of Julie Powell, I would commit hari-kari. She is terribly unpleasant, self-absorbed and repellant. All of the characteristics with which I could identify are completely reduced to rubble in her hands. I find myself never wanting to hear or use the F-word ever again, and even I was repulsed by her disgusting apartment. I had to skip most of the passage involving maggots lest I lose my lunch. All the tales of sticky cat hair, brackish flooded fixtures and rotting floors didn't help either. I read most of the book with that look on my face people have when something nearby stinks.I assume she was attempting humor and exaggerating many of her misadventures and personality flaws, but the end result is that I loathe her as a fellow human being and wish ill upon her. Her heartless exposure of her friends' and family's personal lives is inexcusable (and dull) and her husband appears to be a combination saint/fool for putting up with her. Powell hates the project, hates her job, dislikes her husband (she mentions her frequent desire to beat his head with sharp rocks. I mean really! Eric! Run for your life!), disdains her friends, scorns her mother, disrespects Julia Child and admires only her cats and her brother.In its relentlessly bleak tone and insistence on examining the lives of detestable characters, this book reminds me ofA Confederacy of Dunces. Another supreme waste of time and positive energy.I think the lesson to be learned here is that a blogger does not an author make. The publishing industry needs to be really careful about offering book deals to just any successful blog author. Any fool with an internet connection can create a blog, after all. That doesn't mean they are worthy of anyone else's time or attention."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"Many a blog turned book falls into the \\"nothing new\\" trap; what we get on paper is just a reproduction of what we got on the screen. In her attempt to escape this pitfall, Julie Powell goes to the opposite extreme and tries to do way too much. The premise lured me in: approaching 30 and flitting from one temp job to the next, Powell attempts to do the improbable, tackle all of the 524 recipes found in the first volume of Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in one calendar year. What could have been an interesting story of using a culinary challenge to provide structure and direction to an otherwise chaotic New York lifestyle turns into a book with an identity crisis. Part memoir about family and friends and life in New York, part story of getting closer to Julia Child through her iconic cookbook, part recounting the blogging experience near the time of its inception, part fictional re-imagining of the relationship between Paul and Julia Child - the book felt like a shouting match between styles and genres each fighting fiercely for attention.Was the book diverting? Yes, and sometimes it was hilarious. However, there are a number of books out there that successfully do what Powell is attempting here. If you have your heart set on reading this book, go for it. However, I would also like to offer the following recommendations depending on what drove you to look at this book up in the first place:If you are interested in Julia Child and how she (and others) have influenced American cuisine, I suggestThe United States of Arugula: The Sun Dried, Cold Pressed, Dark Roasted, Extra Virgin Story of the American Food Revolution.If you are looking for a food memoir, someone learning about cuisine to better understand themselves and a culture, tryServe the People: A Stir-Fried Journey Through China.If New York is the draw,Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguiseis written by the former restaurant critic of The New York Times and includes stories of restaurants (with reviews), home cooking, and some tempting recipes.If you are looking for great, laugh out loud memoir that actually pulls off the blog-to-book transition, but does not have much to do with food, pick upBitter is the New Black : Confessions of a Condescending, Egomaniacal, Self-Centered Smartass,Or, Why You Should Never Carry A Prada Bag to the Unemployment OfficeThere has been a huge surge in the publication of food-related books over the past few years and many of them are excellent, but \\"Julie and Julia\\" is just not one of them."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Thank goodness Julia Child or Judith Jones never met her and I wish I had never bought her book. Don't waste your money. I'm sure Julie Powell is laughing all the way to the bank for those of us who were duped into buying her book thinking it would focus on food and life rather than a cheap attempt to garner fame and ... money. She doesn't even try to hide her objective. Because of so much negative publicity and the critics slamming the \\"Julie\\" part of the Julie & Julia movie, hopefully others will not make the mistake of buying this book or any others she may write.Instead, I recommend My Life in France or any of Julia Child's other books. There, you find an authentic, unpretentious person with a true passion for food and life. Julia Child is inspiring and authentic -- everything Julie Powell is not. If you're looking for a true food book, not a gimmick, stick with the real Julia.I'm putting my Julie & Julia book in the recycle bin."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

And mopes. Some books make you glad, others make you cranky; this one leaves me with the urge to grab the author by the shoulders, give her a good shake and yell, \\"Stop whining!! My 9 year old niece whines less than you!\\" And tip for Julie--any recipes you had problems with were because a) you have no clue how to cook and b) you were too distracted whining to follow a recipe.

It seems to work for Julie."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I'm going to try to be as objective as possible since I was an editor for many years and would like to voice what I think the actual issues with the book are. Starting with the title: Julie and Julia, 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen. This, to me says funny, light-hearted adventures in cooking ala the comedic genius of Julia Child. Not so. It's more of a memoir that is a bit dark at times. The title, I feel, misrepresents the content but this is only minor. The book jacket was extremely well done and actually reminded me of the first episode on the Julia Child French Chef DVD where she tries to use \\"conviction\\" to flip potatoes in the pan and a big hunk lands on the stove and she declares \\"well, that didn't go so well!\\" Hilarious stuff and she wasn't even trying to be funny.Next, the author's opinions about republicans, the president, 9/11 victims etc... I don't have any objection to anyone having strong opinions. Many times, if something is controversial, it actually helps a book sell more copies and is often exactly what a publisher might have in mind right from the start. Where this fails is in the frequency of the remarks. Exhausting. Really good authors need only to mention something once to get a point across. In this case, anyone who is buying a book about someone as significant as Julia Child is likely part of a demographic that is educated and sharp enough to understand the author's position in one go. It was a bit in your face at times. And though the author may have been honest about her feelings with regard to 9/11 families, victims et al., there seemed to be a lack of general humanity in the tone of it - not that she actually felt a certain way but how she put it out for the world to read. The issue here in my opinion (and her editors should really take responsibility for this) is that anyone's first book is critical to that author's ability to make an impression and gain a reputation - one that will help push a career forward. You don't want to insult any group of people your first time around the block. Successful opinion-giving comes with getting your readers to trust and respect your opinions before hitting the sensitive areas. Everything is about timing. You can say anything and get away with it if you give it the proper placement. What all good authors want (and need) is to reach a wide audience particularly on the first go. You want to appeal to a variety of people unless you are writing a high tech book about some new technology/product/whatever that only affects a niche. And really good readers - the caliber of what any author would want - remember these critical first books and the impressions made. I'm guessing that there's the possiblility that the publisher pushed this through the system before it was ready to go in order to get it on the market in time for the gift-giving season. But I think a disservice was done to the author because it really needed a bit more work. She wasn't a trained, practiced writer. She could have used more time and assistance but, sadly, editorial help is no longer what it used to be. Anyway, specific examples include the beginning of the book. All of the gynecological stuff might have been better later in the book. The first few pages of the book seemed to be a forced reproduction of the first few pages in the Devil Wears Prada where the secretary is driving around trying to get too much done and everything is going wrong in the circumstances that she finds herself in - all beyond her control. Why it works in the Devil Wears Prada is because that woman is actually writing about what the book is about. Julie and Julia opens up with the author in the gynecologist's office getting bad news while the doctor is wiping off his speculum. (A book about food begins with a gynecologist wiping off his speculum? No no no!) And somewhere from there it goes on about selling her eggs to pay off debt. And then she's in the subway with severe body odor and everyone is crazy and somehow she ends up at the market and she's purchased the items for potato soup. It doesn't work because there was too much information - the type of information that is better given later - after the reader starts to feel like he or she knows the writer and would be more comfortable getting such intimate details. I would have also suggested removing the sections on Paul and Julia because it was off-focus and didn't bring anything to the memoir. Less is always more. Well, you get the point. The author may still sell a lot of copies since the title is a bit deceiving but she will probably have fewer repeat buyers if a second book is in her future.Marketing is the last thing I'll mention. This is clearly a book suited to a certain age group - late 20s/early 30s. The problem is with the fact that Julia Child is an icon, a pioneer really, and she appeals to a lot of people, especially people who have been watching her shows since the beginning and reading her books (the first-edition buyers). It should have been marketed to the specific demographic than as broadly as it was (because of the misinterpretation of the title). Though many younger people would be fine with most of the book, the tone, the language and opinions, I would say that the over 50 crowd might not be OK with all of the profanity, sexual references and general unhappiness that overwhelms what the focus of the book was meant to be - a book about trying to cook all of Julia's recipes in one year in one small place. And unfortunately, many of these hard-core Julia devotees won't really get what the book is about until after they've spent the bucks and are angry about it. I was also left with the impression that Julie didn't really like Julia all that much. I'm curious to see how her next project compares to this. It will be very telling."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I love cooking and eating so any book in which food serves as an integral role or an interesting plot device is appealing. I honestly think that the premise of the book was great in theory, but not as interesting in reality. My biggest complaint with the book was that the events were not strung together well enough to form a compelling plot. The whole book felt like a bunch of amusing blog posts strung together that were interesting, but didn't seem to come with any well definited climax or suspense. I'm sometimes willing to overlook this if the material is written in a beautiful or compelling way, but just did not find that. In addition, I felt like there was too much focus on her rise to fame and not enough on what had actually attracted me to the book in the first place, her cooking experiments and their role in her life. There simply was noting pushing me along to form an emotional connection with the author or to wonder what happened next. I also found it interesting that a book about such decedant and sensual food was written in such a way that the dishes didn't come to life. When I'm reading about food I like to feel like the descriptions make it as if I was tasting the food myself. Instead I personally found her writing voice a little annoying and at times as if it was trying a tad too hard. Granted, this is all a matter of personal taste and what is annoying to one could definitely be amusing or pleasant to another. That said, I'm still giving this book 2 stars because it was still a decent way to pass a plane ride and at the bargain price I found it at ($5.99) I can hardly complain.

It's about the author's life, her husband, her job, her friends, her family, and politics. It's about moving a couch as much as it is about cooking.It's written in a humorously sarcastic style and reflects the author's candid observations about life. She's both introspective, and wry. She definitely has no love for the president, or Republicans in general. If that puts you off, this isn't the book for you.I also agree that she appears to be quite high strung and that the intense focus on her feelings to the almost complete exclusion of everything else can get a little tiresome.I enjoy memoirs, however, even when (perhaps especially when) the protagonist is flawed and human.

Reading should not be a chore. There is so much wrong with it I can't cover it all but here are my major complaints:First of all Julie is downright obnoxious. There is nothing likeable about her. She is whiny, crass, and extremely vulgar. This book is also full of profanity. And I am appalled at her cold feelings towards 9-11 victims. I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. Second, this book has hardly anything to do with cooking. The author mentions the recipes almost as an afterthought.

In my opinion, I didn't understand what Julie Powell was trying to get across to her readers. I was 40 pages into the book and had no idea what I was reading. I thought maybe if I stick it out, things will start to make sense. Well halfway through the book, I was more confused then ever. This book makes no sense. Julie Powell is all over the place with her story. She jumps from one subject to another without finishing what she was talking about in the first place. Very frustrating to follow. By the time I got halfway through this book, I had no idea what I had read. This had to be just about one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read.

They're sort of an afterthought (maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs in a chapter) after the trials and tribulations of her life.

Well I went very wrong, very very very very wrong.The book has nothing to do with cooking, from a woman who seemingly hates food and only started cooking(by her on account) to snag her husband. Why I wonder did the woman choose to do all of the recipes in MTAOFC in 365 instead of truly trying to do the recipes as written and to perfection? I do think as a past reviewer has said that this was Ms. Powell attempt( which she did successfully) to get rich off of the late and great Julia Child.I am not a fan of reading about a very spoiled woman who seems to have no real talent of her own.

I was amused by her trials and tribulations with some of the more arcane recipes and ingredients, and I'm glad she preserved onwards.But afterwards?

Living","review":"It is unusual to read a book, especially a memoir, where you find that the writer (who is supposed to be the protagonist) is not someone you can always emphathize with or even like. This is how I felt many times while reading Julie & Julia, and is probably why many people have a hard time with this book.However I did not walk away feeling the book was entirely without merit.After seeing the movie I was curious about Julie Powell and who she really is. Because if you've seen the movie you know it doesn't go into much detail about her life and really makes the year long project seem like it was a cake walk for the most part. Reading the book or Julie's old blog gives you real insight and it is interesting to see just how opposite the Julie Powell of the movie is portrayed.The thing I can appreciate about Julie once I get past her self-loathing, foul mouth, bad housekeeping, and even her disregard for the sanctity of marriage, is that she succeeded in cooking from a 40 year old cookbook after most of us would have long given up.I can also appreciate her struggle because I lived in Manhattan for a while. I know what it is like to have to shop for food everyday, to have to lug heavy groceries around town, and to cook in a very small ill-equipped kitchen (especially in an old building without modern conveniences). Knowing that makes her feat all the more admirable.I think this book also suffers from poor editing. The story was a little all over the place, she'd talk about a dish she had to make and then stray off into some story about her friend's sex lives. Things didn't flow well and sentences sometimes rambled. I felt at times there was just fluff added to beef up the word count.So while the book at times disgusted me and I couldn't help but judge her, I also found myself rooting for her. I've certainly had jobs I've hated and I've certainly fantacised about becoming a writer so I could quit my 9 to 5. But Julie actually did it, and I can take some inspriation from that.I recommend reading it if you are a foodie or if you liked the movie and are intrigued, but I rented a copy from the library. Also you can still find her old blog online which goes more into the actual day to day cooking trials, whereas the book goes way more personal."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Due to her \\"condition,\\" she may find it rather hard to conceive if she waits \\"too long,\\" and this causes her to suddenly reevaluate her life. Her husband Eric encourages her to start a blog, which she does, called \\"The Julie/Julia Project.\\" Embarking on a year-long project to cook all of the 536 recipes from \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One,\\" we follow Julie Powell through all of her ups and downs, including humorous tidbits about her apartment, her day job, her family and friends, her every day life, and her personal revelations as she \\"masters\\" the art of French cooking.I find I have mixed feelings about this book. It's amusing, has taught me more about French cooking than I ever wanted to know, and made me care a bit about what happened in the real life of a woman I will (most likely) never, ever meet. At times, the book made me laugh aloud, and I found it engaging. Additionally, who doesn't enjoy a bit of schadenfreude now and again when reading about how someone is scrambling somewhat desperately in their efforts not to fail?However, while reading I repeatedly kept wondering: When does she get to the point? To which I then reminded myself that I was essentially reading someone's diary. \\"Real life\\" does not have a point, whereas, most novels I read for pleasure do. Upon completing the novel, however, it still feels \\"unfinished\\" to me. Yes, it does come to an end point, but that doesn't feel like an end, and doesn't entirely seemed to have a point, a solid resolution, or a resounding message of all she learned, ready to be shared with the world. That could just be my opinion of it, however.If you're someone looking for a complete and concise story (possibly, as I did, to compliment your enjoyment of a film), I would not recommend this book to you. If you enjoy reading \\"slice of life\\" stories (that may or may not feel like it has an ending to you), then grab this one, it's certainly got some funny bits in it.One last thing: The deliberately fictional parts about the lives of Julia Child and her husband, Paul, were my favorite parts to this book. They make me look forward to any purely fictional work she may write.Of my rating system, this book gets Three Stars. In the end, I'd consider it an interesting run-through, but, overall, I was left dissatisfied.Originally posted at my book blog, Lady Kay Reviews."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"Never got around to reading this until the recent movie release, so I got on the stick and picked up a copy. (I figured I'd eventually be seeing the film, or hearing from others who did and wanted to be prepared for discussion.)What I found was an enjoyable story about a young woman at a crossroads in her life who decided to try something ambitious and see where she could go with it. Julie Powell's journey through Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and sharing it via blog, was an undertaking I probably would've done at her age, had the Internet been around. I found her character somewhat relatable, as at that age I was unsure as to where I wanted my life to go. (I did briefly entertain the idea of going into the food business, had also wanted to write, and had worked as a secretary just to make a living.)I've read some of the commentary here and felt the reviewers were a bit harsh on Ms. Powell. So she curses like a truck driver -- so do a lot of people I know (neither condemning it nor condoning it). She's not the world's greatest housekeeper (I do have to admit I almost tossed my cookies on reading the maggot incident). She's a Democrat working amongst mostly Republicans, on a post-9/11 initiative. (I don't think she was being irreverent about her work or colleagues.) Nor did I think she was being disrespectful to Julia Child -- quite the contrary, I think she was somewhat in awe of Mrs. Child (but it was easy to get frustrated with the recipes when tackling them after a long day at work or not being able to have things come together easily.)I also admired how loyal (and supportive) Ms. Powell's friends were to her. Not everyone is willing or interested to venture to distant parts (in her case, Long Island City) to sample dishes one would not be making on an everyday basis. And Eric (Ms. Powell's long-suffering spouse) obviously finds something endearing about his wife to tolerate the late dinners, the never ending pile of dishes to tackle, and the constant outbursts...I wonder if my husband would've been able to put up with my tackling a similar project.On the whole, I enjoyed this book, as I could relate to it on many levels. I didn't give it five stars, as I felt that towards the last few chapters, it did get a bit draggy, especially with Ms. Powell complaining whether she'd be able to finish or not (which she did, ultimately)."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

There are moments when the book gets bogged down in some of the blog chat and could possibly have used some more editing, but overall it was an enjoyable and fun read.

This mission was to cook everything in Julia Child's cookbook, \\"Mastering The Art Of French Cooking,\\" one recipe per day for an entire year. Then she would blog about it. As we also know, there was a movie starring Amy Adams as Julie Powell and Meryl Streep as Julia Child. The movie was decent, the book was aggravating, and I would ask that you refrain from reading the book and maybe check out the movie if you wish.In the movie, we see Powell's adventures and how Julia Child began her culinary expeditions. In the book, we hear Julie Powell whine and complain and read letters from Julia Child during the mid-twentieth century. The moaning and groaning is just so much that I could find an equal amount of entertainment in a blog about the hardships of being a parent. Books that are written like this don't need to be published. What's even more hysterical is after this book was published, Powell was now declared a culinary expert and garnered more writing opportunities, one was about meat cleaving.The only reason I am granting this book my original score of two stars out of five that I granted it when I first read it is because it does feature a goal and it does discuss the goal and how it was reached. It still doesn't make a difference between liking and disliking the book.Gaining your fame with something like this is a complete and utter shame."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I got to read a same of the first chapter of the book on my kindle and fell in love with this book! I bought the entire kindle version and could not put it down. What most people would see as \\"whinny\\" is really heavy sarcasm and must not be taken seriously. The author uses such rich vocabulary words and strings them together in such a way as to get one laughing so hard it is sure you make the reader gasping for air and clutching his or her belly. I am sore from laughing so hard!This book is genuine and though she used foul language it is something I have come to expect out of a young persons mouth. She does not try to hide her real self. Julie Powell was 29 and trying to cope with life in New York. She came home one day with a bag of groceries, unknowingly with the exact ingredients for a recipe from Julia Child's recipe for potato and leek soup from her mother's copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which she stole! This book is a memoir of a young lady finding one way to cope with the depressing life after the events of 9/11. She is angry, is insecure with the government, and overall bored with her life. Her blog and experiments with Julia Child's recipes became her life! I myself enjoy trying new recipes and experimenting in my kitchen and find myself in a disaster not unlike some of the ones described in this book. I related well to this memoir. I too am in a situation where sometimes I need a change in routine and inspiration in my life. This book is inspiring to me and was just the thing I needed to get myself laughing and looking at cookbooks, or any challenge for that matter, in a whole new light. Thanks Julie! I really loved this one! I hope you write more novels with your refreshing and hilarious approach on life!One has to overlook the language and read between the lines to get the feel of this witty book.

The plus to working in a book store is that I have access to hundreds of books, can read them, and don't have to purchase them. &lt;3 I am insanely happy I did not buy this book, but am also happy I got to read it.At first Powell was an annoying, self-absorbed, drama queen of a pessimist wrapped into an ego-centric body. Her narrative was off-kilter the entire time, ranging from her friend's sex lives to random family encounters. At times it helped move the book along, other times it took everything to a grinding halt.A teenager blogger comes to mind. It felt like as she was writing she was simply expressing whatever happened to pop into her head at the time. On several occasions she managed to confuse me as to when something happened in conjunction with the present.What also irritated me was that she didn't bother to translate what the French terms were (at least not 'til the last 100 pages!). It would've added to the charm of the book to at least help your readers out a bit!Half-way through the book I thought of just dropping it. Julie was insanely snippy with her husband, wrote badly of him, and was still flipping out over the most mundane of mistakes. But then I realized something; she's sharing herself openly with us. She isn't buttering up her personality. She isn't sugar-coating her tantrums with Eric (who's a saint, btw). She's allowing us to devour her raw.I can't put a negative review on that. Matter of fact, it's the only reason why this is a three-star review and not a one-star. I have massive respect for someone who 1) tackled the Project and finished it and 2) revealed herself so openly to the public.So kudos to you, Powell. You've revealed that you're an annoying, self-absorbed drama queen. But at least you gave it to us without lies to try and make yourself look better.I will defintely read the second book for that sole reason.PS- I see a lot of negative reviews on her usage of the f-word. It's just a word. The more you shy away from it and point with horror-stricken faces, the more power you give it.

Living","review":"Usually when a book is turned into a film, the readers lament on what the film gets wrong and wail that it could never be as good. In this case the film with Meryl Streep and Amy Adams was infinitely better than the book. The book is clogged with needless emotional baggage carted around by Julie Powell. The film just focuses on the food.While the movie bounces back and forth splitting its time equally between 1940's Paris and 2002 Queens, The book focuses predominantly on Julie Powell and her world. In fact in the first half of the book she seems to deal with the 17th century world of Samuel Pepys more than Julia Childe.The book includes a lot of Julie's personal issues that are unrelated to cooking, her biological clock, secrets of her youth, trouble with jobs, family problems with her parents and brother, land ladies and the subway, none of which came out in the film and rightly so. They all serve to clog down the pacing and while Julie is being brutally honest about herself, warts and all, it makes her less sympathetic as a person. While the on screen Amy Adams' Julie sparkles with energy as she drives on her cooking quest, the book Julie repeatedly trips over the self induced emotional baggage of her life seeming less like the corporate drone trying to breath free, than someone well on her way to being wheeled into Bellevue's ER after a hysterical jag over absolutely nothing.The problem is that when she writes about the food and the cooking and even the markets where she gets it, it's fun. If you like cooking it reminds you of when you've attempted challenges and you can say \\"Yeah I did that\\" or more smugly \\"Ha! I side stepped that problem.\\" And for foodies they are good memories. For non-foodies who were terrified away from cooking after their turkey exploded one year or they made a fish even a raccoon won't touch, it will be reassuring to know that everyone makes those sort of mistakes.Julie Powell does not try to hide her flaws, she wants to share it all with the reader and while charmingly open at first, after a while we don't care. She's the friend who won't take advice and won't shut up about her latest string of disasters and doesn't recognize most of it is self inflicted. Tell us about the food, and the cooking, not the nit wits at your job/subway/doctor's office etc. The bottom line here is that if you saw the movie and loved it, stick with the movie. Amy Adams delivers a wonderful performance as Julie Powell overshadowed by Meryl Streep but just a vital to the film. We know she has neurotic moments but we aren't forced to go through every one of them. We can just accept they're bubbling below the surface. In making the film Nora Ephron wisely stripped away the needless detail and left us with the good stuff."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I didn't find the book very interesting. guess i thought there would be more about the trials of cooking Julia's recipes vs about Julie trying to pull a life together.

It encouraged me to get the book, and I found it hilarious, much more so than the movie (though Meryl Streep was her usual Actress Incarnate Self.) . I had no trouble with the F*** words, and even found them on occasion to actually add to the humor (i.e, after quoting her mother, Julie adds an aside; Julie's mother: \\"Would you just stop F***ing cooking!\\" Julie's aside: I come by my sailors mouth honestly). I find being around my wife and children helps me to keep my language under control most of the time, but I had no issue with the level of profanity. While saying it was used judiciously might be an over statement, like salt some spice is good, but I do not feel she over salted it.Kudos for a well written humorous book. Obviously some people just don't get it.If you are looking for a cookbook with lots of recipes, look elsewhere. If you are the type of person who enjoyed Mad magazine as a teenager (say, are slightly iconclastic), then you will love this book.I'm off in search of Cleaving now."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I have never appreciated Nora Ephron so much until I saw what she did with this second class material. It plods along with not enough cooking as well as not enough life. Julie's most interesting scenes in the movie did not come from this book -- they were obviously Nora's creation. I did love the bits of Paul's (Child) letters that separated a few of the chapters.

Blogs, it seems, are the new 'Christmas-card updates' for people who think their lives are interesting to other people. Not so. Fortunately, the movie made ostensibly of this book is delightful.

In all those respects, the book is a failure. The author is not a particularly good cook, does not aspire to get any better, approaches the cooking as a challenge she sets for herself (much as one would memorize the periodic table of elements or read the entire OED), does not lead an interesting (even quirky interesting) life, and has no meaningful insights to offer the reader.I slogged through the book, thankful that I do not know her or her friends.

I found Amy Adams a little more likable than in her previous movies, and Meryl Streep was just spot on. As movies usually leave portions of their namesake books out, I downloaded Julie and Julia to my Kindle to see what I'd missed. That was on August 23; it's now September 11, and I've just finished. I've had plenty of opportunity to read the book in that long time span, but not much to entice me.Frankly, it's rather boring to read about cooking, dirty kitchens, failed recipes, etc., over and over. There's enough of that at my house. Visually, those things only entertained me in the movie. The excerpts from Julia's life were much more interesting in the movie; in the book, they were very, very short, although I realize that the movie had more to work with since Nora Ephron adapted parts of Julia's book, My Life in France, into the movie.Often, a chapter would begin with Julie in a new situation; however, she would veer off topic for a number of pages, and by the time she returned to the subject, it was hard to remember the start.I don't believe I laughed a single time during my reading. Julie's constant complaining and whining became old very fast, and I didn't see that 365 days of cooking made much difference.

This book hasn't changed my life, but it was an interesting take on someone setting a goal and meeting it - however arbitrary and supposedly trivial. The book is one woman's perspective, and if you don't like it, you won't like this book - just as with any book. She talks about being strongly opinionated politically, flipping out on her loving husband, and having a grubby kitchen - things many of us have done in one way or another. She describes how setting a goal related to something in life that she loves, rather than the job she is compensated for, frustrates and fulfills her. She finds her interests and talents later in life. Yes, she drinks, curses, and mocks strange and delusional suggestions related to the events of 9/11.

Living","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I only got this book based on the fact that I loved the film. In my experience the books are always better than the film, so it was with much much anticipation that I got this novel. In fact I bought it in December and saved it to read on my honeymoon in Feb. I was that excited.By the time I got half way through, I was wondering if I was somehow able to get a refund, even a partial one.To say this book is the most awful thing I have ever read is wrong. But it is up there with some real doozies.The problem for me is three fold... 1. Julie Powell is NOT a professional writer. Not by a long shot. The writing lacks the flow needed to take the reader from one idea to the next. Instead, she jumps around so frequently that I found myself turning pages to see if I had accidentally skipped ahead. Her use of brackets is astonishing. She uses these as a way of avoiding paragraphs. The bracket starts and 15 sentences later she is still rambling on about something or other). Oh, and it would be nice if the brackets closed too... Unlike in the film which made Julie a wanna-be writer, the real Julie is a frustrated actress, and boy does it show. Which brings me to point 2.The Julie Powell the writer is a self-obsessed, neurotic, narcissistic drama queen. And worse - she's the BORING kind who thinks that her little idiosyncracies make her somewhat exciting. Blerg!!! Her contempt for the people around her who lead way more interesting lives is astonishing, and can be summerised for me in the spat attack she had when her brother dared hint that perhaps her friend is NOT THE MARRYING KIND. Of course dear Julie straight away thinks that he is saying that she is, and causes an argument. She is an awful character. And what makes this worse is that this is not a made up character, unless Julie decided to take some creative flair. Either way, real or not, the Julie in the book is so unlikeable that reading about her, through her eyes, is a journey into culinary hell.3. I was hoping for some passion, some love of food in this book. But no. Rather, the cooking part is just the hook to make you buy this book. Julie appears to hate cooking, and her descriptions of food are so mundane that I found myself losing my appetite. Books that concern cooking should make you salivate. A brilliant example of a writer who paints food with his words in Anthony Bourdain. Perhaps dear Julie could call him up and ask for a lesson...There is so much more I could say, but at the end of the day I couldn't bring myself to even finish this book.

If you're a reader looking for a half-n-half Julie Powell/Julia Child memoir, look elsewhere. This book is about Powell's culinary journey through Child's recipes. This book does not contain Child's recipes (copyright and all, I'm sure) which will upset the most loyal foodie.At first, I didn't think that I'd like Powell, or the book. The first couple of pages nearly turned me off of it. First, there are disjointed jumps from one scene to another -- with completely NO transition. One moment she's doing one thing, and boom, you're in a new scene -- no in between. This could have been helped with tighter editing. Second, the first three pages were stuffed with shock value: selling her eggs to pay down credit card debt. Reading that tidbit I thought: Hey Lady...way too much information. I don't even know you and you're hitting me over the head with this?But, Powell doesn't stop. And soon, page after page of revelations, dinner disasters and successes become...fun. Yeah, she's blunt and curses a lot. She isn't always nice to her husband or her mother or her brother or her friends. And she despises Republicans (I think that this is part of the reason for the one star reviews and intense hatred for Powell.)But she is brave -- she doesn't pretend that she's some omniscient, five-star Cordon-Bleu Culinary Goddess that her \\"bleaders\\" (blog readers or readers) should all bow down too. She reveals her shortcomings, mistakes and -- well, everything. Sometimes, when people write their biographies or memoirs, they leave out details or embellish to make themselves more likable. Powell, at least, is honest and real with her audience. Sometimes, I'd end up laughing out loud; other times I'd wonder where she was coming from. Her honesty is the one reason why I couldn't put her book down.I haven't seen the movie, or read her blog, so I have nothing to compare the book too. Those readers who can't understand why she's so forthright, should look at pages 96-97 in \\"Julie and Julia,\\": Powell takes her aesthetic from Samuel Pepys -- an English Naval Administrator -- who kept a diary of his life.Powell writes, \\"What I think is that Sam Pepys wrote down all the details of his life for nine years because the very act of writing them down made them seem important, or at least singular....There's a dangerous confessional thrill to opening up your eminently fascinating life and brain to the world at large, and the Internet makes it all so much faster and more breathless and exciting...It's one thing to chronicle your sexual and social missteps to satisfy your private masochistic urges, but sharing them with the world at large? Surely there are some limits, aren't there.\\"With Powell, I guess there is none...but it's well worth the journey. I didn't think I'd like Powell or her book --- but I do now, and I enjoyed the book immensely."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It's not until her husband introduces her to the new world of blogging that she discovers she may have been born to write. The story is well written and uplifting, although long narrations about boiling lobsters and extracting bone marrow can be a bit unsettling. Reading the other reviews and the critics' reviews, I thought it was going to be more humorous and fast moving.

Perhaps she's exaggerating for comic effect, but as is, she initially comes across as the worst caricature of a Gen-X, would-be New York hipster: mean-spirited, self-absorbed, foul-mouthed, rude, whiny, and intolerant of anyone she suspects of not sharing her self-consciously outre (i.e., monogamous married life is \\"bourgeois\\", but the woman operating an S&M; dungeon in mid-town Manhattan is \\"awesome!\\") values. Most of the way through the book, I almost felt sorry for Julie Powell, because she didn't seem to really get much enjoyment out of anything in her life, in spite of having a loving, supportive husband and family.On reflection, though, I felt that my earlier review was too harsh, because Powell does actually grow up a little and mellow out towards the end, and becomes much more endearing as a result. She can be very amusing at times, and I respect her willingness to let people see her struggles and failings and foibles (although I could have done without the blaspheming, and with fewer descriptions of her strident political biases and her friends' sexual escapades, which in my opinion didn't really add much to the book).

I thought she had an engaging voice and an admirable quest. Even though I'm vegetarian and the thought of boiling a lobster alive sickens me, I liked the idea of a downtrodden secretary taking the reins and finding some meaning in her life.Powell does ramble sometimes, but the book has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to make up for it. And her stick-to-it-iveness makes her a fun protagonist to root for.I would recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor and is not Republican (she does whale on the GOP a lot)."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

My Mom had a copy that was always on the shelf in the kitchen, and it turns out she gave copies to all her friends when I was little. I was visiting one set of godparents recently and they showed me their copy, which was actually inscribed from me, aged about 1 1/2, saying \\"Thank you for babysitting me.\\" And when other other godparents both passed away last year, my sister inherited the dining table, china and cookbook, including a copy from my Mom saying, \\"Thank you for being such a gracious hostess.\\"So we could relate to Julie - a second-generation inheriter of the book but hapless cook and confused about the direction of her life. I thought it was rollicking good fun all the way through, but then as she got closer to her goal and talked about the impact it had on her, I found myself weeping uncontrollably. I cry all the time at movies, but almost never when reading a book. I found this book not just funny, but an inspiring tale about pursuing excellence and conquering difficult challenges, and about giving meaning to your life at a time when you're feeling lost."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

She and her husband have just moved to a tiny, cramped apartment in Queens, NY above a pizza shop. She works full time at a just so so government job, and is unsure what to do with her life. Julie does love to eat, she loves to cook, so she comes up with an idea to cook every single recipe in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking cookbook. She plans to do this all in one year and there are over 500 recipes. Every day she blogs about her cooking experience, and soon she becomes quite popular out there in cyberspace.She becomes totally obsessed with her project, and fortunately for her she has a supportive husband on her cheering squad.If you see the movie, I think you will agree the Meryl Streep was just fabulous as Julia Child. She sounded just like her, and she too had a supportive husband like Julie, who encouraged her to pursue her interest in cooking, even though she was in her 40's when she did.It was amazing how they combined Julie Powell's story with Julia Child's : My Life in Paris story. Laugh out loud moments you will want to experience again and again.Had I just read the book (Julie Powell's true story) and not seen the movie, I might have been a little less enthusiastic with this review, and Julie, was a bit of a whiner, or to me, that is how she came across. This was one feel good story, that I will be talking about every opportunity I get.

I'll admit that. And a blog junkie, I'll admit that too. When I picked up Julie & Julia, my inner pseudo-foodie was what propelled me to do so. I knew nothing about this book except that it had something to do with Julia Child.So the main character, Julie...I can identify with her. Youngish, married, watching her single friends go on with their lives, a working drone looking for something more...I get that. There was some humor...hey, I use the same library of curse words when I have disasterous cooking experiments. But then, the book got, well, DARK.Specifically, the gross factor. I'm not talking about the unusual foods she cooked. No, I am talking about the vivid writings about all the various environmental hazards that the main character was working around while conducting these cooking experiments. It amazed me that, even though this is a work of fiction, that the main character and everyone who ate her food didn't die of some sort of horrible food borne illness.So...two stars for a main character I can sort of identify with and that dash of humor. Minus three stars for reducing me to tears with the plumbing bits and the fly thing.

I had never heard of Julie Powell and the first time I heard of her blog was in this book. From the very first chapter, though, I was engaged with the book because I felt she was so like myself: 29(well, I'm 30 now, as she turned in the book)and diagnosed with PCOS - as I was myself last year - married, and not entirely satisfied with her life. I was hooked from Chapter 1. I enjoyed reading about her messy life and the messy lives of her friends every bit as much as I enjoyed reading about her hilarious anecdotes about her cooking experiences. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, certainly, but why would you expect this book to be entirely about cooking. This is a memoir - no one's life is ever just about one thing, and if this book HAD been only about cooking, it would not have been nearly as much fun. Or even a true memoir, for that matter. I think it is hilarous that some reviewers criticized Julie for being an amateur cook - I believe that was the point of the project: to tackle something new and different.I say thanks, Julie, for inspiring me to find a project to commit myself to - to find purpose in something I can be passionate about."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

A story of a woman feeling lost and wondering where life would lead, taking on a slightly irrational project that became all consuming, who inspires an unlikely mix of characters while finding her own path of sorts along the way.

The first passage I read involved a leftover charlotte cake that the author carried to her workplace to share. Unfortunately she dropped the cake en route and the dish was smashed. She served the cake anyway, but went around the office to warn a select few (those who shared her political affiliation) to avoid the cake because it probably contained ceramic dish shards and traces of antifreeze from the street surface. I had to read this passage twice to confirm it was as horrifying as my first impression. Then I trashed the book. Normally I give away used books, but this one is too toxic to pass along.

It's no wonder Child herself was reportedly unimpressed by the blog that led to this book and the film. Do you want to read a book full of incoherent, wandering diatribes against Republicans, Christians, and just wholesome living in general? Then you will love this book and undoubtedly, the author as well. There are few chapters that don't rail against the \\"what would Jesus do\\" bracelet-sporting co-worker, or the \\"evil Republicans,\\" who she is happy to use for her own selfish ends (The Republicans have provided her with her job; when she is desperate for wine advice, she turns to a Republican).Having seen the movie, it is remarkable how much effort Nora Ephron had to expend in order to re-write the character of Julie; 'movie' Julie is almost charming in comparison to 'novel' Julie. If Julie had been portrayed in the film as she describes herself in the novel, I doubt even Meryl Streep's mighty cinematic power could have saved the film.So: Skip the book. See the film. Read \\"My Life in France,\\" by Julia Child. It's a book worth reading, written by an intelligent, likeable woman, who exhibits none of the venom or hatred Julie Powell enjoys spewing."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It sounded like a lot of fun but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.JULIE AND JULIA follows the adventures of disgruntled government worker Julie Powell as she tries to find meaning in her life right after 9/11. Julie is about to turn 30and decides that she needs a project. She decides to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING over one year and blog about it. This memoir chronciles that project.The subject matter of this memoir had such potential but it ended up plodding along from one recipe to the next. Powell occasionally spices up the book with tidbits from her personal life and those of her friends. However, the book came to feel as if it were a list of recipes with a few life vignettes in between. I found it to be really slow. Powell herself seems to be charming and the reader is left wanting to know more about her and her life. Overall, however, the book fell flat for me. Perhaps the movie will prove more entertaining.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended. The idea is great but the execution is poor.

It could say stuff you don't like. Most the folks I know are real tired of that sort of holier-than-thou posturing.On the other hand, I felt like I was reading a book one of my friends had written. The narcissism gets a little grating, but that's what we're like. That's the nature of the 30s 40s crowd. The swearing... well, again, I don't know too many people who don't talk that way. But the general sense of loss of purpose, of grandiose plans gone to hell, of plain old existential angst is far too familiar. One day we all realize that if you look like a marketing guy, work as a marketing guy, and aren't actively writing, painting, acting, inventing, crafting, whatever-- guess what? You're a marketing guy.On a more practical level, it's one of those books that, as Julie herself describes, demonstrates all the possibilities out there to see a world larger than the one you'd settled into. It's the kind of book that makes you think 'huh, wonder what I could dive into?'It's funny. I've laughed aloud while reading it. It's maybe a bit longer than needed, but it's easy reading. I'd definitely recommend it to chefs and foodies, but it's not really a food book as much as a \\"coming of age\\" back for those of us who have found ourselves making multiple return visits to ages that end in 0."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

(She digs her husband, though).While in this state of unrest, Julia happens upon her Mom's copy of Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (a book, by the way, that is currently sitting at #66 on Amazon's bestselling books today - I bought the book myself after reading Julie & Julia) and decides she is going to cook her way through the book and blog about it. The writing ends up being about much more than cooking. Through an unorthodox writing style that includes much strategically placed profanity, we learn all about Julia's husband, her friends, and her co-workers.

Living","review":"It's amazing that one little book has such a wide variety of reviews. With as many one star as five star verdicts you can't help but wonder at such enthusiasm at both ends of the spectrum. I thoroughly enjoyed this engaging biography but can see both sides of the argument. There IS a lot of profanity and more than a few melt-downs. Over and above all that I still saw the author's joy in her year long project to cook her way through a Julia Child classic cookbook. And if she didn't always enjoy the cooking she definitely enjoyed consuming the results. She is a woman who finds deep satisfaction in feeding her friends and family, in bringing a disparate group to her table and leaving them nourished and satisfied. For those who were appalled at how often she gave out too much information about sex and politics I can only wonder at what rock they've been living under. TMI is the norm in these Reality TV overloaded days. Julie Powell and her book is very much a product of the reigning culture.While giving us an intimate portrait of her life we also see the less than glamorous side of living in the Big Apple. Their decaying apartment and its woes gave me the willies and I had never given any thought to the difficulty of a long subway ride home with numerous bags of groceries, including large bags of cat food and litter for her pets. I found it very easy to understand why her temper was frequently blown before she ever tackled her daily recipe. Many reviewers dismissed her as a narcissisicitic whiner. I felt such a judgement was unfair. She wasn't shy about faithfully describing her cooking disasters but I saw someone who, though meal preparation did not come easily, nevertheless muscled on until she prevailed. Certainly there were meals that bombed and she complained accordingly but there were many more successes and she was always faithful to give credit to any and all who helped make that happen. I found her friends and family tales varied and amusing and doubt she gave away any information about them that they had not approved.While I enjoyed her description of recipes she tackled I'm not sure I could have joined her at the table. One thing that did cause me to cringe throughout her tales was her and her husband's cavalier disregard for cleanliness. They might have been able to eat with cat hair piling up and maggots under the drainboard but I certainly could not! Still, I wouldn't have missed reading about it and look forward to her next book with pleasure. Apparently she is now tackling the art of butchering meat. Remembering her description of gathering marrow from bones in JULIE AND JULIA hopefully she has acquired the proper tools for this latest adventure."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Some people have said it's misleadingly titled, that it's a disappointment to discover that the book's more about Julie Powell's personal life than about Julia Child, the famed chef, or how to cook like Julia Child. I didn't buy it to learn how to cook, or even to learn about someone else learning how to cook. I bought it because I wanted to read about someone's journey (destination unimportant), and have a good time doing it. \\"Julie & Julia\\" was hilarious, endearing, very well written, and profound. It was about so much more than cooking - it was about the writer's use of tackling the Julia Child tomb of French food as a way to rediscover her own path and joy in life. I'd buy a book called \\"Jim and Jimmy\\" about some guy named Jim tracing Jimmy Carter's campaign trail back in the day for the same reasons, assuming it was as funny and honest as \\"Julie & Julia.\\" And I'm not even that interested in politics - or French cooking, for that matter. Furthermore, I did not get the impression that \\"Julie didn't really like Julia all that much,\\" as observed by one customer reviewer. Au contraire. Julie's outbursts at some of Julia's more maddening recipes seemed loaded with affection and respect. They also seemed to compliment Julia Child's own salty attitude towards cooking and life in general, from what I've read. As for the \\"late 20s/early 30s\\" demographic recommended, I'm crawling up the backside of 40 myself, and in no way did I find her book to be age-specific. That's the beauty of an honest, well-written story - it defies words like marketing, demographics, and strategies. It just is.

(Doesn't all gourmet cooking do that by definition?) Why blame that on her? She also lives in the most expensive city in the US - her salary makes her poor there, she isn't exaggerating at all. She is a young woman living in New York - duh. So she curses and drinks and talks about sex. Big deal.But on to the book - This is an unadorned look at a journey in someone's life, which happens to involve cooking and the divine Julia Child hovering over it all as sort of a cooking life-coach/ fairy godmother.....it isn't a cook book per se. The focus is on a discovery of self - it's a memoir. If you are looking for the wrong thing in a book - why blame the book? Blogs are diaries - remember them, those unvarnished outpourings of life's melodramatic struggle? That is what this is, albeit a bit more polished. I though it was intriguing and read it all in a short time - I wanted to see how she did. Maybe one needs to be at the age of self discovery or open to changes in lifes plan to see the merit.I loved it, you may not, But it is an interesting journey to read, very uplifting and real. Her writing brings you into the story, you feel a real kinship...And there's butter...lots and lots of butter.*By the way, she isn't mean to 9/11 survivors families as claimed by one review. The woman is not Ann Coulter, just someone who had a rather thankless job wherein she had to field a lot of PR complaints over things she had no control over. The rebuilding effort of the towers site is a political football in reality. Lighten up, people. You are seeing things that aren't there. And the reason that she is upset about her biological clock is that she was diagnosed with a chronic health problem, PCOS, which she will have to deal with for the rest of her life, making her very prone to infertility and certain cancers. There is no cure, no effective treatments - look it up those of you who accuse her of whining.

Julie Powell was 29 years old, for crying out loud; she was (and I'm sure is) smart, creative, funny and honest. Quadruple whammy of \\"gifts\\" (or curses) - what would you do with a frantic soul? I don't know about you, but I am completely inspired by the idea of taking a concrete project with set parameters, and attempting to focus that all that energy on Just Plain Doing It.As an artist myself, I love artistic busywork; it frees your mind, streamlines your frenzy, and lets the people you live with have at least some vague idea of what to expect. I also love to cook, but only if it's monumental - I think Julia Child was a perfect choice, as opposed to, say, all the recipes in the Time-Life Casserole book.So my point is, that Julie's experience appears to be VERY focused on the food she is recreating; maybe not so much in a physics-of-cooking kind of way, but, as she says, in the sexiness of handling, serving, and experimenting with it. My personal favorite form of self expression (that I can write here) is drawing what I see - to me, that is infinitely more fascinating to me and translatable to others than drawing what only I can imagine. Seems like that's what this book is about. Meat and Potatoes French Cooking. And why would she, or anyone, WANT to seperate their everyday lives from their \\"project\\"? What would be the reason for that?And for the comments from those who are put off by Julie's dissatisfaction with her life at the time, it would be horribly depressing to read a book by someone who just loved answering phones and changing toner, wouldn't it? I mean, look at what she HAS done - what do people want from other people? Lighten up.

I picked this up from my library and at no time did I a) expect to have recipes included or b) expect to find a serious discussion of food and the art of cooking. This was from a \\"project\\" created by Julie Powell to distract her from otherwise ho-hum, dreary life, people! She never claimed to be a great chef, and I don't remember her saying that she aspired to become a great chef after completing this project of hers. Cut her some slack!As for the book itself, I loved it! As a fellow frustrated foodie, I totally understood her rants in the kitchen. In fact, I thought about how often my husband has said \\"When will that be done, so I can leave and come back?\\" when I have been trying out a new recipe. You see, I too swear like a sailor in my tiny kitchen when things don't \\"work\\", when I drop something or can't find the measuring cup I need, or the spoon will barely move through the mixture. Who can remain blissful and zen-like when dinner is on the line? (well, maybe those heating up frozen dinners.....)I'm a displaced Democrat from Indiana now living in North Carolina. I understand Julie's Democratic frustrations all too well. I also understand completely her frustration with the world of public service, as it can be alternately mind-numbing and blood-boiling work trying to serve the needs of the many diverse people we come into contact with every day. Not work for the squeamish, I guarantee!I hope that having completed her project, Julie Powell feels much better about herself and her life. She committed to this for a year, she completed the task, and she now deserves a well-earned break.

Face it, J&J; is chick lit (and not Christian chick lit).I had purchased J&J; when it was first released and put it aside because the language turned me off like an overly f'ed Eddie Murphy movie.

If you're an over-sensitive, self-righteous right-winger with absolutely no sense of humor, then I submit you probably wouldn't enjoy it, so don't go out and buy/borrow it and trash the overall rating of this book with your negative criticism that focuses on your opinion of the author personally and detracts from what the book is about and its clever writing.This is a MEMOIR, people. The author is being herself both in her writing style/language and her opinions. That's what a memoir is. Why should she change the way she speaks or modify her views to please anyone? You don't have to agree with her to enjoy the book for what it is, a humorous account of a year-long cooking project and her blog writing that resulted from it and subsequently became the book.If you're any type of foodie, amateur gourmet or even just the occasional home cook, you should really enjoy this book. And even if you're none of these, you should still appreciate the original idea for a memoir and Powell's writing. I found some parts laugh-out-loud funny, like dragging a live lobster home from Manhattan, or interesting such as when she goes in search of bone marrow. I also enjoyed the interstices of Julia and Paul Child that the author imagined and constructed throughout the book. She has a tremendous amount of respect for Julia that comes through regardless of what you think of Julie as a person.I recommended this book for our monthly book club and we're all planning to emulate Julie's efforts by creating some of Julia's recipes ourselves and sharing our experiences (along with the food) at our next meeting.

When I tell him it's about a woman who is cooking her way through a Julia Child cookbook, he looks nonplussed. The author, Julie Powell, reads her own work very well; her intonation and comedic timing are dead on. She is very irreverent ( I love how she refers to Julia Child as \\"JC\\"!) and does have a fairly foul mouth, but I have to say that I find this refreshing. So many foodie books seem to take themselves all too seriously. Like my favorite food writer Ruth Reichl, Julie Powell shows that she loves food but isn't a Food Snob.

The movie wasn't good either by the way - except for the parts with Meryl Streep - she was fabulous, as always, but there was way too little of her.This book was disgusting in so many ways, i.e. foul language, graphic depictions; things that could have been enjoyable to read were ruined by the way the author expresses herself.Do not purchase this book unless you would enjoy hearing this author: (1) belittle everyone in New York; (2) make fun of the victims of 9-11; (3)lament about her body odors including the smell of her own waste product; (4) vividly describe the infestation of maggots, flies, cat hair, etc. in the very kitchen she uses to make all the food from Julia Child's cookbook (and serves to her friends); (5) bash the people she works with, and all other conservatives she repeatedly calls \\"Republicans\\" in a vein to equate this term with something most vile, and so on.To illustrate what I am trying to convey, here is an excerpt from the book (she is talking about the death of Julia Child): It's the death that all wish for - well, either that or finding out you have a terminal brain tumor and going out and assassinating some plutocratic M____ F____ (words spelled out in book) who's systematically destroying America's democracy brick by brick, before you get shot down in a rain of glory. Or maybe that's just me.The entire book is like this - I kept reading hoping for some more flavor of Julia Child - but it doesn't get better.In fact, it gets most decidedly worse because at the end of the paperback version, there is an excerpt from this author's next book. Apparently, she has gone on to become a butcher, and the new book is even more graphic and depressing. She waxes on about her love of dismembering animals, and her admiration for the work of Jack the Ripper.Awful, distasteful, sad.She is right about one thing I am certain - Julia Child would not have liked her, not in the least.I am so sorry I contributed monetarily to this author when I purchased this book."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Most of the book is about her sex life, and that of her friends - which I couldn't care less about. This is supposed to be a book about her cooking her way through Julia Child's book. It isn't. I found the vulgar language she uses constantly to be offensive. I find her disregard for the feelings of others (her husband, her \\"friends,\\" her mother, 9-11 victims, New Yorkers, vegetarians, and anyone else who appears in the book) to be offensive, and her blantant hatred for anyone who is Republican - even going so far as to thank \\"the six Democrats at my erstwhile government agency\\" and childishly insulting Republicans any chance she can get. Why is she doing this?? Her humor is contrived - it gets old and BORING after a while, she rotates between whining and boasting about her accomplishments. She is not likeable at all. Another thing I find very disturbing is the presumptuousness of having not only reading group questions included, but also an interview with the author as well as her suggestions for further reading AND an excerpt from her next book!! I couldn't even finish THIS book - I certainly don't care what she suggests I read further. I am not even going to donate this book and subject this horrible person on an unsuspecting public. The movie is lovely, the book is NOT.

Only at the second (or was it third) ending did I hold out any hope that Santa finally delivered Julie Powell's much overdo maturity. I was hoping for some more parallels to Julia Child.

Living","review":"Julie & Julia is one young woman's attempt to infuse meaning and purpose into her life on the eve of her 30th birthday. Julie Powell was a 29YO New Yorker, married but childless, working for an undisclosed government agency after 9-11, and supposedly suffering from a \\"syndrome\\" that would turn her into a bloated and hairy beast in the near future. Educated, gifted, and stubborn, Julie takes it upon herself to work her way through all the recipes of Julia Childs' classic, Mastering the Art of French Cooking or MtAoFC as Julie calls it in her memoir. At her husband's suggestion, she starts a blog of her culinary adventures. Before she knows it, cooking her way through MtAoFC becomes THE focus of her life and she finds the meaning and purpose that eluded her.We get far more than a cooking diary here. We meet Julie's family and friends and the romantic adventures of girlfriends in her age group; we learn about Julie's fears and intense dislikes (Republicans, mostly); we meet her typically annoying bureaucrat bosses and marginalized coworkers. The girl does not hold back; she cusses like the proverbial sailor and is not cowed by those who tell her that her language \\"really adds nothing\\" to the story. Who cares? This is hormonal, unadulterated Julie. Her trash mouth is just part of her charm. If harsh language offends, you might want to pass on this read.What's wonderful about this book is seeing how one stubborn person with resolve can bring her life back from quiet desperation, or in Julie's case, mouthy desperation. It's refreshing to see that it's possible to do something about the emptiness of post-modern life, and it doesn't involve vast sums of money. It involves vast sums of butter and determination. Most of us won't be taking on any projects like Julie, but it's still a lot of fun to read about someone else doing it.Many reviewers gave up on the story early because of language, etc. This is not a cooking book. Julie doesn't claim to be a gourmand and she says so a few times. This is more of a 30-something urban female memoir that happens to have cooking as a central element. Each chapter begins with creative nonfiction letters from Julia Child and her husband Paul when they were living in Paris in the 1940s. Julie is no gourmand now, but there's no telling what she'll become. After all, Julia Child didn't learn to cook until her late-30s.I highly recommend Julie & Julia for a fun and inspiring read."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Any reference to Julia Child is a lame attempt at transfer."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I was very surprised by this book. I like the premise - blogging about cooking all the recipes in a classic, challenging cookbook and finding joy and a new career along the way. But the main character in this book is hateful. She comes across as that dorky co-worker in the cubicle next to you that you never wanted to know. Dorky is not hateful, but complete lack of character is. She envies her friends when they gravitate towards loser-behavior. (Her friend purposefully puts herself in the position of being used by a cheesy married man and Julie envies her.) She is ungrateful for what she has. She seems to think infidelity is cool. She's terrible to her husband and seems to have no control over her behavior and outbursts. She tells us how she puts the butter in her husband's bag without him knowing, as if that is cute and impish. It's closer to evil. She's afraid of turning into her mother, but aside from her mother's childish and disrespectful response to blog reader Clarence, the character in this book is much worse than her mother. She finds out when she's a child that her dad fell out of love with her mother and you wonder if Julie is testing her spouse's limits to see if he'll do the same. There are some mysteries in the book: Why would a guy as good as Eric stay with Julie in a city where there is a good-man drought? Why would anyone eat at her maggot-infested apartment? Why don't they hire a cleaning service, at least once? It's clear that she is very nave and she doesn't know what it's like to date in the city or be in the midst of any kind of real hardship/war/tragedy. Her analogies are out of touch to the point of being painful, and she makes Democrats and liberals look really bad. The writing in the beginning is very bad, but picks up a little later. But I didn't give the book a one-star rating because, believe it or not, there are some pluses. For one thing, look at all the reviews. If a book is truly bad, I don't think this many people will feel moved to write. She gives us a character that we love to hate. She's everything we don't want to be. She describes herself as dirty, flabby, petty, hints at being bad in bed, not too bright, definitely not worldly, etc. Doesn't that honesty sort of make her a good writer? If she was truly narcissistic, wouldn't she cover up those aspects of her personality? (Unless she's just that clueless?!) In fact, she is honest enough to let the reader see that Eric and her brother are much better humans than she. Also, her descriptions of the cooking process are actually good and it's very cool that she finished each recipe, no matter what it took. The movie was delightful. I remember thinking the main character in the movie was dorky, but not hateful. In conclusion, I would read this book, but I'd get it at the library."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It was an interesting enough premise and this author can certainly write well, but I found her to be more than a little self-absorbed. Also, I thought she shared a little too much information about herself, her husband, her family and friends. Then, there is the matter of her four-letter words. If they bother you, beware! I kept waiting for the author to grow up a little. She seemed a little cavalier in the way she talked about the aftermath of 9/11, particularly about victims' families, the \\"government agency\\" she worked for, and people with a genuine interest who wanted to do something to help. I kept wondering if this was all part of the way she was coping/not coping with the events, herself. If so, that was never explained. Then there were parts of the book I found very off-putting, such as her dirty kitchen, flies and maggots. Unlike \\"Under the Tuscan Sun,\\" this book did not make me hungry.

It obviously has significant amount of text devoted to cooking but it is not the majority - the majority is devoted to the unlikeable Julie and her generally unlikeable friends.

I certainly hope she wasn't trying to paint herself in a more favorable picture because she does not come across as a nice person, treating her husband horribly and being a crappy friend. More than the crummy writing, what irritated me most about this book is that she takes on this 'project' and then seems to learn nothing at all from it! I don't mean cooking skills because she had to have picked up something along the way -- and could you actually talk about that in your book, the cooking part, instead of what is going on with your friends or what other drama you have created in your vodka gimlet stupors -- but actually growing as a person. For example, in either of A.J. Jacobs books you can see him develop as a person, change and grow from what he is attempting to do. Here, Julie just becomes more self-centered and full of herself becuase some people are following her blog. Julia Child thinks you are a joke, doesn't that say something as to how your 'project' is going? I would not recommend this book to anyone as it was terrible and am sorry that it has recieved as much attention as it has for I know that others will be spending hard-earned money on garbage.

I agree with many of the negative reviews below that this is a self-absorbed, whiney author. I found each chapter repetitive - drinking her gimlets, not having sex with her husband, her try-too-hard-to-be-eccentric friends. This book is a case in point that a popular-blog-does-not-a well-written, well-conceived-book-make. I would recommend Ruth Reichl's memoirs or Peter Mayle's tales of French food and experiences. Or Julia Child's \\"My Life in France\\" (haven't read that one, but it has *got* to be better than this.) This book is a poor choice for a reader, a foodie or anyone who abhors whining."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I could only take so much of the how cute/what a mess/how miserable am I that the author is more focused on in her writings. There is really nothing to learn from this book. If you enjoy reading about food and cooking, may I suggest reading Amanda Hesser's books or The Supper of the Lamb: A Culinary Reflection, written by Robert Farrar Capon. At least you'll find a more enjoyable book where you can actually benefit from the reading, other than getting more and more irritated with useless information about the author.Julie Powell had never cooked an artichoke in her life before, besides of stocking of all G*d-awful things, Wonderbread, in her pantry. What would anybody learn from her about food and the art of cooking it? And why exactly do I care that she wore purple go-go boots with a Miss Piggy sweater when she was a youngster, a tidbit apparently Powell deems as necessary to repeat. It's the equivalent of what seems to be the common trend nowadays when folks, lacking any personality whatsoever, claim to have been a \\"nerd\\" in high school. (I think that if one was really a \\"nerd,\\" one wouldn't really come forward with that information, most likely because the experience was traumatizing enough in itself. What is a \\"nerd\\" anyways? It's only a term someone made up to feel better than the rest.)Equally irritating, I also did not appreciate her comments about, God forbid, she was becoming a secretary. Not everybody has the luxury to gripe about working in an office. I fail to see what is possibly wrong with having a good honest job that pays the bills. I think that pretty much describes us all. Such is life, and how you make life more meaningful is what makes life more interesting, other than being just a person who works in an office. There is glory to be had in working mundane jobs, just as there is glory to found in doing daily mundane tasks, such as cooking. I find it appalling that the author could not make a connection between the two.Save yourself the aggravation, and skip this one."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I ultimately put the book down 3/4 of the way through because I just couldn't stand to read one more entry in which the author freaks out again. I loved the idea of the book and just to be fair I went and checked out the authors blog. It is indeed hilarious and I could see why the book was much anticipated among her followers. Surprisingly enough, many people had no idea that the book doesn't contain any actual recipes. To those particular reviewers, I say shame on you b/c the very least you could have done was skim through the book prior to buying it or taking it out of the library. I knew instantly that it didn't have any recipies. Like DUH!!!!! Anyway, I gave this book 2 stars b/c the quality of the writing was not that good and the author is very whiny. I was especially disgusted by her comments on 9/11. I felt that they were so cold and careless to the victims and her lack of work ethic (or whatever you want to call it) was APPALLING. Unlike other chick lit authors whose characters struggle throughout the book to find a new job/man/etc.. all this author did was whine and complain about it. I have no patience for that and as a NYS taxpayer I could not help but wonder did she write her blog while at work? Obviously she hated everything about her job and wouldn't quit until the book deal was done as far as I could tell. I also disliked the political bashing - mainly b/c I felt it added nothing to her \\"quest\\". And speaking of quest... I get that Julie was on a \\"quest\\" to finish something she started. But really, who cares? It just wasn't that funny... As far as the cursing is concerned, I could care less. I noticed it and then I moved on. Perhaps this book would be better on audio tape. I suspect it might but only if you take it out of the library.

But I couldn't stand the author's personality style as it came through in her writing. It's not so much that she uses the F-word a great deal, but the fact that she is a whiney, crybaby, mean-spirited person. I feel sorry for her husband for having to put up with her histrionics.

Living","review":"As with many other people, I read this book because I saw the movie. And let me make this clear... if you only read the first 140 pages or so you will most definitely despise the author. She is genuinely crude, sarcastic, self centered, and slathers everything with a thick layer of disdain. I can personally say that I would probably hate her if I were to meet her. What I will say is this: while she was not the adorable and lovable character that Amy Adams portrayed her to be, she still found herself through food.Julie Powell is completely raw and gritty in this story of the 'Project' but that I think became some of her charm in the end. Her distinct frankness ends up being slightly refreshing in the end if only you can bring yourself to wade through the muck at the beginning. It is not a book that is well written, nor is it a book that I would consider to be inspiring, but if you read between the lines and compare the first chapter to the last... you can certainly see how Mrs. Powell came to a state of self improvement. She is not a good cook by the sounds of it, and I can certainly see how Julia Child would have been insulted, but J. Powell's efforts were in my opinion sincere if not always executed correctly because of one reason or another.I am giving this book three stars. It was not written very well, nor is Julie a very likable protagonist in her memoir, but she is certainly relatable with a very coarse and sometimes hilarious sense of humor from time to time. I don't feel that it deserves more stars simply because as a whole it is a lackluster work, but it doesn't deserve much less either. She still captures her life in complete honesty without any reserves and that I think is commendable. It takes guts to be that honest, and to be that honest with the world takes a lot of confidence. That confidence I believe came from her challenge to cook through Julia Child's MtAoFC.If you buy it, at least finish the book. To quit before the 150 page mark is to miss out on the gradual transformative experience that the author lived. It is not a book that I will reread however."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"Julie Powell, while working for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the wake of 9/11 as a secretary, began the Julie/Julia project. She was going to cook her way through the 524 recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and she was going to blog about it. Her sole purpose in attempting to slog her way through this classic recipe collection is to enliven her dreary life and who wouldn't feel the same? I would be depressed answering phone calls from the victims of 9/11 and people complaining about the LMDC's plans to rebuild the World Trade Center. This blog became the basis of her book and the movie entitled Julie and Julia, starring Amy Adams and Meryl Streep and serves to commemorate her process. She attempts to weave Julia Child's life in Paris into her memoir as it is during this time that Julia learns about French cooking in almost painful detail. Julie's blog is highlighted in the media, and this leads to a lucrative book deal.The book was very well written (as opposed to her next memoir - Cleaving - which I read and disliked immensely) but I often got really tired about the whining, stress bucket that was Julie Powell. It gets a little old when you are constantly being told by the author how awful her job is, how awful her life is and why she's better than everyone because she's doing this project. There were times when she was very witty and pretty funny. I was impressed by the depth of Ms. Powell's research into Julia Child's life in Paris - she never met Julia Child (who died I think shortly after this project was done) so she had to look at letters written by both Ms. Child and her husband, Paul, as well as secondary resources - biographies and articles. I found that the interludes in which she created the scenes between Paul and Julia were too forced and were unnecessary. Julie could have told her own story without those brief interludes and they did nothing to move any part of the story forward. If I wanted to learn about Julia Child, I would have picked up a book about her.Generally an entertaining read if you can get past the angst."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I wouldn't read this book to my grandmother, and I'd say it isn't for anyone who has an issue with cursing. A lot of cursing.Julie Powell's life is not what she was expecting. She's worried about getting pregnant, stuck in a dead-end job, and living in a tiny crappy apartment that is not where she wants it to be. And as many people do, she decides to do something that will resolve none of those issues but will allow her to focus on something else. She decides to go through the 524 recipes in Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking in one year.It's an experiment that does not go smoothly. She burns stuff, has to figure out how to open up a bone to get marrow, and uses so much butter that none of her clothing fits. It in no way convinced me that attempting this experiment would be at all entertaining. It is however, entertaining to read about someone else doing it.At times, Julie Powell comes off as whiny and self-absorbed. She's got a filthy mouth, and she's not afraid to use it. There was more than one instance in the book where I wanted to smack her for the way that she acts about her husband, who seems like a perfectly nice guy married to someone who who doesn't appreciate him. With all that in mind, I enjoyed the book. It's not the best thing I read this year, but it's a decent food memoir from someone who loved Julia Child."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I did enjoy thinking about preparing many of the dishes from MtaoFC as I read, but I continually missed the movie's lovely connections to Julia Child's history and her development as a chef, writer, and teacher.In reflection, it seems to me that Julie Powell fell into a project that captured the imagination of many, and which had a profound impact on her own life. That project, however, did not make her a good writer or an inspiring person. The screenplay writers, on the other hand, accomplished both these goals and made me want to buy Julia Child's MtaoFC, read more about her biography, and cook for my friends and family.Julia captured my interest; Julie, not so much."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I was very, very interested in Julie Powell's cooking and blogging experiences, but quickly found out that her book was more about airing the details of her own life, which she considered mundane at the time, and the more exciting lives of all of her friends. I was especially put off by the frequent references to Republicans as if they are all idiots or some lesser life form (while I don't consider myself the big R, I am definitely closer to R than D.

Living","review":"And not necessarily about cooking. Or Julia Child for that matter. What I'd like to say to Julie is that there's a line between asserting one's political beliefs and making misinformed statements and generalizations about large percentages of the US population and trying to hide it behind a premise of culinary experimentation (which, unfortunately, never really surfaced). And I won't even mention 9/11 because I lived through it and knowing that ANY person could treat the subject with such disrespect actually hurts me. That alone makes me embarrased that she is a fellow New Yorker (well actually, she is a Texan who states in the book that New York is a cesspool - she is posing as a New Yorker for what reason I haven't quite figured out). One of the best things about real New Yorkers is we are the most liberal AND tolerant people on earth. I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of choice. To me being liberal includes accepting that conservative people have just as much right to be conservative as liberals have to be liberal. Isn't that one of the basic principles of democracy? I live in New York and am pretty liberal but I don't consider conservative people pigs or \\"pure evil\\" or whatever other unpleasant labels this author has for anyone different than she is (she actually says in the book that she served a souffle or some similar dish that she dropped onto the dirty NY street to her Republican co-workers noting that she warned only the six Democrats in the office that there could be broken glass bits and/or poison in the form of dirt and radiator fluid and such - what kind of person does that and then brags about it in a book for everyone to read? It's not funny and she really could have hurt someone.). This book should have focused more on the food and Julia's genius and trying to replicate that genius than in bashing anyone she dislikes (which is practically everyone including Julia Child herself). And who doesn't love Julia Child? JC had a lot of class. Most disturbing of all, Julie got an infestation of maggots and flies from the filth of her kitchen - she never cleaned - there was grease-encrusted cat hair stuck to the walls of her kitchen, she didn't do dishes or any general cleaning at all and only when the maggots arrived and were apparently living there for a while, did her husband finally clean the kitchen for her - in the very last days of the project. I'm actually surprised that they didn't get really sick living and cooking in such filthy conditions! And she served other people as well. But this is not all Julie's fault. Though the idea was brilliant, the author did not have the skills (verbal or written) to execute the project. The prose was poor, the editing was poor and a good part of the blame should go to the publisher/editor for not advising this author to stay more focused on the actual premise and to think about the WAY things are said rather than just blurting out offenses to millions of people (not just conservatives but Indian people, religious people, people who attended the Ivy League and let me not forget that her tone is also very cavalier on the subject of extramarital affairs). This was a clear case of an inexperienced, immature viewpoint let loose with no editorial guidance. It had big time potential and I sure do like that cover but considering the sad state of the world right now, the last thing I need to read about is such unhappiness and hatred for others. That kind of hatred and hostility is how the world actually got the way it is today. Her intolerance toward people who are different than she is (including 9/11 victims) only perpetuates negativity and doesn't really help anything get better. Why not do something positive to make the world a better place? But apparently, since she felt such disdain for 9/11 victims and their families, I guess proactive is not a quality this woman is endowed with. She could have entertained a lot of people with this and gotten herself on the path of the greats (the likes of Ruth Reichl) but I fear she has damaged her ability to get people back on board with a follow-up book. (I'm glad I didn't buy this book - got it at a thrift store for 25 cents - I did wonder why it was in a thrift shop so soon after publication but after reading it, it was clear.)

Living","review":"So, the premise is promising: Bored temp secretary strives to reinvigorate herself with the ambitious project of cooking all the recipes from Vol. 1 of Julia Child's landmark work in just one year. Unfortunately, the product buries the promise under a stinking pile of hysteria and pseudo-intellectual (and inappropriate) navel-gazing.Overall, my impression of this book are similar to the other 1-star reviews here. The author's persona in this book is that of a witless and spoiled child who feels entitled to whatever \\"good life\\" she imagines for herself. A better example of a Gen-Y stereotype I've never seen. So, as a Gen-X reader, I find myself disliking her intensely and even silently cheering when yet another recipe goes awry. (I mean, come on -- a simple icing fails because she fails to grok the rather pointed instructions telling her to use separate bowls for the eggs? Seriously?)After I finished reading this book, I couldn't help wondering if anything could have saved the author some serious pain and anguish (and thereby return the story to some semblance of coherence). Actually, there are two words that would have either brought this book to a screeching halt or turned it into a much more rewarding read: Alton Brown (a real admirer of Julia Child, btw).Yes, friends, this book might possibly be very different had the author had the presence of mind to actually inform herself of some really basic cooking principles before attempting some of those classic French gems. All she had to do was page through \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\" a few times and she would have been golden. I mean, who ventures into tricky territory without at least a bloody guidebook? But no, she maintains complete ignorance and puts everyone in her world through a Very Special Hell, the result of which is a glorification of idiocy as disgusting as her cat-hair-and-maggot-ridden kitchen. I thought I would be happy to see this book end, but again, the ending is as unsatisfying as the preceding pages. Because the book tries to end about 3 times before it just simply stops. Neil Gaiman and Anne Rice might be able to get away with that -- this girl, not so much.So, don't get this book because you want to read about food or Julia Child or one woman's \\"unique\\" interpretation of Julia Child's stuff. Get this book because you love to see an unbearably entitled and clueless ne'er-do-well go down in a spectacular show of flames, again and again. And when you're finished, toss the book in the recycling bin with all the other old news that's not worth reading."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I really enoyed reading about Julie's exploits and her general \\"fits\\" while trying to follow Julia's cookbook. While she does curse a bit more than I personally like to read in a book, I really liked her descriptions of preparing the food. If I met Julie on a subway, I would enjoy talking with her. Eric, her husband, is very long suffering, but does serve as an encouraging foil to her activities. He even went with her to the Smithsonian Institute to leave butter at Julia's kitchen . . . that's devotion. I was a little puzzled at Julia Child's \\"response\\" to Julie, though I never read the blog personally. Perhaps Julia felt that Julie didn't take the recipes seriously enough, but from reading the book, I think Julie was more devoted than most people to keeping Julia's legacy alive.

That being said, it was a Herculean effort to not toss this self-indulgent mess across the room 300+ pages ago and instead actually make it to the end.First things first. Powell has to be the most narcissistic, neurotic, whiney, self-absorbed and ungrateful person I have encountered on paper. The scope of her self-absorption is something one encounters in a petulant teenager, but as 30 year old woman Powell seems to have retained that center-of-the-universe egoism, as well as the teenage angst. Her long-suffering husband Eric must be going for sainthood. Powell's dissatisfaction with all that is her life grows tiresome quickly. (I suppose reading about anyone else's identity crisis always is.) And her contempt for countless others knows no bounds. Republicans, Mid-Westerners, non-theater geeks, grieving families of 9/11 victims, co-workers, friends... and basically anyone she deems too uncool for her psudeo-hipster self. Lovely.There seemed to be little continuity to the book. I had difficulty keeping track of time and Powell seemed to backtrack often. Add to this the constant filler of details and anecdotes about family and friends alike. While I was hoping for a real entry into Powell's day to day project, I could have done without the revelation of her father's extramarital affair, her friend's bizarre dream analysis, and another friend's sexual encounters with a married co-worker.As a foodie, I picked up Julie & Julia hoping to be entertained by the magic of a meal well made. But that is not what Powell has shared. While I can admire the fact that she took on such a daunting project, I'm left wishing I had borrowed this one from the library and saved my eight bucks."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

The movie was a wonderful parallel of their lives, and was sensitive, funny, and tasteful. The book was trashy at best. I loved the Julie in the movie, and disliked the one portrayed in the book.

This is a funny book, meant for those interested in cooking and for those who never will put a pan on the fire but just like a good underdog story. You won't get direct recipes (though you will get loads of good advice, like stay away from aspic) but if you're looking for detailed directives you should go to the source anyway and order Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

Julie's book is the exact opposite.Believe all of the lousy reviews. She's whiny, bitter, angry, mean-spirited and boring. She reminds me of a child who makes a joke, and then has to repeat it fifteen times, just in case you didn't get it the first time. To save you the money and time here's a synopsis of the book: she hates Republicans (she really crowbars that into the book about 100 times, even when it's totally irrelevant); she's a wench towards her poor husband, who should probably run screaming from her before she completes psychologically castrating him; she somehow seems to think she has some sort of equality to Julia Child, which is just insulting. Ms Child had class, style and respected everyone she ever encountered. The broad that wrote this book is just a pompous snot.I gave it two stars because the vignettes between chapters gives some additional insight into Julia Child. My advice is to go to the bookstore, read these parts and then move on with your life.

And I don't say that lightly, because in my house, \\"stupid\\" is the ultimate put-down and not allowed to be used except in extreme circumstances.I know this book won all kinds of \\"Readers Pick\\" awards, and was a best seller and such, but I hated it. As a matter of fact, I didn't finish it. I was tempted to put it down about 15 times, but I kept slogging away at it because (a) I was sick and had nothing else to read and (b) I kept HOPING it would get better. It didn't. Worse if possible. I finally put it down forever about 5 chapters from the end. I just couldn't take any more.I WANTED to like this book. I was excited to have it to read. I was CERTAIN I'd like it. The whole premise - cooking every recipe in The Modern Art of French Cooking in one year - what a cool idea! What a great memoir it should be!The problem is - the book is about 30% cooking (and not even cooking well; mostly she subbed and shortcutted her way through it), and the rest a whiney, B****y rant by a spoiled rotten, self-centered, snotty little brat. Her constant snarking about Republicans - and not even a clever, witty snark, just ignorant, lame insults - were really, really annoying. I have no real love for Republicans either, but I don't lump them all together and tar them with feathers for simply existing the way she does.I hate the way she treats and talks to her husband, I really didn't need to or want to know about her youthful experiences with her parents copy of The Joy of Sex (what the H*** does that have to do with Julia Child???) or her friends sex lives (again - that has what to do with the subject at hand?). And I really, really, REALLY hated her for her gross insensitivity toward the families of the 9/11 victims. Maybe she thought those insensitive things; fine, we all think mean things. But you don't write them down and put them out there for all the world to see and think you are some font of cleverness for it, because you aren't - you are just insensitive and mean.What's worse than the 70% of the book completely related to her and her alone, is that the cooking-experience-part (which was SUPPOSED to be the main thrust of the book, but wasn't) was so unsatisfying. I admit, a few times she TRIED to make a recipe as written. But a lot of times she just skipped parts or subbed or whatever. Isn't this experience supposed to be trying to cook all of those recipes, as written? Why was that less than half the book and couldn't she have put a bit more effort into it? I was impressed she tried to make her own gelatin. That was cool to read. But those tiny snippets of interesting commentary were so few and far between that it drove me crazy.Upon reflection, I think this book depends entirely on whether or not you LIKE this woman. If you like her, you will like the book. If you don't like her, you will hate it. Because the main thrust of the book is HER and her personality. There's not enough Julia in it to make it interesting to those of us who enjoy Julia Child."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Reading her books as one would a novel, I learned a great deal about cooking and ingredients in my early 20's.I am so disappointed. I find it impossible to read further about this woman's life (Ms. Powell's). It is a rambling story about her life with only a sprinkling of Ms. Child. The author is a 20 or 30-something living in New York with a rather mundane and unsatisfying existence. I feel she peddled her story on Ms. Child's good reputation and life; and, in turn, did a huge diservice to Ms. Child.

I love to cook, and have \\"The Way to Cook\\" by Julia Child, and adore her legacy. Julie Powell hates to cook, and has a miserable approach to life. This book is not about cooking or loving to cook. The subject was a great one, but the writer chose to use this subject as an avenue for releasing her pent up anger towards her family, friends and towards anyone that voted for George W. Bush or any Republican. Ironically, she has no clue about Julia Child (and even admits this in the end of the book). Julia Child was a passionate and intelligent woman, and would be appalled at Julie's total lack of respect for cooking and life.Julie Powell - wow, did she miss the boat. I'm sorry my husband paid what he did for her hardcover! And, I wish I had read some of the reviews of this beforehand, but the subject was just so enticing.

I have to agree with many of the others who have posted here that the movie was far more enjoyable and pleasant than the book. I almost always prefer the book to the movie, this is certainly an exception.I am sure Julie Powell meant her book to be insightful and even humerous but I found her constant political comments and put-downs tiresome and unnecessary, this was not what I thought I signed up for. If I wanted a politically charged book I would have deliberately chosen one.Also the author does seem to be a very foul-mouthed person and enjoys her drink a bit too much for my taste. I read the book by Julia Child, My Life in France, just prior to reading this one and although Julia did drink and was clearly a liberal, I never got the impression that she was a foul-mouthed border-line drunk. Maybe Julie Powell needs to learn that sometimes one can give out too much information about one's self. She sure does not paint a pretty picture of the enlightened liberal she clearly believes herself to be. I expected (from having seen the movie) to really like Julie Powell but the character in the movie was so much more likeable than Julie herself.I do think she in some ways disrespected Julia Child, (why would anyone call Julia Child a bitch?) no wonder Julia was not pleased. It is clear that Julie used Julia's cookbook as a vehicle to catapult herself into a new career."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I thought that perhaps given her advanced age, she did not understand what Julie was doing. I was wrong. Now I understand completely why Julia Child did not approve of Julie Powell and her efforts. Amy Adams plays a much kinder Julie in the movie than the real Julie does in her book. The Julie Powell in this book is a self-absorbed, profane woman who seems more concerned with complaining than cooking.

I didn't get the impression that Julie even LIKED to cook, so that kinda bothered me, since I thought it would be more of a celebration.

The writing is poor, and rambles on about nothing in particular. Not to mention the fact that her use of vulgarity is unnecessary and used way too often to suit any reader.

Living","review":"This book is a quick, funny, and intensely enjoyable read. The bulk of the text is not about the recipes, and you will certainly not learn how to Master the Art of French Cooking from this book. Rather than being focussed on the actual process of cooking, the writing centers on how said cooking affected the author's life: her job, her marriage, and her emotional state. This means that the book should be filed under 'memoir' as opposed to 'food essays,' but as far as I'm concerned 'how cooking affected my life' is just as legitimate (and interesting) a topic as 'how to cook.'The author herself is a colorful character. She has a mouth like a sailor, drinks like a fish, and is an unapologetic liberal. Her sense of humor is wry, self-deprecating, and sometimes caustic. I understand why people with a lighter sense of humor find her whiny, insensitive, or just unfunny, but if (like me) your sense of humor verges towards the darkly snarky, you'll likely find her hilarious.The prose is decent but not brilliant. The author will not be winning any Pulitzers. If you read this book for literary value, you will be disappointed. That doesn't make it any less entertaining; the book has many other redeeming qualities.It's not true at all that foodies wouldn't enjoy this book, unless foodies don't enjoy reading anything but food essays (which this book verges on but is not). I am a foodie; I enjoyed this book. I am also, however, a member of the author's demographic (a 20-something, college-educated, financially struggling liberal) and I imagine this had a fair amount to do with my affection for the book.To summarize: Foodies, do not be intimidated. You might very well enjoy the book. It is, however, not for everyone. If you are a 20-something liberal with foodie inclinations and a sarcastic sense of humor, I imagine that you'll like it. If you lean towards the right, insist upon impeccable prose, object to foul language (or heavy drinking, or questionable sex), and your humor is lighter- steer away."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

OK, so you didn't like the book. How many have tried to cook those recipes? How many have eaten the results? How many have worked at a demoralizing job? How many have lived in a small, old, poorly-laid-out apartment with a miserable kitchen? And how many have been discouraged?I'm in my 60s so I remember Julia fondly from TV and I also remember how thrilled I was to get her cookbook as a gift when I was newly married and learning to cook. I've made many of the recipes and they are wonderful. The are also expensive and involved and a real undertaking--if you have all day. It's a completely different story if you have to shop, lug your groceries on public transportation, and then cook at the end of a day that has drained you emotionally. Julie Powell did a fabulous job of documenting how it all transpired and what the results were. I think it was a shame she was never able to meet the \\"real\\" Julia. A friend of mine did, and found her to be as charming as she seems in all her writings and programs.Now, to the maggots. Living in an old building, working full-time, above a restaurant--I'm surprised she didn't have rats in bed with her. And I'm sure she learned a valuable lesson about cleaning up. The fact that she told about it says a lot, she could have left that out and nobody would have know how horrible it was. I'm sure she's not the first person to make a nasty discovery around the house and she won't be the last. Cut her some slack! PS A little cat hair never hurt anyone. PPS Julia was the one who dropped the chicken on the floor on TV and then picked it up, dusted it off, and declared that what happens in the kitchen is the cook's business, and besides, it's cooked!This was a pheonmenal undertaking--remember, I've cooked a lot from this book so I know what I'm talking about--and Julie was desperate for some direction in her life. This project is how she found it. Her generation does stuff like blogging. I have never gotten into it but it fills a big need for many people. Just because folks are different is no reason to slam them.And a bit about 9/11 too: Please, we all know it was a terrible tragedy. It's something our country will never forget. But to be forced to wallow in people's despair day in and day out takes its toll, and when said people are unhappy and frustrated and miserable it's awfully hard to keep your perspective. Her job was a position that should have been filled by a trained psychologist, not by a young woman with limited experience of life. I'm sure she did the best she could and I'm also sure that if she'd been able to find something more suitable to do she would have done it long before she resorted to the Julia/Julie project.You can't have it both ways--put her down her for doing the cooking and the blog and then turn around and put her down because her job was awful and she wasn't coping very well.I liked the book. My daughter (older than Julie) liked it too.

Living","review":"Julie Powell has produced a worthy five-star entry in the comedic memoir genre. Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously tells the story of a talented, 29-year-old secretary (originally a would-be actress) whose life seems to have passed her by until she unearths her mother's worn copy of Volume I of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking (or, as our heroine terms it, MtAoFC).Julie's plan is simple (well, sort of). She will cook her way through Volume I of MtAoFC in a year's time, shopping for ingredients after work, cooking a new meal nightly and blogging about her results in the morning. As anyone who has lived in New York will tell you, this plan has complications if you live in Long Island City, Queeens and are commuting to a job in lower Manhattan. Neither neighborhood is heavy on elite butcheries and markets (it's more like \\"Do your best with the Korean place on the corner\\"), and Julie's daily commute is a dreary 45-minute or so slog through a hellishly overcrowded subway system. Nor is Julie's kitchen particularly well-equipped for the task-- grimy and rickety would be more apt.So, Julie Powell has indeed embarked on a year of cooking dangerously and, happily, hilariously. Add to the above setting some eccentric-- but endearing-- friends, plumbing problems, a citywide blackout, dustballs, pet cats (no, they don't end up in the pot), a perfectionist mother who makes ample use of the \\"f\\" word, and a kind-hearted but long-suffering husband and you've got a perfect read for before-bed, plane trips, beaches and rainy afternoons.That Ms. Powell finds a measure of fame and, perhaps, fortune by the end of her year with Julia Child is only fitting. Any deeper message? Undertake that project that captivates you-- the crazy one that just won't let go. Living your passion can open unexpected doors."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Julie Powell's debut is a wild romp through a tumultuous year in her life during which time she finds purpose while cooking her way through Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\\" Maybe as a New Yorker I have a soft spot for Powell's gripes about dragging groceries on the subway after trekking to six different stores, but I found her story to be a delight to read. Unlikable at times, Powell deals with marriage, determination and how to plot her own course in the crazy 21st century while in ways that are both entertaining and exhasperating.There are parts I wish she'd elaborated on, and parts that I thought shouldn't have made the final cut, but this is her story -- not the story of Julia Child or a how-to on cooking.I thoroughly enjoyed being privy to a slice of Powell's life and hope she keeps writing."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Julia Child was a spy, she somehow managed to get into French cooking, and as a woman, succeeded in having her own cooking show. On the other hand, Julie Powell is whiny, self-centered, and callous. She gleefully serves a cake that might be filled with antifreeze and glass shards. The premise of the memoir is interesting- following Julia's Mastering Art of the French Cooking, making every single recipe. There are some comic misadventures.The book gets 3 stars instead of 2 simply because of Julia Child and the occasional discussion of the recipes. Otherwise, it's nothing like the movie with the cheerful Amy Adams and the luminous Meryl Streep. This book would've been better if it had been centered on the recipes&the; cooking, rather than Julie's self-centered, self-righteous gossip."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Obviously food (or its preparation) was the common tie between Julie and Julia, but the book is much more about Julia's quest to find herself through the admittedly odd project to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook. The book is well-written though I often found myself frustrated with the author who seemed very immature in parts.All in all a decent read for someone who was never exposed to the blog that sparked the novel.

Not so with this; it's actually the opposite with Julie&Julia.; Especially since the Julie in the movie seemed so much nicer and likeable than she did in the book.I read this over my first trip to France so I found myself delighted over the Julia parts of the book but not so much over Julie's. I admired Julie for her attempt to take on cooking every recipe in Julia's book, which after all is quite extensive, and I loved the way it brought her friends and family all together. I found her writing style humorous at times but boring other times, and those boring times seem to increase throughout the book.What I didn't like was Julie. Although she had admirable qualities for sure, she appeared to be a rather self centered and immature with a lack of general respect for others. If you are young and a Julia fan you may find Julie more tolerable. But if you think having a child is cherishable; if you feel a deal of sorrow for families of 9-11; AND if you like a book to come together at the end, you may not want to read this."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

It was pretty clear that it wasn't meant to be a cookbook, or a biography of Julia Child -- rather the story of a young woman with an almost impossible goal. I read it quickly and loved every minute -- hysterically funny one moment, poignant the next. Even made me want to try cooking again.Guess it's a matter of personal taste, but I was shocked to see so many 1 star reviews. After reading a few, wanted to say to some of my fellow republicans \\"lighten up\\". But seriously -- if you are using reviews to select a book, are pretty conservative politically and find other points of view troubling, or if \\"salty\\" language in a novel is not acceptable to you, this book probably isn't a good choice. For me, there isn't a book I've read in the past few years I've enjoyed more.Nice work, Julie Powell -- hope to read more of your work soon:) And, I'll be dragging my husband to the movie next week...if it's similar to the book, I think he'll be glad I did."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I'll be honest...I bought the book after I saw the movie trailer, under the assumption that having read the book makes the movie much better. And the movie does star Meryl Streep, one of my absolute favorites. And it is directed by Nora Ephron, who is the director of so many movies I've enjoyed over the years. However, I'm not sure even the divine Ms. Streep or the inimitable Ms. Ephron can make me see this one. I really wanted this book to be one of those that simply makes the character (in this case, also the writer) so dear to you, you're sorry the book ends. I wanted to share it with girlfriends and have it return dog-eared and worn, while we laughed and talked over crepes about the parts we liked best, how it must feel to kill lobsters or extract bone marrow or clean kidneys! None of this happened. In fact, it left me feeling a little \\"dark,\\" and not at all cheerful. A few reasons:I must say, like some of Julie's \\"bleaders,\\" (and as a mother of four 20-somethings!) I quickly grow intolerant of the \\"F\\" word. There are moments when its placement is strikingly funny, or surprising, or in some way redeemable. Its overuse just smacks of someone with a limited vocabulary.Unbelievably tiresome were the relentless digs at Republicans. I grew resentful very quickly, and I'm not a Republican!!! Some of the references to 9/11 families were callous.The parts of the book that dealt with cooking, with food, with the search for ingredients, was somewhat interesting, and sometimes funny and entertaining. It really did make me want to get a copy of MtAoFC, and that's a good thing, I suppose. It didn't, however, make me want to cook my way through it!!!While realizing that Julie Powell was not a professional writer at the time she began the Project (and in fairness, I never read the blog), perhaps she did not foresee the success of the blog, the book, or the movie. What I do appreciate is that she did not attempt to portray herself in a positive light, but rather, it seems, simply said, \\"what you read is what you get.\\" What we got, in my opinion, is a self-centered, uncaring, inconsiderate Gen-Xer, whom I wouldn't care to have dinner with, no matter how well she cooks."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I absolutely loved the movie, and I understand now that Nora Ephron quite obviously transformed the real Julie Powell into the engaging, earnest young character who was the perfect foil for Julia Child, whom I have always loved. Meeting the real Powell through her own words is to encounter narcissism, hysteria, cynicism and foul-mouthed fingertips. My tongue is no stranger to four-letter words, and I occasionally slide one onto the written page, but Powell seriously overdoes it. I think that her writing skills are sufficient to describe pictorally the ludicriousness she encounters in NYC, right-wing politicians, etc. without so often resorting to the \\"F bomb\\" and its siblings. I tried very hard to find compassion for Powell's narcissism and hysteria by trying to remember how I felt when I was making a life-altering change as I approached 30. Alas, three decades of water have gone under my bridge since that milestone. So I was left with a whiney memoir in which there was no arc of transformation, simply the ingenious blogging of her cooking foray and the book contract and subsequent movie deal born of the blog."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

The movie is really cute. I didnt even know that was Amy Adams playing Julie! I didnt recognize her. Meryl Streep, perfect as always. Ok so a great, cute movie. The book is totally different though. Julie Powell is no sweet Amy Adams. The part in the movie where Julie says \\"I'm a bitch\\" at the bar with her friend, I thought \\"No you're not\\" because the movie character wasnt at all. But Julie in the book. Lots of sexual references and I'm not shocked at all that her new book Cleaving is about her having an affair and her getting into S&M. I could see that side of her from a mile away amidst her cooking these french dishes. I mean the book basically opens with her reading the Joy Of Sex as a preteen. The description of her messy apartment, and then the maggots on the dish drainer...ugh. I would NEVER eat or cook in such an environment. Just disgusting beyond reason. Like french dishes arent nasty enough, throw some maggots next to it because she's such a bad housekeeper. Yuck. She's lucky that her blog got the attention and opened the doors that it did. I dont think the same would happen now since everyone and their grandmother has a blog (I still write in diaries myself, I dont understand one airing their private thoughts onto the internet for all to see). I actually liked the parts about Paul and Julia alot more than I did about Julie and her government job and her cooking and her Eric and her maggots. But those pages were few and far between. I guess I have the original first edition book, which is selling on amazon starting at $75...so I'll hold onto the book for that reason. Maybe I'll sell it on ebay and use the money to buy the ingredients for Beef Bourguignon, which was the only recipe that sounded appealing to me.

But where it becomes a bore, is when she tries to make a book of this. Perhaps if you are a near thirty-something unsuccessful woman you might relate. And certainly there is a great deal of chicklit in the world these days that might encourage such poor skills.I read several reviewed in other places before starting my own. I wanted to be sure that my conceptions were not too obscure. I find many of the reviews similar to my own, but then when they are written Miss Powell seems to have defenders who don't judge on the merits of what she wrote or how she wrote this book, but that she is some kind of goddess.She chose to write her tome as an autobiographical work, but so often we are given to asides about her friends and their dating habits, or certainly her casting a shadow upon the agency she worked for and the two political parties. There are many other places where these trips away from the cooking, the blogging, and the promotion of the blog are dribble. It makes the whole seem as verbal diarrhea. That is why the book fails, too much crud that has so little bearing only written so Julie plays on her readers to fall in love with her. Look at me, I'm a nice person.No, this could have been a book as like Kitchen Confidential, but it isn't. Sometimes a secretary is still a secretary. But the movie, now that is good, but then we have Meryl Streep who has surpassed Katherine Hepburn, and we have Amy Adams who is having a great few years now."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I'll just come right out and tell you that I enjoyed this book enormously. Then I'll tell you how it affected my life.First, I adore Julie's authorial voice. It's honest and forthright. She's entitled to her political beliefs, her somewhat unconventional lifestyle (snakes in Long Island City, yet!), and her use of the \\"F\\" word, a word that I myself have found to be highly therapeutic in situations of adversity. (If you are at all prone to strokes, I suggest you adopt this word immediately for its blood pressure reducing properties.)Second, it was simply a brilliant idea. Imagine! Cooking Julia Child from cover to cover! Ingenious! Formidable, yes, but ingenious nonetheless.Third, I found that I wanted to acquire Julie's spotted and dog-earred personal copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking because, like any good cook, I just KNOW she annotated the receipes. Personally, I pounced on the two examples of annotation she used in Julie and Julia and made the appropriate notes in my own cookbook. One note occurred in the frosting receipe and the other in the leg of lamb. (The French and, therefore, Julia Child are quite fond of aging their meat, a practice I myself would never risk. While aged meat DOES possess a full-bodied delightful flavor, the thought of having something rotting at home does not intrigue me. Julie Powell's less than hearty results of aging a leg of lamb in red wine for four days at room temperature bears me out. Better to leave the meat-aging business to the butcher!)Fourth, this book re-kindled an interest in cooking which had gone dormant since I became an emancipated woman and an empty-nester. While I've always enjoyed cooking, somehow after twenty-odd years of standing in the grocery store aisle trying to second-guess the gustatory ticks of a finicky husband, I was just burnt out. When I saw the movie, and read this book, I found my culinary proclivities re-awakened and I immediately ordered Volume II of MtAoFC, as well as the DVDs of Julia Child's TV shows. Now that I'm \\"free, white, and twenty-one\\" I can cook whatever I danged well want to!Winter can be a long, drawn-out business but not this year. And some of my neighbors don't know it yet, but they're going to be eating well. Thank you, Julie Powell, for providing the kick-start to a former passion.

She is turning 30, has a \\"syndrome\\" (as she calls Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and isn't sure if she can have kids, stuck in a government secretarial position which was responsible for Ground Zero (the site where the World Trade Center Towers stood), married and living in New York City. On a trip to visit her parents in Texas, she snatches her mother's copy of Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I\\". Her husband, Eric, suggests she blogs about cooking through the cookbook. The rest, as they say, is history. She becomes an internet hit, all the while cussing her way through the cookbook (honestly, I cuss just making crepes, I can't imagine what it's like through Julia Child's meals), and trying to find herself. My favorite part was nearing the end, after Julia Child learns of Julie's project and doesn't \\"care\\" too much for it. (I just want to throw this in, Julia was pushing 90 when this was going on, probably cantakerous and not understanding about blogs, technology and the like) I loved it when Julie and Eric (her husband) visit Julia's kitchen at the Smithsonian and leaves a stick of butter (remember, Julia cooks French food. Read: lots of butter). Pure awesomeness.If you are looking for a book about Julia Child, cooking or even blogging, keep looking. If you want a book about personal growth, while cooking through a Julia Child cookbook and blogging about it, then this book is for you. However, be forewarned, there is a LOT of cussing, talk about sex (not pornographic, just the subject of sex) and she is a Democrat who does some Republican bashing, not so much as bashing but gives them a hard time (none of these bother me, just a warning for those it might). If any of those bother you, pass. If they don't, I say pick up \\"Julie & Julia\\" and have a good laugh. I know I did."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"I was one of those people who stumbled across Julie Powell's blog back when I was working at my own version of a crappy secretarial job. Her humor, perseverance, and honesty helped me endure many a day at my desk. So it was with great anticipation that I purchased her book Julie & Julia, hoping to find that familiar, sustaining voice within. I am happy to report that I did.As a reader coming from the blog to the book, it took me a chapter or two to feel the connection I had with the blog. Blogs are such an intimate entr&eacute;e into the writer's head, whereas the necessarily more formal structure of a book eases the reader into relationship with the author. But by chapter three we were \\"cookin' with gas.\\"This book doesn't stand out for me as a cooking memoir as much as it represents the introduction of an important new voice on the cultural landscape. Powell highlights the countercultural joys of marriage and monogamy for 20 and 30 somethings-a topic definitely not on the radar screen in our chick-lit, Sex-in-the-City climate, where those who marry young are only pitied. But the comforts of marriage are real, and Powell strikes an newly intimate, almost offhand note when revealing the simple pleasures and inevitable grievances of married life.She also captures a view of how the events of 9/11 embedded themselves in our national consciousness over time. The chapter where she describes working in the family visiting room on the anniversary of 9/11 was stark and true, and gave me insight that all the hundreds of news articles and opinion and TV images I've seen relating to that tragedy didn't.And giving her brother the pseudonym \\"Heathcliff\\" throughout the book? Inspired! I laughed every time I read his name.Like Anne Lamott, Powell is an incredibly accessible writer. By revealing her foibles and triumphs in her conversational and intimate way, the reader can't help feeling like a member of her team, one of her band of \\"bleaders,\\" cheering her on to the project's end.I can't wait to read the next offering from this exciting young author. Julie, you rock!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"I am not a foodie- frozen dinners are regular dining in our household and I cannot taste the difference between some of the various spices. And being a mother of two preschoolers, I rarely have time to start a book, much less finish one!That said, I LOVED this book! I bought it because it sounded like something crazy- who in their right mind would try something like cooking every one of the recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking?- and because I read an excerpt here at Amazon and a review in some other magazine. I figured that if something as obscure (for me) as a book about food had reached my level of awareness, it had to either really well-written or just plain humorous. To my great delight, the book was both!Julie's writing so clearly communicates her personality, one feels that you know her as a friend after reading this. We're both transplanted Texans and Democrats (itself a rare combination). I would, however, be curious to see if someone older than 35 \\"gets it\\". Julie's slang (and nonchalant way of using profanity), the \\"sex and the City\\" impact on perspectives of love and marriage, her love of \\"Buffy\\", the disdain for large, faceless organizations that capitalize on the issues of 9/11... these are timeless themes, but the specifics are completely rooted in the present day NYC.And did I mention that she's funny? I literally laughed until I cried at her description of taking live lobsters home for the purpose of killing them in multiple ways. And her rebellious use of the Cuisinart is hilarious! I would have enjoyed the discussion about the potato ricer more if I even knew what a ricer WAS, but I got the idea...But the most powerful aspect of the whole book is Julie's writing about it ALL. MTAOFC might have been the structure of her book (and the substance of her long nights), but she shares everything- her friends, her life, her husband- you really feel like you are reading the blog of a friend of yours. And by the end of the book, I still had no intention of trying a single recipe, but I will certainly read anything Julie ever writes. Heck, I even tracked down her original blog (and found out the name of Heathcliff!)"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Julia Child was a wonderful, hard-working woman who made the best of every situation and difficulty. It was superbly co-written with her grand nephew. It also has wonderful pictures taken by her husband, Paul, that documented her experience in France. So, I wanted to tie it all together in a nice bow by readingJulie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously. I went from the grace and CLASS of Julia Child to the potty-talk, cynicism and CRASSness of Julie Powell. YUCK! I got to page 95, and when she told her husband to \\"F--- off\\", I had enough. I brought it back to the bookstore, and they gave me a full refund. This is chocked full of sex, filthy language, and just heartless cruelty toward others. I am glad that Julie was transformed through the book, but I think she could learn much more than just cooking from Julia Child: CLASS! I feel sorry for Julie Powell. Don't waste your money on this thing.Thankfully, I heard Julie Powell in an interview, and she said that the character played by Amy Adams in the upcoming movie is not her.

A little pitiful and sad...but she redeemed herself with the concept sometimes you just do what you gotta do, and try to find the joy in it. She gives all the credit to Julia for that concept. Julie has awakened in me the desire to know more about Julia, and I'm off to the library to check out \\"My Life in France\\" and the 2 books by the female OSS workers that Julie mentions in the back of her book. I'm actually going to try to make the baked cucumbers and the liver with mustard sauce (sounds so much nicer in French: \\"foie de veau a la moutarde\\"). My definition of a good read is one that awakens me to other thoughts and actions, and perhaps sparks debate in my book club (as I'm sure this one will do, if only in the negative, like a lot of the reviewers who have posted here) So, by my definition, this was a GOOD READ.

It seemed to me the writer was trying too hard to be humorous and spent too much time thinking up clever witticisms instead of focusing on the content. But as the book progressed, she seemed to relax into her writing and it became far more fun for the reader. The pacing is a bit uneven here and there, and yes, she does take us off on unrelated tangents occasionally; in the end, however, it only adds to the endearing quality of this unabashed and heartfelt tribute to the greatest cook in American history.I admire Julie Powell's courage in tackling a project of this magnitude - as a long-time Julia Child devotee, I was relieved to see someone else had the same *&^%$ struggles with marrowbone that I did - and, although Julie, her husband, or her family might curse me for even suggesting it, I wouldn't be disappointed if she decided to tackle MtAoFC, Vol. 2."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"I like Julie Powell. I discovered her blog a long time ago and followed it daily. She is talented in the way of stream-of-conscious writing, pop culture references and crazy funny metaphors. She is also pretty ambitious, having had no formal experience in cooking, to take on Mastering the Art of French Cooking. I admire her for that.I get the feeling, however, that this book is a product of the Julie Powell that I admired, having gotten into the clutches of an editor. An editor who asked Julie to toss in some grand themes, to make sweeping connections between her cooking project, and life in general, and to 'kick up a notch' her talent for hyperbole.No matter, it is still an entertaining book. And I do understand an editor's need to take some twine to the stuff of the blog (and Julie's life) and bind it all together, infusing it (to use a bad cooking analogy) with some common themes; a fear of aging, the biological clock ticking etc.Julie is funny, creative and talented. She was obviously under-utilized as a secretary, and I'm so happy for her that she has obviously found her calling. I look forward to more of her writing, and I hope it has an epicurious tilt.One disappointment- there are enough anti-Bush, and anti-Republican rants to fill a Howard Dean I-Have-A-Scream speech in this book. I wonder why Julie felt that she had to insert this banal filler? It is so common, and, well....boring! Where was the editor to advise her against it? Julie seems like an enlightened person, but to purport stereotypes about 'evil Republicans' makes me wonder. What does politics have to do with French cooking? She doesn't so much insult Republicans as she makes herself look trite. I think she is above it, and she should certainly know better.I give this book 3 stars because it is pretty fluffy, and some of her sentences are excruciatingly long as she strings together metaphor after metaphor with increasing hysteria. You do find yourself skipping to the bottom of the paragraph and feeling out-of-breath. I look forward to a much-improved, wiser, and still-funny Julie Powell in her next publication."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I found myself laughing out loud at her misadventures in the kitchen, and even her constant use of the word f xxx. I scold anyone who uses the word, and yet Ms Powell's writing style pulled me in, realizing it was the only way she expressed her emotions. It added to, rather than taking from, the elements of good writing.Using her blogging experiences also added a fun dimension to her memoir, which is more like a confessional. She hates her day job, loves her offbeat friends and describes catastrophic attempts at French cooking as if she is sitting in my living room discussing the same. I was able to imagine Julia Child being a crude, honest and full of just-do-it courage as Julie was in her memoir, including the profanity laced throughout. Eric, the author's husband, reminded me of Paul, Ms. Child's husband, in his acceptance of the hilarious attempt of the wife learning the art of French cooking. Neither could cook, and yet, over time, both became media darlings from their culinary talents.As I cook for my husband I'll smile as I remember so many parts of this book, making the monotonous daily meal a more meaningful and at times an amusing adventure. I highly recommend this book, and if you think seeing the movie was enough you might rethink that idea.This book delivers so much more and is an excellent gift for any one who loves cooking or blogging."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

The intricacies of foods that I will never cook or eat (aspic and veal marrow) was fascinating and her telling is funny (many project memoirs, are funny and that's another reason I like them).Another interesting tidbit is that she recounts Sept 11 -- since she was working in Manhattan at the time.

The account of her self-appointed task to prepare all the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking never bogs (blogs?) down; she weaves into her book stories of Julia's introduction to cooking and her own bouts with infertility and her friends' relationship ups and downs as well as, of course, her experiments with French cooking.

Living","review":"From time to time, I get so excited about reading a book that I rush out to buy it thrilled at the prospect of coming home to dedicate myself night and day to its pages. Last weekend I felt the familiar pang when looking to get some Julia Child DVDs and the book Julie and Julia kept popping up. It is a story based off a depressed temp who decided one year that the best way to get her life put together was to throw herself headlong into a year of passionate cooking. She determined to do all of the roughly 560 recipes from Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking with brains, liver and all. What is not to like? Stories of a woman in Queens learning to butcher meat, extract bone marrow and all sorts of delightful ingredients! So, I made up my bed with the most lovely sheets, turned on my beautiful crystal reading lamp, and burrowed in. It was exactly what I did NOT want it to be. The prose was clumsy, course and reminded me of a teenager who was overly excited about swearing without getting in trouble. There was far too much discussion of her politics and conversations of how Republicans (her former employers) were the scum of the earth. Occasionally she focused on the experiences of actually bumbling through recipes, but often those were glossed over for trite observations and lewd dialog. Towards the end of the book, she actually talks about a interview she held with a reporter from The Times and Julia Child herself discussing the author's Julie/Julia project. She wept as she talks of how in the interview, it became apparent that Julia Child hated her. Julie sobbed and has a chapter of her grief at discovering that her idol considered her a twit. I knew I was in good company! I think she is a total twit too! So, it almost killed me, but I went ahead and finished the book last night so that I could get a new book today and move beyond her terrible, terrible book. So, if the book is given to you as a gift, you don't mind reading a thinly veiled poser's self indulgent journal, enjoy! I just have one thing to say. . . NOT IT!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I just couldn't read more about her ungrateful whining about how bad her job is (without her government job there would be no sticks of butter to cook with--that's how life is) and her too-intimate details about how her crazy her friends are. Just sounded like a blog I'd probably never read, and a whole lot less recipes than I expected.But the movie was super-good. Amy Adams, and otherwise beautiful actress, reduced herself to a homely tomboy yet still made the character likeable (unlike in the book) and Meryl Streep, of course, made an excellent Julia. This is a credit to their acting skills.Don't read the book, not even if you get it for free.

It's hardly about food and all about Julie complaining about EVERYTHING even her husband who she is practically controlling as if he were a pet instead of a human being! I was expecting this to be really good, but based on what I did read it did not live up to my expectations. Julie jumps around way too much and her writing is filled with a large vocabulary which can be great, but it gets too confusing. Plus, she's barely focusing on the recipes. I thought this was supposed to be about a recipe everyday not every 10+ days. She doesn't like to clean and she has maggots in her kitchen because of it. She's bored with life and it definitely shows when she constantly curses in almost every statement. I mean we all have our moments of foul language, but she sounds so cocky and it's as if she doesn't give a crap about anything. I am so unbelievably disappointed in this book. I always read the book before I see the movie and this time I think I'll pass on the book. Maybe when I'm around Julie's age I can finish this, but for now I need something with a bit more class and dignity."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

In my opinion, Julie Powell would have done better writing a satanic pornography book rather than a book about her journey with Julia Child's Mastering The Art Of French Cooking. I was greatly disappointed and I have to admit that just reading this 1/3 of the book, I'm not going to rush to the nearest theater to see the movie. I will wait and rent it and hope for the best.

Blogging about dinner is probably right up her alley as a writer. I saw the movie which was thankfully much, much better. The movie took out all the parts of the book that just didn't do anything for me, like her brother \\"Heathcliff\\" and her dad's birthday dinner.

It's okay if you don't like something, of course it is. But to criticize a memoir for being a memoir, having too much information, not appealing to a broad enough audience, etc., seems wrong-headed. This book is exactly what it says it is: a woman, lost at nearly thirty, commits to cooking all of Mastering in a year, and lives to tell about it. Julie Powell is not a cook, not a chef: she's a person, and she found inspiration in Julia Child. Simple as that. That it didn't fit \\"foodies\\" image of what a book like that should look like is immaterial.Lastly, anyone who loves David Straitharn is a friend of mine. Go, get it.

From the title, I thought it would be a memoir of Julie renovating her tiny apartment kitchen and modeling it after Julia's famous kitchen so that she could tackle those recipes. What a disappointment. She doesn't even go into making meringue, which is what the cover picture shows...!In all seriousness, the reviews for this book are too funny and nearly as good as those uber-earnest liberals worrying over the spoof video clip petitioning for Stephen Colbert to admit the falsiness of his truthiness. Having worked as an underling in the airless stylized world of Manhattan cookbook publishing and witnessed what it actually takes to get a book out by a big-name press/house (being married to the CEO helps, as does having a nationally syndicated television show or a chain of restaurants that has agreed to purchase 10,000 copies of the first printing), I found Julie's opinionated voice in all its potty-mouthed glory a refreshing whack to the marrow of those horrid bluebloods. I too have found blogs to be mostly self-indulgent, but mind: Julie hardly embarked upon this manic scheme with an eye to garnering a fiercely loyal readership, or bleadership. Rather, this was more of a personal challenge as she approached 30 and found herself stuck in a godawful temp-to-perm job (of which NYC has way too many) with a frightful number of rabid Republican spin doctors.But this really isn't so much about politics, though easily offended, God- and/or J.C.-fearing Republicans should run far, far away from this book. My name isn't Julie, I don't drink, but I too am a deeply flawed, normal human being. I love food, have just turned 30 (and had a doctor just tell me that my body wanted a baby even though I didn't), and -- back when I took my foodieness too seriously -- had a vicious quarrel with then-bf, now-long-ago ex over a spoiled handmade aioli into which we'd dripped, and wasted, a half-bottle of French artisanal hazelnut oil purchased on a trip to Paris (Alice Waters was mad to include that recipe in a *kid's* cookbook). Which is to say that I could overlook that misleading cover and ...where are the recipes?!!.. and was extremely glad that this *wasn't* just another well-packaged cook/book, but rather a personal quest to find structure in one's life and the happy discovery that she isn't alone after all (and she has a saint of a husband). Not a bad lesson to learn at 30!(4 stars because I agree that while an entertaining, laugh-out-loud and speedy read in the manner of Bridget Jones' Diary, it isn't a beautifully crafted, densely woven classic like Pride and Prejudice.)"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I enjoyed the book Julie & Julia, however, this is the first time I have ever liked a movie more than the book.I love how much more detail a book gives than a film. The book provides much more detail about Julie's relationships with her husband, family, and friends; household mishaps that affected her project; and the actual blog along with its \\"followers.\\" A reader has the advantage of knowing what the characters think and feel beyond what is possible to convey in film.Things I didn't expect from the book: language & politics. Near the end of the film Julie mentions that she uses the \\"f-word every so often.\\" In the book \\"every so often\\" is a gross understatement as she uses the \\"f-word\\" a little too regularly for my taste. In regard to politics, a mentioning here or there is fine, but her regular, stereotype-laden, political rants related to her office job didn't do much for me. They didn't add to the development of the story, and after the first mention were no longer needed to express Julie's disgust and dissatisfaction in her job.

Enjoying Julie Powell's sense of humor and blog style, I thought that a book could only provide more background and detail of the story that intrigued me.That said, this is perhaps an instance in which a movie really was more than enough information. That time limit meant audiences got the gist of Powell's year of trying to complete all 524 recipes in Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" without actually having to *see* them all. In the book, on the other hand, it felt as though we were with Powell for each and every recipe -- which I don't think even hardcore culinary afficionados would care for, instead preferring to hear about the highlights (like particularly humorous or disastrous results) and the end result.In addition to the cooking project, Powell also writes about her personal dissatisfaction with her life as she approaches thirty. This includes her temp job working for a New York government agency, her husband and family, and the hijinks and problems of her close friends. While a bit of background is good, so that we know what motivated Powell to embrace such a project in the first place, a lot of the side anecdotes seemed like filler and just plain didn't \\"go\\" with the overall plot of the book, either.While this wasn't the worst book I've ever read, overall I have to say I couldn't really recommend it, either."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

However, I think her idea of cooking every recipe in such a landmark cookbook is an intriguing one, and I was interested to see how she fared in her quest.Not bad, it turns out. Julie managed to cook every recipe in the mammoth tome in exactly one year. And she also re-invented her life.If you're looking for lots of recipes or cooking tips, you won't find them here. What you will find is a delightfully irreverent (and sometimes whiny) young woman who cooked and wrote herself out of a dead-end job and a feeling of hopelessness. Julie was 30-ish, working as a secretary, and feeling adrift when she decided to cook every recipe in MtAoFC in the next 365 days. With her husband's support, she figured she'd blog about her efforts.Most consumers of pop culture know what happened next. She gained a cadre of followers, media attention, and a new career as a writer. In the book, one learns far more about Julie's life, her struggles, and the journey she takes to find herself than French cooking, but that's kinda the point. Powell never claims to be a great cook. (In fact, she admits over and over again that she's not one, often describing her failures in the kitchen.) And whether she is or not, who cares? What's admirable is that she set her mind to something and did it. She did it, even though it would have beena heckuva lot easier to sit on her couch eating Fritos for another 365 days.I loved reading all the zany stories she threw in about her friends, the dinner parties she threw, and her adventures in grocery shopping for aspic recipes. (Spoiler - aspic requires calf hooves. Seriously.) In this book, Powell told unflattering stories about the folks she worked with, she examined the human need for food with an unflinching eye, and she ate a ton of butter.Not bad."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Even without the sincerity of her own voice, she had me in the first chapter when she confessed her love for Buffy.I don't think this book is really intended for \\"foodies.\\" Frankly, I'm not inspired to cook calf brains. The story is about Julie's journey through a tough year in her life; she is supported by friends, family, and most of all, her husband, but it is the Julie/Julia Project that prods her to keep going through thick and thin.I, for one, am looking forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

She's searching for fulfillment and isn't finding it in her office job. She comes up with the idea for a project to cook all of the recipes in Julia Child' Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and write about her daily experiences in a blog. She isn't a chef but she likes to cook and her mother has a well worn copy of the cookbook that she borrows. Julie's husband and friends are supportive but her mother isn't too crazy about what Julie sets out to do.What I liked about this book was that it was about a normal, everyday person who sets a goal for herself ,an experiment of sorts, and she blogs about it daily. This book is heartfelt and it is written based on the thoughts, experiences, frustrations and accomplishments that Julie goes through during this one year project that she writes about on her blog. Some people may be offended by her political comments and comments about 9/11 victims and families as she writes about working for a government agency that deals directly with this situation. Her comments are callous and insensitive at times but again, these are her thoughts and feelings written from her blog. She also swears.... a lot...the \\"F\\" word is used quite frequently. It didn't bother me that much but I can see that some readers may be offended. She talks about her body...how it is changing eating so much high fat foods...and her sex life and her friends sex lives.

I just stood in awe to think of everything that had been cooked there. It was the same feeling that Julie Powell had after she had completed her year long project to cook every recipe in Julia Child's French cookbook and blog about it. I enjoyed reading about her decision and the reactions she got when Julie pursued the project. Challenges are always that, a challenge to do and especially when there's no real incentive, it can be hard to finish it. However she manages to do it, have fun in the meantime, and learn how to cook really good food. I, myself, probably would never accomplish this task, due to my distaste of most French food, but as a mild foodie it was fun to read. The little Julia excerpts throughout the book, while fictionalized, made her and her husband come alive in the book. I almost shrieked and grimaced throughout the maggot scene in the book. Even now, I'm still gagging just thinking about it. It was portrayed humorously but if I had been in Julie's shoes I would have been doing the exact same things she did.There were a few things about this book that I wasn't too fond of. I would have liked more talk about the food. I assume that all that was left on the blog, but it would have been nice to have read some excerpts from the blog entries or more adventures about what happened. What was in the book was really fun to read and very enjoyable. It's just not a food memoir so if that's why you're reading the book, you should be prepared. While I fully appreciate her excitement about being a blogger (the comments, the readers, the hits), I have never in my 3 years of blogging have ever heard anyone call a blog reader a \\"bleader\\". There is some language in the book and while at times it's a bit grating, it's not a big distraction.Overall I enjoyed the book and Julie's style of writing. It was fun reading into a year of her life and the background story behind the idea for her blog. I wish I could have read her blog during it's original run.

Too old for theater, too young for children, and too bitter for anything else, Julie Powell was looking for a challenge. And in the Julie/Julia Project she found it.

The culinary ones have an undercurrent of NYC scavenger hunt and discovery, like Julie's first experience with bone marrow: Bifteck Saute Bercy garnished with bone marrow of a cow.

Before I began reading, I wondered whether Julie Powell would pull it off. It sounded like a good idea, but would it end up slow or contrived? Annoying? I'm glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.I wish I'd known more about Julia Child as I read the about the birth of the Julie/Julia Project. My vague recollections of Julia Child meant that this book shaped much of my image of Julia. But this is really isn't a bad thing. Julie's Julia is a funny, practical, generous and adventuresome muse. I've just unearthed and watched a video of the Omelette Show on The French Chef and will surely watch more Julia Child over time.Julie & Julia captures the flavor of New York so well.

Eric, Julie's very supportive husband, who always comes through when needed.This book was about more than the food, or even the project.

I like the premise, that Julie Powell is feeling a bit of a life crisis: Close to age 30, feels a bit aimless in life, and decides she wants to cook all recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It looks like a fun, unusual challenge, and reading about it is enjoyable. But I'm getting tired of women who are so horrified of turning 30. Seriously, it's not such a bad thing. Thirty isn't old anymore!But in between you read about her government job, which she doesn't like, but what she complains about doesn't sound that horrible. Government jobs have their reputation for red tape, etc., but for someone who wanted to be an actress but for some reason never followed through and starts up a cooking blog, it's almost, why complain? Just do something about it! But I guess that's where the 'project' got started. Worst is I get the impression she doesn't even like to cook (in the book she says she started to impress the guy she ends up marrying). That's not really a passion for cooking, but just an attempt to bait a guy.As for the cookbook, she tackles all recipes. It seems like she did them in order, which makes no sense to me, as I think you'd want to bounce around for variety's sake. But there almost isn't enough cooking in this cooking memoir, and in between you hear about her eccentric friends, selling her eggs for money (and her fertility issue) and her supportive husband and her blog and some of the attention she gets. It's a cute, real fairy tale, but it's missing something: A little bite, a little spice. The parts I liked best were the tidbits between the Julie chapters about Julia Child's life. I wanted more of these mini-chapters. But when those little amuse-bouches prove more enjoyable than the main course, that's not good."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I love her sarcasm, wit and ability to laugh at herself...even publicly.I found myself reading excerpts of the book to anyone who would listen. I wanted to share the pure humor with everyone around me. After reading, I found myself approaching life a little differently and taking myself a little less seriously.If you are looking for a recipe book, this is not it. If you are looking for a laugh, looking for some inspiration, looking for a nice break from your own life...this is the book!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"Let's say, for example, that you are in your late twenties, living in New York City in a something-is-always-going wrong apartment, and working at a miserable dead-end secretarial job at a government agency. What do you do to stir up your life? Well, cook every recipe - 524 of them - from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume I by Julia Child in 365 days of course! And that is precisely what Julie Powell, the author of Julie & Julia, set out to do.Living in one of the most exciting cities and having a loving and supporting husband aside, Julie Powell was stuck in a rut. On a visit to her parents', Julie rediscovered the cookbook that appealed to her so much when she was a child; at her husband's urging, Julie decided to cook and blog her way through the entire Mastering the Art of French Cooking, dubbing it the \\"Julie/Julia Project\\". What followed was a year of entirely too much butter, aspic, things that refused to gel together, extracting bone marrow, the trauma of killing lobsters, and the list goes on. Through her cooking triumphs and disasters, frozen pipes, a freezing apartment and sludge filled sinks, Julie discovers a new meaning to life and comes to the realization that anything is possible.Julia & Julia is a joy to read; you might find yourself laughing (or at least smiling) at Julie's remarks and her susceptibility to calamities of all kinds. Julie spares no punches when it comes to her beliefs, - her anti-Republican remarks may be offensive to some - but her memoir is straight forward, witty, inspirational and often flat-out hilarious.Bon Appetit!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I agree that the way she wrote about 9/11 was a little insensitive - it was cringe-worthy. But, c'mon, anyone who dares to plow their way through a cookbook such as this one, probably the best ever written, has to get some kudos! I have to admit that while reading the segment with the maggots had me laughing 'til I was crying. My only hope is that the movie doesn't make Julia Child look foolish. I hope she is portrayed as the smart, talented, remarkable woman she was. My only regret is that I didn't stand in line at the bookstore when Julia was signing copies of her last book. My loss.

While I was surprised that the book seemed to have little to do with Julia Child or even French cooking, I did find it a wealth of information about far-left mentality, complete with all the immorality, godlessness, and vitriolic intolerance of anyone who might hold a different opinion. The reader gets bizarre lessons on everything from social Darwinism to plumbing, all equally irrational. Despite wading through all the sewer language and \\"nasty\\" bits (and there are plenty of those), the writing is good, often funny and revealing. There are few sources where the elitist mentality comes charging through with flaming arrogance, but it is soon diluted with self-deprecation. Julia Child, whom the author says \\"hated\\" her, deserves our sympathy. However, I feel that I know Julie and Eric (In fact, I am sure I do, only they have different names), and I wish them well.

Living","review":"As another serious home cook who learned by making his way through Mastering the Art of French Cooking, I was eager to read this chronicle of a fellow Julia student. While I found it an entertaining read, the book has some serious flaws.First, the good: the most successful parts are the accounts of the actual cooking sessions. Her vividly recalled failures and frustrations in the kitchen are often hilarious and will resonate with anyone who has attempted to cook an ambitious menu. Her singular passion to accomplish her goal makes you root for her; when she does triumph -- both along the way in individual recipes and at the very end by making the deadline -- it's satisfying and poignant.What isn't sucessful are the bits added post-blog (and since I did not follow the project as it unveiled on her blog, I read the book as a newbie with no bias toward the original account). The imagined courtship between Julia and her husband Paul Child simply doesn't work. For one thing, these brief, italicized interludes are repetitive and don't really go anywhere or add up to anything. Nor do they reveal anything new about the couple's relationship that you couldn't glean from any of Julia's biographies. I assume the reason the Julia/Paul interludes are there is to show both Julie and Julia at the moments in their lives when they are both seeking the \\"Project\\" that will give meaning to their lives. It's interesting that cooking was the instrument of change in both their lives, but so what? -- that's true of many people, and hardly something that Powell and Child alone share. We already know the story about Julia & Paul's courtship so why cover that ground? (And even if you don't know about it, as Powell presents it it's not very interesting.) The passages feel randomly placed and intrusive; they're jarring in the way they steal you out of Julie's intense hot and bothered outerborough kitchen and thrust you into some stagy A&E; Biography-like \\"real-life reenactment\\" that feels false and \\"literary.\\" Their cool, sepia tone is also at odds with Powell's own marvelous salty, smart-ass voice. (It's not a pleasing contrast.) What would have been more original and also more challenging and revealing (of both Julias) would have been for Powell to imaginatively chronicle Julia Child's own progress in the kitchen -- show us how Julia learned how to carve a duck and how she felt during her own apprentice days about killing a live lobster, etc. That would at least have parallelled what Powell was going through, and would have gotten inside Julia's head in an interesting way. As it is, the Julia/Paul interludes feel tacked on, feel like padding. Some of the passages about Powell's friends and family and coworkers also have a tangential quality that dilutes the primary relationship here, which is Julie/Julia -- not Julia/Paul or even Julie/husband.I suspect that Powell's editors are to blame for these \\"enhancements\\" to the blog material. I hope she'll have the clout and courage to follow her own voice next time around."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

After seeing how cute the movie looked and seeing it was a film by Nora Ephron, the woman behind the great films Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, then I decided to give it a try. I started to read the book, got into it, maybe 50 pages in thinking, \\"This is cute, I think I'm going to like this.\\" I then started reading further into it and was very disappointed. Not only was it very long and boring, but the author has the tendency to not translate the meaning of what she's cooking, since all of the recipes have French names.

Plus, I love reading about cooking and eating--food writing in general makes me pretty happy. But ultimately, I just could not love this book, because I just had such a hard time liking Powell! The author seems to whine and complain nearly incessantly, and her myriad mentions of how evil all Republicans are were distracting and (in my opinion) totally unnecessary given the theme of the memoir. Maybe I was mistaken in seeing the film \\"Julie and Julia\\" prior to reading the book; I just prefer the Amy Adams' portrayal of Julie Powell in the movie I suppose.

Much like the movie with the same name, the book is as much about Julie's life--her marriage, her friendships, her thankless job--as it is about cooking. Unlike the movie, this book is really just about Julie, there is very little \\"real\\" Julia Child in this book. The only Julia in this book is the one in Julie's head, who almost like an imaginary friend, cheers Julie on as she make her way through MAoFC and helps her to discover an inner passion for cooking and how it brings people together.I really enjoyed this book. I thought Julie was honest and funny about the challenges of being young and direction-less in modern urban America. I found it interesting to see how Julie used the project to discover a real passion in herself and to provide herself a purpose that ultimately led her to fulfilment (and an extra 15 pounds of butter weight!). That being said, I don't agree with everything that Julie said or did, and yes she could be a little self centered at times. But this is her memoir, so she has a right to share the world from her perspective.If you are drawn to this book because you loved the movie--be warned, this Julie is a much more colorful (in both language and personality), well drawn character than the Julie in the movie, who in my opinion was sanitized into a typical romantic comedy heroine. Yes there are a lot of incidents that were in the movie that are also in the book. But the book is really about Julie and her life, not Julia Child. That being said, I loved both the book and the movie, but recognize them as two distinct works.If you're interested in reading about how one woman found herself through the completion of an unreasonable project that most people would never even think of undertaking, this book is for you. It shows Julie's project as it was--with all of the messes, curses and challenges that it contained.

You have to be in a generous state of mind to finish and maybe enjoy this book (which I was).

Who knew that hidden among the writings on food books was a gem of this caliber and magnificence.Julie Powell was like many failed actresses who had moved to New York before her...stuck in a dead end job. She was unhappy in her secretarial work for some government agency as are many people who labor at such menial occupations.On the cusp of her 30th birthday, Julie recognized the trivial existence she had been inhabiting and determined that she needed some purpose in life. She was beckoned to what would be become her Bible for the next year...Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child. Julie resolved to cook her way through this intimidating collection of recipes within one year. Not only did she take on this daunting task, she decided to blog about her experience, which resulted in a group of followers, several interviews, and an eventual book deal.What follows the introduction into the premise is 300 astonishing pages of anger, pain, laughter, frustration, adoration, and...butter. Julie deliciously (and sometimes disgustingly) describes, in detail, her journey into the foray of French cooking. We are thrilled with her when she accomplishes tasks such as bone marrow scraping and crepe flipping. We are aggravated alongside her through the poaching of eggs and the ever elusive task of mayonnaise making. We are enraptured with tart-a-palooza and squirm our way through aspics. We are even with her when she attempts culinary seduction by way of pecan spice cake with pecan icing.Not only is there are relationship built with Julie but through her, and the apartments in her brain pan, we come to know Julia Child as a culinary genius and one Hell of a woman. I was even saddened when in the final pages of the book I learned that Julia Child died on the eve of her 92nd birthday.This book is not strictly about food, though that is the central theme, but is also about people. We get to know Sally and are somewhat creeped out by the David's, we worry over Isabel's life altering choices, and enjoy Gwen's sexy IM romance. We are thankful for husband's as supportive and composed as Eric and wish Julie's mother would just calm down. What is there to say about Heathcliff other than...that's Heathcliff.What can I say to express the sheer pleasure and delight that filled me with each turn of the page? I laughed, I cried, and I toiled. This book is inspirational to say the least. I was ravenous through the majority of its duration and my cravings would change as we grew deeper into the cookbook, beginning with potato soup and ending with a stuffed, pastry-wrapped duck. I found myself overflowing with the hunger to cook. I kept walking to my kitchen bookshelf to find and flip through my copy of Julia Child's The Way to Cook. Not only have I found myself wanting to create culinary masterpieces, I also was inspired to write. Julie Powell's voice is blunt, brutal, and honest. She has no qualms about using the word f*** whenever she sees fit, and sometimes even if it doesn't fit. She does not sugar coat her life to make it seem more desirable. She offers the reader nothing other than her self and her life. Take her as she as or do not take her at all...and balls to you if you don't like her!All in all, this was quite a delectable read. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh and or if you simply want an uplifting, yet down and dirty read. I cannot wait to see what Julie comes out with next.

Living","review":"Julie Powell loves Julia Child. Wanting to give something more to her life, she gives herself one year to cook her way through all 524 recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, or MtAoFC, as Julie calls it. Julie gains more and more online and then real life popularity as she continues her plight making gross-sounding gelatin entrees, boiling live lobsters, and getting the pink slimy marrow out of bones. The cooking scenes are bound to make a reader a little squeamish, but make you respect Julie and her husband Sam, who helps out, all the more. Julie's running narrative is full of emphatic cursing (which is disliked by some of her blog readers but I enjoyed), and I like her self-deprecating sense of humor. The book has about six false endings, which is kind of annoying, but helped to wrap up The Project (as Julie calls it) a little better. Julie also lives in New York the year after 9/11, and works as a temp for the people responsible for taking ideas for a monument for the tragedy, and handles this with grace and as always, her unique perspective."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

She had some inside help on this..or maybe she glommed onto a Julia Child blog. No wonder Julia was irritated with her.I suspect Julia threw up her hands when she learned that the author was attempting to make one of her recipes in the midst of maggots. While the author may have found that cute and self-deprecating, I found it disgusting.And by the way..if you disapprove of the politics of the people who are paying your salary ( at the time the book was written, the taxpayers had voted Republican and the author was living on the taxpayers) show some principle and go work for some other entity that will tolerate your apathy, ennui, and frequent sick days. We get it, you are a Democrat, you are too good to work for Republicans, and you have maggots in your kitchen. And you are absolutely too smart for your job. Well...the reader is wondering...if you are so smart....why do you have that job? Perhaps because working for the government is all you can acccomplish?Ok.. I like to cook, I'm not an expert, would not eat kidneys etc. Admire her effort if not her housekeeping...wonder if it really happened however...or if it was all a fake.Bottom line this was a mildly amusing tale..have read better blogs about more interesting subjects and I'm certainly glad I did not buy it in hard cover.

Quick, real, young, funny, pretty good writing although kind of blog-like. More of a psychological portrait than a cooking memoir.I found Powell's snapshot of a young woman struggling both entertaining and sad. The author presents her life honestly, the way SHE see it, right where she is in life, right now - in this case negative, upset, lost and hard on other people. This author admits she is troubled. She has fertility problems, which I know, from experience, can be more devastating than you think. She seems alcoholic. She drinks a lot. Her views, attitudes and behavior remind me of an untreated alcoholic, and I have known quite a few. I try not to judge her and I am glad I read the book.

I loved her use of foul language almost as much as I loved her obsession with Mastering the Art of French Cooking. She makes something that would normally be rather boring to witness into something hilarious and charming. Yes she does use vulgar language throughout the book but I personally don't care. She has a knack for writing and a wit that cannot be compared with any other author I have ever read. She has a way of describing situations in a way that makes you say, \\"I know exactly what you mean!\\" even if you don't. Her frustration with life and cooking comes through so clearly with her words and yet leaves you feeling completely satisfied with how it turns out. Is it different from the movie? Of course, books always are. Is the movie better? Hell no! I enjoyed the movie but I LOVE the book. I checked it out from the library but I plan on purchasing it so I can read it whenever I feel like it. Not only is it a hilarious read but you also are left with this undeniable urge to try out some of Julie Child's recipes. I plan on doing just that on Valentine's day with Julia's Beef bourguignon. I'm sure it will be just as delicious as both Julie and Julia say it is and I am just so amazed that a book has inspired me to even try it. I do enjoy cooking and I do remember watching Julia Child when I was a child but I was never interested in buying a cook book of hers or even really learning more about the woman until reading this book. For that I thank Julie Powell for doing her project and then publishing this book. The people who didn't enjoy the book I can only say they didn't take the time really learn anything from it. If you just look at it as a book full of foul language you are missing the bigger picture entirely. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the book first then watch it.

Many of them also expected good cooking advice and practice. I found Julie hysterical, whiny, prone to fits, snarky, and I didn't expect any cooking advice, just some excellent interpersonal stories.Don't pick this up is you want to Master the Art of French Cooking. Don't pick it up if you want to glean expert recipe skills. In fact, if you are a foodie, you might not enjoy Powell and company's lack of appreciation for the more exotic delicacies. This is a book for anyone who enjoys a good memoir-this one just happens to be centered around the ultimate gourmet cookbook.As a modern working woman, I appreciated Powell's shock at the time these recipes called for. Finding ingredients was hard enough (no supercenters for these people-they spent hours traipsing through neighborhoods for complete leg bones with marrow, or sugar cubes instead of granular sugar, or calves feet). Once the ingredients were tracked down, recipes took hours, If things went awry, Julie could be behind on dinner by 10:30 AM. Mixtures often needed to sit for \\"at least 12 hours, preferably 24.\\" Everything was made from scratch. No quick gelatin-it was created from calves' feet, which \\"makes your kitchen smell like a tannery...also, in my admittedly limited experience, it *tastes* like a tannery.\\" Mayonnaise was made from scratch, and ladyfingers from scratch were attempted so as not to use commercial ones and \\"debase an otherwise remarkable dessert.\\"Powell's book takes place post-9/11, and she comments on her job as a secretary in a government office overlooking ground zero, on the families who visit their windowed conference room, and on her data entry job receiving surveys about the 9/11 memorial. She also lived in NY through the 2003 blackout, and there is a beautiful chapter about the candlelight dinner she made for her NY refugees on the night of the power outage.Overall this is a terrific read IF you read my caveats and didn't come looking to Master the Art of French Cooking. For anyone who was a fan of this book, also try A.J. Jacobs' The Know-It-All.

A talented, educated young woman in a thankless, low-paying secretarial job in Lower Manhattan and a microscopic apartment in Brooklyn, she was teetering on very real depression over the realization that the adult world we all yearn for as adolescents wasn't that peachy keen. To cut to the quick: to keep the demons at bay, she set out on the journey known as the Julie/Julia Project, in which she challenged herself to make all 564 recipes in Julia Child's MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, Vol. 1, in 365 days, in that doll-sized kitchen, and to keep a blog about it.It never occurred to her that the blog would be read by anyone, but she soon accrued a following of faithful \\"bleaders\\" and the attention of the national media. While the book reprises some passages from the blog and bleader responses, it is about much more. It is a grand, hilarious and often touching tour of her family and her friends, especially as they finally shed adolescence and take on full adulthood in this post 9-11 world, and it is not egocentric or navel-gazing in the least. She provides a unique and insightful perspective of the phenomenon of Julia Child, her personal accomplishments and their affect on our culture. Powell is a born performer and all her stories, whether of cooking in the most adverse circumstances (imagine all the drains clogging up at once or the big blackout or the media showing up) or the rest of her life, are engaging.Powell takes an artistic risk that I think works: she intersperses imagined scenes from the early life of Julia and Paul Child, from their meeting to the point early in their marriage when she decides to attend cooking classes in France. These sketches are not disrespectful; they are a way of communicating with the muse.This book did not just make me laugh, it left me thinking a lot about Julia Child, her way of cooking, how Americans cook now, my late mother, why I cook, lots of significant things. What I love the most about JULIE AND JULIA is that unlike a lot of books where an author dips a toe in offbeat waters in order to write the book, this author grew as a result of her full-plunge and significant experience, landed in a better place than where she began, and the book came last.

Oh and how does she get the cookbook she decides to try to make something out of, she steals her mom's book. Mom has had and used this book for 40 years and while she is home, she sneaks it into her suitcase, what a kid.5. However, she is not a kid she is 29 going on 30 while writing this blog and cooking so she is old enough to understand how to write a blog but not mature enough to leave out the cursing even when her bloggers ask her to lighten up and then she puts all that nasty language in this book.6. She also like to poke fun at the people in the agency she works for because they take their work seriously, because she is neither wise nor dedicated and admittedly takes the job just to have one. She wanted to be an actress but did not like to go to casing calls so consequently did not get any jobs.7. She also makes several disturbing references about shooting people in power, either herself or her brother.8. The author ridicules other Christian beliefs as well as normal American concepts because she is so above the need for moral guidelines with her own beliefs, which are not existent.9. This book is being recommended for reading groups and has discussion questions in the back, before your Christian Book Club mistakenly picks this one you may want to discuss if it is worth wading through all the filth, especially the disturbing and constant use of God's name in vain.I would be happy to lend my copy to anyone, usually I pass books along to my daughters or donate them, but I do not want to inflict this on anyone who is not interested and for the same reason do not want anyone to spend money that will encourage this type of trash writing. I enjoy good books; this is just obviously not good literature and not worth spending money on.I cannot tell you how disappointed I was because I had looked forward to seeing this as a movie thinking it would be good entertainment. I know books can be different from the movie that follows if anyone has seen the movie and has another opinion I would welcome your comments."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Julie Powell tried to tie together a series of disparate blogs into a meaningful and humorous account of a year but didn't succeed very well; I felt like I was bouncing from one story to another to another without any strong connections between them and, unfortunately, there wasn't much humor or well-rounded characters to make up for it (Julie, the one fully fleshed character, was more annoying that sympathetic).

Living","review":"Julia Child, just the name invokes images of a tall, funny speaking woman who had a TV cooking show. What I remember the most is that at the end of the series, she would say 'Bon Appetit'. Julie Powell has given us insight into this woman, and I now admire and respect her very much.Julie Powell took a year of her life to make it a more interesting and fun life. On a trip to her parents' home she found Julia Child's first cooking book, 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Since Julie loved to cook and was looking for a project, she decided to recreate every one of Julia Child's recipes over the next year. Her husband, Eric suggested she write a blog at the same time. Soon, the recipes came fast and furious with a great deal of angst and uncertainty in tow. Julie also found an audience that loved her irreverent and funny blog. She became a hit and her cooking skills increased. With each recipe she would enclose or discuss the trails and tribulations that Julia Child experienced when she started cooking in France, fifty years ago. Julie's family, friends and extended family all play a large part in this book. Julie discloses a great deal about herself and her husband and their marriage. But, this also gives us a taste of who Julie Powell really is. She is someone we would all like to know. She does not suffer fools lightly, she takes no prisoners and swears like a sailor, well, actually, like her mother!The recipes sound luscious and Julie and her husband do everything they can to replicate the recipes exactly. Julie has a sinkful of dishes most of the time and throughout the year, dust and even maggots accumulate, all in the interest of good food. And, they did eat well, liver seems to be the meat of choice and we learn every way to cook liver and the delicious sauces that accompany this dish. Julia Child, it seems had a robust sense of humor as well as a robust love of sex. Who would have guessed this?I loved this book, and devoured it in two days. It is a 'not put down' book that will keep you laughing and smiling and hungry! Meryl Streep plays Julia Child in a film of the same name, 'Julie and Julia'. This will be a must see film.Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-15-09Cleaving: A Story of Marriage, Meat, and ObsessionMastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Fortieth - 40th - Anniversary Edition) (Vol 1)"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

You may also be interested in a cookbook/memoir called NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. Similar to Julie's idea, NOT ON LOVE ALONE is built around one year of cooking -- specifically, it divides the first year of a newlywed couple's marriage into 12 months, with little stories and recipes for each of the months. It's charming and witty, and utterly appealing, just like Julie.Enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

And even more shameful are those who bought it. But, as P.T.Barnum might have said: there's a sucker born every minute. BTW for those who are wondering, I didn't buy the book. I saw it at a bookstore, sat and skimmed through and then put it back on the shelf. Among my collection of cookbooks are every one Julia Child has written or co-authored. I'd read any one of them again before delving into this one. Unlike Ms. Powell I have cooked my way through volumes 1 and 2 of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and it ain't an easy task ... and in a small kitchen in a small apartment in Chelsea (NYC). Some recipes I've done over two or three times just to get them right ... I seriously doubt if Ms. Powell did. BUT what a wonderful conceit to sell a book!Oh, do see the film if you haven't already. It's wonderful not because of the sections on Ms. Powell's troubles but because of the information received of Julia Child's life that many may not be aware of. And that information is important when comparing the two -- Julia and Julie. Julia Child spent much of her lifetime mastering the art of French Cooking (It can't be done in a day, week or year -- just how long did it take her to perfect a good recipe for French Bread? Two years? And then sadly you realize that the recognition, fame and fortune that took one woman, Julia Child, years to obtain was handed, so to speak, to Ms. Powell on a silver platter.

One reason I read this last was the plethora of scathing reviews. But I enjoyed this book. I'm trying to figure out what the huge backlash is all about, and I think I have a few ideas: 1) If you are a Republican you'll be insulted. She does not hide her lack of affection for Republicans 2) If you are offended by the \\"F\\" word, pass this book by. It is laced with it. 3) She writes in that hip nouveau smart-aleck voice that can be and often is intensely annoying. But Julie Powell pulls that off better than most. 4) This is not a tome that rehashes Julia's life or work. Plenty of other books do that. MtAoFC merely provides the framework around which Ms. Powell is able to re-focus her life and accomplish something worthwhile. If you are looking for culinary loftiness and a pretentious wannabe Food Network star who seeks to impress with superior skills and taste, look somewhere else. This book is by and about a real woman seeking to find meaning and direction in her life.

She spews contempt for Republicans, Texans, New York and New Yorkers, has unnecessarily bad language throughout the book, and at one point finds it acceptable that a friend is engaging in Internet sex with a married co-worker on the opposite coast. Sorry, she's just not my kind of person.Many people around age 30 are struggling to establish their identities and are trapped in mind-numbing directionless jobs. Like many, Julie found something to do: Cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in one year and blogging about it. No doubt this was a huge challenge that was personal stretch for her, but in my mind it's hardly anything notable. Lots of people stuck in dead-end jobs and mundane or unchallenging or in some way difficult lives(or not) undertake large personal challenges: they volunteer for non-profits, decide to run a marathon, write a novel, climb Mt. Everest or go back to school. Some of these efforts even contribute something to society in the end. Julie's challenege is no more exceptional than any of these and in many cases is less exceptional. So she cooked her way through an entire cookbook. So what? Why was the self-imposed timeline so important that it caused her enormous angst? Why does she live and work in New York if she hates it as much as she seems? It's never clear why she's there in the first place. And at the end of \\"The Project\\", she still remained a foul-mouthed, jaded New Yorker with contempt for people with personal views different than hers, except now she is one with a book and movie deal. I don't get it.The writing was fragmented, the book frequently wandered, and it took me a long time to wade through the book. There was less about Julia Child and her life than I expected. And frankly Julia Child, who in her quest to accomplish something with her life in her 30's and 40's, gave us all something we could use: books and a television program that led to a sea change in the attitudes about food in the United States that was much needed in the 1960s and 70s. It's the reason she's still iconic today, even if some of the recipes are dated. And she managed to do it all with resorting to constant profanity.If you want to learn more about Julia Child, read \\"My Life in France.\\" While she also clearly identifies her political views, it was in the context of her lifelong disagreements with her father, which was clearly a personal struggle. But to my knowledge, she never served a dish containing glass chards to Republicans."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I don't do Julia Child-style gourmet cooking; it frustrates me more often than not, but I do like a good bit of food writing and this is not it. It's a memoir of sorts and a vent for the writer's self-absorbed angst. Not that most people don't have similar moments, but most people don't write about them either. The pettish slaps at Republicans(otherwise kind, intelligent people who still vote Republican? please) get old after about three such intervals and the frank discussion of friends' sex lives as well as her own-well, it's just not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Nora Ephron's movie makes Julie Powell out to be a quirky, fun person who takes on a daunting task, perseveres through many challenges, and learns life lessons from following in Julia Child's giant footsteps. Nora also splits her screen time between the two characters, drawing interesting comparisons between the two women.Unfortunately, Julie Powell's character in the book comes off as whiny, self-centered, alcoholic, and intolerant. In the movie, Julie is thrilled and amazed that people start reading her blog and commenting. In the book she scorns her readers, amazed that anyone would waste their time. The way she mocked their interest in her blog was unpleasant, along with her lack of respect for her long-suffering husband. I read about a third of the book, but there are too many good books I haven't read yet to waste more time on this one."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

I was expecting a fun book focusing on her project, the challenges with cooking and other adventures that she had while cooking her way through a great cookbook, but I was sorely disappointed. The author went on and on about her personal life, her job at a government agency and her relationships with friends and family. It is more like a diary of the author's life with the cooking project being a side-note.

It seemed fitting to listen to a book about Julia Child and her book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, while winging my way to France.Since I'd heard a great deal about the book, I later read the actual book to compare it to the abridged audio version.The author reads the audio book and does a brilliant job. As someone who dislikes anything and everything about cooking, I admired her perseverance in tackling such a huge project in one year.Powell writes in a manner that could be termed a quirky stream of consciousness that is interesting and often quite funny. Generally I enjoyed her offbeat writing and the people that make up the landscape of her life. At other times I found her coarse, juvenile, whiny and disrespectful in a way that wasn't at all funny. It was trite and disrespectful and made her look uncaring.I found her generalization and stereotyping of Republicans as evil people, sad yet interesting, since Democrats call for the acceptance of diverse beliefs. Apparently that only goes for them and not others. As a Kennedy Democrat of yesteryear I was embarrassed. Somehow the title didn't fit Powell's banal rants. Her language certainly was surprising. And then there were the 9/11 references. I wanted to discontinue at that point. Her disdain for the victims families, well, I have no words to adequately express my feelings.That said, Powell exhibits talent and is free to express her beliefs. I hope she puts it to better use in her next outing. Perhaps she'll grow up a bit, and latch on to some wisdom before then. I hope so because she has a gift that needs some fine-tuning and direction. If she doesn't, she might find that she's lost fifty percent of her audience. Maybe more if you include the older folks of similar political leanings.Armchair Interviews says: This book could have and should have been brilliant. It's not.

References to Julia and Paul Childs are sparse and oddly placed. Time spent chronicling work in the kitchen (which was fairly interesting) was vastly overshadowed by incoherent rants about family and friends. Attempts at wit were forced and not particularly funny. I generally smile at chiding by opposing political parties; however, I found Ms. Powell's persistent irreverent generalization of Republicans as unemotional and \\"piggy\\" annoying. I was particularly troubled after reading the cold account of her job consoling families a year post 9/11 as \\"emotional sh** work\\".

Her marriage and friendships were positive and loving. All in all, even apart from her influence on cooking/eating, she was a worthwhile person in every respect.Ms. Powell is a self-indulgent, whiny, neurotic and colossally boring brat. She treats little annoyances like world disasters, she is a miserable spouse and friend, and she revels in her self-indulgent immaturity. For her to exploit the life/name of Ms. Child is a travesty and it is a shame that she made a dime doing it.I immediately re-read the wonderful \\"Appetite for Life\\" after wading through Ms. Powell's dreck and nothing could have more clearly emphasized what an utter waste Ms. Powell's book was.

I thought it sounded gimmicky. But thanks to the free sample option on my kindle, I read the beginning of the book. And I loved it! So I downloaded it and absolutely devoured the rest of it in a matter of hours, and there was nothing my newborn or my two year old (or my husband, for that matter) could do to stop me.Now, you have to know what this book is, and what it is not. It's not a rehashing of JC's recipes, or an assessment whether the author succeeded or failed in her attempts to make all 524 recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year. It's not a paean to Julia Child, or to french cooking in general, or an attempt by the author to toot her own horn over her culinary skills (except for the deboned duck, which was well warranted); after reading about her filthy kitchen, as a matter of fact, I'm not sure ANYONE should eat Julie Powell's cooking, french or not. What this book is, is a memoir by a young woman lost and full of no small amount of despair in her everyday life. And she found purpose and enthusiasm for her life thanks to Julia Child. Does that sound hokey? Maybe. But Julie Powell pulls it off, and she does it in a damn funny and engaging way. Her voice is fresh and real; she sounds just like who she is: an almost 30-something. She swears; she's irreverent; she throws tantrums not unlike the ones I wanted to throw when I was her age.Some reviewers have objected to her language, but balls to that. And some have said she is disrespectful towards Republicans and about 9/11. She certainly is bitter and ascerbic towards the GOP and its supporters, and when you put this in historical context, it makes absolute sense, especially for her age group. On the matter of 9/11, I think that's just over it. She's a New Yorker; she lived it, and continued to have to face the repercussions of it every day thanks to the job that she had. She just doesn't have the reverence for 9/11 that so many do - and I think that it's justified. In any case, it's a small part of the book. Another reviewer says that they walked away feeling that Julie didn't even like Julia Child. This reviewer must not have read the book, or at least very much of it, because it's very, very clear throughout that Julie admires and even adores Julia, so much so that she basically creates an imaginary friend Julia Child for herself, to keep herself going.

She doesn't even make the food sound good, which was so disappointing in a book about cooking Julia Child's recipes. I was so tired of all the COMPLAINING. She complains about her job, her apartment, her friends, her move, her husband, and what's up with all the profanity? I wanted to yell \\"grow up!\\" half the time I was reading it. Sometimes complaining is okay - like when it's funny; comedians have made quite a living with that, but hers isn't funny, it's just annoying.I was so bothered by the way she treated her husband when he was having a migraine - absolutely deplorable. It's terrible that she did it, but then to write about it shows her to be selfish and narcissistic.The last thing I'll mention are the numerous war references she uses, the one that sticks out the most is when she refers to the mess in her apartment as like the Bataan Death March.

I truly think the poor woman is unable to go five minutes without using the \\"F word\\" (along with a slew of others). I'm not a prude but there's a time and a place for everything and a book about cooking (I dare not say love of cooking) is not it. Speaking of talking, there is not a whole lot of chatter about food despite the subject matter. So what does she talk about?Well, sex for one, LOTS of it - sex thoughts when she was a teenager, in college, sex with her husband, her brother's sex, her friends's sex, even (hard to believe) an alleged affair by her poor father - is it possible to get lower? Then she rants about politics. Her quips against the Prez & the GOP were at first humorous, then tiring, then trite, then annoying. After the 100th remark, adjectives like immaturity and infuriating come to mind. She ends the book (there are several \\"endings\\") by fantasizing on assassinating Bush - not your usual cup of tea.My problem is I didn't like her as a person much less a cook. Her kitchen was so filthy that a colony of maggots flourished on the counter, she made fun of 9-11 victim's families and their thoughts, she told us secrets of her friends, she gave us details of sordid nights of drinking and let us in as viewers of her many fits, tantrums and breakdowns. She repeatedly tried to include herself with the working poor yet the costs of the ingredients alone (not counting the copious liquor) could have fed an apartment building for a year. Occasionally she gets around to the food and some of it is enjoyable, especially as she attempts to cook from a book 40 years old. But the food is definitely secondary to her tales of woe and vivid descriptions of her apparently tragic life. This is all the more pitiful because this could have been another \\"Year in Provence\\" by a more mature writer. Instead it is \\"Heat\\" without the intelligence or obvious love of food."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

There was not enough wine to help them through it and yes we do enjoy dark humor.She is a complete narcissist and lacks any ability to relay a story, even a horrible one. She whines througout the entire book about every single thing in her life. She rambles, complains, curses stupidly and treats her husband Eric like crap non-stop. I often find that when a woman writes a list of reasons why her husband would never leave or cheat on her he usually already has.The author has nothing but disgust and contempt for New York and real New Yorkers, page 149 \\"Yes, New York is a stinking, chaotic, life-sucking cesspool and Austin, Texas, is a verdant, peaceful paradise,...\\" one of many insults about this great city. She's a wanna-be New Yorker and overcompensates while still complaining about her endless knowledge of every nook and cranny of the city. Terms like \\"Yankee-fied\\", \\"New York-hardened skin\\" phrases are sad. To the rest of us it's just disturbing.On that note, her complete lack of sympathy or kindness towards the families affected by September 11th (9/11) is reprehensible. She thinks she's funny she's not, she's jut cruel. And I guess she thinks by being the most venemous liberal in LIC it will make her more acceptable. Again, it doesn't, she's just ignorant and small minded.More french cooking less narcisstic sharing. Our group decided to pass on the movie now. I read a few pages of her next book and it's more of the same garbage only now she's a butcher, what a surpise.Towards the end of the book she find out from a CA reporter in an interview that Julia Child said she hates Julie Powell and now I find that very understandable. Julia Child was in a class all her own an accomplished woman.

The book jumps from one subject to the next with some personal stuff thrown in about her pals who I don't really care about as they don't really add to the subject.

As psychotic as Julie is often portrayed (and I'm sure that Powell uses a healthy dose of hyperbole in the book), I think we all know exactly where she's coming from. I would bet that there isn't a single woman out there who could not relate to Julie in at least some way, most of us - in more than one.The book, however, ended up disappointing me (thus the two stars). I can't believe some people call it \\"inspirational\\" and \\"profound\\". I think the book fell very short on profound stuff, even though it seemed to be heading in that direction for a while. And I failed to see how it's inspirational to know that of millions and millions of blogs out there a few managed to bring their owners money and fame. Maybe it's just me, but I find something \\"inspirational\\" when it compels anyone who reads it to make a change for the better, however small. By Julie's own admission, her life would have quickly returned to sucking after her 15 minutes of fame, had it not been for the book and the money. NOT the project.So, really, the title of the book should have been \\"Julie&her; editor\\", since THAT was what changed her life. Julia was just a pretext and didn't really take her (and, therefore, her reader) anywhere new psychologically and spiritually. Just out of the hated job and old apartment. And since we cannot follow her down THAT path, the end of the book felt very anticlimactic to me (I kind of figured she got the book deal from, well... the cover?)."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Living","review":"There is no other word to describe Julie Powell then unlikable. Having not seen the movie, I asked my mother if Amy Adams portrayed her as a foul-mouth, whiny person. Apparently, she did not. While I was not expecting a perky little house frau, I did hope that the author would have some redeeming qualities. For example, she is endlessly mean to her husband, passes judgement on all of her friends and collegues and gives intimate details of their sexual exploits,and even though I am a Democrat myself, I find her continual jabs at the Republicans she works with incredibly disrespectful. All this relates to Julia Child how? I'm still not sure. I am no prude and believe me I have had go arounds with my husband, cursed, and have been judgmental. I just don't feel the need to write any of my personal issues in a book. However, she swears like a truck driver and drinks to the point where she ruins some dishes. If that's what you are doing at 29 years old, perhaps lack of culinary expertise is the least of your issues. That and maybe her lack of heart in dealing with the families of 9/11 victims because she didn't like her job. A real stand up gal!I hoped this would be more of homage to Julia Child. I own both volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Both were my Grandmother's. We used to watch the show together on PBS back in the 70's. I felt like Julia was an after thought and it was only towards the end where her significance is truly addressed. I felt that there was not really a great love for this culinary icon so much as she was a means to an end. I guess I was hoping this would be about love of food and a passion for cooking and a tip of the sauce pan to a great legend of the kitchen. Instead, I found it self-indulgent and insufferable. It's much more of a complaint about how awful she precieves her life to be instead of a great chance to really honor an outstanding woman. No wonder Julia didn't care so much for Julie."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"This book suffers in comparison to the movie, not for its quality, but for its attitude. Like most people, I hadn't heard of Julie Powell or the Julie/Julia project until the movie with Amy Adams and the incomparable Meryl Streep (who should have got the best actress Oscar!) was released. The problem is that Amy Adams is not Julie Powell. She is waaaay too sweet. There is a sweetness that pervades the whole movie that made me go out and buy the book and read it to my wife while she cooked our dinners. The book was entertaining, and I love any story where the protagonist discovers herself and is transformed by overcoming obstacles and facing her demons. Julie Powell is an interesting character in her own right. The movie did her an injustice by portraying a marketable Hollywood characterization. The movie did well, and, I suppose, Julie Powell is happy about that, but, unfortunately, many people will be put off by the disparity between the sweet Amy Adams and the earthy, real, Julie Powell. After reading the book, I told my wife that the movie would have been more accurately cast with Sarah Silverman playing the role of Julie Powell. I don't know if it would have made as much money, but it would have been more honest.I can imagine gaggles of church ladies running out to buy Julie & Julia after watching the movie and even selecting it for their book club. We know a few who did, and we had to laugh as we read the book and imagined their shock and horror at some of Julie's subject matter and language.I don't know Julia Child. But I know she is a woman from another generation. I could see her rightly being put off by Julie Powell's sexual candor and not-for-general-audiences language. I kind of had a chip on my shoulder about Julia snubbing Julie in the movie (how could she do that to poor, sweet, Amy Adams?), but now I think I can understand where she was coming from. Unfortunately, Julia never really got to know Julie, and, in the end, I think she would have liked her. Julie Powell is a gifted thinker and writer, and in the end, a decent human being. I think Julie Powell honors the legacy of Julia Child.Ultimately, I think, the book must judged on its own merits. It isn't deep, but it is human and entertaining. Julie Powell doesn't deserve much of the criticism she is getting in the reviews here, because people are really just condemning her for not being Amy Adams, a Hollywood fiction. A nice, sweet one, but a fiction nonetheless."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

They were so few and added absolutely nothing to the book. Ms. Powell could have researched and wrote about Julia's real life. Why did Ms. Powell not even bother to contact Julia Child? Julia was still alive when the blog was started. Ms. Powell had a wealth of information she could have discovered but chose to ignore it so she could write whatever she liked; very lazy. As for Julie Powell as a person, she is spoiled and self consumed. She whines about everything and everyone. She takes her husband for granted, she's ashamed of being a secretary, and complains she'll have trouble getting pregnant despite that she sold her own eggs to pay off credit card debt. CREDIT CARD DEBT! She also lacks empathy. Ms. Powell decribes how she often works in the \\"Family Room\\" for the families of 9/11 victims yet she seems oblivious to their pain and heartache. I am certain that seeing these people cry and put up letters and pictures on the wall would be life altering for me. It doesn't affect her. She uses cooking all the recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking to add meaning to her life; a reason to keep going. I find it very hard to have any sympathy for her. I feel more sorry for Julia Child who had no choice about being featured in this mediocre book. P.S. Cleaving, Ms. Powell's second book is worse!

At least the movie people were bright enough not to insult a chunk of their audience.Take all of Ms. Powell's insulting generalizations about Republicans and change the word Republicans to Democrats or Jews or Catholics or African-Americans or Chinese and see how insulting they sound.

After reading about the wondrous slimming powers of French eating in Will Clower's \\"The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss\\" and \\"The French Don't Diet Plan: 10 Simple Steps to Stay Thin for Life,\\" along with Mireille Guiliano's \\"French Women Don't Get Fat,\\" Michel Montignac's \\"The French Diet: Why French Women Don't Get Fat\\" and multiple cookbook dieting diatribe offerings from mega home shopping diva Suzanne Sommers, unsophisticated Americans from the west to east coast want to know if eating stick after stick of butter really will allow you to fit into that fabulous pencil skirt without the corseting muffin-top effect of a good body shaper. Well, here's what blogger and now writer Julie Powell, back in 2002, found out when she took it on the cuff (or hips) for the rest of us.Deciding that her \\"government drone\\" secretarial job did not provide her with enough stimulation, she embarks upon her Julie/Julia Project, a foodie blog where she cooks and comments her way through Julia Child's definitive tome on French cuisine, \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One (1) (Fortieth - 40th - Anniversary Edition) (Vol 1).\\" Trust me, Powell did not engage in this yearlong battle with French gastronomy for the sole purpose of discovering that yes, she would put on the pounds. I just made that up. I am not quite sure why the Austin Texas native did it all other than that once she started and realized that she did have a dedicated cyber-audience she had to continue to the bitter end.Whatever the case, tipping the scale in the wrong direction may seem superfluous when compared with Powell's resulting jumpstart to her own career as blogger, now writer and, once this Friday rolls around, lead character in a Nora Ephron rom-com where the cutely efficient Amy Adams plays her as cozily married and knee-deep in dirty dishes in an apartment where the plumbing doesn't work and the maggots have more than enough unclean prep-time fodder to turn into a healthy swarm of flies. (Ugh--makes you wonder if you could ever be hungry in such an environment, doesn't it?) Powell's blog morphed into \\"Julie and Julia\\" a memoir of her year living in Long Island City, trekking to work in downtown Manhattan while whipping up quelque choses francaises in the evening as dictated by the pioneer of all television foodies--the oracle of all food oracles, Julia Child.I never read Powell's blog. Unfortunately, although the site still exists, the entries are no longer available for anyone's reading pleasure. I guess \\"Julie and Julia\\" is supposed to suffice. Sadly, I don't know if it does. The premise while good takes an almost daily food blog and whittles it down to mainstream paperback size. Mixed in are a few italicized stories about Julia and Paul Child--an afterthought of sorts that seems to weakly pull Julie and Julia together as they, both as wives and women, attempt to find \`projects' that add meaning and purpose to their respective lives. The result as pertaining to Julie comes across as disjointed with obviously missing pieces that only a daily reading of the on-line journal could rectify.In addition to the blaring plot holes, Powell's stories about her friends leave much to be desired. I want to read about food--its preparation and the moments it creates as all those culinary smells take over that seedy apartment and convert it into a Mecca of Indulgence--not some goofy \`Sex in the City' type hype about being young and living vicariously through a troop of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and/or Miranda wannabes. What the heck! I surely do not want to consume all that butter, but as Julie and her husband, Eric (what a nice guy), did just that for me, I wanted to roll about with the abandon of that Roquefort filling and become lavishly enslaved within Julia's pastry recipe like some perfectly perfumed and rounded odalisque at Topkapi Palace. Allow me this foray into classic cuisine without the intrusive meddling of 21st century melodrama.Bottom Line: Julie Powell, author of the blog \\"the Julie/Julia Project\\" converts her year's work into a memoir, \\"Julie and Julia,\\" relating her cooking experiences while mastering the art of French cooking ala Julia Child. From a literary standpoint, the book has some holes, evidently the result of attempting to stuff a year's journal into 300 plus pages like so much filling into a diet-sized crepe. Rather than the over exposed descriptions depicting the squalor of Powell's Long Island City apartment, her almost annoying comments regarding her disgust for anyone who isn't a liberal democrat and her disability to interject displeasure without using the \`eff' word, more food adventures would have been welcome along with a more definitive notion as to why all this was done in the first place. Powell becomes a little fatter albeit much more famous while she proves that the French paradox remains just that no matter how old you are or where you live. I reserve my recommendation for after I see the upcoming film Julie & Julia [Theatrical Release].

It is boring with emphisis on drawing out the \\"r\\" in borrrring. Nothing has happened other than Julie is in the typical learning about life rut, frustrations about her job, and oh wait that's it.I keep hoping that the book will pick up, that something interesting will happen and make me want to finish it, but a sofa stuck in a staircase is sure not it.I get frustrated when trying to force myself to finish a book, especially when I know that there are so many others that I have to force myself to put down and am disappointed when it does end.

She was grasping for material, so she had to pretend that cooking was still so ha-a-a-rd...The brilliance of this book is the achievement, taken on with Child-ish aplomb and Manhattan views. The deterioration is that she simply gets a bit slapstick at the end. She is understandably crushed when Julia gives her blog a bad review for disrespect, but continues the disrespect by saying, \\"Julia thinks I'm a pissy little bitch\\". Well, it's just possible, Julia did her show as a lady during a time when the F word in print was only done by Henry Miller and J.D. Salinger. A more appropo response might have been to curse less in the blog, rather than put epithets in Julia's posthumous mouth.Nonetheless, this closely observed book about food and alchemy is great fun.

In addition to experimenting all the recipes, Julie decided to start her own blog, documenting her experience. It was encouraging to her when she started having readers who encouraged her to keep going when she was very frustruated with her cooking as well as just life in general.It was quite fun to read about Julie's experience as sometimes, the food might turn out well and sometime it was quite disastrous. It was also interesting to read about her ordeal of getting weird incredients that were suggested by Julia Child. I think that people who have try experimenting with different recipes may be able to relate to Julie's experience. I am not sure why some reviewers here are upset that Julie did not provide any recipes as this is not a cookbook. This is about Julie and her quest to complete her \\"project.\\" In the midst of working on her \\"project\\", she provided information about her personal life, her work as well has her friends. This was quite an engaging read for me."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

The book is written by a very unlikable snobbish whiny young woman who turned my stomach early on in the book with her attempt at wit. I recently read The School of Essential Ingredients, which is a lovely book about cooking and the magic of a well made meal. I thought this book would have the same charm, but it did not. The only palatable parts of the book are about Julia.

That is the lesson I got from reading Julia Child's autobiography. Julia identified an issue in her world and made a positive effort to correct it and achieved a great deal of personal success in doing so.Cooking complicated food in a great rush inside a filthy kitchen with no knowledge of cooking is not something that I want to read about.YUK!!"},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"This book has travelled with me from Arizona to PA, to TX, to NOLA, to PA, to NOLA, to GA, to PA, back to GA and finally back to PA again.... I have been \\"in the middle\\" of this book for almost two years. It is one of those books that never really grabs you. Some books grab you and pull you in and you can't put the book down, however, I put this book down many timees.Julie & Julia is a very boring and unintelligible memoir to Julia Child (maybe) but more so a self-involved journaling/rambling of a person battling depression, cooking obsession and the beating of the \\"biological clock.\\" Her half-a**ed attempts at recreating Julia Child's recipes left me with a bad taste in my mouth.The author attempts to (and somewhat accomplishes) the re-creation of every recipe in Julia Childs renown cookbook (524 recipes) (Mastering the Art of French Cooking) in one year. She cooks things such as brains, liver, kidneys, marrow. The only humorous memory was that her Mother always said that kidneys always \\"tasted like piss.\\" however some that the author cooked did not taste like piss, however her \\"piss smelled like kidneys.\\" That was such a crude remark (and I am no priss mind you) I could not help but laugh.The author wrote a blog and this book really made small mention of her blog, small mention of other characters. The only characters truly developed in this book is the author and her husband Eric. But even his character is truly never examined, just from the author's perspective minimally. This book was albout the author. My final impression of the book was that the author wants/wanted to have a baby, had to do something to occupy her mind besides thinking about having a baby or not being able to have a baby and the personal neglect in her kitchen can't help but be seen as depression.I'm sorry but little flies flying around the author's kitchen constantly and finally towards the end of the book they discover maggots under their dish drying tray. They were very neglectful of the dishes, left them piled in the sink frequently and I'm sorry but this book was extremely bad and further, I could not imagine eathing ANYTHING from this author's kitchen knowing the lack of care taken to have a clean kitchen. She put forth about as much energy in writing a book."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life. To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close. The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write! Forget the food, it's just not you. Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ... Living","review":"What a great idea for a book and kudos to the author for coming up with the concept of cooking all of Julia Child's recipes in one year from Julia's first cookbook and for managing it.That aside, the author (Julie Powell) comes across as a smug, complaining, selfish, mean spirited & condescending woman. The way she is so mean in how she talks about her co-workers and complains ceaselessly about her job, you just wish she'd quit (both the job and complaining).And although I tend to be more liberal in my politics, even I had to wince at the amount of vitriol she spouted towards her co-workers who were Republicans and the President at the time (it takes place about a year after 9/11). People like this give liberals a bad name by being so hate filled, intolerant & downright nasty. She even managed to come across as insensitive & condescending to the 9/11 victims the agency she was temping for was supposed to be helping.As a foodie, I was quite turned off by all the times she described cat hair everywhere in her kitchen and went on about her lack of good housekeeping like it was a badge of honor. Be warned, there is a scene in the book where her kitchen ends up filled with flies and maggots again because of her admitted poor house keeping. Mmmm...doesn't it make you want to go to her house for dinner. Oh well, at least it got her out of her temp job and now it got her a movie deal, so I hope she is at least happier. Maybe that will make her next work more palatable, but I doubt I'd brave it."},{"Title":"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her ...

Unfortunately, I've made it to about page 65 and will not be reading one more word. I have no idea where Julie Powell is going with this story, but so far, it's been a rambling mess. Her writing style is all over the place, and not in any sort of charming or appealing way. The story of Julie's life is interspersed with what I think are diary entries by Julia Child, but honestly, I'm not 100% sure if that is the case. It is not clear who is writing these other entries. Julie Powell is not a likable character. She complains, is mean to her husband, dirty and overall not inspiring in any way. Do yourself a favor and do not read this complete mess of a book. It will frustrate and depress you! I hope the movie is better. Great idea, horrible execution.

I almost did this while reading on BART, people thought I was crazy (because of my loud chuckle, not my wet pants), but I didn't care, this book was worth it.

Juila Child's life in France is next because I don't want to stop reading about the adventures of cooking French food even if it makes my stomach growl with excitement.

Living","review":"This book has one redeeming feature -- it may lead people to read My Life in France, by Julia Child (and her husband Paul's nephew, Alex Prud'Homme). That is a magnificent book about a very unique person who lived a wonderful, very unusual life. Unless you want to read for yourself how deeply unlovely the real Julie Powell is, skip Julie & Julia and treat yourself at once to the grit and charm of the creative, fun, funny and unflappable Julia Child of My Life in France.Nora Ephron made a movie based on both books. The near-universal take on the movie is that the parts featuring Julia Child were divine (Meryl Streep is a wonder in it) and the parts featuring Julie Powell were highly irritating. That pretty well sums up the difference between the two books, as well.I don't enjoy cooking, but love Julia Child, and would have found it very interesting to hear detailed descriptions of someone attempting her recipes. Oddly, Powell gives only the most cursory descriptions of her endeavors, and reuses the same ones repeatedly (I'm guessing she had a macro on her computer for \\"cooked it down with some butter and vermouth\\"). Recipes that would be hard for the average person (I know how to cook, I just don't enjoy it) often get dismissed with the remark \\"that was too easy to talk about.\\" That doesn't ring true, and is ridiculous -- the reader is holding the book precisely because they WANT to hear about it! At first I was quite puzzled by this apparent contradiction. But not that far in, Powell reveals her true purpose in creating \\"the project\\" -- her wild enthusiasm over her blog hits reveals her ambition that her idea might just garner her her fifteen minutes. Once you understand the real purpose of the book, it all makes so much more sense. (Powell has been quoted as saying \\"I think I'm going to get out of the memoir-ing game for a little bit. Two memoirs before the age of 40 is plenty.\\" I think her use of the word \\"game\\" is no accident. And while we are discussing games: in my opinion, the maggots were ill-advised fiction.) I came across several reviews suggesting that perhaps Powell did not actually do all that much cooking. That strikes me as a reasonable explanation of why the book lacks focus on and has very little writing about its supposed subject.Now good books can wander far afield and still be wonderful. This one is not. Powell is that most unfunny of writers, one who is deeply convinced she is hilarious. Similarly, she describes herself as crazy, zany, insane, etc. Once again, to insist you are is generally the surest way to demonstrate that you are not. Powell's writing is deeply tedious. Much has been made of all the cussing. I don't care about cussing one way or the other... to my way of thinking, \\"f***ing\\" is a fine adjective for everyday use in one's own brain. But in a book, it's just non-descriptive non-writing, and quickly boring. Cussing is like salt -- it's just one of many seasonings, it cannot be the sauce. Her editor would have done well to present Powell with a dictionary and a thesaurus (or just tell her about Google). (I guess someone edited this, although it is clear that the marketing department had the most influence over this attempt.)I found all the blah blah on her friends' sex lives, her sex life, her body odor and her gynecological syndrome strangely out of place. Powell seems not to grasp that intimate details about a person who is inherently unlikeable, compounded by self-admitted bad hygiene, aren't sexy or intriguing, they're just stomach-turning. What I found outrageous and unforgivable was her revealing to the world that her father had an affair and cheated on her mother when Powell was a child. She even supplies her maiden name, just in case there was any question as to her father's identity. This is so completely irrelevant to the alleged plot (cooking) and the actual plot (ambition) that it stands out as the single-most unflattering thing Powell reveals about herself (and that is really saying something considering the extremely unlovely self-portrait she creates). Why? What is the point of this revelation? In the Acknowledgments, Powell thanks her parents. I'm guessing the feeling is not mutual on this count. Marital infidelity is a terrible, terrible thing. What is Powell's purpose in revealing publicly that wound, especially since her parents apparently worked it out and are still together? Was she trying to excuse her own infidelities, shortly to be revealed in her next book, on the theory that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree? Was she trying to humiliate her mother? Excoriate her father? Confirm our impression that Powell is a toxic person, best avoided?Powell's way of discussing the families of victims of September 11 is also very disturbing. Grief does strange things to people (as does the quest for fame) but the snide, mean and completely unsympathetic way she talks about some of the (admittedly less-then-felicitous) suggestions for a memorial that come from some of the families have the same effect as so much of her writing on the other irrelevant subjects in this book. It doesn't entertain, it isn't thought-provoking, it isn't clever. Powell's rants simply cement the reader's feeling that Powell is (or at least presents herself to be) a person one should aspire to be very, greatly, hugely, UNlike.If you want to learn about Julia Child and read a really good book, take yourself to the library and check out My Life in France. If you want to see a very entertaining movie, watch Julie & Julia (and be assured that the ordering of those two names is on the save-the-best-for-last system!). Nora Ephron very wisely watered down Powell as she describes herself, and even the Julie parts of the movie are watchable (hint: prepare yourself for a lot of whining). But I won't be surprised if you do what I did... right after watching the movie all the way through once, I watched it a second time, fast-forwarding through all the non-Julia parts. Fabulous!To waste time is to waste life (Ben Franklin). I say -- don't waste any of your one and only life reading Powell's quest for fame."},{"Title":"Understanding and Painting Abstract Art: Semi-Abstract and Non-Objective (Volume 71)","review":"I admit to a special fondness for Walter Foster's old publications. This book, as yellowed as the pages may be, is fun. If, like me you have done rigorous training in formal drawing and painting and mastered the principles and are very happy about having done the discipline but now want to break out, this is a really helpful book. It features several styles of work and most importantly how the artists arrived at their processes. It will loosen your artistic process right up.

Depressed, because I'll never have a chance to browse their musty aisles crowded with books. Exhilarated, because this volume successfully captures the thrill of browsing that I've experienced at the Strand bookstore (the sole Book Row survivor) and a few other stores. It's too bad the mindset of our culture has shifted to one in which an intelligent pleasure like browsing for good, cheap used books--in person, in a physical store--has been marginalized. Yes, Web bookbuying has its advantages, but still...I feel something precious has been lost."},{"Title":"Book Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade","review":"It is refreshing to read books written by bibliophiles who express a true appreciation for fine books. They are true literary aesthetes. I've never known scholars or even poets to express such a love of books. Reading &quot;Book Row&quot; has inspired me to acquire more of the classics in fine editions. I think the authors were a little too dismissive of the Internet which has been a tremendous help to me in finding rare books. I no longer have to settle for what I find on the shelves in bookstores with bad taste in books. I can always find exactly what I want to read. The Internet is the greatest bookman there ever was!"},{"Title":"Book Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade","review":"I have to admit I'm divided on this book. As a 4-5 block slice of New York City history, it's thoroughly researched and reported and many times engaging, with some real characters from a decidedly off-center cache. And as an insider's look at a burgeoning book trade with more book shelves per square block than we're ever likely to see again (sadly), I found it in turn wistfully nostalgic in both the descriptions of dead booksellers and quotes from the ones still alive, and elegiac in its ruminations on the sad state of our post-Book Row culture.The problem is, each of the things I liked about it work against it as well. Its narrow scope is problematic, at least within the framework Meador and Mondlin use, with many of the chapters seeming a lot like the ones before them with the names changed and a lot of factual repetition. And the nostalgia can get a little overbearing, with a pretty strong Neo-Luddite bias toward internet book dealers (\\"Those who had the books and the know-how might buy and sell books on the Net, but we'd like to hear Peter Stammer's, Sam Dauber's, and Jack Biblo's views of them as secondhand book dealers\\"). You could also say that as estate book buyer for the Strand Meador's neutrality might come into question, and you wouldn't be disproved with chapter titles like \\"The Strand Lives On\\" and almost a third of the glossy pictures devoted to the Bass family that runs the Strand.In sum I'd say this is a book for book-industry specialists (especially the older ones who might recognize more of the names the authors drop without much historical grounding) and book buffs with enough interest to sift through 400 pages that could have easily been 200. I fall more into the latter than the former, but even then would recommend Chapters One, Two, Five, Nine, Eleven, Fourteen, Fifteen, the Appendix (a cool little pre-Book Row history of books in NYC), and the foreword by legendary book collector Madeleine B. Stern."},{"Title":"Book Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade","review":"This is a wonderful attempt to look at the century and a quarter of the world of Books,Bookstores,Booksellers,Book Buyers,Rare Book Collectors,Just Plain Avid Readers,The Normal as well as the Eccentric;but all Bibliophiles in one form or another; and what took place in Book Row of New York.What an amazing world it was, and a world that we are not likely to see again. While a street or section occupied by bookstores is not unique to New York,this was one of the most famous in the world. There still places where there are collections of bookstores,even some \\"Book Villages\\" that have a nostalgic ring to what Boor Row was,;but Book Row ,and all involved, was the real thing.Most of what is talked about in this book went on long before my time as an avid reader,but I can still appreciate what a thrill it must have been to be a regular visitor to this place.I think that the real value in reading this book is to see how greatly the whole experience of buying and selling of books,be they new,used,rare,expensive,cheap,or whatever;has changed so much and so quickly.About 25 or so years ago,when I seriously searched out books for my collection ,I visited literally hundreds of bookstores,particularly the Used & Rare ,and encountered a wide array of stores and sellers,and what a thrill to find a store that I had never been in;and find a new \\"treasure\\".Even when not finding anything,the bookseller and the store was still an experience.However;what I used to call \\"going book sailing\\" is nothing what it used to be and many of the stores I used to haunt are \\"gone with the wind\\".I guess for the same reasons as with Book Row. The rents kept rising,buildings were demolished for highrises and condos,the Booksellers became old and didn't change with the rapidly changing world of books,the newer sellers who entered the trade have become a totally different breed,the Internet has changed everything and made an unbelievably amount of books and information about books available to any Book Lover,regardless of where he lives or what means are at his disposal.So,one by one the conventional bookstores have just withered and faded away.The price of gas has also made it expensive to run around the country to various bookstores.The publishers are still churning out massive numbers of new titles ,reissues and books at such a rate that there are books everywhere,and at prices that vary all over the map;both for new and used books. For instance,many charities and university alumni groups have seen where they can obtain unlimited amounts of donations of books of every type and along with them lots of volunteers to sort,price and sell them to raise funds.These sales attract huge crowds,who make excellent finds. The curious thing is that a lot of the small time dealers are there scooping up books to sell on the Internet,at obviously much higher prices,and have become the buyers competitor rather than friend.In this book, the authors allude to the fact that many of the booksellers couldn't or wouldn't change and learn to buy and sell ,or otherwise,merchandise their books to retain their customers. The charities and others,changed the whole game,and greatly to the benefit of the buyers.If that wasn't a great enough deathnell;the Internet makes virtually any book one wants ,readily available at whatever,cost,rarity ,condition,etc. the buyer desires.No longer is it a matter of 'take what I got, at my price,or Good Luck\\".So,this book sure shows what the book world used to be;and what a wonderful world it was;but all that is a thing of the past.Of all the great quotes you'll find in this book,and there are many;I think the quote that is most apropos is by someone who is not even a bookseller,book buyer or any kind of a Bibliophile ,and is found on page 365.\\"Considering the long-ago past and eras that are gone with the wind on wings of time will seem a waste to those who dismiss ancient history as \\"weary,stale,flat and unprofitable.\\" Baseball manager Sparky Anderson pointed out the futility of living in the past: \\"There's no future in it.\\" A New York book dealer,quoted by the \\"New York Times\\" (May 31,1981),...and that was over 25 years ago...doubted the existence of serious interest among contemporary booksellers in the vanished shops of Fourth Avenue,which were no longer revalent to the needs and problems of modern bookstores: Those who remember them don't want to be reminded,and those who don't,won't care.It's like talking about a five-cent sandwich.No one knows what you are talking about.\\"Bibliophiles should give a big clap and thanks,to Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador for bringing Book Row to those who have to be resolved with,\\"oh well,it was before my time,and so was the 25-cent bleacher seat and the 5-cent soda\\"."},{"Title":"Book Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade","review":"In the last couple of decades of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th century, New York City was home to a series of legendary booksellers who did business on and around Fourth Street south of Fourteenth Street. It came to be called &quot;Book Row&quot; by dedicated bibliophiles and had its own very distinctive culture, aromas, and for the true book lover, an excitement that could not be duplicated in the same quantity, quality, or diversity in any other American city of the time. In Book Row: An Anecdotal And Pictorial History Of The Antiquarian Book Trade, authors Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador have collaborated to provide a definitive and enthusiastically recommended history of the times and personalities that made Book Row the Mecca for book collectors in search of antiquarian treasures, as well as budget bookaholics looking for something interesting to read."},{"Title":"Book Row: An Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade","review":"This book was a dull disappointment because the authors (one of whom is a book buyer for the landmark Strand Bookstore) are very poor historians. I had hopes of Book Row providing a glimpse into the past of the Manhattan neighborhood in which I live and a window into long-gone independently owned bookstores. It was instead a flood of trivial names and dates that provided very little context or description, and consequently very little to fuel understanding or the imagination.The book is mostly an endless series of abstract, biographical sketches of the booksellers--mainly names and dates with a light peppering of anecdotes that are at most mildly amusing. The authors show no insight or analysis of what made these individuals become proprietors of bookstores and personal bookbuyers for wealthy collectors (who are also inadequately described). It is possible that evidence of only these factual bare bones have survived, but it is then the task of the historian to flesh these out with a picture of the time and place to which these facts belong. Book Row fails to do this because the authors are too content with name-dropping: a particular noted actor shopped at a certain store, a wealthy collector (of whom nothing further is said) praised a bookbuyer as the best. Lists of names are frequently given when they provide absolutely no informational or narrative value.This is a book about independent Manhattan bookstore owners in the early 20th century that fails to reveal anything concrete about what it meant to own a store at that time, or what the character of the neighborhood or its residents were. The reader gets the exact price of how much a particular rare volume procured at auction, but not a picture of where these auctions took place or how they proceeded, or a perspective on how important individual books or book collections were to these auctions. Similarly, the authors often provide street addresses of stores, yet fail to describe the buildings themselves. Missing are such basic facts such as whether a bookstore at a given time was likely to have had modern electric lighting or gas light, or even who owned the building or what the rent was likely to have been. All of these flaws, of style as well as research, made reading Book Row rarely more educational or entertaining than browsing the \\"Bookstores-Used\\" section of an old yellow pages."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Unlike Jack Ketchum's earlier novel, LADIES NIGHT, his newest one, RIGHT TO LIFE, definitely has the shoe on the other foot as a pregnant woman becomes the victim of a deranged married couple that kidnap her right off the street and hold her captive for several months while she's forced to endure their bizarre S&M; games.The 139-page novella starts off with Sara Foster on her way to an abortion clinic to do away with the unwanted child she's now carrying. Before Sara can even enter the clinic, she's grabbed and sedated by Stephen and Katherine Teach-a couple who's unable to have children. Sara is taken to their home where she's held as a prisoner. The couple intend to hold Sara until the baby is born and then kill her.Stephen, however, has other plans for his beautiful captive as well. He's going to get the most out Sara's luscious body by using her to fulfill his own perverted desires. Forcing her to submit in whatever sexual manner he chooses, she's mentally and physically tortured on a daily basis. Even Stephen's wife decides to get in on the action by making the prisoner her sex slave when the hubby begins to lose interest after a few months have past.Sara instinctively knows that she has to find a way out before it's too late, but time is her worse enemy as she grows bigger and more powerless with her pregnancy. She also understands that if she does manage to escape, the couple may very well come after her. This leaves her with just one option...to kill them first!RIGHT TO LIFE will shock you to the core as it depicts one's person's attempt to survive unimaginable torture and humiliation in order to keep from being killed. Mr. Ketchum never pulls his punches with the violence and craziness. His prose is fast moving and creates stark images that are mind numbing in their intensity. The reader is quickly carried into this dark world of depravity and made to realize that anyone can be a potential victim when least expected. The characters are well drawn, but it's the Techs that really steal the show. This is one psychotic couple you wouldn't want to have as next-door neighbors!All in all, RIGHT TO LIFE delivers in full form. Strong in sexual content, it's not for the faint-hearted or those with a queasy stomach. One final note, this edition also contains two extra short stories. The first is \\"Brave Girl\\" and it deals with a four-year-old child whose mother has fallen in the bathtub and is now unconscious. The second short story is \\"Returns\\" which is slightly different from the author's normal subject matter. It centers on the spirit of a recently deceased man who returns home to his hateful wife, hoping to stop her from killing his loving cat. These two short stories are a nice bonus for the fans of Jack Ketchum."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Right To Life might very well be Jack Ketchum's most striking, affecting and brilliant story since The Girl Next Door. Once more, he comes at us full force to have us face the most terrifying and most disturbing nightmare of all: Death.A woman considering having an abortion is kidnapped by a couple who desires a child. They will keep her prisoner for the full term of her pregnancy in the hopes of keeping the child for themselves once it comes. They will torture her and torment her for their own pleasure as they await the child's arrival.Dark, disturbing and terrifyingly realistic, Right To Life is a novella only the twisted mind of Jack Ketchum could conceive. Ketchum's strength lies in presenting his readers with realistic horror. His stories rarely rely on the paranormal, opting instead to investigate the demons that can plague one's mind. And this book isn't an exception to the rule.Right To Life is a psychological tour the force that will leave you breathless. It's the kind of book which you will forever remember, which will haunt you long after you have finished reading it. This is Ketchum at his best and darkest."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"A woman is kidnapped in front of an abortion clinic by a desperate, psychotic couple so that she can bear a child for them. Feeding her unlikely stories of an organization that deals in human slaves, they lock her up in their basement and torment her for the remainder of her pregnancy.The plot is thin even for a 140-page novella. Beyond the initial abduction and imprisonment, the drama never escalates, and so it grows tiresome. The story might have actually been more interesting had it been expanded into a longer form, and shown us what is going on elsewhere as the woman's lover and family try to find her. But unfortunately the author doesn't concern himself with any of that.The story's other major flaw is how inept the villains are. At one point they go so far as to reveal their full names, in an attempt to set up a safety net that would never work. And though the wife is a nurse, she doesn't seem to be aware that what they're doing can very likely affect the health of the baby she wants so badly. Despite their actions, they just don't feel threatening, and the reader gets the impression that their captive could easily outwit them if she waits for the right moment. The abuses heaped upon the protagonist are so mundane that it doesn't even earn points in the extreme horror category.Also included in this edition are two short stories. \\"Brave Girl\\" follows the aftermath of a child's emergency call. \\"Returns\\" is a bittersweet tale of a ghost who has one final task to complete."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Review: \\"Right to Life\\"You ever feel dirty after reading a novel? Because that is exactly how Jack Ketchum's \\"Right to Life\\" novella will make you feel afterwards. Like Ketchum's \\"The Girl Next Door\\" (which was inspired by the tragic Indiana Torture Slaying), \\"Right to Life\\" is primarily based on the Cameron Hooker case. Read \\"Perfect Victim\\" for the full story, of Cameron and Janice Hooker, who held a young hitchhiker captive for 7 years. Ketchum tells the story of one, Sara Foster, who is currently in a relationship with a married man, Greg Clover. Several years ago, Sara lost her son to a tragic accident. By mistake, she is impregnated during the affair with Greg. If Greg's wife ever finds out about the affair, their life together would be over. He particularly doesn't wish her to know he got another woman, Sara, pregnant. As the story begins, Greg is driving Sara over to a Manhatten abortion clinic, where dozens and dozens of New Yorkers protest right to life. In the midst of the protesting, Sara is abducted by married Stephen, and Katherine Teach, who drug her and then whisk her away to their New Jersey residence. Sara awakens from her stupor in the Teach's basement/torture chamber. There, she is tortured physically, mentally and sexually by Stephen, who is an evil psychopath who uses a story to brainwash Sara into believing she is his and Katherine's slave, and her and her family will be killed if she ever disobeys. The Teach's plan is to keep her captive until she bears her child. Sooner or later, Stephen becomes less interested in his own wife than he does his \\"slave\\", who is repeatedly tortured throughout. It even seems like he'd rather have the slave than the baby. Lonely, Katherine even finds herself sexually attracted by Sara. Will Sara escape the Teach's?While readers are meant to believe Ketchum's sole intention is to make a bold statement about the controversial abortion themes, the Right to Life issue is left in the wind as soon as Stephen's psychopathic colors show. This is when this disturbing, sadistic novella is told with a frightening immediacy. No matter what side of the abortion issue you are on, you really start to feel for Sara. Her helplessness and despair leaks onto the pages. She has no way of escaping the Teach's, and you really want to see her and her baby survive. Yet, as this novella begins to reach its conclusion, you never have an idea how it's going to end exactly, or what is going to happen to Sara, and if she is ever going to escape. This keeps you on edge, frantically turning the pages until you get to the end of it all.Rounding out this novella are two of Ketchum's short stories, \\"Brave Girl\\" and \\"Returns\\". Both stories are so far on the other side of the spectrum of the title story, it is actually refreshing to see a change of pace. If the former had a tighter ending, it'd have been really memorable due to how well-told of a short it is. \\"Returns\\" is light in its tone, and while it isn't exactly my cup of tea, it's pretty much a harmless, neat ghost story. These short stories, in a way, are like appetizers to a main course (although they are featured at the end of the volume). And that main course, \\"Right to Life\\" is a difficult one to digest."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Jack Ketchum delivers another discomforting look at the dark side of human nature. A bizarre, sadistic couple of right-to-lifers kidnap a pregnant woman in front of an abortion clinic, hold her captive and engage in various forms of physical, psychological and sexual torture. I don't know why, but I couldn't put it down. Very graphic and descriptive as Ketchum tends to be. Not for the faint-hearted."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Because the book is way more distturbing than that! This book scaredthe hell out of me in part because it was based on a true story, I will say this-if you're a cat lover, as Mr, K obviously is, have LOTS of kleenex ready for one of the short stories towards the end. AND for at least one scene in the title novella.Not for the easily upset, squeamish, or offended."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"This is my second Jack book. I read the Girl Next Door because books like this interest me and I feel, because I'm naturally good hearted, complete me. However, there were issues.1. J.K...who edited this book! This book is full of stupid typos the author should have caught. I usually put down a book after 10, give or take, but I kept reading this one because the woman had my sympathy. Misspelled words, run-on sentences, missing quotations marks, half of a repeat sentence...Was there an editor at all?2. The plot goes stale after chapter seven, is sometimes unbelievable because why isn't no one looking for a pregnant women abducted in broad daylight, and the ending leaves you confused, like was she dreaming, or what?3. The charaterization of the antagonist is, well, more horrible than the horror.I liked the theme that was played with here."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"The names are changed, but the story is nearly the exact same, only in Perfect Victim, it's a true story, and in Right to Life, Ketchum made it all up.**Here is the description for Perfect Victim:Hitchhiking from Eugene, Ore., through northern California in 1977, 20-year-old Colleen Stan thumbed a ride into hell. Her kidnappers, a sadistic lumber mill worker, Cameron Hooker, and his battered wife Janice, subjected her to seven years of torture and sensory deprivation. She was made a sex slave, kept locked in a wooden box and brainwashed into believing that an underground network of sadists would recapture her if she attempted to escape....this harrowing tale shuttles between the courtroom and the grisly doings in the Hookers' basement.**Here is the description for Right to Life....I made the changes all caps:SET TO ENTER AN ABORTION CLINIC IN NYC, in 1998, 40 YEAR OLD SARA FOSTER STEPPED INTO a ride into hell. Her kidnappers, a sadistic lumber mill worker, STEPHEN TEACH, and his battered wife KATH, subjected her to 7 MONTHS of torture and sensory deprivation. She was made a sex slave, kept locked in a wooden box and brainwashed into believing that an underground network of sadists would recapture her if she attempted to escape....this harrowing tale DEPICTS the grisly doings in the TEACHS' basement.Ketchum's got cojones, though, because it's very nearly a straight play*-jar*-eyezed (mispelled and split up because apparently it's a naughty no-no word in Amazon reviews) work, including the methods that the perpetrator (whackjob) uses to brainwash his victim AND the name of the fake underground network - The Organization.And like any Ketchum novel(la) you get two, two, two mints in one. Well, three, actually. There's the main story, and two short stories that have nothing whatsoever to do with the main story, and all of this rolled into 158 very short pages that were totally not worth nearly $12."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"I enjoy horror fiction. I thoroughly enjoy reading about instances that are either so supernatural that they're brilliant or so haunting, because they could really happen. Kidnapping a pregnant woman about to have an abortion and torturing her is just a heinous act of ill judgment that this is a subject that should just be off limits unless portrayed in a way that could work. This doesn't.As I mentioned, the novella is about a woman who is about to have an abortion at the abortion clinic. It's common to see pro-lifers protesting, but a couple take it to the next level. They kidnap her, blindfold her, and strap her in a coffin-like box where she is forced to stay. Their goal is to keep her imprisoned until she delivers the baby.This is just so disgusting that it isn't horror fiction disgusting. There are plenty of things covered in fiction, but this is just too, too much. I do believe in the work of Jack Ketchum and its strength, but this one just isn't up there. Avoid this, as well as the Leisure fiction pairing with \\"Old Flames.\\""},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"there is a novella based on a true story that is horrific, but the true crime has no happy ending, why the writer melowed it down is beyond me. so the novella aint that good.two bonus stories are excellent as most of mr. ketchums stories.the book is only over 100 pages, not worth the money"},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Sara Foster finds herself in a situation she had never thought she would be in again, one in which she feels that her body and her emotions have betrayed her and have allowed her to love once more. Its a sad thing, too, because Greg's a married man and happy with his family, a good man that also loves her but that can't leave them, and because she's pregnant with his child. Because of tragedy in the past this is further complicated, to the point that having the baby doesn't seem like a viable option. Together they decide that aborting the child is better than the pain of not being able to be with one another, and Sara decides that, in order to get things over with, she'd have Greg drop her off and park his car. Enter Stephen and Katherine Teach, one with the inability to have children and the other with plans that feed his sadistic desires, as they take their station wagon and snatch Sara off the streets in broad daylight, leading toward a life that has, until now, been nothing more than a news article read in passing.Although this is only a novella in length, I found myself happy with the way that Ketchum balanced the act of positioning the character and storytelling, letting the days bleed by and the notions infect mindsets as one played into the other. He did this by keeping times and dates at first and by letting you know what was through the minds of both the victim and the victimizers, not to mention leaving no holds barred in the torment department. In many rights this made me feel for Sara, the woman that had been judged and yet wasn't known to the captors that kept her locked inside those devices, as the story played out and the travesties became more familiar to the person they had attempted to break.Also accompanying this are two really short stories, one which I liked and the other that I didn't, called Brave Girl and Returns. In Brave Girl I saw an idea that I thought might be horrific in its own right, that might find a way to display something vile within its clutches, but that turned out to be something that I was relatively disappointed in. Perhaps it was because of the content of the book that caused it, that its message seemed out of place to me and tragic but not tragic enough, or that it simply wasn't that well orchestrated on its minute approach. Whatever the case, it wasn't a hit with me. Returns was better, however, making up for Brave Girl with a little breath of oddity in its own right, finishing off the book with a brisk jog through the lives of the dead and the reasons they carry back into life. I still don't judge these as anything other than accompanying material, however, and see them as nice gifts set as ornamentation for a novella I liked.For anyone that enjoys Ketchum's works, I think this is a pretty nice piece to have around. It isn't as detailed as some of the longer works as far as setting is concerned, but this instance doesn't demand setting changes so familiarity allows a little less. He still has all the time to delve into the torments of the captive, the mindset painted in the expressions of the tormentors, and how things can sometimes become a little graphic as the horrific is fleshed out. It is a quick read, but a good one nonetheless."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"Right to Life is not as good as The Girl Next Door, but it's a lot better than Flame Finders which is the new novella that it's packaged with. The only negative point to this novel is that it didn't really explore the craziness of some Pro-lifers. Actually this book isn't really about the abortion debate at all. It's just your standard abduction and torture novel where the victim just happens to be pregnant.What is done well is the revenge or escape tactic employed by the victim. Ketchums novels are notoriously known for having ending where the bad guys finishes first. This one is a rare exception."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"While there's nothing supernatural in Jack Ketchum's terrifying thriller, Right To Life, the monster in this tale - like most of his work - is all too real, taken right from the headlines of today's news. At first, I was hooked on the mystery of why this innocent woman was kidnapped and wanted to know more about her kidnappers and their motives. However, the reasoning behind their actions didn't seem as effective as it could have been. Maybe that was an easier way out instead of writing about someone doing this because of their belief in saving a precious life, doing anything they can to protect the baby that grows inside of our main character. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read and one of Ketchum's stronger works, along with The Off Season, Offspring, Old Flames, and The Girl Next Door - my favorite of his books."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"I have never read anything by Jack Ketchum this was my first book by him and i loved it.

Unrealistic because of the details and how they are presented, but it's main crime could happen!"},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"I just finished reading this novella, and it's the second of Ketchum's books that I have read. Let me begin by saying that I did NOT want to read this book. As a new mother, I felt that it would just be too graphic and too horrifying, yet after reading about 1/3 of it, I began to realize that Ketchum led me gently and concerned into this novella.Sara Foster is a very realistic picture of a sad woman who somewhat fell into an affair with a married man, and an abortion becomes her decision. When she is kidnapped by the psychotic couple, her external and internal struggles are so well-written without extremely gory or unrealistic details. This keeps the reader from suspension of disbelief, which strengthens the connection to Sara. I know a reviewer commented on the somewhat unbelievable circumstances of her treatment since the woman who holds Sara is a nurse, but if you have read Peaceable Kingdom, this woman isn't exactly a well-qualified nurse for anyone.If Right to Life made me appreciate Jack Ketchum, Brave Girl made me appreciate a child. This story and its sudden twist showed me an old gruesome difference between a young child and an adult, and I am sure nearly every reader of it would say the same."},{"Title":"Right to Life: And 2 New Stories","review":"This was over the top. I don't get the point. It starts off right away with totally unbelievable stuff happening to this woman and gets more and more rediculous. It's so unbelievable, I don't know why he even bothered to write a story around the awful things that happen to her. Why not just write down whatever twisted, demented thing you've ever wanted to do to a woman, and print it? There's no point to this story at all. Don't waste your time or money. I was disappointed and embarrassed. I took it off my coffee table when people came over. Not his finest work by a long shot."},{"Title":"It Isn't Easy Being Johnny Style","review":"Life in Chicago has not been easy for Johnny Style, but he has always made the best of it even growing up with a drunk of a father. The Mayor, whichever Daley or crony is in charge, should have declared the Style family as a disaster area as Johnny's school days were filled with punks, young hoods, and wannabe wise guys such as Santana Santiago a high school drug dealer. Thus Johnny knows the lowlifes including his family who fail to reach the bottom rung of the social food chain. Perhaps that is why Johnny is a cynic expecting the worst from everyone.Johnny has always bent and broke rules so he applies his best skill at a profession that makes great use of breaking and entering; he becomes a private sleuth. Though he knows death first hand, Johnny feels helpless when he watches his only real pal Jimmy die. Jimmy's death sends Johnny seeking revenge against his high school archenemy Santiago, who has turned into an adult drug dealing punk. To Santiago, the game of vengeance started with Anita Nicole Anders.This gritty urban noir stars a very pessimistic (that's being optimistic) individual whom readers will not like due to his gloomy persona. Johnny Style is as negative of a lead character as one might find in a novel. The talent of Patrick K. Jassoy is that this powerful story line amidst the mean streets that Bueller would avoid catches the attention of the audience from the start and never lets go until the final confrontation. It is easy to appreciate the author even though it isn't easy to root for anyone.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"It Isn't Easy Being Johnny Style","review":"Every High School has a bully--at least one that makes life hard on everyone else while the teaching staff never notices a thing. Often it is High School where the deviant mind first shows up and begins to explore the nature of evil and its seductive power. Unchecked then, it isn't surprising when that same deviant mind makes the papers years later as a result of criminal activity often horrific and appalling.In the here and now, Johnny Style is a private detective, lonely and broke on New Year's Eve. When turned down by the right lady for the right now, Style begins to head back to his office for no real reason other than he has nothing else to do. After a couple of encounters with various people along the way, he finds an old friend by the name of Jimmy C. on the stoop in front of his office building. Jimmy C. has been savagely beaten with his lips sewed shut and is very near death. Style manages to cut his lips apart and Jimmy C. tells him that Santana Santiago did it over a drug debt before passing away in his arms.This isn't the first time Santiago has killed someone close to Style. Johnny Style and Santana Santiago have clashed since High School when Style, new to the area and the school, inadvertently got into Santiago's way. When Style began dating Anita, Santiago's girlfriend, it made things personal and something never man has ever gotten over. What should have been over by graduation instead has turned into a sort of blood feud with Santiago taking his growing rage and need for vengeance out on Style's friends. Style hasn't been able to stop him and finally, Santiago seems ready to finish the game, once and for all.Written in the stylistic style of the old pulp fiction novels, this 165-page read was very fast and very good. While I, as a reader, am not a fan of the use of flashbacks, the nearly 100 page continuous flashback in this novel works and works well. By doing so and in such great detail, the author not only provides a foundation for this book as to how it all began for Style but for the planned series as a whole.With such a cast of unique characters as well as a strong, complex protagonist, this book is well worth reading. Assuming the author lives up to the potential and unique style of his voice, this should be the start of a very enjoyable series.Kevin R.

Instead it developed a growing sense of sheer relief that never again would one have to try, and usually fail, to contain those towering rages of sheer frustration and the resulting bad manners that the Russia of this trip and time created in this visitor.Now mostly passed and gone, like one of Newby's Siberian stations with the attendant Station Mistress overseeing departures at the full attention, that Russia was as full of obstructions and stupidities as this book is full of interesting facts, apt and forbidden photographs and sparkling descriptions.

I have, however, read her first two manga from the Japanese version (Hyakuman Tsubu no Namida, \\"One Million Tear Drops\\" and Sorayume no Uta, \\"The Song of Dreams\\"), and can tell you that they are wonderful peices of art.The stories are supernatural and touching -- one dealing with the line between man and machine, and innocent desires; the other dealing with the bitterness that causes people to kill, and the price of immortality. In both manga, there are cute, sweet scenes of happiness, and then a dive into the darker plot. Violence is used sparingly, but well. Altogether, Yuana Kazumi's first two manga are serious, character-driven shoujo with endings that will leave you stunned.From what I have seen of the Flower of Deep Sleep, I suspect it will contain the same supernatural element, passionate characters, and stunning ending. I strongly urge everyone to give this series a try. It is the only one of Yuana Kazumi's manga licensed in the United States (as I write this).Yuana Kazumi's 4th, and current manga, that she's working on is called HaruHana, and actually appears to be a relatively \\"normal\\" shoujo romance.

Never dry, this book is lively, vividly evoking images of the subjects described. Though research into ancient Egypt in the decades since this book was originally written has made many important discoveries, the essential value of this book, its capability to enlighten the reader on one of the great cultures of human civilization, has not diminished.As a writer, Breasted might have excelled at almost any genre of literature he might have selected. His work as a serious historian allowed him to use his skill as a writer to make otherwise perhaps esoteric material available to a broad range of readers, asking not much more from the reader than the capability to simply enjoy a good book."},{"Title":"A history of Egypt from the earliest times to the Persian conquest,","review":"While his translations are slightly dated because of new linguistic discoveries, there is still no other work that can compare to James Breasted's monumental &quot;History of Ancient Egypt.&quot; It is an indispensable work for novice and expert alike.

Almost a hundred years old, this book still reads surprisingly easily. Whether it's out of date or not, I'm in no position to judge, not being an expert in this field. But I'd assume that a lot of archaeological discoveries must have been made in the last century to make this book somewhat obsolete.Breasted was the first and foremost American Egyptologist, the founder of the prestigious Oriental Institute of Chicago (the premier archaeology academy in America - featured in Indiana Jones), and the first archaeologist elected to the National Academy of Sciences.(He was also a former President of the American Historical Association, and must have been the only person to have both honors.) I particularly like his opinions of Thuthmosis III, whose 3450th passing is today.Two other books that may shed some light on the recent findings are &quot;Egypt of the Pharaohs&quot; by Sir Alan Gardiner and &quot;The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt&quot; edited by Ian Shaw."},{"Title":"A history of Egypt from the earliest times to the Persian conquest,","review":"Back when I first read Breasted's history it was already 60 years old. I was 14 and much enamored of this ancient culture that I knew mostly from horror movies and eerie museum displays. Cruising the library shelves I found this ponderous volume and dived into it. Starting a lifelong habit of always picking the heaviest book. Of course, the book was out of date then, and today it is more a document of the turn of the century mythology about ancient Egypt than it is anything that qualifies as 'history.'And yet, in many ways it entirely changed the world of a fourteen year old child - whose horizons were suddenly broadened in a multitude of directions. Breasted bridges the gap between tedious academic history and popular and simpleminded glosses. He is always conscious that the facts he narrates are a telescopic look into a culture almost completely alien from what we are today. His simple, direct style has brought the old world alive for the curious for almost a century now.If his thinking seems a bit nave now, it is important to understand that there has been a wealth of discovery in the intervening years. And this book was one of the inspirations that fueled that pursuit of knowledge, drawing people's attention to the mysterious past, and inspiring countless readers to look further.

They represent a completely new translation (ab ovo) of all memorials, et al extant at the time of the original publication - 1909 - and are referred to throughout the main history.This history, though dated, is a much better read than the more recent and stuffy work by Grimal (a sure cure for insomnia).Breasted is able to switch from a wonderful flow of descriptive narrative when giving a synopsis of The Land to a more scholarly mode without dropping a beat.Don't buy this book for the illustrations - being an off-print, they've suffered in the process but there are better places to find these anyway.

There were a few cliques used, but overall it was well written and kept a good pace from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Capitol Punishment","review":"First I want to say that I really enjoy reading this and all the others on my Kindle.This is a story that keeps you in suspense as you travel with the characters throughout. It does start out a bit slow, but as you get into the story, it keeps you on your toes. I found myself getting antsy as the characters finally got to realize just what was really going on with the white leader as he used the black characters.All in all, I found this to be a worthwhile read, especially in this day and age."},{"Title":"Capitol Punishment","review":"Ryne Douglas Pearson creates a realistic and chilling band of domestic terrorists in this outing for his FBI agent hero Art Jefferson. He also gives them a plausible plan to wreak serious havoc on the U.S. government. Expect fast page turning and nail-biting suspense when you pick up, or download, this title. Jefferson's in a race against time to stop a plot that's almost impossible to detect. To say more would spoil the twists and surprises. If you enjoy action thrillers, you won't be disappointed here."},{"Title":"Capitol Punishment","review":"I thought this book was amazingly good. Pearson puts together a great story full of very strong characters in this book. It features Art Jefferson, a character whom Pearson reprises in the following Simple Simon (check it out, it too is a good read). This story kind of hits home with the theme of terrorism and scenarios of attacks on American soil. Very realistic story. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Capitol Punishment","review":"A study on hate and homegrown terrorism : white supremacists and African Liberation Front's are two sides of the same coin and are the protagonists of this thriller.The plot starts by a 911 call and the quick death of the first responders, followed by the discovery of the bodies of the chemist and his buyer of a nerve agent. Soon, FBI agents Art Jefferson and Frankie Aguirre realize that two more canisters of the gas were made and are somewhere in the hands of terrorists.The story follows the steps of the bad guys and the FBI agents who try to stop them. It is well done but not a really intricate plot. I found most of the characters unidimensional and the motives for their actions either not well explained or too simplistic.Still it is a very enjoyable book, a nice read, with an all too believable plot."},{"Title":"Capitol Punishment","review":"I read this book after reading a later one in the series - Simple Simon - so I went into it knowing the main character, and wanting to know more about him.

He is a well-known college coach and is well-respected.His &quot;Directionals&quot; system is original in how it is organized/structured. Teachers before him also taught directionals but didn't articulate it as well. His directionals is a form of high-percentage tennis. Some players are not mentally wired to perform directionals and will express confusion when confronting a player who violates directionals (what do you do?). Directionals also sometimes conflict with creativity (or genius, like McEnroe or Hingis) and automaticity (being in the zone). There are a few lesser tactical problems with the &quot;Directionals&quot;, e.g., situations where &quot;Directionals&quot; break down. &quot;Directionals&quot; do, however, help many players to understand &quot;high percentage&quot; tennis. &quot;Directionals&quot; also help players to anticipate based on geometry of the court and high-percentage play. It also allows coaches to present tactical ideas in an organized manner. There are many fine coaches who like &quot;Directionals&quot;. Most players should be exposed to the concept of directionals...but it is for them to conceptualize their own style and tactics. Still, it is a very fine, original (although hyper-organized?!) contribution to tennis theory. And, every good player usually incorporates a good portion of &quot;directionals&quot; (high-percentage tennis) in their game. A final plus is that there are a wealth of tactical drills many of which don't involve directionals. In fact, 2/3 of the book is based on tactical drills. Recommended for coaches and teaching pros. Recommended for those advanced players looking for systematic tactics or just simply for more drills. Not recommended for beginners and low intermediates (below 3.5 NTRP) since they won't be able to execute many of the tactics and drills."},{"Title":"Pressure Tennis","review":"This book is for anyone that wants to improve their play. It shows you how to pick appropiate shot selection so that every shot becomes automatic and you won't have to think about it.

With her clever character development and her the vivid and colourful language, depicting Ireland at its most rugged most mysterious, she carries us on a journey of romance, suspense, and danger. The story is consistent, the plot truly believable, and yet, the unravelling of the mystery, is a complete surprise, despite the clues she drops along the way. This is a finely written book, with a slight nod to Agatha Christie. Well done Joan!"},{"Title":"Here Among the Living","review":"I read a lot of romantic suspense books, and this is one of the best I've read in a long time. The author describes the people and places so vividly that I felt like I was there. The descriptions of Ireland really set the book apart.

Young and old minds alike are engaged with the Wunderkind elite, and other wonderfully wacky characters in magical Masonville, as Millicent's latest invention wreaks havoc and the amnesiac Felicity tries to find her way home. The author takes the reader on a precarious, often hilarious, non-stop journey through a place that is imaginatively wrought with old-fashioned sentiment and modern day diversity.

Close your eyes, spin around, and hurl the projectile any which way (making certain no one is standing around and that there isn't any delicate glass about). Now go see what book the stone hit. If you happened to be in the children's room, particularly in the fiction section, you probably had a pretty good chance of hitting something meaningful, depressing, or meaningful AND depressing. And let me tell you, there is no sure-fire method of turning a kid off of reading than making them read only books that fit into those two categories. As a children's librarian I've been reading a ton of children's books published in 2006 and I am SICK of books that aren't any fun. So when \\"The Misadventures of Millicent Madding\\" (adventure one = \\"Bully-Be-Gone\\") fell into my lap I didn't know what to think. The Amy Vangsgard cover art kind of turned me off. Clay is cool but not always appropriate for a fiction cover. Still, it sounded... fun. And I needed fun. I needed fun badly. So after reading this book cover to cover, I can say this of \\"Bully-Be-Gone\\". It is every bit as fun as the premise suggests and it is bound to be dearly beloved by scores of wide-eyed kidlets. All around amusing.If you are smart and attend school in some fashion, there is one fact of life you have to acknowledge. Bullies. They're everywhere. Well young Millicent Madding is smart, but she isn't resigned to a life of dodging this scourges of the public school hallways. She's just invented a whole new kind of face cream. It's called Bully-Be-Gone and it's supposed to affect your average bully's sense of smell, thereby repelling them. The problem is, Millicent's still new to this whole inventing game. She's had some bad luck in the past and her fellow members of The Wunderkind Club (a group of the smartest kids of Masonville) are wary of trusting this new invention. But try it they do and the results aren't exactly what Millicent thought they might be. Now Bully-Be-Gone is attracting love-struck bullies rather than repelling them and Millicent's in a fix. Add in her long-lost aunt trecking across the country in an ancient wedding gown, a tale of contortion and cooking, two parents lost in time, and an uncle who's hair color and hair style changes every day... well let's just say that the town of Masonville may never quite be the same again.Sometimes I can pinpoint a moment when a book has won me over. Often the book as a whole gains my love, but once in a great while there's a single defining turn of phrase or image. For me, a children's librarian, it was page 28. Sweet sweet page 28. On that page we meet the local town librarian, Miss Ogelvie. She simultaneously fulfills your normal librarian stereotypes (bespectacled, prudent, unmarried, etc.) and pounds them into dust. Consider this sentence: \\"Closer inspection revealed that Miss Ogelvie had, through years of lifing books, developed a rather intimidating frame. Her arms, especially, were thick and strong - a fact she played up by having had them tattooed with the faces of literary figures like Shakespeare and Toni Morrison\\". Any book that contains a character who has the author of \\"Beloved\\" imprinted in ink on their forearm has my instantaneous love.But heroic librarians aside (I haven't even mentioned the legend of Goody Constance Madding, which is faaaabulous) it's Tacang's writing here that sets the book apart from the pack. It balances the author's story with amusing details here and there. Tacang isn't going for deeply held emotional resonance, but he still manages to hit meaningful chords throughout his storyline. There could also have been a danger of going too wild with this book. Too wacky. The back cover promises scores of kooky crazy kids and adults with everything from human cannonballs to rebel librarians, and they're all here, true. But at the same time, this isn't another \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\" or \\"Pure Dead Magic\\". The wacked-out nuttiness is great, but the author never overplays his hand. It's a delicate balance all the more impressive when you consider how well it ties together.And by the way, the inventions in this book aren't your average half-hearted \\"Freddy and the French Fries\\" lame-o inventions. Every single one is an invention that should exist (with the possible exception of the gloves that clip your fingernails) and that anyone would love to own. I would like to personally suggest to the world that we take Tacang's suggestion of a carpet with Autosuck Technology and make it exist. It makes so much sense! \\"You simple flipped a switch and the carpet retracted dirt, in a sense. Dust, soil, and other small debris were sucked through the carpet and into a plastic bag\\". Honestly, why isn't this being installed in homes everywhere already? Hello, patent office...If I have any objection with this book, it concerns its ending. With all her friends hating her for their hard-to-shake new bully buddies, Millicent needs to find a cure, stop the bullies, and get on her uncle's good side by the story's end. She does so, but it's done in such a sudden madcap way that it feels to the viewer that they've suddenly run smack dab into the literary equivalent of a brick wall. A little more time spent on wrapping up stories (and not having her friends forgive her QUITE so suddenly) would have given \\"Millicent Madding\\" far more believable closure. Ah well. Can't have everything, I guess.Child inventors have been gracing the pages of children's books at least since Homer Price \\"fixed\\" that old donut machine in 1943. By and large, however, the inventors have been boys. Now Millicent Madding has come to kick butt and take names. Alongside another 2006 title, \\"Roxie and the Hooligans\\", by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, these two books look at bullies and find incredibly creative ways of dealing with them. Kids everywhere should approve. Enjoyable reading with more than its fair share of intelligence."},{"Title":"The Misadventures of Millicent Madding #1: Bully-Be-Gone","review":"This is an appealing story about 12-year-old Millicent Madding, who wants very much to be an inventor.

Now Millicent's parents have disappeared in their newly invented time machine, so she goes to live with her Uncle Phineas. At school Millicent belongs to a secret group of young inventors. Unfortunately, Millicent hasn't really invented anything the group is excited about.

(In this regard, he reminds one of Kierkegaard in the 19th century.) Anarchy and Christianity is one of his most penetrating criticisms of institutional Christianity. But like most of his theological works, it's not entirely (or even primarily) critical in tone. It also offers a vision of what Christian faith might be.Ellul argues that both the Hebrew and Christian scriptures are wary of political (worldly) authority. The transition from judges to kings in ancient Israel was viewed as a decline by Hebrew Bible authors, and Jesus' entire public ministry is a challenge to both political and religious authority. The subsequent institutionalization of the Church, and the transformation of the living presence of Christ into \\"religion,\\" break faith with the teachings and meaning of the Christ.Ellul intends his audience to be not just Christians, but also the anarchist community, which has generally been militantly anti-Christian. In one of the more interesting sections of his book, Ellul tries to demonstrate that in fact genuine Christianity (as opposed to the institutionalization of it that both he and atheistic anarchists dislike) is deeply anarchistic. Through a series of masterful scriptural interpretations (pp. 32-44), Ellul argues that God is not omnipotent, providence doesn't rule out human freedom, and God is a liberator. This re-envisioning of God, which Ellul argues is more loyal to the scriptural model than subsequent theological analyses, is instructive. Is rejection of the monarchical understanding of God anticipates much of what liberation theologians had to say.Also of interest is Ellul's exegesis of five texts from the Christian scriptures which he sees as central to the anarchic message of Christ (pp. 59-85), especially his reading of the Book of Revelation as an anti-governmental authority document (pp. 71-74). Much of what he has to say is reminiscent of the American Christian iconoclast William Stringfellow.An instructive, disturbing, but ultimately inspiring read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"In what might well be the last book he ever wrote,Jacques Ellul, the great French resistance fighter, politician, sociologist, political analyst, biblical scholar, radical Christian, has summed up his life and thought in this brief and trenchant little book. Don't be fooled by its size. Like everything I have read of his, there is not one wasted word; every one needs to be carefully chewed on, but beware if you swallow it. You might become the kind of follower Jesus was looking for.Ellul makes it clear at the outset that he is not trying to convince anarchists to be Christians, nor is he attempting to make Christians become anarchists. He's just writng what he thinks the Hebrew Bible, Jesus, Paul and the rest of the New Testament authors, are saying, namely that no one [but God] has the right to rule anyone else. (That's what \\"an-archos\\" means in Greek). Love God, Love others, be responsible, and let the chips fall where they may.Though he sides with political anarchists in their rejection of those who claim the right to rule others, Ellul hastens to add that he does not share their utopian belief that once statist or authoritarian domination is eliminated, people (being naturally good and kind) will achieve peace, security, happiness, and community. He rejects that assumption, he writes, because he is a Christian and accepts the Christian view of the radicality of evil in human beings. Consequently, anarchists reject him because he's a Christian and Christians reject him because he's an anarchist. So be it. This is the way he has chosen to live, and leaves it up to us the readers to choose as well."},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"This brief manifesto condenses the theses of Jacques Ellul's philosophic life into a concise format that provides a good overview and a primer for possible future reading. It provides a handy summary of the logic by which he believes close reading of Scripture reveals an anti-statist bent at odds with the tendency of formal Christianity to make common cause with the powers of the earth.Throughout this volume Ellul insists he is not trying to proselytize anyone for a point of view. The repetition makes me suspect he protests too much, but this book is too short and introductory to change many minds. What it is likely to do is start lively, productive discussions that may allow two camps, often regarded as incompatible, to find commonalities and stop the feud that divides them both.Ellul calls himself a Protestant, but expresses disdain for anyone exercising dominion over others. He insists we must be cautious and selective in reading Calvin and Luther. There are some places, particularly in his exegesis of 1 Peter and of Paul, that he must perform interesting verbal gymnastics to reconcile his thesis with Scripture. He might have been better served here to take a bold approach and admit there are some things he just doesn't know.Ellul doesn't write for dabblers or dilettantes. His prose is ponderous and allusive. He makes references to prior writings by himself and others. This book is meant to engage true believers, activists, and thinkers. Be willing to set aside a healthy measure of time before reading this book.But if you set that time aside and use it wisely, this book opens up a new way of regarding our Christian mission on earth. Highly recommended for Christians, for conscientious resisters, and for intellectuals on both sides of the theological divide."},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"Jacques Ellul's book is unfocused and frequently contradictory - I guess \\"paradoxical\\" is the polite term - occasionally verging on incoherence. Still, he provides an ultimately enjoyable, if often confusing, account of the relationship between Christianity and \\"anarchy,\\" as Ellul understands the two movements. If the book is a relatively aimless ramble, still it is a thoroughly harmless and occasionally enlightening one.A Protestant theologian of some renown, Ellul's personal intellectual odyssey was deeply influenced by major events of anarchist history that are utterly forgotten by my most Christians. Alluding to the Kronstadt rebellion of 1921, Ellul writes that \\"the Cronstadt sailors and the Makhno government seemed to me to have been truly revolutionary and I could not pardon their suppression.\\" (p. 2). Referring to the Stalinist treachery in May of 1937, Ellul adds that \\"what led me to detest the communists was their conduct during the Spanish Civil War and their horrible assassination of the Barcelona anarchists.\\" (p. 2). That's enough to establish Ellul's credibility as a political (or anti-political) radical.But what of Anarchy and Christianity? \\"There has always been a Christian anarchism,\\" writes Ellul. (p.7) \\"In every century there have been Christians who have discovered the simple biblical truth, whether intellectually, mystically, or socially.\\" (p. 7). And yet, Ellul insists, \\"I am not in any way trying to tell Christians that they ought to be anarchists.\\" (p. 4).What exactly is this \\"simple biblical truth\\" that Ellul insists he is not telling Christians to follow? What do \\"anarchism\\" and \\"anarchy\\" mean?\\"By anarchy,\\" Ellul writes, \\"I mean first an absolute rejection of violence.\\" (p. 11). As government, by definition seeks a monopoly on the means of organized violence (see Woodrow Wilson'sThe State: Elements Of Historical And Practical Politics), strict pacifists naturally tend toward anarchistic philosophies - witness, for example, Leo Tolstoy and Ammon Hennacy. Taking Jesus' nonviolent teaching seriously, says Ellul, \\"Christianity means a rejection of power and a fight against it.\\" (p. 13).Yet if Ellul finds himself \\"thus very close to one of the forms of anarchism,\\" still he insists that he is not truly an anarchist at all: \\"The true anarchist thinks that an anarchist society - with no state, no organization, no hierarchy, and no authorities - is possible. But I do not. . . . I believe that the anarchist fight, the struggle for an anarchist society is essential, but I also think that the realizing of such a society is impossible.\\" (pp. 18-19).Just four pages later, though, Ellul insists \\"it is more necessary than ever to promote and extend the anarchist movement,\\" for he says that \\"Anarchy . . . has a bright future before it. This is why I adopt it.\\" (p. 23).So, is Ellul an anarchist, or isn't he? It really is hard to tell from this book. Perhaps he means to say that it's necessary to strive for the impossible, and that this is what Jesus directed Christians to do. Recall Jesus' charge to his followers \\"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\\" Matthew 5:48 (NRSV). One need not believe that moral perfection is possible, in order to strive for it.In truth, though, it is rather difficult to understand precisely what Ellul really means to say. I suspect he means to be difficult. Yet his book is studded with random jewels - insights or observations that demand further thought.Of Romans 13:1-7 and Titus 3:1, so often cited as mandating submission to human governments, Ellul writes: \\"These are the only texts in the whole Bible which stress obedience and the duty of obeying authorities.\\" (p. 50). He insists that they run counter to overwhelming antiauthoritarian currents in the scriptures - currents that he documents with scriptural citations.Considering the temptation of Christ, when Satan offers Jesus the power of all the world's kingdoms (Matthew 4:8-11; Luke 4:5-7), Ellul writes that according to the biblical texts \\"all the power and glory of the kingdoms, all that has to do with politics and political authority, belongs to the devil. It has all been given to him and he gives it to whom he wills.\\" (p. 48).And of Jesus Christ himself: \\"For those who are not very familiar with the Bible it must be pointed out that Jesus never said himself that he was the Christ (Messiah) or the Son of God. He always called himself the Son of man (i.e., true man).\\" (p. 70).There is much in the book to ponder, then, even if Ellul never manages to weave his rambling thoughts into a coherent statement on much of anything in particular.Eric Alan Isaacson"},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"Jacques Ellul (1912-1994) was a French sociologist, philosopher, and theologian, but his main profession was teaching law at the University of Bordeaux. He held strong views about the nature of government as antithetical to Christian faith, and is counted among the 20th century Christian anarchists.Anarchy and Christianity is a short work presenting the essentials of Ellul's political philosophy with respect to Scripture. It reads in a scholarly manner, especially with his references to historical and textual criticism and the assumption that the reader knows something about Marxian class theory, historical theological traditions, and even a bit of Greek. One must be prepared to encounter someone distant from the American evangelical theology that we are so familiar with. I'd be hard-pressed to say he is a \\"theological liberal,\\" but he is different. Despite the qualms I have with certain elements of Ellul's thought, I found the book to be a very enjoyable read and it enlivened Scriptures that I had not paid due attention in the past. Since it isn't that long, I think anyone can gain a lot from reading this book.The book contains three main parts, plus an appendix for further thoughts. First, Ellul includes a personal introduction to demonstrate why the political question of anarchy is still important to the church today. He begins: \\"The question I am posing is the more difficult because fixed opinions have long since been reached on both sides and have never been subjected to the least examination.\\" If anything, the question is not settled (not even with him). He reveals some of his personal history, including his time participating in Marxist movements before converting to Christianity. Even though he admired Marx, he was also very familiar with Proudhon (\\"Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.\\") and therefore never really considered himself a strict Marxist/communist even while sympathetic to the ideas.Part 1 is entitled \\"Anarchy from a Christian Standpoint\\" and outlines what anarchy actually is, describes why he considers himself and anarchist, and answers some anarchist objections to Christianity. To Ellul, the essential element of anarchy is not the caricature of a bomb-throwing revolter but a rejection of violence and aggression as a means of accomplishing political goals. \\"No matter what the motivation, however, I am against violence and aggression. I am against it on two levels. The first is simply tactical... My second reason is obviously a Christian one. Biblically, love is the way, not violence.\\" Ellul then addresses the charge of non-Christian anarchists that Christianity itself is antithetical to freedom, even going so far as to address briefly the \\"problem of evil.\\"I love this paragraph where he defends the position that God is the great liberator:\\"But why freedom? If we accept that God is love, and that it is human beings who are to respond to this love, the explanation is simple. Love cannot be forced, ordered, or made obligatory. It is necessarily free. If God liberates, it is because he expects and hopes that we will come to know him and love him. He cannot lead us to do so by terrorizing us.\\"The subject of Part 2 is \\"The Bible as the Source of Anarchy,\\" where Ellul shows via what he calls a \\"nave reading\\" of the Bible that typical interpretations of pro-state Christians are wrongheaded. He surveys both the Old and New Testaments, answering a variety of questions that seemingly pro-state Scriptures bring to the forefront. Without giving too much away, he addresses 1 Samuel, the Prophets, the teachings of Jesus, Paul, Peter, and Revelation. Some of his interpretations are what I expected, others are quite surprising. I will leave it to you to discover and enjoy.In summary, Ellul's work is quality material for the Christian libertarian. His chief flaw - and this flaw is certainly not trivial from my point of view - is a lack of understanding about the free market as the great vehicle of practicing freedom. I think it very likely that he is caricaturing corporatism as capitalism, but nevertheless a steadier free market principle would be help bolster his ideas to contemporary libertarians of all backgrounds. But most importantly, he gives an thought-provoking case that the State is from any point of view the enemy of freedom and of God.Originally posted at [...]"},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"Jacques Ellul's book is a thoughtful and serious account of the intersection of Christianity and anti-statism.

I imagine the average christian would be shocked at the similarities.

Although, I don't agree with everything Ellul says what is more important is that he is an original thinker, even though he does often follow the \\"party line\\". That may seem paradoxical but I think he comes up with his conclusions by reasoning and not just accepting what he is told. I think he may be afraid of disagreeing with the Bible and Protestant dogma, though; perhaps fearing he can't serve Christ and disagree with some of the typical interpretations. Because of this, I notice a lot of round-about reasoning and possible contradictions. I don't remember individual contradictions but I remember thinking there were some. And I believe that's common with evangelical dogma. I, personally, share more of a gnostic interpretation. Not a DaVinci code, new-agey gnostic interpretation, and not a mythicist or liberal interpretation, either. I accept Jesus's blood atonement, believe in Him in history as fully God and fully man. But,I think He may not be the Jewish OT God, who I think is probably the demiurge, but, instead, I believe Jesus is the manifestation of the Perfect God.Anyway, Mr. Ellul understood that followers of the Way are the salt of the Earth and it shouldn't be expected for the church to be large. He understood we need to live in small communities, like Acts, and, yes, even in our modern age. He also understood that secular anarchists are largely deceived and prejudiced like so many others, although they are perceptive of much of reality. It is interesting how ahead of his times he was, even though he advocated a primitive simple lifestyle, like in the past. For, recently, many modern secular and anarchistic activists are recognizing the value of Jesus's teachings, and how much of an anarchist He really was. Also, many Christians are realizing how important justice is and how Jesus and the early church was apolitical.Christian community may be entering a revival. For anyone interested, look up New Monasticism and communities like Koinonia Farm, the 12 tribes of Israel, and Rutba House. If more Christians lived as Jesus and the early church did, freely and compassionately and if more activists types realized the reality of soul and Spirit and lived as Jesus did real positive change could happen and the world would be a better place. I don't expect it to be perfect, though, and understand this world is not my home.That said, it's probably true that more anarchists live true to Jesus's teaching than those who profess being Christian. To paraphrase a chapter of Romans(??3:12??) The gentiles who don't know God but follow their conscience will not be condemned."},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"Very thought provoking and a challenge to both classical dogma and the status quo within the Christian Church. I will have to do a lot more studying from early church history to verify what the thinking of the early church was concerning a Christians relationship to the state.Highly recommended for anyone not satisfied with contemporary Christianity esp. as practiced in the U.S."},{"Title":"Anarchy and Christianity","review":"Jacques Ellul's \\"Anarchy and Christianity\\" is 109 pages long and is divided into 8 chapters and several appendices. The main focus is on re-thinking power structures and relationships from a Christian viewpoint based on the New Testament writings. The church, in essence, should not get involved in the machinations of the world.There are several strengths to the work. First, it is written by a professional academic and activist who has many years of experience in law, sociology, and the history of institutions. He knows of what he writes. Second, it is written in an easy-to-read conversational style that does not bog you down with technical jargon. This will make it accessible to a wider audience. Third, the biblical analysis challenges the reader about what they thought they knew about the Bible. There are numerous texts that are either completely missed or misunderstood by many modern Christians, but which Ellul highlights as they relate to Christians versus the State apparatus. Fourth, a good survey is taken of large segment of the Bible to bolster his points, such as the Book of Judges, the Gospels, the Writings of Paul, 1 Peter, and Revelation.I have two complaints. First off, the several appendices from Karl Barth and an obscure Catholic priest do not add much to the thrust of the book. Also, I wish instead that Ellul has examined more thoroughly the biblical texts instead and perhaps given his own practical assessment of how his findings affect power relationships not just between the church and the state, but also within the institutional church itself, which has a long and problematic history with hierarchy. For me this issue is paramount, especially since I am involved in trying to establish a network of house churches after a more New Testament model of the church (see Acts 2:41-47, 20:20, Rom 16:3-5, 1 Cor 16:19).Overall, this is an excellent introduction to the biblical roots of anarchism and should be considered required reading for anyone interested in the relationship of Christians to the state and, possibly, leadership within the church.RAD ZDERO, author of LETTERS TO THE HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT and THE GLOBAL HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT"},{"Title":"Avram's Gift","review":"This title was declared a 2003 Notable Book by the Association of Jewish Libraries!

Granite is the universal stone which contains uranium, aluminum, iron, silica and rare minerals. At one time, the peaks rose higher than the Rockies and even taller than the Himalayas. Three hundred million years ago, the land in the area stood 10,000 feet higher than it does now. There was never an eruption like that in Alaska.The exposed granite of Stone Mountain covers 25 million square feet, or 583 acres. It is 1,683 feet above sea level. When I visited there with a school group, it was just a huge rock. But not anymore. Now three famous Confederates astride their horses have made this monstrosity famous. The land had belonged to the Creek Indians, then the Venable family. In 1826, President John Quincy Adams purchased the land topped by a rock as big as a mountain.Historians tried to find evidence that Hernando de Soto (searching for the garden of youth) visited Stone Mountain. Captain Juan Pardo, sent by Spain in 1567, called it Crystal Mountain. George Washington got involved in acquiring this large-scale replica of Gibraltar in 1790.In 1909, the United Daughters of the Confederacy chose this as a site for a spectacular Confederate Memorial at the world's largest piece of sculpture cut into this enormous mass of granite. Fifty-five years elapsed before the statue was begun in 1964. At first, it was to depict a seventy foot (later expanded to 168 ft.) carving of Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis, all astride their horses. (Lee's horse, Traveler, has his own notoriety, the best known in the Civil War (you can read about it in the World Book). In 1958, the Georgia legislature deeded it as a state park and actual work on this monument began in 1963.A few revisions were made throughout the project by the chosen sculptor, Walker Kirkland Hancock of Gloucester, Mass. The carver, Roy Faulkner, spent six years drilling thousands of holes in the acre of granite, declared it a privilege to be associated with such a great man as Mr. Hancock. Together, they created a work of art the likes of Michelangalo: a giant, effective Confederate Memorial of the three top men."},{"Title":"CARVED IN STONE (Civil War Georgia)","review":"This tells the story well.

A major strength of this volume isits organization. The dominant case of headings and subheadingsto introduce a thought makes this easy to read as well asconducive to just looking up sections of interest.Dr. Dickason's treatise in the area of angelology brings severalbenefits to the reader. First, an understanding of the spiritworld will help to understand God, the Father and his relationshipto the realm of creation and his created creatures. Second, Thistopic will bring comfort to believers in understanding God's useof angels to minister to us. Third, we can learn about the holinessof God and his judgment on men and angels as they sin and rebell.Dickason discusses the nature, position, classification and abodeof angels. He competently details their ministry and their destiny.His closes the first section examining our relationship to angelsIn part two he writes informatively on the original state and fallof Lucifer. He also deals Biblically with Satan's character andposition and details his power and activities.This volume will bring blessing and comfort to the reader as wellas Biblical insight into this area of theology."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"While there are dozens of books by theologians on the topic of angles, C. Fred Dickason's Angels: Elect and Evil is more thorough than most. This book covers familiar ground in the normal format: the existence, attributes, and activities of angles are all here. What distinguishes this book from others like it is the clarity with which Dickason writes.This book could serve as a catalogue of all references in the Bible concerning angels. The first half is spent on angles in general, and the second half on evil angels in particular. Dickason provides a comprehensive look at Satan, as well as demon possession.There are a few obvious weaknesses to this book. While for the most part, Dickason makes solid and biblical conclusions. The glaring exception is his belief that Christians can be demon possessed. While there is perhaps a case to be made for this view, Dickason does not make it here. Instead of biblical arguments, this section is filled with stories and recounted tales from the mission field. It stands out as being different than much of the rest of the book. Secondly, there is a chapter on the occult which likewise leaves the confines of Scripture for the realm of experience. That chapter just feels out of place in a book like this.Also, like most of the other similar books, the reader gets the impression that there is a depth that is lacking. This book is wide, and touches on just about every passage in Scripture concerning angels. But it is not deep. What are the implications of angels being created to serve both God and man? Does this help explain the fall? He has an excursus defending his view that Genesis 6 describes angels committing immorality, but he does not go to WHY they would do so, or touch on the implications.In the end, this book is better written and more comprehensive than others like it, but in key areas instead of depth, the reader finds experience and a familiar--yet through--cataloging of the verses concerning angels."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"This book provides good, solid Biblical insights into the spiritual world of angels and demons. It clearly explains some major misconceptions within Christian groups and organizations. The use of Scripture is accurate and helpful in understanding the spiritual elements. This book has been a huge help in my spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"Fred Dickason has written a book that is helpful to Christian community. His focus is thoroughly biblical and probably one of the most detailed works on angelology. His thought is found to derive only from Christian scripture about the nature, purpose, role, and attributes of angels.The work will literally expose you to everything (and I mean everything) you might possibly desire to know about angels. He certainly leaves no stone unturned in his goal of bringing forth every meaningful teaching or reference to angels. In an age with growing \\"spirituality\\", this book is of dire importance for Christ's church. Though angelology is not the primary focus of scripture, it plays an integral part in the unfolding of biblical-redemptive history and helps to explain the supernatural realms/dimensions around us.Dickason does not take the approach that an angel or demon is under every rock, but the teaching that these forces don't exist is just as problematic; Dickason sets out to refute both kinds of teaching. Since our culture has largely become postmodern in its thinking, New Age thinking (such as \\"The Secret), or general \\"spirituality\\" and the like, is now common among the majority. Most people now prefer the word(s) \\"spiritual/spirituality\\" in comparison to \\"religious.\\" This type of thinking has really given way to the New Age Movement which flourishes in a postmodern context. Dickason's book is a decisive tool in dismantling the false realities of these teachings (2 Cor. 10:4-6) and does what every secondary source should aim for - return to what scripture teaches.Overall, the work is systematic in its approach to angels from a biblical perspective, brings every issue pertaining to the angelic nature and role, and fiercely combats the \\"highly-spiritualized\\" worldviews of New Age and Postmodern thought, which translates into paganism. I also think Dickason's chapters on the \\"Angel of the Lord\\" are worth the price of the book. He approaches Old Testament Christology carefully like a surgeon, looking at the Old Testament occurrences of this \\"Angel\\" and seeing the message of plurality within God, as well as a powerful foreshadowing and witness to New Testament teachings about God as Trinity.Overall, an excellent piece of work that deserves to be on the shelf of every Christian servant, whether teacher or preacher, lay worker or bible/seminary student."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"Angels Elect and Evil. This book is divided into 2 parts addressing the angels of God & Satan and demons. Scriptural evidence throughout will support the facets covered in a very comprehensive way. You will learn why angels were created and the attributes they possess. Special classes of angels with distinguishing characteristics are given including Cherubim(speak of the revelation of God's glory to man) and Seraphim(afire with adoration of God and proclaimers that man must be cleansed of sin). C.Fred Dickason clarifies the statement of mankind as \\"a little lower than the angels\\" spoken in Psalms and Hebrews. Man is weaker and subject to death but being \\" in Christ\\" are positionally above angels and in the resurrection shall rule over angels with Christ.The section on Satan and demons is highly informative culminating satan's ultimate plan to direct world government through the Antichrist. Although still powerful, Satan, through his fall after creation in Genesis 1, has limited power. The highly debated issue as to whether Christians can be demon possessed is explored as is clarification given on who the \\" sons of God\\" are (Gen.6) and who \\" the spirit in prison\\" are(1 Pet. 3:19).Additionally, you will gain insight into the following:- Where the holy and evil angels abide- The names of Satan and how they present the multifaceted aspects of his power, character, and activity.- The vast range of duties demons perform.- How we open up the door to the occult.- Practical attitudes and actions to develop in spiritual warfare.If you desire to do a Biblical teaching or want in depth information on angels, Satan, and/ or demons this would be an excellent book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"Fred's theological exposition of angelic activity, both holy and evil, is easily understandable in this excellent book. Should be on every Christian's bookshelf, along with his other book \\"Demon possession and the Christian\\". Praise the Lord Jesus for Fred, and Praise the Lord for Himself and His Power and Victory!"},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for truth about this subject.the service was good also.thanks so much"},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"Excellently structured and cross referenced with The Bible to confirm truths on the Title of this book.Recommend this book to anyone that seeks a deeper and true understanding of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"I actually threw this book into the trash.This is a collection of old manuscripts (very much similar to the \\"Forgotten Books\\" series available here on Amazon) which have been edited in an attempt to create a storyline that has some kind of historical-theological significance. There are a lot of problems with the way the author assembled the material.1. I don't trust his translations. Having read some of the manuscripts in their own right, I found several discrepancies between previous readings, and what I saw here.2. The editing is clumsy. I understand that the author/editor was working with ancient writings from multiple sources, but his transitions are rude and at times questionable, for reasons I'll explain next.3. The editor tends to cut off manuscripts at almost random points, and then tacks on part of another manuscript (sometimes no more than a few lines), before resuming the original passages. This completely destroys the context of the originals, in addition to being very, very misleading to the reader. Context is everything in ancient religious writings, and this book destroys most of the original context by attempting to shoe-horn meanings into the work in an effort to create a preconceived story line.4. The author elevates these writings to the level of inspired religious writings. In other words, the editor makes the assumption that these religious manuscripts carry the same weight as the inspired texts of the Septuagint, the Old Testament, and the complete Bible (as well as the accepted inspired Hebrew texts). Several of the manuscripts he makes use of in this book are, in fact, Gnostic apologetic works that have no actual relationship to the subject of \\"angels;\\" the editor simply uses out-of-context passages to fill-in a story line that he gives credibility via a priori assumptions.For my money, if you have a passing interest in the subject you should purchase the \\"Forgotten Books\\" series that relate to the topic. If you are making a serious study of the subject, for any reason, avoid this like the plague. Reading it is thirty minutes of your life that you'll never get back."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"This was 'required reading' for a graduate level course in seminary. I think the author could have boiled it down to 5-6 pages of useful material rather than page after page of reiterating the same thing 3 different ways. By the time I was finished with 1/2 the book - reading the second half was more of a chore than enjoyable/edifying. I'm not an expert in the area angelology, so i'm going to search for a better read for my personal library."},{"Title":"Angels Elect and Evil","review":"Overall a decent book, but for a conservative, traditional perspective I have to say that I did not agree with several chapters and a few points the author promoted."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"While I was deeply engrossed by this novel, one of the characters' deaths seemed like an afterthought of the author. The final and most important duel of the novel wasn't noble or suspenseful, but rather anti-climactic. And the book contained a few scenes of &quot;self love&quot; that could've been tastefully omitted."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This book is a very enjoyable, easy read. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high paced adventure story. Only one caution: at times Mr. Smith seems to delve into the realm of smut with his descriptions of the main character's sexual exploits. More swashbuckling please!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Bird of Prey is my very first Wilbur Smith novel.The novel can be simply divided into two major parts: the first part being where Sir Francis Courteney still alive, and the latter section hovering around Hal Courteney, his son.The first section mainly deals with Dutch people near the South African Cape of Good Hope. It was set during the waning years of Anglo-Dutch war, where Sir Francis got caught in between the peace settled between England and the Republic of Dutch. He was actually a \\"formalized pirate\\", since being a merchant with a Letter of Marque from the British monarchy entitled him to raid Dutch vessels. Those vessels were intercepted between their voyage from the islands of Indonesia to Amsterdam, to be precise: just before the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of African. He intercepted the very vessel carrying not only expensive goods and spices and commodities, but also the soon-to-be Governor of Good Hope and his wife themselves. At the end of the first section, Sir Francis was betrayed by his Knighthood mate.I need to add that, it is a western type of perspective. Being currently living in Indonesia, an ex-Dutch colony; I found myself familiar with many of the Dutch issues and deeds they did during those days. Batavia, Bali, etc. were all mentioned in this novel, and they are located in Indonesia. On the character called Althuda and Sukeena, I found that the author had slighlt miss the religion, since almost all Balinese are Hindus. Being part of the nobility, both of those characters are most probably Hindus, such that having them of other religions seemed highly improbable.Dutch VOC (the Dutch East Indies Company) brualities were grossly explotied by Mr. Smith. An actual (non-fictional) history with the capture, torture and murder of several British merchants were also told in this novel. Wilbur Smith has taken into account of of this historical facts, by assuming Sukeena's father, as one of those unlucky merchants. There is another outstanding character named Aboli, who is a slave from a tribal African village, kidnapped into slavery and saved by Sir Francis during his childhood. Aboli eventually becomes \\"the godfather\\" for Hal Courteney, since Aboli is both wise and skillful at arms.To me, Sir Francis is nothing but a \\"formal thug\\", since he robbed Dutch vessels, who also robbed their colonies. Thus, robbing another robbing will do no good at the end, which was what precisely happened to him, shrewdly manipulated by Smith. The way slaves (including Sir Francis himself) were treated was described vividly by Wilbur Smith. Smith really has an authority in telling these matters.My rating for the first part is 4 stars.The second part dealt with Hal Courteney and his journeys through the African forests and plains all the way to the eastern seaboard. Later, he took his gang sailing to Madagascar, Ethiopia and parts of the northeast of Africa, in the Ottoman's strangehold. Making the story even better is that he is defending a supposedly Christian Kingdom of Prester John in Ethiopia. Some people might think the Prester John kingdom exist, but for a start I suggest a Non-Fictional Historical book by Giles Milton titled The Riddle and the Knight: In Search of Sir John Mandeville, the World's Greatest Traveller.Hal Courteney was depicted as having affairs with three ladies, plus a brief encounter will an African tribe female slave.The second part of the book, I rate it as a 5 star.Wilbur Smith actually writes: 30% history, 20% romance, 50% adventure and 100% pure enjoyment!This novel can actually be published into two separate books, but Mr. Smith deep concentration in finishing them in one book is just overwhelming. I remember reading in a single run for at least 100 pages without knowing the times past.This is a must read book for adventure, history and somewhat romance genre type of fans. Bravo Mr. Smith!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Torture, bloody murder, numerous decapitations, a mouthful of pus plus a sadistic nymphomaniac bisexual slut made this book a vivid read. If you want lots of historical fiction action this novel will serve you well. But I found myself wanting this book to end. Several plot lines had wholly unrealistic character actions - especially what the protagonists do not do during a desperate prison break. This somewhat spoiled the balance of the story for me.The writer also has a penchant to draft descriptive passages of penises. In addition, more than once the reader will encounter difficult-to-believe depictions of pederasts and the occasional masturbation scene.This book has a number of very predictable elements, especially along the amorous lines. If an attractive female appears in the text, the main character will be copulating with her in fifteen pages or so.Cornball dialogue didn't help either: \\"The young eagle was beginning to rejoice in the power of his wings\\" and \\"Katinka! Have no fear. I am come to save you, my darling. I will never let these villains take you.\\"I am also biased against any novel that has the author's name printed larger than the title on the cover. It also doesn't help that the writer has his name on the top of every other page as if he needs to constantly remind the reader who created this literary gem.I'm glad I borrowed it from my public library and didn't shell out the $26.00 for the hard-cover edition. It's not a bad little diversion in historical fiction, but its flaws kept me from enjoying it more."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This was my first Wilbur Smith book. I thought it was all right for an adventure genre. There is enough historical research to add color. And it certainly moves along well. Many of the events are not believable, but you can say the same for James Bond. The book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially. Boys grow into manhood overnight. Women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar. Crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life. But it is easy reading for passing a few hours."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"There's not another activity quite like reading a story created by a skilled author that allows you to travel to another time and witness events of high drama and intrigue while in the safety and comfort of your own home.Wilbur Smith has created such a story. This is a fantastic historical novel set in the 1670's depicting the English pirate raids on the Dutch East Indies Company. Treachery on the high seas, slavery, brutal conditions and extraordinary characters make this a story not easily forgotten. It seems its main characters, namely Francis and Hal Courtney may be the ancestors of the later Courtneys found in Smith's earlier novels. It will be a pleasure to find out."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"this is a novel that got me started on Wilbur Smith and I wanted my cousin to experience the tail"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Another swashbuckling novel from the pen of Wilbur Smith that will not disappoint Wilbur Smith fans.

If you are not the maritime type you need a naval dictionary to absorb the action. On the other hand a wealth of information of how England built its Empire. Wherever there was no enemy, the Brits always managed to create one. The Boers in Southern Africa are people from the same stock as the Brits. Yet they had to have an enemy in that part of the world also, so the Boer war and many other wars at the Cape, would be inevitable. For good measure Wilburn Smith in this book introduces an old enmity between Moslem and Christian in an area where active piracy is currently taking place! Is this wise? In my view no! I look forwards to the new book by Wilburn Smith.John Taliotis, M.D.Cyprus."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Yet another smashing adventure that truly captured my imagination.

If your seek adventure this book will satisfy your hunger."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"&quot;Birds of Prey&quot; is another great book by Wilbur Smith.

From the very first page he manages to enlist the reader as a member of this band of adventurers. I was almost able to see myself battling alongside Hal and his companions as they traveled the seas and coastlines of south Africa. It was hard to put this book down and I hated for it to end"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"A friend of mine sent this book to me from England so I got a head start on the U.S.. The problem with the book is I couldn't put it down. Now I have to wait another year or two for Mr. Smith to write anothe great book. The adventure never stops from the first page to the last. You love Hal and hate his enemies. You may get sea sick from the rolling of his ship. You will be aroused by his affair. Once again, do not pass this book on to a friend. You won't get it back"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Birds of Prey was my first Wilbur Smith Novel. Being a person that makes a living on the ocean I am attracted to novels about the great sailing ships of the past. Everything I had read about Wilbur Smith led me to believe that this would be a novel that I couldn't put down. In the beginning that was true. The main characters were interesting. I didn't expect the explicit sex scenes that are scattered throughout the novel. Mr. Smith's main hero throughout the book is young Hal Courteney. His sexual exploits are described in vivid detail in the first half of the book, but then as the book progresses become more like what I would expect from an adventure novel. I am not sure that the earlier sex scenes really added to the book. The St. Martin's Paperback version that I have is over 660 pages. It was a long read and you could actually divide the book into two halves. The first is while Sir Frances Courteney (Hal's Father) is driving the action in the story. The second is when Hal is the lead. The first half of the book is filled with intrigue and vivid battles scenes (and sex scenes). The second half of the book seems to have been an after thought. All the vivid drawn out scenes from the first half become a few paragraphs of quick victories for young Hal. You wait and entire 600 pages for Hal to face his Dutch antagonist. When it finally happens I can call it at best anti-climactic. He defeat's another ship easily and his other foil dies pretty unceremoniously. Forgive me, but when I put 600 + pages of time into a novel waiting for these two show downs (which you know at page 300 are coming) I expected more! Much more. Cut out the pages of Hal's sexual exploits and make the final scenes of the book worth the time I invested in this novel.Having said all this the book was okay. The book's strength was the early vivid descriptions of Europeans seeing Africa for the first time. You could imagine what they must have been seeing. What a crocodile must be like for someone who has never seen nor heard of one. The fear they felt when the crocodile's got a hold of someone in the water. The book's weakness was the quick tidy ending. I am not upset that the good guys win; I expect that in an adventure novel. I was just disappointed that this was an after thought and wrapped up cleanly with a lot of luck.I am not sure that I for one will invest another 600+ pages in a Wilbur Smith Novel in the future."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I ordered this book as used and in good condition. It was exactly as advertised. It was in such good condition that I couldn't tell that it was used. I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I bought this book for pennies plus shipping still much cheaper than I could get at any store. It is in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion. Thank you."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"\\"Birds of Prey\\" is the second book by Wilbur Smith I have read, and I can draw a couple of parallels with the other one, \\"Cry Wolf.\\" First off, Smith's heroes are all men's men. Tough, handsome, winning the ladies right and left, and of course, always operating under a strict code of honor. Second, Smith writes adventure very well. Reading this book I was transported back to the Pirate craze of my middle-school years, when I avidly read anything involving treasure, jungles, ships, and sharks. Three, there are occasional slow spots.The plot can be determined from the summaries given on this page, so I'll just sum up my reaction to the book. It is 664 pages long and probably could have been about 500. However, it seemed that whenever the thought of putting the book aside entered my mind, Smith would throw in a twist, or a thrilling action sequence to hook me again. The characters, though cardboard knights in shining armor from the school of G.A. Henty, are all fairly personable and thus do not grate like some two-dimensional heroes. And above all, Smith's love of Africa comes through in these pages. The man knows his country, and he imparts a fair bit of his enthusiasm in these pages.So if you like to read and want an exciting tale of derring-do on the high seas a la Robert Stevenson or C.S. Forster, give this one a try."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This book was great. The action was good and the characterization superior. One really cares about the characters. I can hardly wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I thought that this book has all the neccessary ideals in it to make a classic. It has action romance and lots of atmosphere and makes this an essential purchase for all action fanatics or anyone who wants a good read."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I have been a respectful admiring reader of Wilbur Smith for many years. I was enthralled by his intricate plot, spellbounding capacity, and deep knowledge of the history and politics of his (and my own) native Africa. But more than that, his psychological analysis of characters, ability to convey relations between different races, tolerance and contrivance to impartiality in portraying the motivation and actions of different ethnic/political groups has raised him above the exotic thriller/adventure writer he is classified as. However, beneath the surface, you could see sometimes his identification with the &quot;Anglo&quot; white man (that is African white people of English descent). This is apparent in his clashes with other Whites (Boers), Black (Bantu) people, and in this novel with Arabs / Muslims. Though the book technically and plot-wise is very good, the author has not escaped the temptation to generalize when speaking about Arabs or Muslims (i.e. There are many types of Christians, good ones, bad ones, but Muslims are a stereotype). It is bit surprising that Hal fought such a fervent war against Muslims, with such conviction, just after his Muslim wife was murdered. If you add that Muslims had nothing to do with the death of his wife or father, you'll be more surprised. Having his brother-in-law abstain from fighting his people was the gesture that saved the book from being unrealistic and superficial. Smith's portrayal of Muslim characters (even Anglos) is uncomplimentary, if not downright derogatory. Hal is a typical Courtney hero again, brave, clever, handsome, charismatic, irresistible, and unconquerable. But I got used to Smith's Courtney prototype that I am starting to enjoy it, if not believe it."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Wilbur Smiths &quot;Birds of Prey is captivating. His gallant, highly sexed heroes and gorgeous sexed heroines are unforgetable. Who can foregt the sadistic nymphomaniac,Katinka, who not only seduces the innocent Hal but also includes the exotic Balinese slave,Sukeena to the Dutch Colonel Schreuder and even the vile executioner Slow John.This book is not the fainthearted as all the battles are very vivid and detailed. Each encounter upon the pirate ships as they sail around the coast of Africa is written in great detail as Smith the capitivating storyteller does so well.

Now I have ordered the entire Courtneys of Africa series. I just completed The Sound of Thunder and while good (3 star)was not up to the excitement and adventure of Birds of Prey and Monsoon (both 5 stars). Perhaps it was the adventure on the high seas as opposed to the Boer War that I enjoyed but I think it was more the writing style and great decriptive and story telling skill that made the difference. I can't imagine a more exciting or better written novel than Smith's latest two books. Tomorrow I will begin A Time to Die."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"In BIRDS OF PREY, it is the year 1667, and we are introduced to the 17-year old Englishman, Hal Courteney. Hal is a crewmember on his father's ship, the \\"Lady Edwina\\", as it sails the high seas off the southern tip of Africa. England is at war with the Dutch Republic, and the ship's captain, Sir Francis Courteney, has been given license by the British Admiralty to prey on Dutch trading ships of the United East India Company as they return to Amsterdam from the East Indies via the Dutch settlement at the Cape of Good Hope. Sir Francis captures a Dutch ship carrying the newly appointed Governor of Good Hope and his wife, Katinka. During the period when the Governor and his wife are held for ransom, Hal loses his virginity to Katinka, a sadistic, treacherous, highborn slut. (Well, good breeding isn't everything.) Subsequently, Sir Francis, Hal and the rest of the Lady Edwina's company are betrayed by a former ally, the Scottish Earl of Cumbrae, with the help of a former crewmember, Sam Bowles, and imprisoned at Good Hope. Sir Francis is brutally tortured and executed. Hal and a handful of survivors later escape, acquire another ship, and go on to defeat their primary tormentors, Cumbrae and a Dutch army colonel named Schreuder, against the backdrop of a war between the Christian Emperor of Ethiopia and the Moslem Sultan of Oman. Along the way, Hal inherits his father's captaincy and finds true love (as opposed to hormonal-driven sex with Katinka) - twice.As painted by the author, Wilbur Smith, the chief characters of this swashbuckling adventure are almost caricatures. The \\"good guys\\" - principally Hal and his loyal buddies, Aboli, Ned, and Daniel - are brave, noble and heroic. The \\"bad guys\\" - Katinka, Governor van de Velde, Bowles, Cumbrae, and Schreuder - are cruel, dishonorable and totally vile. The action, much as in Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones film trilogy, is wildly improbable, especially over the book's latter half. Similarly, however, that same action is scripted with such exuberance and energy that it's totally engaging. Finally, I read to be transported to places that, in most cases, I will never visit. I doubt that I shall ever ply the Indian Ocean or South Atlantic aboard a frigate under sail. This book took me there in grand style."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"BIRDS OF PREY is no doubt the very best novel Wilbur Smith has ever written.

I hope BIRDS OF PREY eventually gets made into a major movie. It's good and powerful, believe me. I can't wait for Smith's next book! Other books by Wilbur Smith I highly recommend are EAGLE IN THE SKY, ELEPHANT SONG, RIVER GOD, and THE SEVENTH SCROLL. Smith is the most talented author in the world - he meticulously researches many things and never rushes his job. His books are therefor almost perfect. Buy BIRDS OF PREY, be patient with it, and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's not the type of book I usually read, but it was recommended to me by my brother. I found it to be very fast paced and exciting. You follow the hero (Hal) on his seafaring adventures set in the mid 1600s. It gives great insight as to what life in this period was like and so makes for a fascinating read. It has great battle scenes, heartbreaking torture, and a good amount of lust! The only thing I found slightly tedious were the constant references to the ship's construction and operation. It would have been really interesting, if you knew what they were talking about. They should definitely have included a little diagram of a ship with all of the parts labeled. I bought this book for my ocean loving brother-in-law and am sure he'll love it. I thought it was very well written and would recommend it, especially for the guys out there who like history and stories of the pirate days."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I believe Wilbur Smith has written in the vicinity of 30 novels. I should go home and count them tonight as I have every one of them, and I am starting his most recent, Monsoon, this evening. My dear wife gave me his novel, Rage, about 11 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. He simply has never written a book that was not a delight to read and an educational experience as well. The history of South Africa is woven through many of his books and you will not find an easier way to learn it. This book is a rolliking story of the sea which contains all of the elements he weaves so effortlessly into his books. Adventure, romance, sex (there is a difference), mystery and suspence come in many measures, all palatable and more than enjoyable. The outline of the story has been told by other reviews. Suffice it to say, you always get more than your money's worth from Mr. Smith...even at today's prices!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This has to be one of my favourite books. It was my first Smith book and he definitely lives up to the hype. Its every thing a good adventure novel should be, with well defined characters, loads of sword swinging action, intrigue, betrayal and even a heavy dose of eroticism thrown in for good measure.I like his style of writing. He possesses an almost liquid command of prose that seems to flow from one sentence to the other, never yielding to monotony. That is the mark of a good writer, a talent that a lot of modern-day authors lack.Since 'Birds of Prey',I have read a list of other Wilbur Smith books and I'm yet to be dissapointed. If you like a good Indiana Jones/James Bond/Treasure Island/Historically correct book, check out Smith without hesitation.The man is the Stephen Spielberg of adventure novels, not the mention an engrossing storyteller. He'll hook you from the first page.AHHH,the pleasures of a good read are underrated!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This was my first Smith book, but not my last. In the past I'd never read this type of book -- dealing with sailors (unless of course they were in an historical romance novel), but I decided to give it a try. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. This book has it all -- action, adventure, romance, some sorrow, loyalty, you name it. The characters are very well developed so that you come to know and care about them. The loyalty between some characters and what they would do for each other brought me to tears. The plot twists and turns in such a delightful manner that you never want to the book to end. But when it does, don't despair -- just pick up Monsoon -- the sequel. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"A top notch adventure from a top notch author, Birds of Prey is undoubtably a superb epic. Sure the sex scenes can seem overdone, but who cares? The entire story cackles with energy and escapism with grand action sequences that have rarely been as vivid. It is cliche-clogged and sometimes predictable, but to tell you the truth, if I wanted to read a literary suspense novel I would have picked Frederick Forsyth or Nelson Demille. What I expected from Birds of Prey was mind blowing action and a fast paced book, both of which exceeded expectaions.Chronologically the first in Smith's prolific Courtney series (for now atleast), the book opens by introducing us to Hal and Francis Courtney, son and father, one a growing man and the other an accomplished privateer. After that, the duo and their crew spot a dutch ship carrying potentially tremendous cargo, and the reader is then treated to an epic action-fest journey like never seen before. Duels to the death, explosive jail breaks, wild animal hunting, battles with pirates, religious warfare, non-religious warfare, ancient relics, astrological prophecies, torture chambers, lakes filled with writhing crocodiles, fights with lion herds, explorations into the unknown african wilderness, confrontations with ancient tribes, christian empires, muslim armies and MUCH more shape this epic, filled with almost ridiculous acts of courage and skill by the protoganists, though tremendously enjoyable too. Much to the reader's pleasure, the good guys laugh at impossible odds and dispatch them with almost as much ease and for those looking for some action, this story is a definite must.The tale is primarily about Hal's journey from teenage to manhood and about how he becomes a great warrior. He's charismatic, the best fighter alive, a natutral leader, he never turns away from his duty, no obstacle can hold him back and the rest of his characteristics are just about anything you can attribute to the classic good guy. The tale is of course also choke-full of utterly hateable villains. Colonel Schreuder the master swordsman who has never lost a fight, The Buzzard the cunning and greedy pirate, Slow John the almost inhuman yellow eyed executioner, Sam Bowles the cowardly traitor, Van De Velde the obese governor of Good Hope, Katinka the sexy and sadistic wife of the governor and lots more constantly face the protoganists for some reason or the other.One thing that I should emphazize is that this is not a tale about just sailors and pirates. Though a huge part is full of sea battles, a chunky portion of the action also takes place on land too and to classify this as sea adventure would be a gross inaccuracy.And talking of accuracy, whether some people are obliged to admit it or not, Smith has undertaken some heavy research on this book. It is totally unfair to say that this book is not well researched just because he got a technical term wrong about a 17th century ship according to a reviewer. From geographical locations like Trincomalee and Elephant Lagoon to the information about African wildlife, Smith has done his homework before penning this tale, and despite some faults, has managed to do a commendable job.Overall, if you want great literature with three dimensional characters who teach you something about the morals of life, you would be better of with something else. If you just want to sit back, relax and read an action-packed adventure epic like a mega-budget summer blockbuster, Birds of Prey will definitely rank among your favourites."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"The book was great! The only bad thing was that there is a reference on the back cover to something fairly major that doesn't happen until about halfway through the book. I couldn't believe it was taking so long for it to happen. You'll also find yourself waiting and realizing that you'd be enjoying the potential possibilities if you didn't know the inevitable.Read this book, it's excellent , but don't read the back cover.I'm looking forward to reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"&quot;Birds of Prey&quot; is the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith, and it won't be the last. I became thoroughly engrossed in Hal's adventures and was very disappointed when the last page came so quickly. This book deserves 5 stars for Mr. Smith's immaculate research and story-telling ability, its outstanding character development, and its plot-twisting emotional involvement. I can't wait to get started on his others."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I read the book and find the Audio version, though abridged, to be just as engrossing. For anyone who likes a good adventure, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I first picked this book up in the ships library on board USS LaMoure County LST-1194. It was already well read.That was in 1998. Since then I've purchased the hardcover as well as all of the following books.

Full of adventure."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I'm about 1/3 the way through the book and like Smith's other books I've already read, he captures your attention early and holds it.

It has a little too much sexual content for even an high school levelbut not very exceptional for popular novels today.Details of sea life and the hardships of prisoners is vividand realistic, but the compounding of gun powder in the African wilderness is very unlikely.Some suspension of credibility is to be expected with such fiction.That there were wars between the colonial powers:BelgiumFranceHolland ( Netherlands)EnglandGermanyPortugalSpainin Africa is not to be doubted. That the wars were thisextensive, this early is somewhat doubtful.The matchlocks used match the ones in the film The Seven SamuraiSeven Samurai - Criterion Collection - 3-Disc Remastered Editionas a Dutch weapon. The English of this period actually used Flintlockswhich needed no slow match from what I have read."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I have enjoyed several of Wilbur Smith's books and chose to read Birds of Prey based on its reviews. There were parts of the story that I enjoyed but I found some of the graphic sex scenes to be disturbing and totally unnecessary to the plot. Smith went into such detail during some events of the story (like the weird sex scenes) and yet the last part of the story seemed to be rushed through. I found myself interested in the story but not dying to know what was going to happen next (like I felt while reading some of Smith's other books like The Seventh Scroll and River God.) Wilbur Smith is an excellent author and I will probably read Monsoon which is the continuation of Birds of Prey. I hope to be swept up in the adventure and NOT able to put THAT one down."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"following the story of this family is fabulous:swashbuckeling, pirates, ships, a little history, steamy romance - who said pirates are only for guys?

As for this book: great."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This is the third Wilbur Smith book I've read following River God and Seventh scroll and it REALLY is as good as the reviews say. I loved it, and can't wait to jump right into Monsoon to see what happens to Hal next."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I have always been a Jeffery Archer fan, (Kan &amp; Able, Prodigal Daughter, As the Crow Flies) until I was introduced to Wilbur Smith. Birds of Prey is a classic novel. It is well written, suspenseful and has quite a bit of history incorporated into this novel. You won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Set on the southern coast of Africa in the 17th century, this is an exciting tale of a young man who braves villains and the elements to rescue the people he cares about. Action galore, brave deeds and derring-do abound. The author obviously researched his subject in great detail, and has created a convincing and entertaining story that will keep the reader glued to the book. He writes like a modern-day Edgar Rice Burroughs (which is a compliment). I should point out that this is not really a naval adventure ala Patrick O'Brian or C.S. Forrester. Only about a third of the book takes place at sea. This is more like a really long old-fashioned adventure movie, with a good splash of graphic violence and a bit of lurid sex thrown in."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This is one of those books that you wish would never end. I have never been disappointed by any of W.Smith's books."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Set in the world of piracy in the 17th century, Birds of Prey trips up early. Hardly surprising, when in this masculine world you've still got women 'screaming wildly and clutching their bosoms' at the sound of gunfire. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the prose is more painful than any blast of grapeshot. There are far too many examples of school play dialogue to list, but if you're looking for an exciting seafaring tale, you'd do much better to turn to 'The Golden Ocean' by Patrick O'Brian."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This book was my second Wilbur Smith book, after &quot;River God&quot;. &quot;River God&quot; was an excellent book, but this is not. It has some of the same elements of &quot;River God&quot; (well drawn characters, an interesting plot traversing many locales, and McGyver like ingenuity of the protagonists).However, in this book Smith brings into focus more needless torture and violence than necessary. This is a mark against it. (Some violence is fine and provides entertainment, but when it becomes a focus it seems the author is in need of some psychotherapy.)Also, the plot just is not as good. The last third of the book is entertaining, but this part should have been expanded and the beginning shrunk substantially. The beginning was a long drawn out period of awaiting what was foreshadowed (and takes you past the middle of the book to get to where it really begins).Therefore, I recommend other Wilbur Smith books above this one."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"What a great surprise to find this book in perfect conditon at such a great price. thank you also for your promptness"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"I was disappointed in this one because I was expecting something as well-researched and based in history as the old Hornblower novels. Suffice to say this one ain't.It is riddled with historical inaccuracies. There was no war between the Moghuls and the kingdom of \\"Prester John\\" at that time. And there are so many little details which a modicum of research would have revealed, such as the (Urdu speaking) Moghul Maharaja speaking Arabic, or a description of what is obviously a hummingbird (which lives only in the Americas) -- small points but when I say this sort of thing was repeated ad nauseum you get the message.Smith even borrows an incident from \\"Hornblower and the Atropos\\" in which someone is shot in the chest but the bullet travels around the rib to the back, where it lodges and causes fever and inflammation. Forster uses the incident for character development (the wound is the result of a duel between two cantankerous individuals; the wounded man is absolutely vital to Hornblower's mission and the other duelist is the doctor who has to save him while Hornblower is all but tearing his hair out). In Smith's hands, however, the wound is simply part of a battle and the extraction of the bullet the excuse for as much gore, pus, agony, etc., as he can lay on.Also, I HAVE to ask: is anyone out there familiar with fencing or swordfighting? I've done a little fencing, and the climactic fight in which Hal kills the evil Colonel Schreuder turns on a trick of swordfighting which simply doesn't make sense to me. It sounded odd when I read it, then I tried to visualize it, then it seemed like nonsense. I even got a couple sticks and tried it out with aanother friend of mine who's a better fencer than I. It just doesn't work.I gave it two stars because if you like gore, sex, and fantasy in a historical cloak, this is OK."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"An exciting and fast paced books which is definitely up there with the other Wilbur Smith,s classics wonderfully researched and well written"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This is the fourth time I've attempted to place a review of this book on-line. Well maybe the fourth is the charm.This tale's a sweeping adventure about English (and other) pirates in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic along the southern African coastline during the days of English-Dutch colonial conflict in the 17th century. The first quarter of the book, unfortunately, is tiresome as it's rife w/cliches: the noble Sir Francis Courtney (\\"pirate\\" captain and knight of the order of something or other), his eager and bright-eyed young son Hal, the African sidekick and all around noble savage, Aboli, and, of course, all the de rigeuer bad guys (the lovely and sexually sadistic Katrina, her fat malevolent husband, the Dutch governor, the treacherous first mate, the evil pirate captain and comrade, etc.). But, oddly enough, the tale does catch fire once the characters get mixed up with one another and end up in Cape Town. Although the plot is mechanical and the characters little more than cardboard cut-outs, the writing (including sharp descriptions of the African flora and fauna, life aboard ship and lots of taut action) does have a certain zing to it. I did find the evil and thick headed Dutch colonel (in the service of the fat governor) somewhat annoying (though he was the \\"perfect\\" villain w/his shaved pate and waxed moustachios -- shades of Simon LeGree!) and I thought the torturer, Slow John, another bit of overkill, if you'll pardon the \\"sort-of-pun.\\" But Smith can write action scenes -- when he's not larding the plot with villains and nefarious encounters, along with one cliche after another (lots of duels to the death, ambushes, daring escapes, fierce sea battles, etc.). His female love interests are also so perfect and so wooden you'll think them puppets. (I can't remember the names or very much else about the two lovely gals who give up everything for the dashing young Hal except that each is lovelier than all other fair maids in the world and, of course, loyal and self-sacrificing to the core.) In fact there's too much here generally. One action scene after another drives this plot. Reminded me of the worst of television. But, oddly, and I have to admit this here, it kept me reading. Aside from the nicely turned phrases and descriptions of the terrain and the action, or perhaps because of this, the book does hold the reader to it. So what if the characters are barely real? The prose is peppy (after the early parts, I must hasten to add) so, in sum, I think I can see why Smith manages to make a living at this stuff. But it doesn't hold a candle to the great pirate literature of the past (am thinking of Sabatini's Captain Blood here, or Stevenson's Treasure Island). On the other hand, the gratuitous sex and mayhem perhaps speaks more to our modern sensibilities. I was a little troubled by the double climax which seemed to throw away a wonderful confrontation between hero and villain at the end . . . after the book had, to all intents and purposes, already come to a crashing and fiery halt. But I guess Smith just figured he had to get that one last duel into the mix. And couldn't forego the earlier climax for it. So what the hey, give 'em two! The reader probably won't know the difference anyway! Three stars for this one, on the basis of a strong and dynamic narrative engine. Nothing more. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This is a reasonably good novel until it degenerates into a &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; story. The author did not seem to know how to end the tale, and continued from one misadventure to another. The author failed to keep all of his characters on the same time line, a problem when an author does not outline things properly. He also disposes of various characters as if he is tired of them, or does not know what to do with them, in order to introduce new characters. Perhaps a few too many dead bodies left by the wayside."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"yuhfhfhdd h fh"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"The flyleaf says this book is &quot;meticulously researched&quot;. Let me tell you, in areas where I happen to have expertise this guy is absolutely clueless. There are several gross examples where he demonstrates conclusively that he has no idea whatsoever how square-rigged ships work. In addition, the details of naval conflicts range from the dubious to the impossible.Given this incredible ignorance about things where I know the score, I am very dubious about a good deal of the other military stuff. In particular, although I am not expert, I think that his versions of how people fight with swords is not reasonable or even in some cases physically possible.His characters are also extremely one-dimensional, and his plotting is pathetic. Gets very predictable after a while.Oh yeah -- although Prester John is a myth, and I suppose one can have some freedom with what one does with a myth -- he transposes it some THREE HUNDRED YEARS. Sort of like meeting Daniel Boone in downtown Chicago having a conversation with Mayor Daley and Jimmy Hoffa -- and being told, &quot;Well, it's his descendant and his family lived in the Kentucky woods for a loooong time without anybody knowing.&quot; Nuts.If you enjoy this kind of book (and I usually do), I suggest you try the series by Terry Goodkind (starting with Wizard's Rule). Similar thematic material, better plots, much more interesting and realistic characters -- and the fantastic stuff like dragons is explicitly labelled as magic. Unlike Hal's ship which is supposed to be a square-rigger but actually has to have turbine-powered props to do what is claimed."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"This book by far surpasses any other book I have read. All the books that I thought had a good story line and were written well don't even compare to this. I'm on the second book, \\"Monsoon\\", and cannot put it down (except for right now)! The characters in the story are so strong and you get to know their personalities so well, that it's as though your sitting on the ship with them and know how they will react to situations. I fell in love with Hal as I got to know him and absolutely LOVE how Smith wrote the series.If the first book in the series you are reading is Birds of Prey (how I started), just keep reading. I hate to admit that it took me quite a while to get into the book, because I've never read pirate/historical books and it was quite boring in the beginning with how much he described the ships. So hang in there! It's definitely well worth it."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Typically I read books about history, biographies, or memoirs. It is not to often I pick up a fiction book. Prior to finding an audio version of \\"Birds of Prey\\", I had no idea what a Swashbuckler story was (I had to look the term up). So basically, right off the bat, this was not the type of book I read and I really had no idea what to expect.While I expected this to be the literary version of a pirate movie, I have to say I found the book surprisingly complex. On one hand, Birds of Prey is a highly entertaining book, telling a story about the days of old. Set in 1667, the book tells the story of a father and son team. The father and his crew are not pirates in the traditional sense, but rather they are mercenaries, fighting for whomever offered them the greatest opportunity to plunder enemy ships to obtain the spoils of war. As the story takes place during a couple of wars, as one would expect, the tale is filled with exciting fight scenes, thrilling chase scenes, suspenseful turns of events, surprisingly steamy adult scenes, and a stereotypical ending where the man gets the woman.However, on the other hand, the story is really about Hal, the son in the father and son team. Much of the tale is centered around him. As much as this is a story about action, blood, and guts, this is also a story about Hal's passage from a meek man who really does not matter to a true leader, leading his man from the clutches of death and to a promise land of riches.I found the narrator, Christopher Cazenove, to be pleasant to listen to. He also made the story really believable, making the listener really feel like they were there.I was surprised to find this story worked on several levels. I found the beginning of the story to be a but confusing and I had a difficult time trying to keep the characters straight. However, once I learned who was who, I found this to be a rather enjoyable story to listen to.If you are looking for a great, classic, action packed, bloody story, than this will fit the bill. It is also a great coming of age story if you look past the violence. Overall, I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"What a fantastic read! I started reading Wilbur Smith about a year ago and have managed to tear through quite a few of his many exciting novels since then. To this point I would say that Birds of Prey is one of the best. It is action packed from beginning to end, and the scope of the story is enormous. The story takes you to a long forgotten time and moves you up and down and all around the southern coast of africa. If you have never read Wilbur Smith before, or are a fan and want a really good Smith book then this is the one! Two thumbs way up!!!"},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"My first experience reading a Wilbur Smith novel was an overwhelmingly positive one. Smith does a first rate job in painting a descriptive verbal landscape of the world in 1667 through the eyes of protagonist Hal Courtney, son of the captain of a royal commissioned English privateering vessel. We get transported from the ocean drenched decks of a battle tested &quot;pirate&quot; ship to depths of a Dutch colonial dungeon in Africa in following the adventures of Hal, his father Sir Francis and his shipmates. Smith spins a tale of comradeship, loyalty and betrayal which had this reader thirsting for revenge against the enemies of the heroes. Of course, all ends relatively well for the &quot;good&quot; guys with enough unfinished business to pave the way for a sequel. I am anxiously looking forward to reading that sequel &quot;Monsoon&quot;."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Having been a sailor in the U.S. Navy I enjoy all stories pertaining to the sea.

It was simply a scenic tour. And I loved it.I will say that it was a bit more of a pirate story than I had expected. Had I known it was really a pirate book, I would have passed. But, I'm glad I didn't.The storyline is great. The characters are extremely well done. The prose is flavorful. And, I can't believe I'm saying this, the action sequences are suspenseful. Yuck, I hate action and battle. But these scenes had me turning pages fast. It's a 600 page book. I'm a very slow reader.

Since then, I have read all 12 of the other Courtney series books starting with Monsoon and in no particular order, including most recently, Assegai. But I left Birds of Prey for last. All were purchased through Amazon.A few days ago, I picked up this book and as usual was immediately drawn into the story... but the paperback was flawed...and I almost cried... but seriously found this hilarious!! This paperback was brand new. It's 664 pages long and when I finished with page 600, POOF!!! the pages went back to page 25 through 56 again.. and then resumed with page 633 leaving out 32 pages... I mean, what the HECK!! So here I sit awaiting the arrival of another... Thank you Mr publisher/printer for the tantalizing treat, but unfortunately, it's not Halloween. Fortunately for me though, Amazon came through (even after my purchase was many months ago) and are sending me a new copy. You can't go wrong with an amazon purchase!! Though, I'm not sure that I can wait the two days, I'm seriously tempted to pull into the public library and see if BOP is on the shelves, which to me is a five star rating on any book."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"What a treat for me. I had never before read a \\"swashbuckling\\" adventure story. Despite not understanding anything about ships and sailing(lots of the language was foreign to me) I was totally engrossed and caught up in the universal themes of strong family and friendship bonds, loyalty, revenge, good vs. evil, etc. To its credit, this book just takes you away.

Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a &quot;true warrior&quot;. The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"The book is based on the interesting premise of naval exploration and combat in Indian Ocean in the aftermath of of the Second Anglo Dutch War. It is a time and place unfamiliar to most of us and rarely a fictional setting.Unfortunately, the writing just isn't up to the task. To call the plot meandering in an understatement. Too many characters are introduced. The characters are cardboard cut outs. The good guys are really good: loyal, virtuous, high minded. The bad guys are unalloyed bad. Smith initially creates a potentially interesting villain, the Earl of Cumbrae (think Harry Mudd from Star Trek), and a multi-dimensional character, the Dutch Colonel Cornelius Schreuder then proceeds to throw them away. Unfortunate, as both were more interesting than Courtney or any of his friends. The existence of an widespread naval order of chivalry is simply out of place at the time. And there are many small details simply wrong. For instance, one pound of black powder will propel about four pounds of lead shot. A musket ball of that era weighed in at a shade over an ounce so the single pound of powder would be good for about 64 rounds. The panic of Courtney's band of refugees when they find themselves reduced to about 50-lbs of powder is inexplicable.Too much time is spent on events that lead nowhere and the last part of the novel, the climax, is rushed through making it an afterthought that you just want to get through rather than the reason you read the novel."},{"Title":"Birds of Prey","review":"Wilbur Smith has written an adventure story of the high seas that surpases even the greatness of C.

In Birds of Prey he tells the story of young Hal Courtney who is learning the craft of sailing from his stern father. His father's hard discipline will turn out well for the lad as he faces treachery, uncharted lands and seas, and a confrontation of cultures. The setting of this novel is around southern Africa. Smith's research into sailing seems quite throrough as well as his attention to the areas around the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century.

The book is about a cavewoman and her (over 100!) cavemen lovers. The premise behind it is that men are still making the same mistakes with women that they made a million years ago. And boy, does this book make it appear to be true! Reputed to have been originally written on clay tablets and now coverted into this book, it's the year-long diary of a lusty cavewoman named Ooba. It chronicles the bawdy adventures of Ooba and an amusing parade of caveman suitors and thoughtless oafs that she both encounters and endures. Though supposedly written a million years ago, I think every \\"modern woman\\" who reads this book will definitely recognize a few similar suitors and like experiences in her own love life. It seems men really haven't changed that much in the last million years! But, hope springs eternal! Admittedly, the book is a little raunchy, as is Ooba, but it's well-written (Ooba was quite pithy) and hysterically funny. I read the entire book in one sitting (and I've re-read parts of it many, many times since then.) I laugh out loud every time. Since it's written in diary form, it's easy to just read a few pages (days) at a time, too. I think Ooba's brazen honesty will have many women secretly wishing we could be a bit more like her. Overall, I think the book offers hilarious, thought-provoking insights and clever, perceptive observations about men, women, sex, and the dating problems experienced by any woman with taste."},{"Title":"Daily Math Practice for Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) -","review":"This is a sound SOL book for 4th graders.

In 1900 a large percentage of the officer corps were from the civil war era and had no interest in further intellectual development, but this changed with an introduction of new junior officers who were educated at Fort Leavanworth, Fort Benning, and the Army War College. These schools encouraged personal intiative in officers and the new study of new technologies such as tanks and airplanes. As a result this new class of officers intellectual interest was the development of the Air Corps and armor in the army.Coffman also writes about how the army was divided along class and racial lines. The families of officers and enlisted men very rarely intermingled with each other, and officer families only married other officer families and not enlisted men. However some enlisted men such as James Gavin rose to become a general. The army was also divided along race with blacks being gradually eased out of frontline service from 1900 to 1940 and the few black officers such as Benjamin Davis were constantly harassed through their time of duty. This is outstanding book about the American army from 1900-1940 and should be read with the books by Brian Linn."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"This a great sequel to Dr. Coffman's &quot;The Old Army.&quot; Through the use of Army records, personal papers, memoirs, biographies, questionnairea, and many interviews, he has told the story of a U.S. Army that evolved as the country developed from an insular nation to a major world power. From 1898 to 1941, the Army changed from a frontier constabulary to a global force. It is a fascinating story told in a lively way that brings to life the participants, both the principals and their families, both the soldiers and their officers. While essentially a social history, underlying it all is the story of the transformation of the Army itself. A fascinating and superbly written book."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"Coffman's book traces the evolution of the US military from a frontier force to becoming a modern, WWII fighting machine. The book is unique because it tells the story with first person accounts and it includes chapters on what it was like to be a soldier and a dependent at various locations during the period.From a transformation standpoint, the chapters on the \\"Managerial Revolution\\" and \\"The War to End all Wars\\" (WWI) are particularly interesting. The last chapter \\"Mobilizing for War\\" tells the story of how the Army was able to take itself from a near-broken, depression-era force to one of the most capable armies in the world able to fight major wars on both sides of the world while equipping other armies.This book is a good complement to Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940, which is a strategic perspective of the Army in the Pacific in the interwar years."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"I'm now in my 60s, and I grew up an Army brat in the 1950s, so much of the social history and attitudes depicted so clearly and engagingly in this engrossing book are familiar to me -- even though the author is speaking about a period a couple of generations earlier. Even though it changed dramatically during the forty years between the end of the War with Spain and the beginning of World War II, the Regular Army still is and always has been a deeply conservative institution. In times of national emergency, millions of civilians may volunteer and be drafted, but when the emergency is over they -- the survivors, anyway -- will take off their uniforms and go back to the civilian world. But the Regulars will still be there, like the rocks that reappear, unmoved, when the tide has flowed out again. During the late 19th century, the Army acted primarily as a frontier constabulary, fighting skirmishes against the Indians and maintaining order in Western communities (and suppressing labor strikes, unfortunately). The coming of war in 1898 brought a flurry of enlistments and applications for commissions, but the war itself didn't last very long. The result, however, was an empire in Cuba and Puerto Rico, and especially in the Philippines, and the Regulars found themselves in the role of an imperial military force, not unlike the British Army in India. There were also several regiments stationed in China as part of the international occupation force that followed the Boxer Rebellion. That period also provided practical experience for such future luminaries as Pershing, McArthur, Marshall, Arnold, and later Patton and Eisenhower -- not unlike the role played by the Mexican War for future Civil War generals. During the few years just before the United States got involved in World War I, the Army underwent a managerial revolution -- and \\"revolution\\" is not too strong a word -- under the leadership of Secretary of War Elihu Root (strongly backed by Theodore Roosevelt), who pushed through a long list of much-needed reforms, especially the formation of a general staff to centralize military planning and coordinating. That was followed by the drastic overhaul of the Military Academy and the establishment of the War College. After 1918, the Army was practically in limbo for more than a decade, with its budget cut, little attention given to technical development, and promotions so glacial many ambitious officers and noncoms resigned in frustration. Under FDR, however, it became clear to most military planners that a new global war was coming and the mobilization that began in the late '30s meant the Regulars were able to be halfway prepared by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.As in his earlier book, The Old Army, to which this is largely a sequel, Coffman gives as much attention to wives and families as he does to the officers and enlisted men themselves, and I have to say it's this that mostly interests me. To be the child of an officer c.1910 meant one or more transpacific voyages (lasting a month each way), and living in the exotic milieu of Manila or Tientsin. In the 1920s, the destination was likely to be Hawaii, which was being developed as the center of U.S. military and naval operations in the Pacific. It was, in many ways, a cloistered life; it was still largely that way overseas in the early '50s, when I lived in occupied Europe. Things were a good deal different for the rank and file, of course, and even more so for non-white soldiers. The end of World War I coincided with a strong upturn in racial bigotry and discrimination, to which Coffman also gives full consideration, comparing it to the somewhat less strained earlier situation in which black officers like Benjamin O. Davis could built a career. Throughout the book, Coffman strews anecdotes and reminiscences from many published sources and from the hundreds of interviews he conducted with those who lived through the period, and there are a great many fascinating photos, mostly of the unposed snapshot variety, which makes them more true-to-life. The \\"all volunteer\\" Army of the 21st century is a very different world. This is a book that anyone with an interest in American military history, or in the U.S. in the 20th century generally, absolutely must read."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"I just finished The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941, by Edward M. Coffman. It is a social history of the Regular Army, starting in 1898 when it was a tiny frontier constabulatory about to take on an imperial role with the Spanish-American War and subsequent occupations, and ending with the massive mobilization immediately prior to WWII. It describes a military that would be barely recognizable to anybody who has served in the American military in the modern era, along many dimensions (in war and peace, in CONUS and overseas, officer and enlisted, servicemen and families, different branches, traditional technologies such as horses vs. the emerging technologies of tanks and airplanes, blacks and whites, etc.).One thing that was striking to me was the many similarities between the campaign against Filipino insurgents at the turn of the century and the campaign against Iraqi insurgents almost exactly a century later.The author believes that the seeds of the victory in WWII were sown in the pre-war Regular Army. I am not sure that I agree. I think that a strong argument can be made that the pre-war Regular Army was a insular, reactionary, complacent organization, that although it had its bright spots it had tremendous amounts of incompetence and mediocrity, and that the strengths of American society were employed to create essentially a new Army starting in 1940.However, I do not have to agree with the author of a book to recommend it. The book is both a brilliant piece of scholarship and extremely well written. The portraits of people and life in the Regular Army of this period are vivid. It is simply one of the best books I have ever read. If the subject interests you, it is a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"Huzzah for Coffman's account of the U.S.Army between Spain and Pearl Harbor. Not only does he trace the organizational evolution of the Army, but he includes many personal accounts of careers in the service to life on posts for the children. It is easy to forget that for forty years American soldiers served in China, the Philippines, and Panama. Coffman also describes the Army educational system at the Command and General Staff School and the War College that developed the leaders of World War II. This account is very comprehensive yet entirely readable."},{"Title":"The Regulars : The American Army, 1898-1941","review":"This book lacks the personal anecdotes from enlisted men that would have made this a successful tome. Even the Volunteers in the Philipines are not covered well."},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","review":"First published in 1939, this novel set in Nigeria (where Cary had served two stints in the British colonial army)reads today as alarmingly un-PC. It wasn't thought so at the time, of course; the 1962 paperback I read has two introductions, one from the editors who call Johnson \\"a rubber-legged thing of surprise and caprice,\\" and one from V.S. Pritchett, who admits that Johnson may be seen as a \\"stock comic African\\" but then says stoutly, \\"Who is more irrational, childish and backward...: the poor hallucinated black clerk Johnson or the emotionally incompetent and obsessed white Commissioner Rudbeck?\\" And of course Pritchett hits the nail squarely on the head, for that is the set-up of Cary's novel, and in Johnson he has created as rich and fascinating a character as Gulley Jimson, from the better-known Horse's Mouth. On the one hand, Johnson is a liar, a thief, a wastrel, childish and thoroughly incompetent at his job as a clerk. On the other, he is gay (in the old sense), imaginative, romantic, energetic, persuasive, a natural leader, and a wonderful poet or song-maker. Cary has included the full text of a number of songs, and I would love to hear them sung.The setting is the the colonial office in a remote small town in Nigeria, where Rudbeck represents the rule of British law, with the occasional aid of a corrupt Emir and his Waziri. Johnson is his clerk, and at the start of the novel he has just fallen for a local girl, whom he proposes to buy from her father with money he doesn't have. How he manages this scam and a string of others, while throwing parties every three or four nights, details the \\"rise\\" arc of the novel, to be followed inevitably by the fall. The structure is impeccable. (It is said to have been Cary's favorite novel.) The ending is beautifully crafted.In short, this is a good book and at times very funny. I'm leaving a star off as a concession to the delicate sensibilities of those who won't be able to get beyond Cary's whiteness and Johnson's blackness. But they might try to relax a little--Johnson is good company.p.s. to editor: please spell the author's name correctly, here and elsewhere,"},{"Title":"Mister Johnson","review":"I bought this book about a week before I had to leave the city.

The format the book is written in fits my study habits well. The contents of this book don't just offer facts but applications for use of those facts in the field of work.

I really like this and think that is helpful for people to understand the basic management principles and theroies. One thing that i have find very usefully in this boook is the exhibits. The exhibits have helped me understand more clearly different concepts that I would not of understood with out them. I also like the testing page that are found at the end of the chapters. They are a really big help in making sure I understand the main concepts that were covered in that certain chapter.I do plan on keeping this book after I have finished my class at the end of this semester. I will think that it will be an excellent source for me to use when I have started teaching."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I gave this book a five out of five, because it is very useful for the engagements of management. This is also the first management book that I have read so I don't have much to compare it to. I have found it very useful for studying. My favorite part about the book is that it has the vocabulary words highlighted to the side with the definitions under them."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I used this textbook for a Business Management course offeredat HLG. My overall impression of this book is very good. The book iswritten in fairly good size print for those of us who despise readinglittle words. The cover of the book was very colorful and appealingto me as well. One of the most useful features of this book was thedefinitions located on the side of each page. These definitions camein quite handy when studying for tests and taking notes. I also foundthe small clips on the majority of the pages that related what we werereading to everyday life very interesting. I found these clips to behelpful because they helped me visualize the concepts discussed withinthat chapter in everyday society. The least helpful part of the textfor me was the stories that were at the beginning of every chapter. Ifelt as though these stories were too long and wordy for this book. Ialso felt that these were quite repetitious considering the smallerstories on most of the pages ... I cannot recommend any changes tothis book because honestly I feel as though it is one of the bestbooks I have ever used. The illustrations and the graphics within thebook are great. I believe the book has helped me learn thatmanagement is everywhere. In the work force of today, there is no wayto avoid management. The text also helped me to understand what it isthat I need to do in order to be an effective manager someday. Iparticularly liked th first chapter. I felt as though it set up agood introductory for the rest of the book. The exhibits in chapterone for example, were very explanatory as well as many othersthroughout the text. I also found the &quot;Testing YourComprehension&quot; sections of the book to be very helpful whenstudying for tests."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"The Fundamentals of Management book has helped me in many ways. The exhibits and charts in this book are great. They enable the learner(me) to understand processes easier. The book taught me that management is a part of our lives everyday, whether we know it or not. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a management class."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I used this book for a course entitled Business Management. In general, I enjoyed evaluating, discussing, and examining this book. The most useful features are the definitions and examples offered on effective business management. I found the summary definitions to the side of each paragraph extremely helpful when studying for a test. The one thing that I found least helpful and most difficult to comprehend were the green boxes at the end of each section. I do not plan to keep this book, because over the course of my studies I have outlined what I think is valuable information. I have no suggestions on how to improve in this book, because I feel it was written with language that the common person can easily comprehend. It was written with such a style that even high school students could benefit from. All of the difficult concepts were explained well and adequate examples were offered for each problem. The illustrations were different in style and successful in capturing the readers attention. This text is much more detailed and up to date than the books I am using in other courses. I do not think that this book has influenced my career choice. However, I did enjoy reading about the techniques and tips offered on how to be an effective and efficient manager of buisness. I especially appreciated the drawings and demonstrations offered for example, the exhibit 5-2, on the decision-making process. However, I did not like exhibit 4-9, on the break-even analysis. I felt that the graph was rather confusing and not to the point at all."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This book is a useful tool for any person, student or other. It is easy to read, and the charts make learning easy and enjoyable. By adding the definations onto the side of the pages, the auhtors saved their readers from frustration. For me, the quizes turned what could have been a plain old text book into a way to discover who the reader is through learning. Studying was made easier by the objectives being answered in the back of the chapter; and I knew that i was ready for a test after I took the useful chapter test. I plan to keep this book because it is a very useful tool that will help me through out my career, and I know that there is concepts that i over looked and would like to learn more about. The only changes that i would suggest for this book would be to put the quizes together in the back, when i was reading or studying for a test the quizes would get into my way. Then when i would take the quizes, i had to go back and forthe trying to find them all. Also I found the &quot;Details on a Managemnet Classic&quot; (eg. chapter 5 page 141) and &quot;Managers Who Made A Difference&quot; to be very interrupting, and unuseful. I would recomand this book to be in all classrooms, in or out of college."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for.

De Cenzo was well done. Aside from the dry subject matter this book was a fine product to learn the fundamentals of management by. The chapters were well organized into the various patterns dealing with the five different parts of management. Example in each chapter were very helpful as a supplement to the regular reading. The format of each chapter lent itself well to the taking of notes and seemed to be set up good to teach from. To test the knowledge gained as the reader moved through each chapter there were quizzes provided at the end of each chapter. The quizzes were an excellent gauge as to what was needed to be studied for the test. All in all, there were many helpful points and very few drawbacks. I recommend this book"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I feel that this book was well written and had many good points in it. The terms in the margins of the book were nice and the chapter tests at the end of each chapter were very heplful. In as far as this class was required for me and this was the chosen text it was a good asset for keeping up with the class work.

I received no code; therefor I would have to pay $80 to purchase one."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I have been studying this textbook all semester for a college course called Principles of Business Management. When I first looked at the book I found it eye catching. They made the book look like fun. I also became interested to learn what was in the book after reading the table of contents. My favorite section has probably been the chapters on leadership. I am very impressed that the authors put so much into this section of the book. They recognize that it is the most important part of management and I agree. We can learn all we want about how to manage but if no one follows our leadership then it is worthless knowledge. I cannot justly say how this book could be improved based on the information it provides. I haven't experienced being in a management position yet so I cannot discern what facts are useful or not. I found the book easy to understand and up to date. It was honestly one of my favorite books that I've used in a course so far."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This was a good textbook. What I exceptionally liked was the quizzes at the end of the chapters and the summaries they really helped with studying. So many books put absolutely nothing in the summaries. Sometimes the book was a little hard to understand some of the business terms did not get explained very well, probably because the authors assumed it was already known. However, this was my first business class so I had to read it a few times more than necessary. All in all one of the better books of mine this semester."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This book was very detailed in giving information. It covered quite a few areas of management. Sometimes with the wording used and the context it sometimes took me at least 2 or 3 times reading it before I fully understood what was being said. However this was the first business class I have ever taken and my limited knowledge probably had something to do with that. All in all it was a fair book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"Here is another review for another one of my classes, Principles of Business Management. The book is a lot easier to follow than the book I recently reviewed; &quot;Marketing: Connecting with Customers.&quot; In addition to more fluent material, the end of each chapter has questions to help prepare the student for exams, whereas the marketing book does not. Another pro to the book is that the material covered is up-to-date, accurate, and very useful in today's management situations. 20 years ago, you couldn't really sit down and read/study a book to become a better manager, whereas today it is made possible to do so. Figures, charts, graphs, and examples are also very useful and helpful in studying for exams. Cons about the book is that a few activities or interactive CD-ROM would have made the material more enjoyable to learn about. Overall rating, 4 stars."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"Starting out this book was very interesting but it lacks in some understanding of the definitions. I liked the whold idea about the definitions being at the side of the pages. I wish there were a short summary at the end of the chapters though. Also there were a couple of places in the chpt. that was written unclear or maybe just hard to understand. A lot of the charts and graphics used in this text book was very helpful in understanding what i couldn't understand in the text. I would say this text is easier to understand than most of my other classes though. I esspecially thought the leadership chapter was very interesting and very enjoyable to read. I believe overall this was a great textbook but all textbooks have thier problems but fortunally this one didn't have many!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I have found this book to be easy to read and follow. The illistrations and charts really helped me clear up certain concepts the literature did not. The self-tests at the end of the chapters reassured me that I got out of the chapter exactly what I was suppose to. The feature that I seemed to skip over was the &quot;Managers Who Make a Difference&quot; sections, I am sure that this is my loss. I do not plan on selling this book back so possibly one of these days I will have time to go back and read them. I am sure they give lots of advice to situations that I will more than likely face in the business world. The only downfall I found with this book was that in some places it seemed to skip around a little. It began one topic went to another then went back to the first. However, with the illustrations and the summaries II usually figured it out. Over all, I rate this text as a all around good source of learning management. I feel I have learned many valuable leasons that I will take with me and hopefully put to use successfully not only in the business world but with a family as well."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I really like this book, the way it is set up, the way it looks, and the way it is presented. The most useful part of the book was at the end of the chapters was a through chapter test. If every book I had was set up this way I think I would do very well in my classes. Each chapter was well explained and the illustrations and graphics were very good and learning oriented."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This book was not too bad. The material was presented in an easy to follow manner and the graphs were at times helpful, but not always. Though the information was all relevant and effective, it did little to keep my attention. It still felt like a reading assigment every time I opened it and it often took multiple sittings just to finish one chapter. I can't rate the book too low, however. The authors tried to make the subject interesting and relevant, but it didn't necessarily work for me. Butit was effective and it did give me a better understanding for how managers today use the concepts discovered by those of the past to better direct their respective employees."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"Fundamentals of Management is an excellent textbook. I purchased this book because it was the chosen textbook for the college course Principles of Business Management. It is written very well and the information is portrayed in a way that is easy to understand. The chapter summaries are very helpful, as are the questions at the end of each chapter. I really like that the important definitions are located in the margins. This is very helpful when preparing for a test. For the most part, the exhibits included in the chapters are very helpful. The interview and resume tips in Appendix B are very good and will help me not only in my management class but throughout my life as well. This textbook has been very helpful to me, and I would definitely recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This book has many good qualities. It has colorful, graphic, detailed chapters. This helps the reader to understand the contents. All the learning objectives are outlines at the beginning of each chapter. This helps enhance the material that the reader should comprehend in the chapter. The material is easy to understand, because of the way it is displayed. The personal experiences are great illustrations of the contents that each chapter contains. The self tests help the reader find their strengths and weaknesses in their personalities. I would recommend this book as a good freshman or sophomore college level book. I am in my senior year of college and this class is just a review or retrospect of the material that I have already had."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I bought Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. De Cenzo for a class I am taking at college. At first I thought I wouldn't even read it, except to study for tests. I did end up reading the book,and for a book I thought would be pretty boring, it ended up being very interesting. I thought the most useful features of the book were the words written out to the side with their defenitions. They proved essential for quick references, especially when you are trying to take notes and listen at the same time. I also really benefited form the grpahs and charts that are through out the book. They explain some of the concepts better, than those that are written out in the text. There are also a lot of other useful assesment tests and little articles throughout the book. I was able to apply the article about how to hold successful meetings to my job. We have a lot of mettings, and sometimes we feel like we do not get anything done. I shared the information in my book about meeitngs with one of my managers and she picked up some new tips and information on how to hold successful meetings. The book was very understandable to read and the conceptes were clear. Some of the more difficult concepts to understand were explained well in either the text or the graphs. So if you did not totally understand one, you could look to the other for reference."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I feel that the textbook, Fundamentals of Management by Stephen P. Robbins, is a good tool for the beginning management student. Throughout the course, I learned many different approaches to becoming a successful manager. The book made use of illustrating it's points by using graphs, charts, and tables. This is important for the students who are having a hard time understanding what the author is trying to say. The author made it very easy to understand his teachings. However, I believe that there are two sides to management. These are the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;ethical&quot; and &quot;unethical&quot; sides. The book touches briefly on the unethical side and the side is just as important. It's hard for someone to succeed at something if they do not understand the different aspects. This is my only complaint. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to chase a career in business. I know I plan on keeping this book for future reference."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"The text Fundamentals of Management Essential Concepts and Applications, written by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. DeCenzo was used in my Principles of Business Management course, taught by Dr. John Schafer at Hannibal-LaGrange College. The text was well written and provided real life examples and situations that made the text applicable in my life. My favortie features of this text include the CD-ROM which aided me in other class projects for the course and the quizzes at the end of each chapter which asked realistic questions of what the chapter was based upon. I probably will not keep the text at the end of this course because I am an Accounting/Business Administration double major, and I do not plan on holding a manager job for my career. One suggestion I have for the authors of this text is to make the chapters a little shorter because sometimes the material presented in drawn out, lengthy manner. The charts and graphs helped present the concepts and explain them thoroughly no matter how difficult the subject matter. This text definitely explains things in a much simpler manner than many of my other texts for other classes.

Robbins and David A. De Cezno. I have found this book surprisingly interesting and enjoyable considering that I bought it for a college course. In fact, it has actually confirmed my desire to work in management after college. Throughout the book there are quizzes for self-assessment and tips for learning skills such as listening and planning good meetings. These quizzes and tips are helpful insight into the business world. Another part of the book that I enjoy is the short stories at the beginning of each chapter. They are a good representation of people in the business world. I like to read them to find out not just about the companies, but also how the companies were started. The charts and tables in the book are also very easy to understand. If I don't understand something in the reading, the charts can usually explain the same concept in easier terms. The authors also made learning easier by placing the vocabulary terms in the margins of the pages. This placement is much easier than some books that only have glossaries that you have to flip to the back of your book to find a word in. This book has definitely been helpful in my class. I even plan on keeping it after the class is over!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"The name of this book is Principles of Business management. The book in itself was not bad at all. The most useful part of the book to me was the glossary and index. I am considering keeping this book after I'm done because it goes with my major but maybe not if I end up needing the money. The words were easy enough to understand, just some of the concepts were kind of hard. My book has excellent pictures and grpahics in it. My favorite part of the book wasn't the book itself, but the CD rom that came with it. I have a minor in computers, so that made it even more fun and I enjoy those kinds of personal analysis tests."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"The book cover had been chewed on/off by an animal, but all the text was there and usable.

Be forewarned that even the condensation from a glass of ice water, transferred by your hand to the page, can cause a paragraph of text to run easily. The binding is also not well constructed. I would have preferred an electronic edition of this book due to the sheerly poor nature of its print quality. As for the text itself, it is often contradictory and perpetuates myths that have long been debunked in the business world. In one of my favorite examples, the book praises organizational planning and rigid structure, referring to systems that sound like communist five year plans; the book then proceeds to upend its argument by touting that Steve Jobs and Apple Computer have been successful not just in spite of organization structure but rather because they have turned the old concepts upside-down. Some would say this simply shows the book being fair and balanced. Unfortunately, many times it simply comes off somewhere between pedantic and silly."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I used this book in my business class. I found a few chapter's completely uninformative and rather boring. One such chapter was on communication and the other was on motivation. Either of which, if you have basic common sense is more helpful then the textbook.The book is also very contradictory in its writing and examples. It seemed to me the author's had an agenda which was to push the business practices and ideas they deem the best, then bash the rest in a sneaky backhanded way. Then later on in the same chapter compliment the other side, as a means to try to make it balanced.I would never use this book for personal exploration or knowledge not worth it."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I found Fundamentals of Management to be a very well organized and informative learning tool. The chapters start simply and build upon one another in a manner that facilitates retention-(in order to learn from one chapter you must have understood the previous one.) This book develops a solid management base that will enable a student to succeed in the rest of their managerial education. Each chapter is prefaced with a prevalant example of a current managerial situation that ties directly to the chapter's content. These real life examples help to encorporate what the student learns with how it applies to today. The combination of these examples and the diagrams and pictures that are distributed throughout the chapters, present an easy to understand and current depiction of management. The sectioning of the chapters and the questions at the end of each chapter help the student to organize the important information in their own mind. These questions emphasize the important points and give students a place to begin when it's time to study. This form of presentation is very student friendly and will definitely enhance their learning experience"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I used this book in my Fundamentals of Management course at Harlaxton College. Of the two textbooks used for this class, I thought this one was much more useful. My favorite aspects were the definitions in the margins, the quizzes at the end of each chapter and the various exhibits throughout the chapters. I felt these learning tools made taking notes easier, let me see what exactly I did and did not know about the material and helped me better understand some of the more difficult concepts being taught. I also enjoyed the short &quot;real world&quot; managerial examples at the beginning of each chapter.

Another quality that I have learned through this book is how to not only delegate responsibility but also how to make problem solving teams.

It was written in a way that I could understand and learn from. The quizzes at the end of the chapters were useful as well. They helped me to know what I should have learned and what I still needed to study.

Also, the current business situations, which are given to supplement the reading on various pages, helped to understand real world management applications.

Overall, I feel this book will help me in the long run in any career field I may choose to enter, not just management."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I found Fundaments of Management to be very informative and accurate to the business world. I am currently employeed in a management position, and the information from this book has been beneficial to my job.

Needs improvement but is overall fairly done."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"My name is Jeff Heeley and I'm a soph. at Hannibal-LaGrange college in Hannibal, MO. I have been currently studying with this text throughout the current fall semester in Principals of Business Management. I have rather enjoyed this text and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Management, they could not only benefit from this book, but could also have a good time while doing so. The book is filled with tid-bits of knowledge that will help you in your excusion in Management. The author did a wonderful job explaining the material in a way that is easy and helpful. I would rate this book higher than others that I'm currently using in other related courses. I don't really think that this book has enfluenced my career choice, but it has been helpful none the less. Even if your not planning on being a manager, you could benefit from this book, in that everyone needs to know how to think like a manager, or how your manager is thinking."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I really have enjoyed this book. It has helped me to see things from the employees point of view. The chapters on leading have been pretty cool. It lets you see that you don't have to be a jerk and a dictator, just a manager. This is probably the only book that I will keep after the semester is over, because it will be great to review all that I've gotten out of it so far."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"Fundamentals of Management 2nd ed. by Robbins and De Cenzo was the text use for my Management course at Hannibal-LaGrange College. While using this book, I noticed that it had many definitions in the side margins. They were helpful to me to better understand and comprehend the material I was reading. The many exhibits through out the book made the material applicable to the business world. The exhibits helped me to learn visually. To test my comprehension, the text had helpful \\"Testing Your Comprehension\\" Quizzes at the end of each chapter. I found these helpful after taking in a lot of material, I was able to sort everything out and refresh the newly learned material. Though this book's good out weigh the bad, I would like to have seen the text and the corresponding exhibit on the same page, so that page flipping would not take place. Page flipping can cause the reader to lose interest and even concentration. My only other complaint was that it is in serious need of a face-lift, something that would attract the eye. The books overall appearance has the ability to make the reader want to read it more. Some suggestions would be to put a photograph on the front, use computer graphics in the book, and hardback to be more durable and more presentable. When writing this book, I believe that the authors did a wonderful job of making the difficult to understand material, easy for people to read and learn from it. Many different majors were in the class that I took and I do believe that each took with a better understanding of Management and how Managers function in the business world. In comparison to other books that I have used in other courses, I think that the material inside was excellent, but as I mentioned before, I think that it could use a face-lift. After studying the material that was inside the book, I believe that I will keep this book. The reason being, is that I think that once I get out into the work place, I will need to know how to work with others and how others work best together. This book has encouraged me to keep pursuing my career as an accountant. In my future profession, I assume that I will placed in a management position. I will be a \\"boss\\"/manager and have to know how to motivate my employees, make sure that the task is completed in an effective and efficient way and all the while encourage my employees to be innovative in the work place."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"This book is pretty useful. It displays the terms really well. It sometimes gets confusing though. I plan to sell this book back when I am done with it. The concepts in it were pretty easy to understand.

It has not really influenced my career choice, cause I knew what I wanted to do before I took this course. There were not any special chapters."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Management: Essential Concepts and Applications","review":"I enrolled in the class Principles of Management at HLG, and the book Fundamentals of Management was the book used. My overall reaction of the book is exceptionally high. I really enjoyed reading the chapter because they were put into terms that I could read and understand. I really liked that the definitions were in the margins as well as throughout the reading. The thing that I liked the most was the review at the end of every chapter. The review helped me see if I understood the content of the chapters. The graphics within the chapters also helped to demonstrate the concepts that the book was trying to illustrate. After the class I plan to keep the book because it will be a good reference in the future. This book has helped me understand management a lot better.

Of the two textbooks used for this course, I thought this one was much more useful. My favorite aspects were the definitions in the margins, the many exhibits (which included various charts and graphs) and the quizzes at the end of each chapter. These learning tools helped in note taking, better understanding of more difficult concepts and knowing what exactly I did and did not know.

The author attempts to teach the reader what is most important in the management field and doesn't talk about anything that isn't relevant to the topic. It is straight to the point and easy to read.

It has colorful, graphic, detailed chapters. This helps the reader to understand the contents. All the learning objectives are outlines at the beginning of each chapter. This helps enhance the material that the reader should comprehend in the chapter. The material is easy to understand, because of the way it is displayed. The personal experiences are great illustrations of the contents that each chapter contains. The self tests help the reader find their strengths and weaknesses in their personalities.

It also tells you if you do not want your employees to keep calling in sick all of the time, you can try and set up a way for them to work out (staying strong and fit) during their free time or lunch time.

When I first purchased the book, I thought that it would be nothing more than a supplemental material that would rarely be used for the class. As the class progressed, I found the features that the book used in presenting the material very helpful in understanding the concepts being taught in the class. The book's biggest strengths are in the way it presents the material and features that apply the material. For example, the book contains visual representations such as graphs, pictures and charts, and easy references in the side margins of the text such as definitions that highlight the main point. The feature that I found the most useful it the Testing Your Comprehension at the end of each chapter. Basically it's a multiple choice quiz that test your comprehension of the material presented in the chapter.

Walker's Instinct series, I was eager to get my hands in his latest Jessica Coran story. It was worth the wait, because Walker's novel made my skin want to slide from my bones.The killer in Absolute Instinct exhibits his evil nature at the ripe age of seven when his mother catches him sucking the marrow of her dead cat's spine. That scene actually made my blood boil, and I said a curse out loud.Not to become political in a book review, but I immediately thought of research that shows most serial killers start by killing or torturing animals. I nearly stopped reading in order to write my Congressman a letter pleading for stricter animal cruelty laws. However, I was hooked into finishing this book in hopes that Walker's character, Jessica Coran, would track down this demon child (as the adult he becomes, of course).In a twist of cruel reality, the child became a man, and that man is obsessed with the human spine. He is tracking his victims and actually removing the spine while the victim is alive. Of course, he doesn't want to be wasteful, and it seems that he is turning the spines into grotesque artwork.If you have ever wondered if serial killers are born or created from the environment, Walker offers the idea that they are born. The killer is driven and haunted by not knowing who his father is. His mother tormented with tales of his father being a monster, and he is accused of being just like him until the day she dies.On her death bed, she gives her son a box that contains all the information that explains who the spine sucker is the spawn of. The killer does not open it for most of the story, but when he does long time readers and newcomers alike will be in for a big surprise.At the same time that the reader is following the killer through his tribulations, we are with Jessica Coran as she works to figure these bizarre murders. One problem is that they are happening across the country, and one state has already convicted someone for the crime. Coran finds herself in a race to not only catch a killer, but to save an innocent man.It is a fast-paced, well-written, and extremely creepy mystery suspense novel. The kind of book that I Absolutely love.GRADE: A+Eric M.Croas"},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"If you like spine chilling type books then Absolute Instinct will have you on the edge of your chair. A man sits on death row for a crime he may or may not have commited, the only thing that might set him free is a missing spine, is there a connection? They claim he kills women and takes their spine, but if he's the killer why is there another woman dead and her body missing a spine, can this be a mirror crime? or is the real killer still out there. Time is running out on death row, how many more deaths will take place before they decide if they have two killers or just one and the wrong man will die for the crimes he did not commit. The book is a real spine chiller- Larry Hobson-Author-The Day Of The Rose"},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"Laura Graham caught her seven-year-old son Giles drinking the fluid and eating the marrow of her beloved cat's spinal column. When he reached adulthood he graduated to dining on the spine of humans while they were still conscious and after drinking the fluid and eating the marrow he made the spine a part of his sculpture. In Portland Oregon, a black man was found guilty of killing his white wife and hiding her spinal column. FBI agent Darwin Williams doesn't believe that the man sitting on death row, Robert Towne is guilty.When Giles takes the spine from a woman in Milwaukee, the M.O. is the same as two other homicides including the one in Oregon. Darwin calls on Dr. Jessica Coran to prove that all these crimes were performed by the same man so an innocent person can be released from prison. When Jessica is finally convinced by the evidence, she talks to the governor for a stay of execution but the racist governor insists he needs more proof. Jessica has Darwin and the death row inmate devise a daring plan to free the prisoner while she offers herself up in a cat and mouse game with Giles who wants to make her his next victim.This action packed thriller starts off at light speed and only gets faster but the heart of ABSOLUTE TERROR lies with the characters each in their own way going extraordinary lengths to find a way to free a man three days from his date with the needle. Jessica is her usually feisty self, taking daring chances to save an innocent man she does not know. Robert W. Walker is at his absolute best with ABSOLUTE INSTINCTS.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"The best forensic series I know of, and this the 11th in the series is absolutely right on. Mr. Walker was among the first to create this genre, working in it before Silence of the Lambs. I am thrilled to learn he's starting a new series with City for Ransom. His writing terrifies and fascinates at once. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"This latest addtion of the \\"Instinct\\" series finds forensic diva Jessica Coran on the trail of a disturbed serial killer who leaves his victims without their spinal cords but with a lovely charcoal drawing. Paired with a handsome, black FBI agent, Jessica becomes invovled in a a last ditch attempt to free a man from death row.Unfortunately, this is one painful read. The dialogue is stilted and the FBI characters are so grossly unprofessional it counfounds belief. The governor is a stereotypical, racially insensitive, politically incorect, sexually aggressive pig. The confrontations with him quickly devolve into insults that ultimately have no consequence. The silly subplot about freeing the innocent man on death row quickly falls into the realm of the ridiculous.On the plus side, the victims are engaging and the serial killer is fairly well crafted and a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill slice and dicer. But all in all, Absolute Instinct stinks."},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"This started out well but laborious repetition made it impossible to finish and Although i NEVER normally give up on books I packed this one in.

When a character is reading a book intently, she is \\"pouring\\" over the book; perhaps the author meant \\"poring\\". When a character finds another's conduct bad, the first character is \\"enamored\\"; perhaps the author meant \\"not enamored\\". When a character finds something interesting, he is \\"peaked\\"; perhaps the author meant interest was \\"piqued\\". I could go on and on, but these are just a few example of lazy writing.If the plot and dialog weren't so stilted, I could forgive minor errors, but I was stuck with this novel on an airplane.By the way, the author in his \\"Acknowledgments\\" spends most of his words on himself, even describing himself as the \\"undisputed king of series fiction\\" and denies drinking vodka while writing this book. I kid you not.Finally, the initial reviewer has a few errors in her comments. The first character mentioned was not Laura Graham, but Larina Gahram.

I wish I had gone with the preview because I would have read no further than that.

During several action areas, the action would begin but then we got a long interlude of the minds of the characters being probed and uninteresting other things, before the action resumed. It became frustrating!However, I liked the general thread of it and took to the heroine, Jessica, and also her English boyfriend on whom Jessica leaned rathere heavily at times.

Horror, mystery or thriller take your pick as it works well in any of the listed genre."},{"Title":"Absolute Instinct (Jessica Coran Novels)","review":"This book blew me away from the first sentence to the last. I can only tell you that it is for smart readers, readers who love a surprise at every turn and action on every page. Walker's way of writing is absolutely visual and clean, yet literary at the same time. Every sentence is crisp and clear, and he never confuses you or loses you; it is as if he reaches out from behind the book, takes you by the hand and guides you through, and at the roughest, scariest moments, he's still got hold of your hand...or is it your mind. This book literally snatched me up from the get-go and never let me go or let me down as in so many books when you have figured out everything half-way through and the rest becomes a stupid soap opera filled with drama better saved for your moma. I am on to Walker's new series now and it is amazing that one who writes so well about current law enforcement and evil so deliciously can do the same in another entirely different time period. What Walker does with researched subjects is to make them compelling whether is is forensics or the streets of Chicago in 1893 or phrenology. Love this author, love this book. It's another keeper that will not see the inside of a used bookstore for sure."},{"Title":"Corvettes (High Performance)","review":"This book would be good for people who want to know more about the history of corvettes. I would suggest this book to people who collect cars and want to make that collection bigger. My favorite corvette is the 1963 Stingray. I like it because of the rareness of the car. I also like it because of the split rear window and the spine running down the center of the roof. This book was all about the history of the corvette from start to now. They talked about the different types of corvettes and the rareness of some of them. The most expensive corvette was the 1963 stingray. It is the most expensive because of the split rear window, the spine, and they only made around 1000 of them. My dad has a 1968 camero that I help work on at home. I really like old cars and I like to ride in them as much as possible."},{"Title":"The Watchtower Files: Dialogue With a Jehovah's Witness","review":"One of the toughest things to do when in dialogue with a Jehovah's Witness is to document your claims. For example, it does very little good to attempt to argue against the false prophecies of 1914 and 1975 without actual documentation. Even if you have the quotes, the JW might think that you somehow took them out of context. This is why Art Barrett's book is so valuable. He provides actual photocopies for the JW to see the errors for himself.One of the problems many of us have in witnessing to JW's is to get them to think for themselves. With the Watchtower as their authority (they won't admit this, of course), they will most likely not be persuaded by biblical arguments. That is why many have such difficulties. But if you can demonstrate that the Watchtower is unreliable, then you can actually engage the JW in a two way conversation and allow them to think things through without the WT.Even though this documentation is available in this book, it must be handled with discernment. Attempting to argue against the false prophecies on your first meeting with a particular JW might just ruin an opportunity for a second meeting. Remember, the JW's aren't interested in people who are just out to disprove the WT. They want people who are seeking answers. That is why a relationship should first be built with the JW. And when they find that they can trust you as a genuine person, then you can lovingly and firmly expose the WT errors.Over all, this is an extremely valuable book. Not only does it provide documentation, but it is written in a dialogue format between a JW and a Christian. This allows the reader to see both sides and be prepared for many of the rebuttals that a JW might offer in a conversation. The material is very easy to read and will provide the beginning apologist to have a good foundational grasp on the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses.

This was first published in Astounding Science Fiction from February through April of 1943. It was first published in book form in 1947, and was revised in 1952. It was also published under the name 'One Against Eternity' in 1955.In the Isher series, there are two organizations who are vying for power on Earth. There is The Imperial Isher Dynasty, which is the governmental force on Earth. Although the only governmental force, it has been unable to squash the technologically superior Weapon Shops, who provide the citizens with powerful weapons which can only be used in self-defense. The main character of this story is Robert Hedrock, who appears to be working for both sides, or at least playing them off against each other. The recent development of an interstellar drive has both powers trying to get control of the new technology. Robert Hedrock is trying to gain control of the interstellar drive himself to maintain the balance of power. It would be difficult to discuss this book any further without spoiling the story.In 1952, this novel was ranked 26th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. The prior Isher stories include: 'The Seesaw' (July 1941) and 'The Weapon Shop' (December 1942), both of which were shorter fiction.

As many old timers assert, it isn't that much fun to outlive everyone you know.What was fascinating about this piece was van Vogt's attempt to portray an immortal human. Here was a character who had access to centuries of scientific invention. Since he was the only immortal, he took it upon himself to decide if and when these inventions should be released to benefit mankind. This is a god-like chore. Who would want this responsibility?

This book is a thouroughly facinating read, and the relaxed manner in which these stories are told, makes the D-Day experience come to life. However, Drez does not go far enough. Although he starts off by giving accounts of how and why soldiers joined up to fight, he does not follow up by revealing how their post D-Day experiences fared. There are a handful of old pictures of some of the soldiers discussed but there are no new photos. There is no mention of how these guys got home, what they did after the war, and where they are now. There are even a few pictures of soldiers who are not at all mentioned. Drez includes one personal account of a French girl who came out on to the beach to help with the wounded. He mentions at the end of her segment that she ended up marrying an English soldier, but he neglects to explain how they kept in touch during the war, when they got married, or where and how they lived. It is (I assume) quite unusual for two people to met, and eventually marry, right in the middle of history's largest invasion. What a story! Yet Drez doesn't tell you the whole story; no details. He doesn't even include a picture of the couple. This book is an excellent companion as a follow up to the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, but it does not go beyond that point. I would like to know more about the lives of the men who fought and died for freedom and democracy.

Yet, the will of the men was to persevere, and on they came.The accounts take us back to that fatefull time and allows the reader to see into the horrors of war.

Instead, this is a series of interviews collected in connection with a decade-long project by personnel of the Eisenhower Center of the University of New Orleans. In addition to selecting and editing, Ronald Drez actually collected many of these interviews himself. The result is a skillfully pieced together vision of D-Day utilizing the authentic voices of the men who were there, who witnessed first hand the carnage and success of the largest amphibious invasion in history. These are the words of men who lived through the night jumps, the hellish push from the sea to the coast, the inch-by-inch clawing up the sand flats and cliffs of the Overlord beaches to hookup with the airborne troops already inland. The voices are French, German, British, Canadian and American. From 1st Sergeant Len Lomell on Pointe du Hoc with the 2nd Rangers, to Frank Simeone of C co. of the 116th on Omaha making his way up the Vierville draw, to my friend and neighbor, Ken Russell, of the 82nd Airborne hanging from his chute on the church at Ste. Mere Eglise before taking out a German AA truck, these are words chosen by the fighting men themselves. Contained in their words are the voices of the dead, voices felt and heard only with the heart and who perhaps speak loudest of all. And they speak to us of the price of freedom they and their comrades were willing to pay for us.Published on the fifty-year anniversary of D-Day it is a fitting tribute to the gallant men of that generation who lived and died that day and is a fine companion piece for Ambrose's excellent \\"D-Day\\"."},{"Title":"Voices of D-Day: The Story of the Allied Invasion Told by Those Who Were There (Eisenhower Center Studies on War and Peace)","review":"As a World War II history buff, my interest mainly falls in the category of personal experiences.

It also deals with some great American statesman who didn't become president. This was a time in history that America began to emerge as a legitimate world power. The building of the navy and development of modern Naval war tactics under Alfred Mahan is greatly discussed.In my study of American history three more names kept coming up regularly in this period: Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay and Elihu Root.

Yet they have shown expansionist tendencies since colonial days.\\" (Zimmermann, 17) So begins chapter 1 of First Great Triumph, Warren Zimmermann's book chronicling the rise of America to world power status and the five men that he credits with that accomplishment. Zimmermann's book states emphatically that contrary to popular belief, America has been an imperialist state since the beginning. Zimmermann seeks to show that not only did the United States seek to create an overseas empire; we did so enthusiastically, rather than reluctantly.In his book, Zimmermann acknowledges that in many ways the tide of history was pulling America toward the role of imperial power. The American frontier had closed, the Indian wars were over and now the American expansionist impulse needed a new direction the once powerful Spanish empire entered the final period of its inevitable decline. Many influential Americans argued that the expansionist impulse was by definition, a violation of the basic American principles of freedom, and self-determination. Such was not the case with the five heroes men detailed in Zimmermann's book.Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Elihu Root and John Hay, were all imperialists. In part one of his book, Zimmermann provides biographical sketches that, while brief, give full accounting of each of these men and how each became a driving force in the growth of American foreign policy at that most critical point in history.Zimmermann draws from over 190 sources, many the works of prominent American historians. He also draws heavily from the words, both written and spoken, of his five central figures. Zimmermann's own experience as a diplomat give him a keen understanding of the relevant geopolitical questions and his qualities as a writer provide the reader with a very engaging account of these men and their times.Zimmerman's narrative provides a clear path for the reader to follow to understanding his central theme. The biographies contained in the first part of the book, use the words and actions of the central characters to prove his point. From their early lives, each of the five seems destined to play some role in the growth of the American nation. The way that Zimmerman weaves their stories together, illustrates the fact that in reality, very little of the American rise to global power was accidental."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"This book is a must for any history teacher. I disagree with a couple of the author's assertions, but it is a great read and clearly outlines how we became the world power we are today. It also dispels some of the arguments that expansion was motivated mostly by racism. Clearly, Admiral Mahan is one of the most important and least studied people in American history."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"If you want to know how the United States became a great power this is the book to read. The United States quest for empire and manifest destiny can be summed up by the five men covered in this book: TR, Elihu Root, John Hay, Alfred Mahan and Henry Cabot Lodge. The book focuses on conquest in the Philippines, Cuba and Mexico as well as the importance of the Panama Canal. It is a very interesting read that offers a lot about the course of US Empire. Imperialism and Americanism can be seen as one in the same during this time period and these five people acting together set America on a course to become not only a great power but eventually a super power. A must have for anyone interested in America's imperial past."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"This book by a former U.S. Ambassador is an elegantly-written history of the Spanish-American War of 1898, when the United States acquired colonies in the Caribbean and the Pacific and emerged as a major world power. The nuanced, balanced narrative deals with &quot;big picture&quot; geopolitics and historical trends but never loses sight of the human factor or the role that ego and personal ambition played in America's rise to power. Zimmerman doesn't flinch from concluding that American troops committed atrocities in the Philippines or that our acquisition of Hawaii and the Panama canal zone was little more than theft. At the same time, he avoids ahistorical condemnations of turn-of-the-century imperialism. His book will leave leftwing revisionists and flag-waving rightists equally disappointed -- surely a sign of scholarly achievement.&quot;First Great Tiumph&quot; brims with insights into diplomacy and politics, based on Zimmerman's many years in the U.S. foreign service. Indeed, many parts of the book are eerily topical, such as the discussion of how war-lover Theodore Roosevelt seized on the sinking of the battleship Maine as a pretext for a war in Cuba. The book was published prior to the non-discovery of the much-hyped WMDs in Iraq but the parallels to current events are there for any intelligent reader to see. I gave the book four stars instead of five only because the &quot;multi-biographical&quot; approach is a bit contrived and results in the inclusion of much unnecessary biographical material in the first section of the book."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Warren Zimmerman uses short but trenchant bios of five important American decision makers and opinion leaders to tell a story about the beginnings of the American empire.John Hay, Navy Capt. Alfred T. Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt are the principal actors. These men provided the intellectual atmosphere and the institutional framework that enabled the United States to step away from her traditional isolationism, recognize her place in the world as a power of the first rank, and take up that role. In order for that to happen the American people first had to understand the dangers that expansionist European powers presented to their nation. Zimmerman weaves the various strands that these five men bring to this story as well as the reluctantance of President McKinley and the objections of actors like Mark Twain and former senator and newspaper editor Carl Shurz, into an exciting and thoughtful work. The book is worth the price for the bios of the principals alone but it is the story of this interaction, as skillfully told by Zimmerman, that makes this book so interesting and such a quick read.For those who believe that America is not an imperial power (though not quite cut in the mold of European imperialism) this book will provide much to think about. For those interested in knowing how we became a world power in such a short time, this book is invaluable.The author is a former foreign-service officer who obviously has experienced the mixed blessings of the nation's global responsibilities."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Empire building is not necessarily a bad thing. As such the First Great Triumph tries to force the reader to understand our nations obsession with empire and empirebuilding. The book starts off by telling us about the west. Our nation was growing and the American people were driven to move across the country to carve out homesand states west of the Mississippi. Once our nation grew from sea to shining sea the energies behind empire building became global. We could no longer focus ourenergies on the continent of North America, so we had to look outward. This incredible drive to expand, and the passions behind it, became a central part of the Americanspirit.But in order to bring our manifest destiny to the global scale we had to become a force that would be strong enough to hold on to our gains. As such we needed tobecome a first rate power. One who could compete among the nations of old for dominancy in this brave new world.In order to gain such power we needed leadership toguide us. Theirfore the First Great Triumph is not only about empire building but about the figures who helped bring our nation into this new found power. The authorconcentrates on five powerful Americans. They are ; Theodore Roosevelt, Alfred T. Mahan, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay, and Elihu Root. All of which , our author feels,were instrumental in guiding our nation onto the world scene. The belief the author has is that without these five, our nation would not have risen to our present status ofa world power. Let us examine why.The top of the pyramid was Theodore Roosevelt. It was his leadership that made our nation's stature as a world power possible. An influential man both as a statesman and president. It was he who had the vision to build up America's naval power and turn it loose upon the world. The great white fleet was assembled and sent outunder his guidence. The showing of such a fleet of ships was enough to prove to the world that we had become a first rate power. Under Theodore's leadership we gainedinfluence in both Latin America and the Pacific. This was due to Theodore's timely usage of naval power. Theodore had also assembled a cast of first rate leaders aroundhim and was able to use them to the best of his abilities. Theodore was able to delegate his many tasks among the two others to help establish American hegemony.Root was given the task of setting up the government of our conqured territories while Hay was given the task of handling our nations diplomacy with the other forgeinpowers. Both performed admirably and were able to give Theodore a stable base from which he could direct his energies upon the world.John Hay was the statesman from which all diplomacy flowed. He was pro-europe but also an American. As such his unique perspective allowed him to see problemsand solutions from both sides. As such he was an excellent diplomat and arbitrator. Theodore would view him weak, but in reality Hay's greatest strength was his abilityto have patience. His skills with diplomacy , when used, would help smooth out problems the U.S. was having and as a direct result Hay would win wars with wordsinstead of bullets.But diplomacy and leadership are not the only tools one needs to run a country. You need beauraucrcy, that day to day grind that makes politics and governmentpossible. For that we had Elihu Root. Root was instrumental in creating new ways of governing our new acquisitions. They were not perfect but they showed us whatcould work, and what could not work. As such Root would be able to show our government how to administer conquered territories. Root's ability to do this paved the wayfor our country's dealings with later nations and later wars.While Theodore's trio was able to expand the power of the executive branch, Lodge was able to channel the energies of the legislative branch to greatness. Lodge wasnot only an incredible intelectual but he was a man of vision. He dreamed of an imperial American, one that could rival Brittain in both power and strength. As such Lodgededicated his abilities into keeping the pressure up on the legislative branch. His dedication to empire building left a stamp on congress and Lodge's actions helped swayseveral presidents towards the battle for empire. His observations of the dying world regime helped stir the American public into understanding their new role in the world.Spain was dying and Brittain was winding down. As such the American star was rising and a key to world dominance would be by gaining American soverignty over thearea in the Pacific.All of these thoughts for empire stem from Alfred T. Mahan. It was his writtings on seaman ship and Naval power that got this entire ball rolling. In order for a nation tobe great you had to be able to control the Oceans. Mahan had based his writtings on history and how the ancients giants, throught time, all had control of the seas(Oceans). He argued that the United States would always be considered a second rate power as long as their Navy was second rate. To build up the NAvy not only meantnew ships. It also meant the training of a profesional class of sailors, new technologies, and refueling ports / way stations for the ships to be based at. Only by combiningthese three points would the U.S. gain dominancy in the world's seas and as a direct result gain dominancy on the world.But in order to understand history we sometimes have to look at how the author presents his material. What I found at in this book was that it is not an enjoyable read.The author has fallen in love with the big five and treats them like lovers. Their faults are glossed over and their actions are heightened to god like epics. As such youagree with the author. After all the author believes that these five mortal men changed the face of America. By their labors, and their labors alone, they turned our countryinto a first rate power. But the author is biased. It is his thesis after all that these men made America, so he will do anything and everything to back it up. Now the authornever lies about the five, but he does seam to make them heroic. Never the devil, these five are always building our country up and never bringing it back down. They arethe \\"Music Makers\\" after all and to attack any one of these idols would be an assault to the author. One he could not stand.The author wants you to feel sympathy for the five as both men and Gods. As such he imerses you into their past. Hopeing to gain your sympathy and trust the authorinstead disgusts and bores you. After all the book will speak of the historic events these men made, yet instead of completing the story, our author has decided to fill youin on the history of the \\"music Makers\\" while in the midst of the story. Instead of breaking down the history of the characters in an orderly fashion, you instead are givensnippets of the character's personality. Once the personality is constructed you are then given the history of the person. But this history is given piece meal and while theauthor is narrating a story. As such the reader can become confused and bored while learning about these heros. It is also obvious that the book was written for anaudience already familiar with the five. As such amusing incidents are placed , like Easter eggs, throught the entire book. Instead of amusing, I found them unapropriate.The detracted from the content of the book since I was out of the loop and unable to figure out the joke.The book is also a racist book. This is not to say it is a bad thing but the book has been written with the gloves off. Theirfore it is shocking to read about. Now I didenjoy the honesty the author wrote about. After all it is rare now adays to read a piece of work that has not been cleansed by the censors. The author's dealings aboutempire building stir strong emotions in people. His objective look at how race influenced empire building was refreshing. All to often we stay mute on race. It is a tendersubject. But you can not deny how the concept of race has shaped our nation. Learning that our nation of the past felt so strongly about white America helped shed lighton these topics. The conflict of civil rights has always been a sore spot in our nations history. Now, at last, you can understand some of the pettiness and even some ofthe injustices. To know that our nation had dificulty dealing with our black population is one thing. But to finally learn that our nation thought all races but the white man'swere beneath his was fascinating. And these ideas were ones our nation was building it's empire on. Even with all the bias and hero worship in this book I still feel that itis a must read. Simply for the way the book reaches you about race relations and how the White man viewed his world back then.The First Great Triumph not only teaches you about the founding of modern day America and the people who helped create it but it also teaches you the reader abouthis own personal history with the United States. As such a bridge is formed between past and present and we can learn about our American heritage in all its being. Thatbeing both monstrous and glorious."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"This is the best history book I've read in a long time. Here's why:It's really about the beginnings of modern, international America. Politicians before this period seem antique, but those of the Spanish-American War era are the antecedents of current politicos. This is an important but little examined period.Because the public knows so little about the major players, Zimmermann begins with mini-biographies of John Hay, Alfred Mahan, Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge. They're of just the right length- around 50 pages. There is also a sketch of the better known Teddy Roosevelt. Zimmermann gives balanced portrayals of these men. T.R. was one of the best qualified Presidents ever, but a dangerous jingoist who would be unelectable in the nuclear age.The circumstances leading to the Spanish-American War are not as simple as taught in high school. (It was not just a Hearst inspired land grab.) Having finished the book, I don't know which side I would have taken. Can one ask any more of a good history?Zimmermann has a great feel for memorable anecdotes and pithy quotes. There are about a dozen snorters in this book that make you want to jump up and read aloud to whomever's in the room. Hay and Root seem to have been masters of the mot jus.I thought alot about the impending war as I read this. There were several reasons for invading Cuba, but the reasons seemed distinct and unrelated. No single reason quite met the vital requirements of going to war. (Yup, sounds like Iraq.) The story of the subsequent occupation and war in the Philippines should be of interest to post-war nation builders. Of course, no matter how the war and occupation of Iraq turns out, you will be able to cite caveats from First Great Triumph."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Zimmermann has written six separate but related books and then combined them in a single volume. The first five comprise Part One and are brief but exceptionally informative biographies of John Hay, Alfred T. Mahan, Elihu Root. Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt; the sixth is a brilliant analysis of how these five men, together, achieved achieved for the United States \\"the first great triumph\\" of its global expansion or as Zimmermann describes it, \\"the birth of American imperialism.\\" As he explains in the Introduction, \\"These five men were remarkable by any measure. Two of them, Roosevelt and Root, won the Nobel Peace Prize. All were intellectuals and thought of themselves as such. All except Root were notable authors. Roosevelt wrote thirty-eight books, and Lodge twenty-seven, mostly on themes of American history....Mahan produced an analysis of the influence of seas power that profoundly affected American policy and became required reading in the British, German, and Japanese navies. Root, who had been one of the most talented corporate lawyers of his time, became after his government service a forceful advocate of the rule of law in international relations.\\" Remarkable indeed by any measure.In Part Two, Zimmermann shifts his reader's attention to a period extending from 1898 until 1909 when, through the collective and coordinated efforts of the five men and their associates, the United States acquired Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, and Panama. When explaining the legacies of this brief but productive period, Zimmermann observes; \\"First, they created an authentic American imperialism that was confident in its objectives but modest in its application....The second legacy of the founders of American imperialism was their preparation of the United States to be a great power. Pragmatic as they were, Roosevelt and his friends understood that they were embarked on a grand adventure. The \`first great triumph' that Roosevelt fore-saw on the troopship to Cuba did indeed become a \`world movement.'...Third, these five imperialists produced the first comprehensive assertion of U.S. security interests abroad....The fourth legacy of the founders was the creation of two foreign policy priorities, human rights and stability, that have remained in tension with each other ever since....The fifth consequence of the work done by the men who launched America as a great power was to strengthen the American presidency. All five were followers of Alexander Hamilton and believers in activist government.\\"I was fascinated to learn how all this was accomplished, especially during such a brief period of time. Of course, as Zimmermann explains, \\"the five imperialists\\" encountered staunch and formidable opposition. However, they wholly agreed with an opinion expressed by journalist John O'Sullivan that during the \\"era of American greatness\\" their nation was \\"destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles.\\" (1839) Hence the origin of what has since been known as the concept of Manifest Destiny. Those seeking to understand the current state of our nation's relations with other countries throughout the world will find Zimmermann's book especially informative."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Warren Zimmerman uses short but trenchant bios of five important American decision makers and opinion leaders to tell a story about the beginnings of the American empire.John Hay, Navy Capt. Alfred T. Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt are the principal actors. These men provided the intellectual atmosphere and the institutional framework that enabled the United States to step away from her traditional isolationism, recognize her place in the world as a power of the first rank, and take up that role. In order for that to happen the American people first had to understand the dangers that expansionist European powers presented to their nation. Zimmerman weaves the various strands that these five men bring to this story as well as the reluctantance of President McKinley and the objections of actors like Mark Twain and former senator and newspaper editor Carl Shurz, into an exciting and thoughtful work. The book is worth the price for the bios of the principals alone but it is the story of this interaction, as skillfully told by Zimmerman, that makes this book so interesting and such a quick read.For those who believe that America is not an imperial power (though not quite cut in the mold of European imperialism) this book will provide much to think about. For those interested in knowing how we became a world power in such a short time, this book is invaluable.The author is a former foreign-service officer who obviously has experienced the mixed blessings of the nation's global responsibilities."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"This is history at its best -- well written, thoroughly researched, and interesting to read. The principle characters come alive. It's an ambitious undertaking, too, to describe this chapter in our history. Zimmermann not only discusses the emergence of the United States onto the world scene as a major player, but also interweaves five amazing men: John Hay, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt. I was familiar with them, but he makes them real. You get into their point of view, their successes and foibles, and their backgrounds and their struggles.I had wanted to read about World War I and the formation of the Arab states as we know them today. Paris 1919 would be a good start. I decided to read this first, though, as a run-in to Paris 1919. What I discovered is that not only did this period posture the US as a world player, but also the striking similarity between the Spanish-American War and the War in Iraq. More about that later.Zimmermann begins by describing the lives, philosophies, and contributions of these five men whose contributions were pivotal. These are not definitive biographies, to be sure, but rather a series of monographs that are delightful in their brevity and depth. The rest of the book provides an excellent history of the war with Spain -- going into detail about Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines -- along with our seizure of Guam and Hawaii. Along the way he touches on a wide variety of other persons, US and foreign.The only downside is the lack of maps. They would help substantially, but their absence does not unduly detract from the strengths of the book. For example, there is fascinating detail regarding treaty negotiations with Spain and the debate within the US Senate for ratification. Zimmermann even gives insight into personalities in the Spanish ruling circles and how they affected Spanish actions.There were a variety of reasons for the US to expand its thinking past its ocean boundaries. Quoting Mahan, \\"[our] growing production, public sentiment, a geographic position between two old worlds and two oceans, the growth of European colonies in the Pacific, the rise of Japan, and the peopling of the American West with men favoring a strong foreign policy\\" (115).I always thought imperialism was driven more by economic motives (markets) and diplomatic and military motives (national power). Imperialism is not necessarily aimed just at less developed societies, but also between Western and regional powers. Still, I can see Zimmermann's point when he says, \\"Such a cultural atmosphere was extremely conducive to imperialist initiatives, because imperialism -- like Anglo-Saxonism, social Darwinism, and manifest destiny -- was also based on the principle of racial inequality\\" (37). Maybe \\"also\\" is the key word. Having said that, he also makes the point, \\"Three of America's earlier wars had been fought for specific principles: political liberty in 1776, freedom of the seas in 1812, and preservation of the Union in 1861. The Spanish-American War was the first in which Americans were activated in large part by the way a foreign government treated its subjects\\" (251).This is where Zimmermann's analysis gets quite interesting for today's environment. Much has been made recently comparing the War in Iraq and where it may lead us to Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. In reading this book you come to find out that the true comparison is the Spanish-American War. The parallels are numerous. Here are a few examples:\\"...left unresolved [was] the crucial issue of who would inherit Cuba from Spain. Would it be the United States or the Cuban people? That fatal ambiguity has scarred American relations with Cuba ever since\\" (264).\\"The Spanish had courage, but not the kind of courage that leads to victory\\" (283).\\"If we turn this war, which was heralded to the world as a war of humanity, in any sense into a war of conquest, we shall forever forfeit the confidence of mankind\\" (337).\\"The first years of American occupation of the Philippines were marked by full-scale war...\`The people whom we liberated down there have turned against us.' From the outbreak of violence...it took the US more than three years to subdue what was to the Americans an insurrection and to the Filipinos a war for independence. At its height the American troop presence constituted three-quarters of the entire US Army. Casualties on both sides far exceeded the killed and wounded in the three weeks of fighting in Cuba.\\" (386)\\"'To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such dereliction of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity.'\\" (404)Zimmermann's insights go on and on. There is much that is different between then and now, but it's clear that the Spanish-American War has much for us to learn in our current foreign paths.Zimmermann sums up his message of his book the best. \\"In retrospect, the twentieth century, for all the brilliance of its intellectual and technological accomplishments, was a time of violence and horror unprecedented in world history...The threat posed by Hitler's Germany became the major international preoccupation from 1933 until the German defeat in 1945. The threat of Stalin's Russia succeeded it as the main concern. Neither challenge could have been dealt with successfully without the full engagement of the US. The imperial initiation at the end of the nineteenth century had prepared Americans for the great power role that, in the twentieth century, only they could play.\\" (482)This is one of the best accounts of US history that I've read. I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"A century after the events Warren Zimmerman describes, questions of \\"American empire\\" are once again being debated. That makes this book a particularly timely and instructive one.The book's structure has been described in many of these reviews: five biographies, about 40 pages each, and then a longer section weaving together the issues and events of these men's lives into the large drama of the growth of American imperialism. Though the book's length is certainly not unmanageable -- in fact, it would be hard to do this topic justice in a much smaller book -- one drawback of frontloading the biographies is that some of the details of the men's lives tend to be forgotten by the time they reappear later on in the narrative. Mahan, in particular, appears only sporadically in the second half of the book, although his influence on the other men can still be felt.Zimmerman focuses his narrative, obviously, on these five men and their influence on their nation and the world. The author perhaps agrees with Henry Cabot Lodge, whom he quotes on page 184 as writing, \\"The personal qualities and individual abilities of public men ... make the history and determine the fate of nations\\" (ellipses in original). This \\"methodological individualist\\" tack is a refreshing approach in a discipline that these days is so mired in \\"social movements\\" and \\"impersonal forces\\" that the critical -- even indispensable -- roles of individual men and women is often forgotten. While America may yet have become an imperial power without these five men, Zimmerman makes a strong case that Roosevelt, Mahan, Lodge, Root, and Hay, by their own will, channeled America's might and power in the direction of their choosing. It's a direction we're still, by and large, moving today.While the five biographies in the first half of the book are all useful, insightful, and well written, they're really mostly prologue. It's the second half where most of the action, drama, and even excitement can be found. Zimmerman does a fine job of charting the drive for empire, the various obstacles that our five subjects had to overcome, and the long-term consequences of it all.Zimmerman doesn't play favorites. Although his approach to the rise of empire is generally positive, it is balanced and nonjudgmental: his discussion of the annexation of Hawai\`i, for example, makes it clear that the coup against the native monarchy was little more than theft. At the same time, though, he does not idealize the pre-colonial era or downplay that monarchy's undeniable corruption. He is clear-eyed about the costs of empire-building, doesn't shy from naming certain American actions in Cuba and the Philippines the \\"atrocities\\" they were, charts successes and failures honestly, and makes painfully clear the disconnect between America's high-minded rhetoric and our often base conduct. In what may be the nearest our author comes to outright denunciation, he is very hard on Theodore Roosevelt's \\"spurious euphoria\\" about the glories of war and TR's general bloodthirstiness (pp. 416-7).I would have liked to see a little more discussion of the opposition to war mounted by the \\"goo-goos,\\" though Zimmerman's discussion, as far as it goes, is sound. This ground has also been covered well by Robert Beisner's \\"Twelve Against Empire\\" (1968), a work I recommend and which is listed in Zimmerman's bibliography.Even today, there seems to be reluctance in some quarters to see the United States as an imperial power. But we became one a century ago, and remain one today. While our intentions, and certainly our rhetoric, may have been (and be) more idealistic than those of other empires, the real-world consequences have been largely the same. As an introduction to how and why the American empire was born, a primer to how we got to where we are today, and a reminder of the power individuals have to shape the world, Zimmerman's \\"First Great Triumph\\" is not to be missed."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Zimmermann has written an excellent book about the roots and beginnings of the \\"American Century.\\" Influenced by Walter Isaacson's The Wise Men (a \\"group biography\\" of the Cold War), he devotes the first (and strongest) part to five leading figures, who formed a sort of network: John Hay, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt.Hay, who began his career as Lincoln's secretary, was a diplomat, a businessman, and a sometime writer and poet who eventually rose to become ambassador to Great Britain and Secretary of State to McKinley and Roosevelt. His Open Door notes paved the way for an Asian strategy that would play out, at least indirectly, with Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the century that followed, and he helped establish the special relationship with Great Britain that did much to shape world politics (many overlook the fact that throughout the 1800s, US-GB relations were icy, and many Americans viewed the British either as an enemy or rival).Alfred Thayer Mahan was and is well known as the author of The Influence of Sea Power upon History. He drew heavily from the lessons of the Napoleonic wars-Bonaparte lost because of his losses at sea, and Mahan also applied Napoleonic land warfare to the sea (he even named his dog \\"Jomini,\\" after the French military strategist). Interestingly, he began as an anti-imperialist, but as he studied naval history and strategy, he realized, for example, that coaling stations and bases were necessary, thus necessitating an imperial policy. Mahan, Zimmermann argues, set the framework for the debate of the 1890s, as the US built up its navy and developed its foreign policies. Traces of Mahan can be found in the modern concepts of deterrence, d&eacute;tente, sufficiency, and globalism.Elihu Root was a New York lawyer and son and brother of mathematicians/engineers (who, within the family, were called \\"Cube Root\\" and \\"Square Root\\"). Root was a man of apparent contradictions. He was a Republican reformer, and yet he served on the defense team for Boss Tweed. He served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Secretary of War, and then Secretary of State under Roosevelt. Root was involved in the famous Platt Amendment regarding Cuba and also in several agreements with Japan, including the Root-Takahira Agreement. He is also supposed to have played a key role in the formation of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.Henry Cabot Lodge was born into the Boston aristocracy and at first pursued a career as a historian. In the 1884 election, he and Roosevelt, both reformers, opposed the nomination of Blaine as the Republican candidate, but in the end, they refused to split with the party (and join the Mugwumps) and endorsed Blaine, who eventually lost to Cleveland. Following that, Lodge and TR became close, with Lodge serving as Roosevelt's advocate with national leaders and helping to secure him jobs on the Civil Service Commission and in the Navy Department. Lodge also supported policies of imperialism and would gain notoriety in his opposition to Wilson in 1919-1920 over the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations, for which he is sometimes mistaken as an isolationist.Theodore Roosevelt, of course, needs no introduction. An asthmatic child, born into wealth, he pursued \\"the strenuous life\\" of intense activity. Zimmermann describes him particularly aptly: TR \\"crackled with kinetic energy.\\" Roosevelt's glorification and pursuit of war are well known, as are his activist foreign policy and support for imperialism (which he usually called \\"Americanism\\"). Zimmermann offers a particularly intriguing argument about why TR wanted to go to war and participate in it himself. During the Civil War, perhaps because his in-laws fought for the South, TR's New Yorker father hired a substitute to serve for him, and Zimmermann suggests TR did not want to have to explain to his children why he himself did not serve (as his father had to do). It is an interesting argument and quite convincing.In the second part of the book, Zimmermann traces the interactions of these individuals in shaping American policy and world events in, roughly, the 1890 to 1910 period. The topics are familiar-the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Panama Canal, the Great White Fleet. Much of this is already well-covered ground, but through the lens of the five men, Zimmermann offers interesting new perspectives. The impact of these years on the twentieth century, and even through today, is huge, and many of the same issues, debates, and problems continue to exist. Though Zimmermann does not note the parallels (perhaps the book was published too soon), I could not help drawing comparisons between the State-War divide then and the State-Defense divide now. (The Spanish-American War was primarily a War Department-driven conflict, not least because the State Department was led by a senile John Sherman.) Nor could I help finding echoes, for better or worse, of today's Richard Perle and the Defense Policy Board in Alfred Thayer Mahan and his Naval War Board in 1898. The legacies of these five men no doubt have lingered and will continue to endure as the US seeks to define its role in an ever-changing world."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"Zimmerman's First Great Triumph is a welcome dissertation for many reasons. It is both an analysis of the history and aims of American foreign policy and a collection of biographical sketches. It also is a timely commentary on the current state of American foreign policy. Zimmerman's contention, that the United States has entered another phase of world leadership, which requires careful analysis of the true origins of pax Americana, is the most important argument in the book.Zimmerman argues, that American foreign policy starts with five men, for each of whom in the first third of the text he provides a political biography. However, he does not omit other pertinent details. Compared with Morris's two-volume biography of Theodore Roosevelt, Zimmerman's sketches of Roosevelt, Elihu Root, John Hay, Alfred Mahan, and Henry Cabot Lodge are as well written and more focused. Zimmerman also provides shorter accounts of other figures in nineteenth century American history, such as President McKinley and Mark Twain. If nothing else, he makes this period of American history fascinating and central to the rest of American history. Considering the legacies of the five men, through other major figures such as George Kennan, this period should be considered more.Zimmerman also counters the thumbnail argument that American history is divided between realism and idealism. He argues, that from the beginning there were tensions in the conduct of American foreign policy between human rights and stability, depending on which of the five men's policies predominated. Zimmerman also identifies the central importance of the executive branch for the conduct of foreign policy in this period, further highlighted by the working and personal relationships between Senator Lodge and President Roosevelt.Zimmerman is quite frank about the errors these five men committed, especially in Cuba and the Philippines. His insistence, that American foreign policy was more enlightened and consistent with American ideals, will be controversial for many, but hardly unsupported. Zimmerman provides plenty of information for any student of American history and foreign policy to enter this debate."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"In First Great Triumph, author Warren Zimmermann demonstrates a masterful knowledge of the beginnings of American imperialism. He first develops biographical sketches into the background of the five men he feels made the most significant contributions to imperialist doctrines then uses the second part of the book to develop his theory. The result is a readable, engaging work that represents an important contribution to American diplomatic history.But Zimmermann also uses his book as a partial mirror to the present day. In 1898, America badgered Spain into a war the Spanish could not win. The reader cannot help but notice strong parallels to the approach America is using towards Iraq in 2003. Zimmermann?s quote about how American?s see themselves as liberators but are seen as oppressors by those they conquer echoes of America?s relationship with Pakistan today. His final twenty or so pages carry the work in sketch form to the present and helps portray his interpretation of the situation of America as an imperialist power.Zimmermann?s work is well crafted, but there are questions about who he includes and who he only give limited space. After their biographical chapters, John Hay and Elihu Root, and to a lesser extent Alfred Mahan, receive only limited attention. The main players are Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt. William McKinley and Woodrow Wilson receive mention in the latter part, but are omitted in the first. More detailed chapters on them may have helped the transition that occurred in 1920 where overt imperialism was set aside in Harding's \\"Return to Normalcy\\" (whatever that means) campaign. Also there is no mention of Roosevelt as a progressive Republican that reached across class lines to achieve great popularity.All things being equal, this is a very good book and Zimmermann has established himself as a powerful force in this time period. His title seems a bit unusual, as one may confuse it with something on the American Revolution or the Constitution, but it is a quote borrowed from Roosevelt on his way to Cuba with the Rough Riders."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"What do the above have in common? The answer is provided quite nicely in Warren Zimmerman's book &quot;First Great Triumph&quot;. In it, he explains what 5 great Americans - John Hay, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Theodore Roosevelt, Hencry Cabot Lodge, and Elihu Root had to do with the forming of the American century (the 20th Century).Each of these men played his own role in creating Imperialistic America, starting in the late 19th century, and their contributions to American foreign policy continue through to this day.This is an important book for anyone that wants to understand the personalities of these five men and the actions that each took to make America the dominant player in world affairs that it has been during the last 100+ years.The book is divided into two sections; biographical sketches of each of these five men, and then a section on how America became an Imperalistic power, similar to Great Britain or any of a number of the European countries in earlier centuries. Starting with the Spanish American war, the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, and pushing through to American intervention in World War I, this book does a fantastic job of explaining the events that occured and the personalities involved.I now understand why Zimmerman chose these five men to study in this book - when I first started to read it, I thought that perhaps others, such as William McKinley or William H. Seward should have been included in the biography section, but Seward's contributions were too early to be included in this study, and McKinley was too reserved to be included in a group of men that firmly believed in American expansion, much as earlier Americans had proclaimed &quot;Mainfest Destiny&quot;.I enjoyed the book greatly, and would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a study of early American foreign policy, or an understanding of why America played such a big role in world events during the 20th century."},{"Title":"First Great Triumph; How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power","review":"This book elucidated the true right course.

I speak from Hondarribia in the Basque region of Spain."},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Brides: The World of Military Wives","review":"Anyone with an interest in the sociological perspectives of being a military spouse as well as anyone living in a democratic society will find this book eye-opening, thought-provoking, and potentially disturbing. Published a decade ago and now out of print, one would like to think it is because the themes are outdated-- but while they may be under increasing opposition from the &quot;new spouses&quot; and other much-needed forces of change, military spouses past and present will recognize and be able to relate to the accounts outlined within. Definitely not something I'd give to a prospective military spouse unless I was seeking to discourage him/her from marrying into the military. Nonetheless, this book is thought-provoking and really leaves one questioning what our armed forces stand for... the irony seems to be that the very things we cherish as Americans are denied to military spouses, including basic civil rights, fundamental independence, and freedom from coercion and forced servitude. Viewed collectively, the authors seem to paint an extremist view-- but from spouse abuse, to denial of employment, to isolation from family and friends, to discrimination against immigrant wives, to unspoken pressure to have children, and to other unique facets of military family life, the individual accounts are often right on the money. This book takes a factual approach, greater in scope but in some ways similar to the provocative fictional piece by Charlie Hudson (Orchids in the Snow)."},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Brides: The World of Military Wives","review":"I've seen the military from behind the mysterious gates for 20+ years.Regrettably, this is a poorly conceived monogram, attempting to pass itself off as a well researched social study of the world of military wives. This is not scholarly effort, despite the attempt to use an occasional footnote to offset a mountain of conjecture and opinion. The use of a random anecdote does not prove a thesis, yet this seems to be the primary methodology used in this book. I recommend you do not buy or waste any time with this book. It is no wonder it is out of print. If you loved the National Enquirer or the Weekly World News you'll love chapter 6. Otherwise save your time. Thank goodness these types of spouses imagined in this book are not a part of today's military.A much better expenditure would be towards supporting current military spouses via any Fisher House (Provides free or low cost lodging to veterans and military families receiving treatment at military medical centers), in lieu of supporting these authors."},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Brides: The World of Military Wives","review":"I believe the others who wrote these reviews failed to notice a few points to this book. First, the book was written by officers wives, and though the military may not be the same today, it was as they said, 15 years ago. Don't turn a blind eye to this sociologically sound item, it may just open your eyes to how life really was for military wives, particularly those of the soldiers drafted in the 60's and 70's. One more point, those of you judging the book by today's military standards have missed the fact that this book speaks of a different military. Don't judge the book by an all volunteer force, as it is today. The era between 1950 and 1990 was much different than it is today.

Personally, I believe the military person should read this to see what it feels like to be a military spouse. Only military spouses know the actual hardships and I for one am glad I read this book. It gave me persmission to finally say that yes, being a military spouse is hard without sounding like a complaint. Being a military spouse is easier than it was 20 years ago and let's hope if another book is written in 20 years, it will be much better still.

Although there are women who are able to over come these issues, it is not common. Military families deserve higher pay, better benefits (tricare is pathetic) better housing (without asbestos) and access to childcare help/resources. None of this is available which lead to very sad living conditions for MOST enlisted wives.

Most of what I read is now completely out of date and relating to a military that is very little like what we've experienced the last 10 years my husband has been in. I think the basic assumption that will make the enlisted wife feel offended is that all enlisted wives secretly wish they were officers wives. I see little reason to read this book now-days unless it is for posterity's sake. There are better, newer books out there. Ones that more accurately paint the picture of the current military wife.

The stats and studies cited by the authors are mainly from the 1970s-'80s, and I sincerely hope conditions for US military dependents have improved. (With the latest round of budgets cuts and BRAC, I shudder to think of how on-base facilities will be affected, including daycare and family medical services.) And I also hope that attitudes toward working spouses have changed -- surely it's in the military's best interest to recognize that a dependent wife with a college degree and established profession may contribute substantially to her family's budget, thereby lessening the need for extra support from the government (e.g., food stamps). Such a lady is more deserving of the title, \\"independent\\"!In the first chapter, the authors give a brief overview of living conditions at frontier army posts during the 19th century.

How can you write a book about military wives and then only mention enlisted wives when illustrating how much officer's wives looked down on them or how little money the enlisted force makes?Second, as I have only been associated with the military since '96, I can't say that officer's wives didn't used to act so superior. However, in today's military, unless I am blind as a bat, you just DO NOT see that kind of ignorant discrimination towards the enlisted troops and their spouses. They paint this picture of OW's as shallow witches living vicariously through their husbands and EW's as uneducated trailer trash.The authors then attempted to address the discrimination that foriegn-wives face, but not w/out making some nasty comments about how enlisted men marry Asian women b/c they have low self-esteem after being ordered around all day at work and needed to be the boss at home!OH yeah, and I really LMAO when I read the part about an officer's wife giving her husband's rank at the clinic to alert &quot;the medical staff to her position of power.&quot; Give me a break.What a shame if anyone unfamiliar with the military were to read this book and believe any of it to be truth.

He rambles on with a story of very transparent personal anecdotes that appear more like a cathartic exercise down memory lane. The language in the story is a mixture of Cuban registers and some other Latin American register--possibly his editors', thus sounding more like a fake to a Cuban (Cuban-American) who is very familiar with authentic Cuban choices of words and expressions. The novel reads flat and lacks sophistication of thought and plot.

It covers a lot of ground on what it takes to manage as a coach in today's corporate milieu. The author displays a keen grasp of the material, along with a good sense of humor, from cover to cover. The examples and case studies in the text always hit their marks. I recommend this book for all coaches and mentors, and all would-be coaches and mentors, too. It's a very thorough introduction to the managing wave of the future. And it's written in a style that is never dull, which is the bane of so many other books on this subject matter."},{"Title":"The Everything Coaching and Mentoring Book: How to Increase Productivity, Foster Talent, and Encourage Success (Everything Series)","review":"I have been required to read 3 books on mentoring for one of my classes and then was required to review and report on another. I examined 5 additional books on mentoring and coaching and this was by far the most complete and readable - in fact, it was the only one that was enjoyable. Mr. Nigro's sense of humor is only outdone by his understanding of how humans operate and his ability to easily explain what so many other authors must fall asleep writing about - how managers can effectively coach and mentor their staff. I highly recommend The Everything Coaching and Mentoring Book."},{"Title":"The Everything Coaching and Mentoring Book: How to Increase Productivity, Foster Talent, and Encourage Success (Everything Series)","review":"According to the author, coaching and mentoring are not the same; in fact there are distinctions between the two. For instance, mentoring is \\"a more informal and open-ended relationship than coaching\\" and coaching is a \\"paying job\\" while mentoring is a \\"voluntary setup\\" (pp. 38-39).Out of the 22 chapters in this book, I found a few chapters most helpful in regards to mentoring. For example, Nigro claims in chapter 4 that there are 4 \\"chief ingredients\\" to mentoring--trust, time, dialogue, and sharing (p. 47). To elaborate, trust is built at the start of and is maintained throughout the mentoring relationship (p. 47), while sharing involves the \\"genuine sharing of insights, observations, and suggestions--an uninhibited give-and-take dialogue . . . . a one-on-one relationship with a robust give-and-take . . . . a two-way street from start to finish\\" (p. 46).In chapter 21, Nigro discusses the \\"four acts\\" of mentoring. In summary, Act I is the \\"getting acquainted\\" stage, Act II is when goals are set, Act III is when goals are followed-through, and finally Act IV is the \\"closure\\" stage (p. 260). These 4 acts (or stages) rely on basic communication skills such as to \\"give feedback,\\" to \\"ask open-ended questions,\\" and to refrain from negative thinking and speaking (p. 265-266). The latter requires \\"the positive whenever and wherever possible\\" and if necessary, properly diffusing anger (p. 266-267). Nigro stresses that the benefits of mentoring results in an empathy for \\"others and their problems,\\" an increased ability to \\"articulate in expressing themselves,\\" and a greater awareness of consequences from their \\"words and actions\\" (p. 267).Although most of the \\"myths\\" that Nigro discusses in chapter 22 are more relevant for workplace mentoring, some of them were applicable for other types of mentoring. In particular, these were the most applicable myths: (1) \\"Capable people don't need coaching [mentoring]\\"; (2) \\"You must be easygoing to coach [mentor] people\\"; and (3) \\"Employees [people in general] are intimidated by direct communication\\" (p. 270-272). As Nigro points out, there are no \\"perfect employees\\" (or people) so everyone can benefit from the mentoring experience, character traits can be \\"fine-tuned,\\" and honest feedback delivered positively and with helpful suggestions can boost a person's confidence level (p. 270, 273).Nigro's description of mentoring is as follows: \\"A mentor performs the role of prudent counselor, dispensing advice and offers beneficial problem-solving hints on the more immediate matters at hand. Mentors base their instruction on their real-life experiences. Essentially, mentors point [people] in the right direction\\" (p. 40). As a general rule then, mentors are people who use their own past experiences to guide and advise people with real problems.Even though the other chapters of Nigro's book focused on coaching rather than mentoring, the information found in them could be adapted for use in a mentoring relationship. For instance, the chapter, \\"A Coaching Blueprint,\\" emphasizes the following skills (p. 63-64):* Appreciate the individual* Encourage self-motivation* Establish goals* Communicate* Be solution-oriented* Show appreciation* Never stop learning (p. 63-64)These characteristics are not necessarily for coaches only but for anyone who wants to make a positive impact on the current and upcoming generation. Actually, these skills can be seen through the biblical mandate to \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" (Matthew 22:39)-- if we love our \\"neighbor\\" then we will never take them for granted and help them as we are able. Nigro says, \\"To err is human; to forgive is being a coach\\" (p. 6). The truth is, all humans make mistakes and everyone should forgive those who make mistakes (Romans 3:23, Matthew 18:21-22).Overall, this was a helpful book with insights into coaching and mentoring. The case studies in Appendix C provide readers with practical examples of the benefits for investing in a coach or mentor. This is a good resource for someone who is contemplating on becoming a coach or mentor.Review by M.

For example, when should you use intensive or intense? What are common mistakes writers make with a, an, and the? What is the proper way to pronounce length?Somewhat similar to Fowler's famous usage guide, Follett's is an outstanding and essential guide. I find Follett's guide much more readable than Fowler's (The New Fowler's Modern English Usage). Also, Fowler's has a British spin to it (Fowler's English Usage vs. Follet's American Usage).Fowler's is more in-depth and covers more words, but with much denser and technical text. Follet's can be read for fun; Fowler's strikes me as more of a reference text."},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"An enjoyable book. Erik Wensberg is a master stylist and his remarks on good and bad writing are often amusing and always helpful. Given the quality of the writing, it would be fun to read the book sequentially, but a wonderful system of cross-referencing draws one pleasurably here and there, from &quot;collateral damage&quot; to &quot;euphemisms&quot;, and from there to &quot;forbidden words,&quot; or &quot;vogue words&quot; like &quot;window of opportunity&quot; or &quot;the suffix -BASHING (corporation-bashing / mother-bashing) [which] makes melodrama of a slighting remark.&quot; Comparing Wensberg with Follett, one admires W's editorial imagination and his respect for the &quot;original.&quot; In his Preface, he writes that he has &quot;judged every entry in the original text for its value to the present-day reader, omitting some entries, shortening others, and adding a good many new ones [...] Malaprops being as quick to sprout as weeds, I have gathered a new crop to put with the old.&quot; This is a marvelous book!"},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"First I must disagree with the reviewer who calls a noun followed by an apostrophe and an \\"s\\" a possessive noun. There is room for legitimate argument here, and I prefer to call such a word a possessive adjective. To me it is far more adjective than noun and so the noun part of it can't be an antecedent for a later pronoun. Therefore, I agree with what the reviser of Follett's book says rather than with what he does. Another man, who was once an English professor at Ohio State (Corbett, I think), and for all I know may be there still, also frowns heavily on the use of a possessive noun or possessive adjective as an antecedent. One must simply find a way to reconstruct passages that tempt one to break this commandment.I once read Follett's book from cover to cover. The man (not he) was an elegant writer. Nowadays I dip into it to refresh my memory and to find passages to use as arguments in pointing out the writing faults of others.Description is a fine thing, but I'm a member of the prescriptive school and so am perfectly happy with Follett's edicts. When several people are working together to produce a single book or series of books, they must all be following the same path.My only objection to Follett's book is the lack of an index. His section titles are not always straightforward or descriptive, so some things are hard to find."},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"This is a very handy book. Some will have different views of the guidance this book provides, but for the general writer this book can be very helpful. There is an essay in the back: \\"On Usage, Pedantry, Grammar, and the Orderly Mind\\". The more you agree with this essay the more you will like this book. And the more you find yourself disagreeing with the essay you will find yourself disliking this book.It is organized in a way that looks like a dictionary, but you may or may not be using the same word or phrase as the book to find a specific topic. So, there is an Inventory of Main Entries in the front of the book you can quickly scan to find what you are looking for and then turn to that term in the main part of the book.There is a lot of personal preference in deciding whether you like Fowler or Follett and which edition of either of them you choose. But I think any of them is better than struggling on your own. Even if you disagree with the book's recommendations you will have made a more informed choice. You will find your writing more confident and more clear. Isn't that enough?"},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on, I here state the firm opinion that Follett is the best of the reasonably contemporary examples and second only to Fowler. Follett is more erudite, more complete (not more comprehensive, I grant), and more analytical than the rest. (Yes, Bryan, this means you). For example, compare his treatment of the indefensible \\"in terms of\\" to any other.Someone speaks here of \\"disagreeing\\" with Follett's remarks on prescriptivism. Well, if you're not a prescriptivist then you oughtn't be reading usage manuals, and if you are one yet still disagree, you'd better find arguments more persuasive than his.Another critic says Follett isn't terribly useful as a quickhow-to guide. Well, true, but the genuine articles never are."},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"Wensberg's revision of Follett's Modern English Usage is one of those &quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot; usage books. Careful readers of this book will have no trouble finding examples of Wensberg violating his own proscriptions. One example should be enough for this forum. On page 29 Wensberg writes &quot;Perhaps the possessive noun is the part of speech most often mistaken for an antecedent. \`On the Vice President's arrival at Kennedy Airport, he explained to reporters that...' The pronoun \`he' could represent \`the Vice President' (no 's), because both are in the nominative case. But the possessive \`Vice President's' is no \`he;' it serves as an adjective.&quot; Yet in his introduction on page viii he writes &quot;I have gained both space and speed by trimming prolixities from Follett's prose and by making some explanations a bit simpler than he left them.&quot; So much for a possessive noun not being an antecedent to a pronoun.The idea that a noun is the genitive case is an improper antecedent to a pronoun is erroneous. A noun in the genitive case is noun, not an adjective. In fact for as long as there has been an English language the case of antecedent noun has been irrelevent to a pronoun.And that's all you need to know."},{"Title":"Modern American usage: A guide","review":"A poor, incomplete and unwieldy reference. \\"Modern American Usage\\" fails to deal with many of the everyday issues people struggle with in their writing -- the list of omissions is long and varied -- and those that are included are sometimes addressed with a lack of thoroughness or clarity.

Specifically, there are implementation samples for FreeBSD, Linus, and MAC OS X included. This edition is as the first one was, an excellent reference for anyone doing system level programming in C or C++ on the UNIX platform. It is was never intended to teach the reader the fundamentals of the UNIX environment nor to teach C/C++ programming. The author assumes a strong knowledge of both. The book begins much as the first edition did, by explaining the UNIX kernel in generic terms. It then goes on to explain the various implementations of UNIX and their specific differences. You will find chapters three through ten largely unchanged from the first edition, as the basic mechanisms of file I/O, directory structure, interprocess control, and signaling have not evolved since that time. Chapters eleven and twelve are two new added chapters on threads, as threading has become very important in UNIX system programming. Also, gone is the chapter on interfacing to a postscript printer. It is replaced by a more modern chapter on communicating with a network printer. The HTTP protocol is discussed in this context. The book contains a rich set of examples and downloadable code that is very useful. In addition, the book contains the implementations of two large-scale projects: a database library and communication with a network printer. Each project includes complete code with schematics. This book also contains numerous exercises, and the solutions to some of those exercises are included in the back of the book. Since Amazon, and some reviewers, show the table of contents for the first edition but not the second, I include that here for the purpose of completeness:1. UNIX System Overview2.

While the text seems to be up-to-date, the accompanying code suffers from the age of the environment in which is was originally written and has not been ported to Linux. I write this review from the Linux point of view as I am not programming in the Sun or BSD environment.I purchased the book with the idea of learning pty programming for Fedora. While the chapter was very informative in its discussions, using the man pages is required. As the source code accompanying the book doesn't address Linux, per se, and one may be tempted to use the apue.linux3.tar.Z download with its Red Hat port of the common library. Downloading it may be helpful, but the added code was written for Red Hat 6 and the book is newer than that. Specifically, the pty open code was not functional and I reverted to the svr4 code which still needed tweaking.Some of the original sample code is architecturally out of step with the current way of doing things. For example, originally ptys were found by canonically generating all pty names until one could be successfully opened. The sample code is written to return the successfully generated name. The current method in Linux (and elsewhere, I suppose) is to open(\\"/dev/ptmx\\") and then call ptsname(). So plan on using this to study and then writing your own more modern code or tweak the sample code as needed. Of course, one of the goals of the code is to create a portable library to support various *nix flavors, so this criticism may be overstated.Still, it seems a thorough modernization of the sample code would have made this book more valuable.

Apparently, this book is merely a smaller, truncated version of the \\"real\\" book, by practically the same title -- Feed a Family of Four for a s Slow as $10 a week and enjoy a BITE of independence. And while I would like to read the larger version, after the experience I've had in ordering this one, I'm unlikely to go back for more. I feel like I've been misled, because this doesn't cover all of what is in the other book, and reference to it is made within this smaller version, but no reference was made to the fact that this is a smaller version of the whole in the ordering/buying process.While some of the recipes are good, they aren't better than what can be found elsewhere -- and the whole concept of \\"wheat meat\\" grosses me out. Why not just go vegetarian? To do this program, you need to either be in a rural situation (urban neighbors don't appreciate beehives and chickens) or on a very large suburban lot. The point of cutting my food budget is to GET there -- not what the plan needs to be when I do.Overall, I found the title misleading. If you are tempted, at least buy the \\"original\\" version -- it's got to be better than this."},{"Title":"Feed a Family of Four for As Low As $10 Per Week: And Enjoy a Nibble of Independence","review":"I purchased this book to add to my frugal cookbook collection.Unfortunately, this book should not be classified under cookbooks, but rather homestead living.

I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what happened next to these feral cats with names and personalities, living on the edge of living or dying. Janet Jensen's writing was suspenseful and personal, making me care for these otherwise unwanted and unnoticed creatures of the night.

It not only discusses food toxins, toxins in the U.S. food supply, and the impact of toxins on the body but also addresses current nutrition practices and their lack of connection with then environment. The book also discusses in depth the chemical structures of pesticides, food additives, and other substances and how the chemical structures relate to the compounds' reactions.

His historical works show some of his skills as a novelist--you never see dry writing. At the same time, his novels benefit from his historical research. The Long Pursuit is a history that almost seems like a TV drama. Imagine a hunted fugitive who has already killed two policemen and who is on the run. The good guy (in TV dramas killers are rarely the heroes) by sheer luck happens to arrive at an intersection moments before the killer shows up and overwhelms the killer. You'd say, and rightly, that this is pushing dramatic license too far. But sometimes history can be stranger than fiction.The British Navy in WW I was primarily concerned with the German High Seas Fleet in Germany: they could spare few capital ships for action elsewhere. At the outset of WW I Germany had some naval vessels scattered around the world. The prime concern for the British (other than the battlecruiser Goeben heading for Turkey) were the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, two new armored cruisers in the Far East. There were also a number of fast smaller light cruisers (such as the Emden) to worry about. Admiral von Spee commanded the two armored cruisers, and they were well-drilled, efficient ships. German forces were able to attack British and French outposts and ships in the Pacific. The British sent Admiral Cradock with an inadequate force of older, weaker ships around Cape Horn into the Pacific. von Spee caught Cradock off Coronel in Chile and sank the two British armored cruisers with only the most negligible damage to his own ships. Cradock was brave and interpid, but outmatched in this first important British naval engagement since Trafalgar.Hough relates these events in masterful style. He then tells how Churchill dispatched Admiral Sturdee with two new battlecruisers to the Falklands: these ships massively outgunned von Spee's ships, and were also 5 knots faster. This diminished the British fleet guarding against the High Seas fleet by two important ships, but the threat of von Spee getting into the traffic-rich Atlantic and wreaking havoc there was not to be borne. Sturdee, as Hough notes, certainly took his time getting to the Falklands--there was no sense of urgency at all. He arrived at Port Stanley about noon on December 7th, 1914, only because others kept beggging him to please hurry. von Spee's fleet arrived to shell Port Stanley at 7:30am on December 8th, less than 24 hours after Sturdee's arrival. von Spee might have attacked, with the British fleet busy coaling and largely indefensible, but he chose to run. The battlecruisers got underway, and eventually managed to sink the two armored cruisers and two light cruisers, but another light cruiser escaped. There have been other books on Coronel and the Falklands, but I return to Hough's work every few years. Hough tells the story well, and has penetrating analyses of the characters and ships involved. A fine history!"},{"Title":"The Long Pursuit","review":"This is my second book I read from this author. He deals primarily with naval matters at the turn of the last century. This book is a short story of the flight of the German East Asiatic Squadron at the start of World War I. This squadron composed chiefly of two heavy cruisers and three light cruisers roamed the Pacific from the start of the war till December. It inflicted a stinging defeat of a British squadron at Coronel, and was subsequently defeated and all five big ships sunk by two battleships off the Falklands.This author has many good books about naval matters, but unfortunately most are out of date. I just purchased A Fleet that had to Die written by this author, so that one is in print although difficult to get. Good reading for those who can get their hands on Hough's books."},{"Title":"Loudspeakers,: The why & how of good reproduction,","review":"One of the best films to highlight Ham Radio accurately ... much better than the lame attampts in modern film. And Bonita is a cute little actress... The plots are ok too."},{"Title":"England under the Stuarts (A History of England)","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that other books in simpler language might be better than this one. However, if one can overlook the ancient prose, this is a terrific historical find. As one who didn't know anything about Stuart England, I learned a lot from this and enjoyed how completely it covers the period. This is a good basis for English history."},{"Title":"England under the Stuarts (A History of England)","review":"This book was first published at the beginning of the century, and the expected audience was educated Englishman. This means that Trevelyan assumes the reader is already very familiar with not only the general outline of the history but also of the individuals and the roles they play.For example, to criticize James I he says he \\"deliberately chose Carr and Villiers.\\" If you nodded knowingly, then you'll probably enjoy the book. But most Americans, unless they have a strong interest in the Stuart monarchy, probably say \\"Carr? Villiers? Who the heck are they?\\" Be prepared to say that frequently, and to read at least 20 pages (often more) before the casually thrown out reference is finally explained. If you remember it by the time you get there.In addition, his writing style nears the heights (or depths) of Victorian impenetrability. Be prepared to reread a sentence a couple of times just to figure out what the subject and verb are, and what phrase modifies which noun. I'm not usually put off by difficult language, but this book went a little too far in that direction even for an individual who reads Dickens and Donne for fun.Finally, the author's prejudices and opinions are in full display. This book was written before the expectation that an author should remain neutral, or at least not overtly biased, was firmly entrenched. In my opinion, this actually adds to the interest of the book rather than detracts from it, but the reader should keep in mind that the opinions expressed are strictly those of the author and not the unanimous verdict of history.If you extremely interested in the time of the Stuarts, then you will probably find this book fascinating in its presentation of the historical judgement of 100 years ago. If you are not already well informed on the subject and not a fan of complex language where plain would do, then you'll be better off looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Solid Mensuration with Proofs","review":"This book made in 1934 solid geometry 1934, one of the contributing authors is a professor in mathematics from the u.s. naval academy enhances the quality the real title if u look in the interior is solid mensuration with proofs. The proofs are involiving three-dimensional geometrical figures, congruent triangles in three-dimensions, dihedral angles. The only modern book that covers plane geometry in space proofs is geometry for enjoyment and challenge and geometry by arthur weeks. The proofs are tedious, the books dont directly state if they are to be done in two-column or paragraph form, but they do provide critical stimulaton.For some awkward reason this book s give a very low ranking. This is one of the best solid geometry books its concise and to the point. This is one of the best solid geometry books, the problems are theoretical and very practical. Finding the areas of cones inscribed in pyramids, comparing ratios and volumes, deriving formulas and mathematical relationships, financial costs associated with calculating the volume and surface area of composite figures, pyramids with cubes, cylinders attached to cones and hemispheres, etc. All in all, this book gives 4 stars.

There's more in this book than the average classroom teacher in a school with a PE Specialist is ever going to need, but any teacher building his or her library should have this reference on hand. Gone are the days when the classroom teacher organizes many playground games (in fact, recess is sadly disappearing altogether in our area)but the sections on the Instructional Process, Personal Health Skills, Program Implementation and Wellness are going to be useful references for any K-9 teacher for years.

One more part is needed to make the circle full, Merlyn started at least one of his volumes referring to Arthur dying in his arms an the kingdom in ruins, but in a way the main story ends here: the king is given his singing sword. I felt sad when it ended. This volume is vintage Whyte, with action following logically from whatever has taken place earlier. Somehow, however, some of the changes seem forced, with Merlyn striking his head or getting sick just at a crucial junction to send the story on a new route. Besides, magical visions, such as the meeting with Ironhair do not belong in a story that is just a description of what happened. Too much supernatural coincidences make the rest less believeable, and a deus ex machina or a dream seem too easy ways out of a tight spot. However, Merlyn's revenge in the war in Cambria is a magnificent part of the plot and covers other problems. I still wondre about the leprosy, it never got anywhere further than Merlyn's own thoughts. If, and when, the final part of Merlyn's story reaches the end, I would also like a more detailed map to keep track on what happened where. At this stage, I envy those who have yet to discover this magnificent interpretation of what could have been....."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"This is the last of the books in the Camulod Chronicles series, I'm sorry to say.

Two of the descendants, of course, were the mythical figures, King Arthur and the sorcerer, Merlyn (Merlin.)The story would have been fascinating no matter what the characters' names. It was a pure delight to read.

He is the author of the Camulod series of books and has just had published the first in a trilogy about probably the most famous Order of knights, ever to come through the pages of history, the Knights Templar.This is the sixth book in what has turned out to be a terrific series. Yes there are some reader's who do not like the approach of the author to the subject of Arthur and they have every right to voice their opinion. Personally I feel that the time frame he has placed Arthur in sits well in my own mind but if the truth be told none of us know whether Arthur actually existed never mind the period he lived in, so it is all pure conjecture. He certainly did not ride around in tournament armour, as Hollywood would have us believe. That type of armour was perfected several hundred years after the time that he may have lived.. He is much more likely to have lived at the time that Jack Whyte places him.In this, the sixth book, Merlin, Arthur's guardian and mentor has realized that the time is right for his dream to come to fruition. He has groomed young Arthur away from prying eyes, there is nothing more than can be done. It is time to present Arthur as the High King of Britain, a role that he was born for. Merlin cannot protect the boy from his destiny any longer . . ."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I've completed this last book only hours ago. I discovered these books when the first two had been published years ago and eagerly awaited, bought and devoured each successive book as they were published. Two weeks ago I was led to go back and reread them consecutively, with no wait, no break. And that is the way to enjoy the full impact of these books.Even as I know the books are fiction, my mind demands in equal measure the smallest belief that this story is real.I urge you to read these books.

He did such a great job of creating his characters and making me love them that I felt very real shock and grief when both Dedalus and Ambrose died. I kept fearing that Donuil would be next! I had to keep reading to make sure the people I had grown to love through the books made it!I will say that as a woman, I was a bit bored by the seemingly endless battles and battle strategies, but I can see that they were necessary to the story. I did find the weaponry and descriptions of sword crafting very interesting, and it opened my eyes to things I've never wondered at before.Thank you, Jack Whyte, for your totally plausible, exceptionally well-written interpretation of a wonderful legend. Of the 6 months I spent savouring your words, I wouldn't say a moment of it was wasted time."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Although this is ostensibly a review of \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", it in actuality covers all six books of the series to date (\\"The Skystone\\", \\"The Singing Sword\\", \\"The Eagles' Brood\\", \\"The Saxon Shore\\", \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\", and \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\"), primarily focusing on the last two. This series, The Camulod Chronicles, outlines the story of King Arthur as it might have been in a historical perspective, beginning with the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If there were such a person as Arthur, he would have lived during this time. Most likely, he was a composite character, based on some of the more influential warlords and petty kings of the day. As an aside, I am reminded of a vacation in southern England that my family took in 1995. My sons, who were 11 and 13 at the time, could not understand my excitement in viewing the ruins of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, asking \\"How can this be the birthplace of someone who never was?\\" But, that's a different story. . .The first two books of the series, which outlined the founding of Camulod (or Camelot) and Avalon and the forging of the sword Excalibur, were told from the viewpoint of an old Roman soldier. The last two books, which detail the birth of Arthur and his early boyhood years, are told from the viewpoint of Merlin, or, \\"Merlyn\\" in the Chronicles. The last two books, which detail Arthur's adolescence and subsequent coronation as High King of Britain, are also told from Merlyn's point of view. As an avid reader of Arthurian legend and all its various retellings, let me tell you that the character of Merlin is probably one of the most varied of them all, probably due to the fact that he was actually a minor character in Mallory. Hence, the details are free to be filled in by the current chronicler. Merlin ranges from an evil wizard living backward in time to a benevolent sorcerer to merely a human being who is just a little smarter than most. The most esoteric version of Merlin can be found in Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle in which Merlin is the son of Charis, the last princess of Atlantis, and Taliesen, the greatest of the Celtic Bards. Except for the exotic birth, Jack Whyte's Merlyn has much in common with Lawhead's Merlin in that both were mortal men, though a little larger than life in that they were fierce warriors, outstanding field generals, and outstanding scholars. Also, neither possessed the true gift of magic, though they were believed to by the masses of humanity. In the sixth book, we are also given a glimpse into Merlyn's future as he begins to withdraw from the public eye, just as Arthur begins his ascendancy into it.The Camulod Chronicles begin earlier than Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\", in a time that historically did occur, hence the tales carry an air of realism. The descriptions of the Roman influence on Britain in the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries are fascinating. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, but the pages just keep on turning. The story is easy to follow as well as fun. There are those critics who complain that some of the dates given are inaccurate, as well as some of the situations. As Don Henley sang, \\"Get over it.\\" This is historical fiction at it's finest, with the emphasis on fiction. Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is. For the most part, the common characters that the Camulod Chronicles share with other retellings are true to form, though the treatment of Vortigern is more sympathetic than any other I can recall.As I type this, I am awaiting the arrival of the seventh book of the series, \\"Uther\\". I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them. So far, I consider this to be among the best Arthurian series' I have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone who has an interest in the Arthurian legend, anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, or both. As a bonus, anyone who likes these books would most likely like Stephen Lawhaead's Pendragon Cycle and Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy. The order you read them in is not important, though somewhere in the mix you should read Mallory to see where it all began. I love Arthurian fiction and fact, and, after reading these books, I'm sure a lot of the rest of you will, too."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Jack Whyte's \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", sixth book, and 2nd in the series is excellent. Once again we follow Caius Meryln Brittanicus, in his quests, and watch an older Arthur becoming a leader, and in time the high king of all of Britain and wielder of Excaliber. In this novel we are brought back to Camulod, and now Meryln serves as a leader of colony alongside his brother Ambrose. Not to give away story, but tragedy will strike, and through this Meryln makes the change from leader of men, to Sorcerer- friend of few, feared by many, a powerful transformation. Evil always dwells, and this 2nd book in series has alot more action then previous. Once again the characters are descriped in great detail, and we get to know them through Merylns narrative. I in particular like the Pendragon descriptions, characters like Huw and Lyewelln are nice to follow. The only downside I can see at moment, is that there has not been a real follow up to this as yet, as the next book follows Arthurs father, hopefully in time Whyte will deliver more books for this series.

And yet again, I was kept up until the wee hours of the morning unable to put down the book. I have rarely seen characters this well written; Jack Whyte gives them such depth and complexity that they seem so authentic. You get this incredible sensation that these people did exist - period - and history unfolded exactly this way - period.One of the great things about this book and series, is that Jack Whyte explains the magic and sorcery that has surrounded this legend with down-to-earth explanations. The amazing thing is that in doing this, he creates an even better legend. The idea that man, without the aid of magic but by his intellect and will alone, is able to have a vision and bring it to life in a way that has endured as long as this legend has, is very inspiring.I have related to every one of these characters; I have laughed, cried, been enraged, and been constantly surprised by them.I tip my hat to Jack Whyte - he has quite a gift."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"First off, I love the way Mr. Whyte writes. It's been a while since I last found a series of modern works worth reading, and the Camulod series really satisfies the true reader. The words fly through the brain effortlessly and the thousands of pages are turned with amazing speed. A good read, and that is no lie. But! After all that, I am gravely disappointed that Arthur was not given more attention. This book, and this series, just ended - WHAM! Halfway through &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; I panicked. Arthur was still only 15. That was when I finally excepted that Jack had no intention of telling the actual Arthur story. He instead has told the events leading up to the Arthur legend - the story of the making of Camelot. He has left the actual Arthur story largely untold. I guess this is what he intended, and I will not blame him, yet I am left languishing for the actual tales of Arthur in his manhood. Maybe... just maybe... there will be another book after &quot;Uther&quot; ??? I can always hope... In any event, I am a Jack Whyte fan and promote his work shamelessly."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"This is (I think) the sixth volume in the series. Now after something like 3000 pages we have just gotten to the Sword in the Stone episode, Arthur now being about 18 years old. I shouldn't say this, but the author is not a young man -- he dedicates one of the books to his grandchildren. Here's long life to you, Jack!The series is compulsively readable, however. As a member of some King Arthur clubs on the Internet, I have been taken to task for liking these books. They say they are historically inaccurate, in, for example, the same sense that the movie Gladiator was criticized for showing the Romans using fire-shooting catapults on a campaign in the northern German forests. Also, there is no evidence that the British at this time used cavalry to great advantage because they had discovered stirrups. Well, la-di-da. Who cares? It READS convincingly as pseudo-history, and that's all that matters in this sort of story. The latest one is particularly good, after two or three dull ones.The author had a new slant on the Uther/Ygraine tradition that was really good, and there are other felicities. There's also a lot of boring dreck.

I had a hard time forcing myself to read this one because it is so slow moving and just plain boring. It seems as if Whyte lost his train of thought here or was himself bored with the telling of the Camulod tale. Either way, his editor needs a kick in the rear for letting this one be published as is.For those who are reading the series and haven't yet gotten to this one I do suggest you read it just to keep following the story to the end but I finally resorted to skiming paragraphs/pages just to get through the really boring parts.Very disappointing this book is."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Whyte continues a familiar story with quite a different approach.Merlyn Brittanicus continues his tireless journey to make a High King out of young Arthur but finds his carefully thought-out plans disrupted by his long time nemisis Peter Ironhair. Consumed by his deep hatred for Ironhair, Merlyn set out to destroy his enemy once and for all at all costs. If you have read the first books of the series, you will remember Publius Varrus' similar determination when he dealt with Seneca.This final chapter manages to provide a seemingly logical ending to the Camulod Chronicles series. However, you get the feeling that Whyte tried too hard to link too many of the past events from his earlier five books to this final book so that he gloss over certain events. That just leaves readers feeling that something is missing. Certainly, it does not give you the same feeling as when you finish reading Book One - The Skystone.For those readers who prefer a more wholesome ending to the Arthur / Merlin story, Mary Stewart and Bernard Cornwell's series are highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I may only be 14 but I've read all these books and I like them all.

Now in Sorcerer, he has recovered quite a bit, but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.Finally, Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died, as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman, and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer, and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.Unfortunately, the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books, he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.It's a shame, but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"book is great and most impressed with ordering and delivery, actually received in under 3 weeks"},{"Title":"When Medicine Went Mad: Bioethics and the Holocaust (Contemporary Issues in Biomedicine, Ethics, and Society)","review":"Arthur Caplan, who is one of the U.S. major leaders in the bioethics movement, compiled this book demonstrating not only the real use of bioethics in determining the right and wrong of scientific endeavor, but also exposing the fact that in spite of all the knowledge the world has gained from the Nazi atrocities and other questionable experimental science, there are still those who would not only use the data from these sources...but would also excuse some of people who committed these horrors in the name of science.It was to my surprise that I found this book, and later decided to buy it through Amazon. This book came about by researchers who were attempting to use and excuse the data obtained through one particularly horrific experiment done by the Nazis. There was concern that German aviators would suffer from exposure upon leaving aircraft that had been damaged in dogfights with planes from the Allies. This gave scientists the excuse to use political prisoners, captured soldiers, and Jewish prisoners as subjects in their experiments. They would dress the men as aviators would be dress and expose them to frigid water and lack of oxygen (as would be experienced by aviators at high altitudes). They would try varieties of means of re-warming these men, including absolutely ludicrous ideas that are revolting now in their simplicity and immorality...which I have no intention of discussing here. I don't know what is more amazing...that these men felt they were doing no wrong, or that some of our scientists would continue to advocate the use of the data obtained from these experiments. At least Mengele and the men behind his atrocious twins experiments had the presence of mind to know what they were doing would not be looked upon kindly. Not only did they destroy their work before the Allies could find it, but Mengele disappeared into the South American continent. The men who worked on these exposure experiments left around not only their very bad data, but pictures of themselves standing there as they slowly killed men by exposure.In 1991, a conference was held to discuss the ethical use of such experiments. Should it be used? Why, or why not? Would use of this type of scientific information constitute an insult to the dead and living survivors of these experiments, or would putting that information gained to use make their unwilling cooperation in these experiments as not having been done in vain? Or did this type of experiment, and those done at Tuskagee, and those done at Willowbrook, merely continue to advocate the use of those considered inferior, or captive populations, by scientists as morally acceptable because the needs of \`society' (as described by scientists and medical researchers) as more important than the needs of individuals? Sound familiar? It should...this question has never been morally answered and now, it is the corporations who put vulnerable populations at risk. Only their excuse is the bottom line, and profits.Caplan collected a series of essays by those who were the victims of these and other experiments of the Nazi era. There is also input from those who would use this information in references, in their own work. There is input from bioethicists on both sides of the equation, and some input from notable American theologians. So it would seem this is an unbiased look into this question of when and who decides other human beings are of individual worth or are only of use to society as a whole. What is a bit perplexing to me is that the question needs to be asked, fifty years after the Holocaust, and thirty years after the explosive exposure of American experimental atrocities by Henry Beecher in 1966.And yet it does...and yes we do need to teach these things to the new scientists and new medical researchers, and those who would do business by pushing the moral envelope just a bit farther in the name of profit. With genetics and politics combining to form a new type of eugenics, with stem cell research, the increasing need for organ transplants, emerging diseases, and allocation of limited health care...this book should be part of the required list of those in all these areas as well as in bioethics.As theologian Neuhaus says in his chapter, \\"This meeting would be a failure if we were not made to feel uncomfortable.\\" This book should make all of us feel uncomfortable. Maybe if we all were uncomfortable, the slippery slope to another medical and scientific \\"Holocaust\\" could be avoided.Karen L.

It's not a town where much happens and when it does, everyone knows. The return of an old school friend, Nick Kazlik, adds some spark to Rachel's life, but these are the early 60's, a time where proper women do not follow through on their deepest wishes and needs without repercussions. Rachel embarks on an affair with Nick, her heart and body telling her that this is right and wonderful, while her thoughts are filled with fear about getting caught, or worse, pregnancy.Rachel's conflicted emotions and desires drive the plot and tension as she copes with her passive-aggressive mother, and the school principal she barely tolerates. Doing the right thing in Rachel's world means living an incredibly lonely life, which lead to moments of desperation. Should she continue to fulfill the expectations placed on her, or is there a way to break free?A Jest of God is a beautifully written book by Canadian literary icon, Margaret Laurence. It's been over twenty years since I read a Laurence novel, and her writing flows with the same seamless elegance I remember. I wasn't surprised to learn that this book won the Governor General's Award in 1966.

Stone Angel was my favorite, A jest of God was pretty good though."},{"Title":"My country and my people,","review":"This book made headlines in America when it came out in the 1930's. For perhaps the first time a Chinese wrote a book in English about China and the Chinese, and the sympathetic reaction of many Americans to China's plight in the struggle against Japan made this book a bestseller. I still think it is a good book. It sets out in language that is still easy to read the Chinese mind, their history, philosophy, characteristics, etc. A good deal of the descriptions are the author's own opinions, inevitably, but it is a testament to the author's brilliant mind and perceptive eyes that much of the book is still valid today. Indeed, now that war, revolution, and communism are things of the past, the Chinese are reverting more and more to their old ways, both good and bad, and their old ways are what this book is about.Pearl Buck, the first American woman to win the Nobel Literature Prize, was the one who persuaded Lin to write this book. Her faith in him is fully justified. Few indeed were native sons of China who were immersed in both Chinese and Western cultures. And Lin was one.Given my interest in both Lin Yutang and JRR Tolkien, I cannot resist a comparison. There is no evidence that Lin and Tolkien knew each other, although both were philologists (linguists interested in the historical origins of words) living in the same period.Their specialties were quite different, however. Tolkien was an expert in Old English, and was comfortable in many northern European languages, both old and modern. (He could even read Finnish!) Lin's expertise was in Chinese literature from the classical period, and what made him unique at the time was his almost native fluency in English (as well as in German, plus a couple of modern European languages).They were born three years apart (Tolkien in 1892, Lin in 1895) and they died exactly three years apart, at the same age (81).Tolkien was a distinguished Oxford professor. Lin held few positions in universities. But Tolkien's education did not go beyond the bachelor's degree. Lin had an MA (from Harvard) and a PhD (from Leipzig, in Germany).Tolkien's scholarly output was very small, but of a high quality. Lin had no scholarly output in the technical, academic sense. His scholarship and intelligence were reflected in the highly-regarded Chinese-English bilingual dictionaries he produced, his prodigious translations of Chinese literature, and in the brilliant essays he penned in Chinese. As I'm fluent in Chinese (my own native language), I find his essays very enjoyable, very humorous - more so than his English books.Tolkien is immortalized by his novels, which have a worldwide appeal. Lin also wrote novels - of an utterly forgettable quality as far as I'm concerned. He's remembered for his non-fictional writings such as this book. Shortly before he died Lin was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. (I would give it to him if it were up to me.)Both lived through the Second World War in relative safety, Tolkien in England, Lin in America. Tolkien had proved his bravery in WWI, while Lin's life in pre-1937 China was also perilous due to the Japanese marauders. Both were outsiders in different ways. Tolkien was a Roman Catholic living in Protestant England who had been born in South Africa, and whose last name didn't sound quite English (it's German). Lin was a Chinaman in America, at a time when being a Chinaman was almost like being a Martian.Tolkien was a practising papist all his life. Lin was at first a Christian, but he later renounced his religion and became what he called a \\"pagan\\" most of his life - and then apparently converted back to Christianity in old age. Most of his writings are a-religious, if not anti-religious, having been written in his middle years. Tolkien had little to say about his own religion - and his novels are almost \\"pagan\\" - but he seemed to have believed in the \\"truth\\" of mythology. (Fools, if you ask me.)Tolkien was a good friend of C. S. Lewis, the Irish writer. Lin was a good friend of Pearl Buck, the American Nobel laureate. Lewis wrote a glowing review of the Lord of the Rings, while Buck wrote a foreword to this book and did much more to help Lin publish his other books. But neither friendship stood the test of time, apparently.Coincidentally, both men were social and political conservatives. One preferred Old Britain, and the other Old China, to their modern versions, and technology and \\"progress\\" as we know it meant nothing to them. Interestingly, they both loathed communism. They were also devoted pipe smokers. One can well imagine these two gentlemen having a good time sharing their views on these things in a smoky, book-lined study late into the night, speaking their oddly old-fashioned English (perhaps mixing some German into it as well). But as brilliant philologists, they would only talk past each other without a single word being understood! Oh, if only they knew each other!Tolkien's fame is assured, mainly by his epic fairy tales. Lin will only be remembered by those few people in the West who take an interest in China's cultural heritage. But even now there are still not many Chinese who can write, in good English, about China and the Chinese people from such a literate perspective (in the best true sense of \\"literate\\"). His insights are sometimes historical, at other times anthropological and sociological, but always and everywhere personal. He eschews abstract, finely spun theories; he sticks to China's facts, history, insights gleaned from classical literature, and his own keen anecdotal eyes. This book is thus eminently practical. It is not entirely timeless, but neither is it out of date. Given the rising importance of China in world affairs, Lin's books are as urgently needed today as they were more than 60 years ago when they made it to the top of New York Times bestsellers list while China struggled to survive."},{"Title":"My country and my people,","review":"Ever wondered what China was like before the &quot;peoples&quot; revolution? Here's an answer by a scholarly writer. This book is now out of print but shouldn't be! Beautifully written, and fully indexed; the best editions were printed in the mid 1930's. These were made so well that if you are fortunate to find one it will still be in good condition, because of the carefull crafting of the binding and covers, and also because of the good paper used."},{"Title":"My country and my people,","review":"I'm a Chinese American fluent in both Chinese and English and I think Mr. Lin did a phenomenal job of explaining the Chinese people and its culture to a Western audience in a very humorous way. I chuckled many times at all the contradictions he pointed out about the Chinese mind and even learned why sometimes my people act the way they do. I've bantered about to friends on the tyranny of family in the Chinese life. But Mr. Lin explained to me why and what that is and its consequences. A great read. One complaint: Mr. Lin tended to throw out names of historical and contemporary figures alike without fully explaining who they are. I was able to guess correctly half of them because of my heritage. But I think most Westerner would find this frustrating because they may be altogether puzzled at who is and why is this person cited."},{"Title":"My country and my people,","review":"I read about 85-90% of this book and skimmed through the rest. Lin Yutang really gives you an insightful, if not very subjective, view of his Chinese homeland. Having visited China, I am, of course, completely infatuated with the history and culture. Even though this book was written in 1935 (before the Communist revolution and current-day Chinese industrail boom) it still maintains relevence to all things Chinese: from the way they eat; to their poetry and art; to how they see the world.Lin Yutang obviously holds great love and pride for his Chinese people, but also discusses in a frank manner the shortcomings (including foot-binding and the over-all oppression of women).Since this book was written during the Sino-Japanese War (eventually to become the Pacific Theatre of WWII); the author's assessment is a valuable first-hand source as to the Japanese atrocities and the retaliation of General Chaing and his temporary alliance with Mao and the Communists.Lin Yutang's style is a well-written mixture of history, philosophy, psychology, sociology and his own wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"Care and Repair of Shop Machines: A Complete Guide to Setup, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance","review":"This is an outstanding book. It is well written, well organized, has excellent graphics and pictures, and serves a much needed role in most woodshops. White would have been a great engineer. His jigs and measurement techniques are clever, well documented, and easy to make and use. I found myself smiling several times at the ingenuity of his low-cost (and effective!) solutions to high-cost measurement tools. I have a middle-of-the-road chinese knock off table saw that wasn't cutting well (burns and lots of resistance). I made the jigs and went through the tune up procedure in an evening, and the saw performs much better afterwards.I would like have heard White's recommendations for storage, cleaning, and top protection (e.g., waxing vs. oiling ground surfaces), as well as his tips and comments for shop safety, but they are justifiably outside the scope of this book.Overall an excellent book that I am very glad to have stumbled upon."},{"Title":"Care and Repair of Shop Machines: A Complete Guide to Setup, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance","review":"I've been having some problems getting my jointer tables aligned properly, and happened upon this book by accident.

John White goes in depth into the set up and alignment of primary power tools (jointer, planer, table saw, bandsaw, router table, drill press and miter saw). His writing is clear, easy to understand and follow, with plenty of very descriptive pictures. The book is very complete on each of the tools covered.

I recommend this to anyone with a woodworking machine. It's amazing how far off your tools are until you set them up correctly. You'll save time and money by making better cuts the first time when the tool is setup correctly. It's amazing we take the time to measure an angle for moulding and when we cut it and it doesn't fit you think you measured incorrectly when it could have been your tool off by one degree."},{"Title":"Care and Repair of Shop Machines: A Complete Guide to Setup, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance","review":"The reason woodworkers want this book is to save money and time. Understanding and applying the knowledge herein might save your fingers and maybe even your life! I am not joking...John White was the shop manager for Fine Woodworking for about a decade and is still a contributing editor. He has a wealth of practical knowledge and presents it clearly. I particularly like Mr. White's style in some of his videos. He \\"cuts to the chase\\" by demonstrating you how things work, THEN explains them concisely. He also invented (or re-engineered) a very clever workbench and numerous practical shop-jigs. Now, not all of those ( or even very many ) are in this volume. I only mention that to illustrate the breadth and scope of the author's knowledge. John White is certainly qualified to write about this subject.The MOST IMPORTANT REASON that every newcomer should buy (or at least read) this book is to prevent hassles, mistakes, accidents, and bad buying-decisions.For instance, if you do not understand how to adjust a tablesaw or bandsaw, how can you possibly choose a machine with the right features?If you don't know how to tell if a blade is square to the miter-slot (or fence,) and how to adjust it, you WILL experience kickback. (...not \\"IF\\" but \\"WHEN.\\") Unlike that funny TV commercial, kickback is deadly serious.There are over THIRTY THOUSAND wood-shop accidents every year, many of which are related to these main machines discussed in this book. I have seen a piece of plywood shoot from a table-saw and go careening across the shop at sixty-miles an hour like a demonic frisbee, then stick itself into a wall. That particular incident was caused by a novice who ignored basic rules of machine set-up and use. No one was killed or blinded that day, but he was lucky. Would you rather depend on luck or knowledge? If that guy would have followed the advice in this book, it would have never happened.Those \\"bargain\\" tools we see in home-centers are often more trouble than they are worth. If you know what features to look for, then you can avoid buying junk. You can also spot a real bargain when you see one.John's set-up tricks can save money on wood too. When you gaff and destroy some lumber because a machine wasn't set-up well or you used it improperly, you throw money down the drain. The small investment in this reference will definitely pay a beginner backs MANY TIMES over!BTW... If your primary interest is table-saws, you really should online-search \\"Ed Bennett\\" and the \\"tsaligner.\\" (Table-Saw Align-er). Ed developed a tool and methods (plural) for really dialing in any decent table-saw. He has taken the subject of table-saw adjustment to a degree of accuracy that approaches and meets machine-shop standards. He has a good web-site with so much information I can't possibly delineate much of it here. Once you understand Mr. Bennett's approach, the same methods can be applied to numerous machines.I agree with another reviewer that Taunton's use of the word \\"complete\\" in the tittle is wrong. This is nowhere near complete. But the information is crucial to choosing the right equipment, using it well, and keeping it in top shape for best results.This book covers crucial adjustments for the main machines. Not only that, but the concepts are universal. Simple tools, jigs and geometry will measure and verify every shop-tool operation for safety and accuracy. How much is THAT knowledge worth?No finite tome can possibly cover every possible machine or set-up scenario.This does show beginners how to choose and safely use the most common shop machines.Heck, even and old-fart like me learns a new trick now and then, and I have learned a few from John White. I have had to train dozens of people in various work environments over the decades. If I could have had this volume thirty years ago, it would have saved a whole lot of time. I'd just say to every new guy that walked in looking for a job, \\"Here... read this.\\"John's advice will save you money, and possibly a trip to the hospital too. That alone is worth the price of admission. If you run a woodworking shop with employees, this should be mandatory reading. If you can't buy it, go to the library and check it out."},{"Title":"Care and Repair of Shop Machines: A Complete Guide to Setup, Troubleshooting, and Maintenance","review":"This book is superb for explaining how to maintain, tune-up and trouble-shoot the most common woodworking machines; i.e., jointer, table saw, planer, drill press, bandsaw, router table and miter saw.

It is hoped that they have done a far better job of preserving and providing what seems very useful information.If the Kessinger approach were the only way of preserving this important information I would applaud their approach; however, today it is possible to do a lot more than merely image copy an old book.

While Kahane is best known as the consummate outsider, the spellbinding preacher to the masses in his life as religious and political activist, The Jewish Idea, Vol. 1, will challenge the reader to reexamine Kahane as a serious scholar possessed with an encyclopedic and analytic knowledge of the classic texts--Talmud, Bible, Prophets, and commentators. They are all woven together masterfully in this tapestry of modern Jewish thought. The Jewish Idea, Vol. 1 places Kahane in a league with Torah luminaries who were deemed unconventional during their lifetimes, yet later recognized for their genius and foresight--Maimonides, Hirsch, Kook, Soloveichik, and Hildesheimer to name but a few. This is the most important work ever produced by Rabbi Kahane. A must-read for the serious Jewish scholar and for the lay person alike seeking insights into 21st century Jewry and Israel."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"Rabbi Kahane, in this book, talks about basic principles of judaism.He shows us a new and unique perspective over the fundamentals of the jewish religion, covering several themes such as faith and trust, good and evil and the yoke of heaven. His main point is to show that the real ideas of judaism have been distorted and perverted due to the long exile that the jewish people has been through. Considering this, he gives the real meaning of what have been misunderstood, without carrying about being political correct. Maybe from this point stem all the polemics that were criated around his figure, for him saying openly what others think but are afraid to say. The Rabbi also show us his great Torah knowledge by quotting, to each argument, a passage from the Talmud,Midrash,Halacha or sages. No doubt it is a very worthy reading."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"I saw Meir Kahana once in Israel and was very impressed by his charisma and the way he charmed the crowd.Nevertheless, how surprised I am by his book, i did not expect to read such a deep, rich book, nearly each sentence makes you think, and written in a very logical way also.Every sentence is taken from the various sources of Judaism (Tehilim, bible, Midrash etc...) which is wonderful for someone like me who has not all that knowledge : he made all the research to make a link between an idea exposed and all the sources that idea comes from.It shows how knowledgeable the Rabbi was, and teach you the basic philosophy of the Jewish religion in the pure way it was before the contamination of the Exile.I am sure Mr Rabbi Meir Kahana will remain not only in the history of the Jewish people, but also his books will contribute to a lot of Jews like me who only have a basic knowledge of our religion to be proud of our jewish values.That book encouraged me to be more religious so made of me a better man: more calm, and understanding more the meaning of life on this earth.The Rabbi was a pure scholar, not only a politician, and all his politic ideas come from our religion, nothing more, nothing less. An excellent book which may change your life."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"IN THIS BOOK THE LEADER OF WORLD JEWRY SETS DOWN THE GUIDELINES OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A JEW IN TODAYS WORLD. AS ALWAYS RABBI KAHANE WRITES NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS BOOK. THE RABBIS WRITINGS ARE SIMILAR TO THE WRITINGS OF THE PROPHETS IN THE BIBLE. THIS BOOK WILL SURELY MAKE THE KAPOS IN THE US JEWISH AND ISRAELI ESTABLISHMENT CRINGE WITH EMBARRASSMENT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THE READER WILL BE LEFT WITH A FEELING OF AWE FOR THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS A FEELING OF ANGER TOWARDS THOSE IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE MOSSAD THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR KAHANES MURDER.

This classic treatise on Jewish thought is a highly significant historical and religious contribution to the corpus of books on Halachic laws. Rabbi Kahane explores all areas of Jewish law and Jewish concepts with the kind of depth and aplomb that is rarely seen. His prescience and wisdom shine through on every page as he delves into complex subjects using a voluminous amount of sources from the Torah and Talmud. This book is replete with narratives and examples that illustrate points that have long been ignored in other books of this kind.Rabbi Kahane was a true Torah scholar, a very learned man and a wise and compassionate leader of his people. This book is a must read for all yeshiva students and anyone who is desirous of authentic Torah knowledge."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"Now I understand why Rabbi Kahane was so villified by the Left. The book is so truthful, scholarly, and ethical that it inevitably clashed with the Leftist agenda. I highly recommend the book. Although it is written to the highest scholarly standards, it is concise, profound and yet very accessible and readable. There are no boring parts."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"This is Rabbi Kahane's magnum opus, and is even more magnificent if you can read it in Hebrew. In this book, Rabbi Kahane, a pious Jew, Torah giant, talented scholar, master orator, and the greatest Jewish leader of our time, reveals to the Jew what true Judaism is---while at the same time exposing the perversions and lies that have been promulgated by the secular, assimilated Israeli an American Jewish establishments. Rabbi Kahane has accomplished a remarkable feat---he has revived the authentic Jewish Idea that had lain dormant and concealed for the last 2000 years of the Jews' accursed Roman exile (which officially ended in 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel). Rabbi Kahane opens an entirely new world for the assimilated Jew who lives outside of the Land of Israel---a world where the Jews were not today's despised, confused, assimilated minority in the exile, but a proud and strong people living in their own land, with kings that ruled and prophets that prophesied, putting their faith in G-d, and not in some flesh-and-blood sitting in some White House.Rabbi Kahane explains lucidly to his Jewish reader the two most basic concepts of Judaism: Kiddush HaShem (sanctification of G-d's name) and Chillul HaShem (desecration of His name); and he illustrates these concepts by bringing distant Scriptural events to life. The Rabbi's command of the Scriptures, Mishnah, Talmud, Gemara, Toseftah, Agadah, and contemporary history---is astounding. His eloquent and cogent writing style is inspiring and captivating. This is the most important book that a Jew has to read and re-read throughout his life, ESPECIALLY the various Reform and Conservative \\"rabbis\\" in the exile, none of whom had enough courage to accept invitations to debate Rabbi Kahane in public.For a secular Jew who mulls doing Teshuva and returning to his roots, this is the FIRST book that he or she must read---it lays not just a foundation but the RIGHT foundation. Our sages say, \\"The seal of G-d is Truth\\". Rabbi Kahane's book, as are all his writings, is the Truth, the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth. A testament of the Rabbi's genius, stature, and the important role he played in showing the Truth to both Jews and gentiles, was the fact that the first terrorist act by Al Qaeda on American soil was the elimination of Rabbi Kahane---he was the only Jew that the Arabs called \\"The Great Jew\\", the only Jew that they feared and respected. How sad that the evil Muslim enemies recognized what we Westerners didn't. How bitter his loss is to us, and how painfully the U.S. was punished for not investigating throughy his murder, thereby letting Al Qaeda slip through the FBI's fingers and ultimately thereby allowing the 1993 bombing and 9/11/2001 destruction of the WTC towers."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"I must say, although I have not read the second volume yet (because it is in the mail) the first was more than enough to give a 5/5. The Rabbi deals with very basic, but very overlooked and molested beliefs, values, Laws of Judaism using all the Jewish Holy books and ancient writings from past Rabbinical scholars to justify his position and prove to the Jews who wish to learn proper Judaism, Orthodox Judaism, the ways of the Tzaddikim (Righteous).This is an amazing work that gives a very logical and justly presentation of \\"War & Peace\\", \\"Love & Hate\\", Kiddush HaShem & Chillul HaShem and much more. The Jewish Idea is so detailed, logical and in depth reasoning that I find that every Jew must read this work. It is such a shame that Rabbi Kahane was undermined by the Socialist Jewish Establishment, with their Liberal Gentile Establishment cohorts, quickly labeled this Rabbi as a \\"Hate mongerer\\", \\"Racist\\" and every falsely applied title before delving into, or opening their minds to this Rabbis reasoning, logic and immense scholarship. In all honesty, it is such a shame. I decided to actaully read his works and found him that he, and his works, were nothing like those that undermined his efforts perported him to be, while never being able to \\"tolerate\\" any of his well founded and presented research. This Rabbi Kahane fellow was, in my opinion, on the same level of spirituality, Tzaddik (righteousness)and scholarly knowledge as the 18th century Gaon of Vilna (Another Right Wing Extremist).Or Hara'ayon is, by far, Rabbi Kahane's greatest achievement. \\"And I am afraid, for the first time, that we are in the hands of people so blind and so mad and so un-Jewish that we may not be able, G-d forbid, to avert the catastrophe.\\" - Meir Kahane, which suggests to any person of reasonable intellect that Rabbi Kahane was right on many issues especially the case of Israel and the Arab/Muslims. We see that what he warned 30 years ago has come true and more will of his predictions will come true in the future. He wasn't a prophet but a very logical and scholarly Rabbi that opened his mind to consider World realities and not hide behind ones arrogance and one sided knowledge which produces ignorance to the other. The most important goal Rabbi Kahane should have acheived was the making Israel a Jewish State from its current Hebrew speeking Greece, and thus the deportation of all of the Muslims (because if one actually reads the Islamic Holybooks; Quraan/Hadith, one will see that Rabbi Kahane was spot on.) and placing a Free Enterprize economy with Jewish education. What can I say, he was spot on and only an ignoramus, or one with a purely immoral G-dless Secular-Socialist agenda, would believe otherwise.I feel Rabbi Kahane was VERY correct, and every Jew reading this SHOULD consider as this world declines into chaos and Hellenism: \\"Let us not suffer from a national amnesia that causes us to forget who and what we are.\\" - Meir Kahane (A very powerful quote in my opinion)"},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"This book reads like an encyclopedia or a bibliography. Every other sentence has a quote from some other source. You don't really get to hear Kahane's voice. I was expecting to hear his philosophy, but instead I got jewish philosophy from others. This book might be good for people who don't know much about judaism, but if you're looking for Kahane, you won't find him here. You could easily take Kahane's name off the cover, and just look at the table of contents, and then just open to the chapter that interests you and read what other jewish sources had to say about things like humility, love for God, and love for fellow jews. I still want to check out the second volume, because it looks more interesting than the first."},{"Title":"Or Hara'ayon = The Jewish Idea, volume 1","review":"Very great books.

Once there was a fiddler named Sam who traveled the Ozarks from town to town sharing his music. People said he had a gift. Sam could fiddle away peoples worries, cares, and the aches in their bones. As he grew older, he searched for someone to pass his talent to, for he remembered his father's words, \\"This ain't a gift son. It's a loan. You gotta pass the music along.\\" How a red-haired boy took up the fiddle and manages to complete Sam's quest results in a delightful tale of bringing happiness to others. The rich watercolor illustrations entice the reader with warm summer evenings, children chasing fireflies and playing \\"hide and seek,\\" the camaraderie of mountain families and neighbors and the value of passing special gifts to another. \\"Fiddlin' Sam\\" is a reminder of the the beauty of the Ozarks and the values of a less hurried America."},{"Title":"Fiddlin' Sam","review":"I have a son named Sam so this book seemed an obvious choice.

One thing that I thought that she did good on was her hopeful ending, but I'm not giving it away. Now, I think that the Target Audience for this book is probably from ages 6-9 because the story is quite long and has some challenging words in it.As you can see, I liked the story Fiddlin' Sam.

The plot is typical of many suspense thrillers, as a group of Palestinian extremists unleash a strike aimed at bringing America to its knees. All the ingredients of a suspense thriller are there, including hostages, kidnapping, chemical warfare, murder, and a SWAT team take-out, complete with full media coverage. The way in which Tanneberg works out the plot is intriguing and entertaining. Tanneberg's strength, however, lies in his ability to write very descriptively, painting scenes in such vivid colours that I found myself virtually hearing, touching, smelling, and seeing the action unfold. The hero - Rev. John Cain - is not larger than life, but is portrayed with weaknesses as well as strengths.Yet Tanneberg's writing style is much like his hero - there are weaknesses as well as strengths. Unfortunately his superb attention to detail often comes at the expense of plot development, because it slows the novel down considerably. If the average thriller novel can be compared to a fighter plane taking off at high speed from an aircraft carrier, this novel can be compared with a bomber, slowly lumbering down a lengthy runway. Although the book consists of nearly 600 pages, in fact it contains only about 400 pages worth of story-line. I felt that I was wading through unnecessary details to keep up with the story-line, rather than being carried along by it.I also found the Christian content somewhat thin - certainly the novel centred around a church and characters who were Christians - but don't expect to find this novel life-changing or terribly thought-provoking. But if you enjoy thrillers and are looking for a good read that will keep you busy for a decent stretch of time without being too &quot;deep&quot;, this book makes a good choice."},{"Title":"September Strike","review":"Great book!

Kennedy. Millions of words have been written about that tragic day in Dallas: Some point the finger of blame solely at Lee Harvey Oswald, while others weave a confusing web of conspiracy theories that accuse the Mafia, French criminals, Fidel Castro, anti-Castro Cuban exiles and/or militarists in the government who wanted to expand America's role in Vietnam.One of the best books on the Kennedy assassination is the late Jim Bishop's gripping The Day Kennedy Was Shot, a detailed hour-by-hour account of the events of November 22, 1963, starting with the President's 7:00 AM wake-up at Fort Worth's Hotel Texas and ends 20 hours later in Washington, DC. Bishop follows all the major players -- JFK, Jackie, Lyndon B. Johnson, Oswald, Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby -- and eyewitnesses -- Helen Ganss, an elderly Ft. Worth widow who had been allowed to stay at the Hotel Texas even when the other guests were moved out by the Secret Service; Linnie Mae Randall, an Irving, Texas housewife who, while washing the dishes in her kitchen, she &quot;saw Lee Harvey Oswald, bare head down, coming up Fifth Street with a long package in his hand. He held the fat part under his arm; the tapered end was pointing at the sidewalk. The rain didn't seem to bother him. He walked steadily, up Fifth, across the corner lot, toward Mrs. Randall's garage. She kept watching him, a dark, pretty woman with shoulder-length black hair. By rote, she set the dishes upright in the drain.&quot;John F. Kennedy had less than six hours left to live, of course, but while turning the pages of Bishop's 1968 book one feels the tension building up with each seemingly mundane detail (such as Mrs. Randall's dishes). The reader knows that once the President's party leaves the Hotel Texas for Carswell Air Force Base to board Air Force One for that short hop to Love Field, his fate is sealed.Bishop, working from various sources despite Mrs. Kennedy's attempts to block publication of his book, describes every minute detail of those tragic 20 hours -- from the rainy weather over Texas to the bloodstained pink dress that Jackie Kennedy wore throughout that horrible day -- in crisp and clear prose."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"Jim Bishop is an outstanding writer and his format using hours of the day (i.e., 7:00 am, 8:00 am, etc.) took you to where everyone was at that time--Lee, JFK, the FBI Agent responsibile for Oswald, Jackie, the football, Ruby, etc,. His research was in-depth and made you never question its validity. I lived in Dallas when this event took place, but was too young to know what was happening. Jim Bishop took back to Dallas on that day and gave me more than I ever expected to receive from the book. This book will make you feel like a history buff. His excellent writing ability led me to purchase another of his books--&quot;The Day Lincoln was Shot&quot;--This one is &quot;Ditto&quot;."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"\\"THE DAY KENNEDY WAS SHOT\\" was written by Jim Bishop and provides some fascinating insights into the last day of President John F. Kennedy's life.My copy of Mr. Bishop's ultra-detailed book is a 1983 hardcover edition, 713 pages in length. The book is divided into four major sections, chronicling the events of November 22, 1963, in practically minute-by-minute fashion (beginning at 7:00 AM CST). The four sections are labelled: \\"The Morning Hours\\", \\"The Afternoon Hours\\", \\"The Evening Hours\\", and \\"The Midnight Hours\\".Many bits and pieces of little-known trivia concerning JFK's last day can be accessed through this compelling volume. Such as: Mr. Kennedy's last breakfast consisted of the following fare .... Two eggs (boiled for precisely five minutes), toast (with marmalade on the side), orange juice, and a large pot of coffee.Throughout the book, Mr. Bishop supports the Single-Bullet Theory (SBT) and advocates the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin on November 22nd, which is a point-of-view that I agree with wholeheartedly. There are, however, a few portions of the book that I disagree with and fail to understand (especially from a \\"Lone Assassin\\" standpoint). Such as:I find Mr. Bishop's account of the first (missed) rifle shot somewhat curious, given what we can see JFK doing after this shot via the Zapruder Film. Bishop has the first shot missing the car's occupants, striking the concrete of Elm Street to the right rear of the Presidential limousine; this bullet causes \\"dust\\" and \\"concrete chips\\" to fly up off the street (noticed by at least one witness in Dealey Plaza -- Mrs. Donald S. Baker). Bishop's book claims (on Page 172) that Mrs. Baker \\"saw the spray and pulled back\\". Mrs. Baker's Warren Commission testimony does confirm this.However, this first missed shot, according to Bishop's book, is also what causes President Kennedy to stop waving as the President (supposedly) actually FEELS (per Bishop's text) the effects of this missed shot, being peppered (similar to bystander James Tague on this very SAME shot) in the face with debris. This \\"peppering\\" in the face causes JFK to raise his arms up to his face in an automatic protective motion.Mr. Bishop does not \\"line up\\", or correspond, his version of events with the Zapruder film frames (which is unfortunate here), so we can only guess as to exactly WHEN on the Z-Film this first (missed) shot occurs via Bishop's narrative.But this version by Mr. Bishop (although very close to what I believe occurred) is probably incorrect in a few respects. One of which is the fact that (on the Z-Film) we can easily see that the President continues to wave after such a \\"Jim Bishop first shot which peppered JFK in the face\\" had to have occurred.JFK is still waving and smiling to the crowd on his right as late as Z188 (or so), which is just two seconds away from what is the \\"SBT Frame\\" (Z224) -- obviously not enough time for Oswald to shoot twice with his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.Then there's Mr. Bishop's more detailed account on Page 173 of what happened --- \\"The President of the United States, feeling the tiny grains hit his face, began to lift both hands upward in fright. He, perhaps better than anyone in the Plaza, understood the import: he had felt the sandy grains on his skin and he had heard the sound he feared.\\"If JFK had FELT \\"concrete spray\\" on his face well BEFORE Z188 (which he would have HAD to in an \\"Oswald is the Lone Assassin\\" scenario), I have a problem with seeing him still smiling and still waving as late as the Z180s.It's quite difficult to reconcile this account of the first shot in another way too. That being -- how could a missed shot that chipped concrete in the street to the REAR of the President's car send shards/fragments of concrete up and into a location to where JFK's face would be hit by them? Seems to me, in this scenario, Mr. Kennedy would have been struck on the back of his head/body, and not his \\"face\\". (Of course, in reality, the \\"JFK felt the concrete\\" account is all pure conjecture and just a wild guess on Mr. Bishop's part; and to add in these obviously-speculative remarks in his book -- when such a thing cannot possibly be proven, even remotely so -- is a bit too MUCH speculation regarding the matter, IMHO.)And: I also have a problem with Mr. Bishop's first-shot account (overall), in that he has this SAME shot that peppered the President in the face also rocketing across the Plaza and nicking James Tague as well. (In ADDITION, this same missile MUST have also done the damage to the street curb that we've seen in photos, which shows a \\"fresh\\" bullet mark on the curb by Tague.)Could this SAME bullet have struck the street (to the RIGHT REAR of the limo, per Bishop's account), and still have ricocheted in the correct direction to strike Tague and leave the obvious \\"bullet\\" mark on the curb?For such a well-researched and highly-detailed account of events, I find a few errors very odd and it's a bit hard to believe they sneaked through into the final finished edition of the book. .....Such as: Misspelling (badly) Charles Brehm's name. Bishop has him represented as \\"Charles Brend\\" in his only reference to Brehm in the volume. And he also has another mistake re. Brehm -- claiming that Brehm was \\"holding his five-year-old boy up to see the President\\" as the motorcade passed Brehm's position. This, of course, is wrong as well. Brehm was clapping the whole time, and was not \\"holding up\\" his son at all. Bishop also says Brehm was \\"on the sidewalk\\", which is also incorrect. There was no sidewalk where Brehm was standing; only grass. Small trivial errors, but noticeable nonetheless.And then there's also a minor error in the book pertaining to when Nellie Connally made her \\"You can't say Dallas doesn't love you\\" statement to President Kennedy just before the shooting. The book claims that this statement was made AFTER the Elm St. turn -- which is inaccurate. Nellie said this just after the Main-to-Houston Street turn (with photos even showing JFK leaning in towards Mrs. Connally on Houston St. to accept her words more clearly).\\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" is riveting reading, however. I enjoyed it greatly, except for a few minor mistakes. While reading Mr. Bishop's text, you get the feeling of going back in time, back to *before* that awful noon in Dealey Plaza, when the President was gunned down in the middle of the street. If only the reader of this book could somehow freeze the clock at 12:29 PM on November 22nd, and keep the horrible event of one minute later from occurring. But, sadly, the simple act of closing this book when you get to Page 177 (the head shot that killed the President) won't stop the assassination from taking place. Too bad such \\"magical\\" powers don't exist."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"This is a compelling book for assassination buffs such as myself, full of rich detail. I have lived in Fort Worth and Dallas, where Kennedy spent his last day, and the torrent of detail that spills out of this narrative animates the sites which I have visited so many times. There is this terrible mounting suspense as the main characters chitchat because you know what is going to happen. When Jack turns to Jackie and tells her to take her sunglasses off as they cross Turtle Creek in Dallas, a spot I've driven across many times, you fairly want to jump up and shout, &quot;SCREW THE GLASSES! STOP THE CAR AND GET OUT! THERE'S A MAN WITH A RIFLE AROUND THE CORNER WHO IS GOING TO KILL YOU!&quot; But they keep on going and there is no stopping them from driving on or you from reading through to the bitter end.What separates Bishop's account of the day from Manchester's account of the day is the Kennedy family's support of Manchester and their lack of support of Bishop. Consequently, Bishop is more apt to relate events that would be buffed out of any account edited by the Kennedys. You get much more of a raw look at the events. For example, Kennedy viciously chews out an Air Force general because the weather forecast was wrong, leading Jackie to dress too warmly in her pink wool outfit. The Kennedys would have edited out this petty bullying.Bishop also has a good feel for Oswald's mother, Marquerite, and Jack Ruby, both of whom were flaky to the point of insanity. Bishop could have delved a little deeper into Marquerite, a thoroughly annoying character. Once you understand Marquerite, you see where the madness began with Lee Harvey. Bishop also gives good insight into Jack Ruby, a major flake, by simply following him around as he weasels his way into the local action at fires, radio stations, and police stations with packages of sandwiches.My only criticism is that Bishop did not pay as careful attention to getting the details correct as I would have liked. For example, he calls a KC-135 aircraft that flew a fragment of Kennedy's skull from Fort Worth to DC a &quot;K-135.&quot; He says that the gun that Jack Ruby used to shoot Oswald was chrome plated. I've seen it on display in Dallas. It has a dull black finish like most handguns.However, even with those types of errors, this is the second best book on JFK's assassination, right behind Gerald Posner's account. I could not put it down. It pulled me along until I finished and then I wished it had gone on further."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"Jim Bishop's many years as a reporter stood him in good stead when he started this book which is a thorough piece of boilerplate journalism and a fine place to start navigating the Dallas maze. A skillful writer, Bishop is at his best detailing a 24-hour-period as a mosaic of events, each of which effects the outcome, which is unknown until it plays out. An unbiased reader of this book will be reminded of the power of many cliches along the lines of &quot;the best laid plans of mice and men oft gang awry...&quot; The book has two major flaws. The first is that Bishop was friendly with Kennedy and the horror of Kennedy's murder affected Bishop's judgment. In this sense it is reminiscent of Manchester's work. Both men had great trouble writing objectively and unemotionally about a friend's murder. The second problem is outlined in Bishop's opening to the work, which indicates a serious lack of cooperation extended toward him by Kennedy partisans. This, too, hurts the book. The book's biggest strengths are related to its attention to minute detail. He is particularly strong in showing how the nuts-and-bolts details of the day contributed mightily to Kennedy's death - and how those details work hard against a conspiracy. For example, planners of the trip regarded Dealey Plaza as essentially a freeway onramp. The planners fully expected small and hostile crowds rather than large and friendly ones. They expected a perfunctory motorcade and thought he would turn into Dealey Plaza at a much higher rate of speed than the fatal 10.5 MPH. Zooming toward freeway speed would have eliminated the risk of assassintation. Kennedy himself ordered the car to drive slowly because the crowds were far, far bigger and much friendlier than anyone expected - and he could not turn down an opportunity to politic. This is the kind of critically important detail conspirators could not have planned - but which is irrelevant to a disturbed sniper. Weather considerations, Jackie's indisposition, Oswald's lack of a car, all these details played roles in the events as they played out. It is unlikely this book will convince any skeptics, but someone with a truly open mind will come away with a clear understanding that a thousand-and-one independent factors each had to occur exactly as it did for the murder to take place. Personally, I feel that there were two many wild cards in play in Dallas for serious conspirators to choose it as a murder site. The quality of the writing varies from good to purple and there are mistakes and some sensationalism which mar the work. I would say that the book is a good look at what happened in Dallas and helps place some solid limits on the wilder conspiracy theories."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"I have no idea why this book is no longer in print. Jim Bishop wrote an earlier book about the day Lincoln was killed (\\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\") that is still in print (and it's great), but this one has apparently fallen out of favor. Strange.So why a minute-by-minute examination of a single day, even a day as momentous as this one? That's not necessarily an easy question to answer; it is a kind of subset history genre, the close examination of Kennedy's death, or Lincoln's, or Christ's, or 9/11, etc. On first blush it might seem of value only to the researcher writing from a larger historical perspective, but in fact a work of history with this kind of focus can be far more interesting than any other approach to the subject. In the case of JFK, the incredible tension that builds naturally from a chronicle of the day he was killed makes for a more thrilling story than a novel on the same subject could ever hope to achieve.The book follows not only Kennedy but all the players, Jackie, Oswald, his mother & his wife, LBJ, RFK, J.D. Tippett, and so on. At times these separate strands converge, but mostly they're followed separately and Bishop does a masterful job of keeping all the threads tight. It's hard to imagine the amount of research and organization that went into telling this story so cleanly, because it is certainly one of the most confusing, contradictory days in world history, but Bishop makes it look easy. He is a brilliant storyteller, and anyone will tell you that is what a great reporter has to be. It's not just the facts, ma'am, it's the narrative drive, and this one moves like a supercharged Hummer.So why has it fallen out of print? And why has another book on the same topic, William Manchester's \\"Death of a President,\\" also fallen out of print? I'm not much on conspiracy theories; there's nothing in either book that the \\"military-industrial complex\\" would find terribly distressing. Bishop does mention several eyewitnesses who saw or heard shots coming from the famous grassy knoll---as, incidentally, do the live news accounts of November 22---but by far most of the evidence Bishop (and Manchester) collects points squarely at Lee Harvey Oswald. I think this excellent book is out of print now because people just don't care who killed Kennedy anymore, and they certainly aren't interested in a blow-by-blow account of the assassination.To say this is \\"too bad\\" would be an understatement of biblical proportions. Every day, every hour, we are losing our sense of wonder and curiosity about our country, and we are most particularly forgetting the lessons the Sixties taught us: don't trust the official story. They may be right (in this case, I think they actually are: I believe Oswald did act alone and the \\"coverup\\" all these years has been the CIA, FBI, Dallas police dept., etc. covering up how incompetent and ineffectual they were protecting Kennedy that day), but you should ALWAYS look into the story for yourself. Books like \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" (and Oliver Stone's masterwork film \\"JFK\\") help us do that, by marshalling all the available information into a powerful narrative thrust. If we forget, or more importantly if we simply cease to care, then the ones who want us to sleep our lives away have won before we're even out of the starting gate.Read this book, not just because it is about one of the most important days in American history, and not just because it is a remarkably well-written thriller, but also because it is important, SO important, that we never forget this man and how he died and the lessons his death taught us."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"\\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" is one of the most well written books I've read so far this year!! At first glance, this book is like looking at a script of the TV series \\"24\\", but sadly Jack Bauer wasn't there to help and the tragic events of November 22nd, 1963 were not fictional, but a tragic reality. How an authour, yet alone anyone, can piece together the events of a single day in such mintue detail is beyond me. The scenes he masterully recreates make the reader feel like they are there. This book was gripping and hard to put down! The only thing that this book lacks (while taking nothing away from the theme and I suspect, the intent of the book) is an exploration of possible conspiracy theories. (If you're looking for another \\"conspiracy\\" book, this one is NOT for you) But if you're looking for a complete account of that day's events. (The book's chapters are divided into hourly sagments running from 7AM-3AM CST) this is THE ONE! I would recomend this book as an ideal source to use if you're writing a report about that fateful day. I would defy anyone to match its exactness of detail!"},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"Since Nov. 1963 thousands of books have been written about the events of the 22nd. Forty years later it's interesting to look back.In preparation for a trip to Dallas, I read THE DAY KENNEDY WAS SHOT. As the owner of many, many books on JFK and the assassination and a real Kennedy buff, I had a lot to chose from. In fact, I had started Manchester's NOVEMBER 1963.If you want a real feel for the time period and the chaos of that terrible day in Dallas, I would recommend Bishop. For those of us who loved John Kennedy, it's refreshing to read about JFK with out the comments about his womanizing. You see him as a loving family man with a totally devoted staff. In some respects I probably learned more details that I wanted to know. If you want to read about the autopsy and the embalming and all the minor details of the day, this should be your pick. YOu find that lots of people are shown to clay feet, especially Jackie.Even if you are a conspiracy buff, it's interesting to see the roots of some of the theories that emerged over the next 40 years. For instance, I found the comments about the relationship between Jackie and Bobbie interesting because some years ago someone alleged that they had an affair after JFK's death.The descriptions of the blacks in the tale are interesting. Comments are made like &quot;a Negro man...&quot; But this was 1963. I did however think that Bishop glorified JFK's civil rights record.If you want to feel &quot;The Way We Were&quot; in 1963 and the real personal tradegy of the day read this book. JFK lost his life, but a nation lost its innocence. His staff and cabinet lost a friend and cause.

American President, served from January 20, 1961 until he was assassinated in Dallas-Texas on November 22, 1963.During his short term in office important events took place and some of their effects, after forty-four years, are still living with us up to this day.For instance, Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, Cuban Missile Crises and his confrontation with Nikita Khrushchev - American U2 Spy Plane.The establishment of the Berlin Wall and USA subsequent estrangement with USSR.The Space Race with the Soviets and his solemn promise to America to outpace USSR by pushing research and development of the Space Program.The beginning of Vietnam crises.The energetic inauguration of American Civil rights.The book referred to all the above, but did not touch base with something equally important.Israel.The Negev Nuclear Research Centre located about ten kilometres to the south Dimona in Israel.It has never been a secret that in 1958, the French helped Israel construct the centre.{{{The year 1958 was filled with open unrest in the Middle East. a) Union between Egypt and Syria. b) Civil disturbances in the Lebanon c) Coup in Iraq - suspected as communists. d) The Marines landed in Lebanon, and e) The height of the Algerian Revolution and its adverse impact on the Franco-Egyptian relations}}}.Nevertheless, officially the centre was built as nuclear reactor to help produce additional power for \`desalination plant' to water the Negev desert.The world concluded that the purpose of Dimona was not as announced. Israel constructed it to build nuclear weapons. The Arab world, estranged with Israel since day one, suspected the Israelis were applying a policy shrouded in ambiguity and equivocation.Dimona began active work in the beginning of 1962 and was able to produce plutonium. Arab university professors gathered in Cairo and their forum reached the conclusion that enriched uranium was also produced.USA intelligence was able to assess the purpose of Dimona since the beginning of 1960 and insisted that Israel should agree to comply with international standards of \`inspection' (Israel never signed the Nuclear non-Proliferation Pact that began late in 1960).Indeed, Ben Gurion agreed to international inspection provided 1) Inspectors are USA citizens or under the sole supervision of the USA, and 2) that Israel would receive advance notice of the schedule of inspection.Some suspected that since Israel was able to receive advance warning of the date of inspection, it was a lot easy to makeover, hide, evade, and cover, ahead of time, sensitive data at the site away from the scrutinizing eyes of the inspectors.The inspectors informed USA administration of their qualms and complained that their work, in the absence of professional surprise check, would be rendered futile, useless and a waste of time. The inspectors didn't agree to any restrictions put to them by the Israelis concerning the \`areas' or \`the facilities' they intended to check.Ben Gurion was adamant \\"there will be no surprise visits\\", and Kennedy was determined to \`go by the book', \`the inspectors should apply the guidelines to the letter and produce their appraisal, independently, as in any other place in the world.

For all the Stephen King, Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, Dean Koontz etc. that I have read, with their simulated violence sometimes so over the top that it makes me cringe, I have never been more sickened by an account of an evil deed than when Bishop describes the bullets hitting Kennedy and Connelly, with such cataclismic effect. This book should not be ignored--though I notice it is out of print and all the available copies are used ones. Let it go away from us, and history will repeat itself again, in a year, 10, or 100--another man with a gun will think he's doing the country, the world or himself, a favor by ending a presidency with a bullet."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"This book was an AP U.S. History assignment and it terrified me because I had less than a week to read it. Fortunately, the book is a quick read and the 700 pages went by pretty fast. If you do not like history, this probably isn't the book for you for obvious reasons.To sum it up, its well written, but could have been half the length (the beginning and end drags a bit) and just as informative."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"This book isn't as accurate as The Day Lincoln Was Shot. Jim Bishop, is accurate for most of the events that took place on November 22, 1963, except the facts about Lee Harvey Oswald. His statements about Oswald waiting for Kennedy on the 6th floor of the School Book Depository is flying in the face of all the eyewitnesses. No one saw Oswald on the 6th floor. He was seen on the 2nd floor five minutes before and 90 seconds after the assassination. Many people ran to the Grassy Knoll and not the School Book Depository after the assassination.Bishop's statements about Oswald's mother trying to cash in on her son's death is wrong. She proclaimed her son's innocence to the day she died. If you watch the films of Oswald's funeral service, she's crying. Bishop tries to make you believe that she was a bad woman who raised a bad son.If you want to find out the facts of the Kennedy assassination, this book isn't the one for you. It condemns a man who was \\"just a patsy\\", as he said the day before he himself was murdered."},{"Title":"The Day Kennedy Was Shot","review":"From the opening sequence depicting the alleged events in the Kennedy's suite at the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth that morning, complete with the character's imaginary thoughts, one immediately gains the uncomfortable impression that Mr. Bishop is merely making this stuff up. His detailed analysis of those fateful 60 seconds in Dealey Plaza is worse than conjecture, it is utterly IMPOSSIBLE. Not only does he treat us to a detailed description of Oswald's alleged actions and even thoughts as he supposedly sits in that window in the School Book Depository (from which we now know at least some of the shots could not have been fired) with a complete absence of witnesses or testimony, he then goes on to describe how the first bullet missed, hit the street BEHIND the car yet managed to spray the occupants in their FACES with \\"cement dust\\", and then somehow ricocheted over, under, or around the car to then hit the curb two streets away and account for Mr. Tague's facial injuries. Not only is this feat of physics utterly impossible, it is not recounted in this manner by one single witness to these events. Even if the reader were predisposed to believe that Mr. Oswald acted alone, which not only is not plausible but is not possible in the face of known evidence, it is ridiculous to imagine that Mr. Bishop would know it to be due to Oswald's wife and mother not treating him sufficiently like a \\"man\\". The concept of an impartial analysis of the day's events is an interesting one, but having amassed quite an assassination library myself I would strongly recommend that this early apologist effort be passed over. You can get a better accounting of the details with a great deal less spin in Jim Marrs' \\"Crossfire\\"."},{"Title":"A course of modern analysis,: An introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions,","review":"This book isn't Modern anymore. Thank God! It is certainly the most useful book of mathematics I ever put my hands on. If you read its page of contents, you'll call it prophetic! Every kind of function he studied became important in theoretical physics some time. String theory was started with an amplitude containing only Gamma functions. Renormalization, reborn from the ashes, discovered the Zeta-function (in Whittaker-Watson, for sure), Legendre's less familiar functions were prominent in Regge pole theory (again, the source was Whittaker), and even the Theta functions became important for some field theory skirmishes. You could travel light: Whittaker, Watson, tooth brush, etc. It's not only what there is in it. It's also the fact that it's done better! Consider this: I had once an ugly series to sum up. These were the days before Maple! I couldn't find it anywhere, having looked into immense mathematical tables. I came back to old Whittaker and there it was: in an e! xercise, asking you to prove that the sum of MY series was some function he wrote in all detail! This is Whittaker-Watson.

Shame on CUP for reprinting it in less than perfectly top quality. I guess they know that people will always buy it. It is a book that starts from the very basics of real and complex analysis, and moves on to the very depths of classical special functions. It's a joy to read and to teach from. No respectable mathematical physicist can afford not to own a copy.

It was terribly hard to track down and I had to pay a fortune for it. Be glad it's now in reprint. This book is probably in more bibliographies than any other in the 20th century mathematics. For that reason alone it's worth every penny. The book is all business with little extraneous comments, applications, or excursions that often make higher mathematics such a joy. That being said, the 608 pages cover a lot of ground which is probably why it is on so many reference lists.Despite it's fanfare in the mathematic communitiy, the subjects dealt arise from physics and engineering rather than pure mathematics. I don't think there is a chapter without practical application. Unlike many more recent texts on the subject, the authors cover Theta Functions and Elliptic Functions (Jacobian and Weistrass).This is definitely a Hall of Famer in the Math Universe."},{"Title":"A course of modern analysis,: An introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions,","review":"The DEFINITIVE text for classical AnalysisThis book is the definitive text in classical Mathematical Analysis. It was first published in 1902 and the fact that it is still in print is testimony to it's wide ranging utility and appeal.It should be noted that this text is not for those who are new to the rigour of Analysis; its presentation is suitable for a final year undergraduate or for the post-graduate student. More importantly, its wide ranging content of proofs and results would also prove useful to the Physicist.The first part of the book covers the &quot;essentials&quot; of analysis: continuity, differentiability, summation of series, convergence and uniform convergence, and the theory of the Riemann integral. Subsequent chapters quickly but comprehensively develop the theory of analytic functions, the theorems of Cauchy, Laurent, and Liouville and the calculus of residues. These chapters knit very well into the earlier presentation of the basic processes of analysis! The pleasing thing is that despite the passage of time and the advent of hundreds of books on Complex Variable Theory, Whittaker and Watson's treatment still bears a mark of freshness and rigour.Also included is a comprehensive treatment of expanding functions in infinite series and asymptotic expansions and summability of series. For completeness, the text also covers the theory of linear differential equations and Fourier series.The second part of the book is what stands it apart from the rest. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of the major transcendental functions: Gamma, Zeta, Hypergeometric, Legendre, and Bessel to name the more commonly encountered ones. The treatment is rigorous but the copious number of examples provides opportunity to learn the theory and apply it. Lots of apparently obscure results, many that would be useful in Physics applications, are cited as examples.The latter chapters presents a treatment of Elliptic, Theta and Mathieu functions.Overall, Whittaker and Watson will continue to be the guiding light for any serious scholar of classical analysis and an excellent reference point for the solutions to the fundamental equations of Mathematical Physics. Even though I am not a practising Mathematician, I find this a pleasant book to dip into: there's always a little surprise and something new to learn.This book will live forever!"},{"Title":"A course of modern analysis,: An introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions,","review":"I decided to purchase this title about three months ago after hearing lots of praise about it on the internet and wanting to learn the subject, and I can now see that this praise was not exaggerated. A hundred years after its first publication, this classic still remains the definitive general reference in the field of special functions and is a very solid textbook in its own right.The book is split into two main parts: the first consists of short (but detailed) overviews of the various sub-disciplines of analysis from which results are required to develop later results, and the second part is devoted to developing the theories of the various kinds of special functions. The sheer breadth of topics and material that this book covers is utterly incredible. The major topics covered in the first part of the book are convergence theorems, integration-related theories, series expansions of functions and differential/integral equation theories, each of which are split into two or three chapters. The reader is assumed to be familiar with some of the subjects here and these chapters are intended more as a review, but they are still quite self-contained and will also appeal to those who have not encountered the subjects yet. (I am only 16 and know no more than ODEs and a little real analysis, but I learned some material from this)The second section, which is really the heart of the book, starts off with a detailed treatment of the fundamental gamma and related functions, followed by a chapter on the famous zeta function and its unusual properties. The book then covers the hypergeometric functions - the focus is on the 1F1 and 2F1 types, being ODE solutions - which are perhaps the cornerstone of this field, followed the special cases of Bessel and Legendre functions. There are a number of ways of developing and teaching the ideas regarding these functions; this book mainly uses the differential equation approach, starting by defining these functions as solutions to ODEs and going from there. There is also a chapter on physics applications (using these functions to solve physics equations), which is sure to please the more applied math readers. The next three chapters are devoted to elliptic functions, covering the theta, Jacobi and Weierstrass types. (one chapter on each) The two remaining chapters are on Mathieu functions and ellipsoidal harmonic functions. Along the way, some additional functions are also sometimes mentioned in the problem sets. (barnes G, appell, and a few others) About the only room for improvement here would be some analyses of named integrals (EI, fresnel, etc.) and inverse functions (lambert W log, inverse elliptics, etc.), and perhaps more on multivariable hypergeometrics, but these things are not a big deal considering how much else appears in here, and I have not really seen any book out there that covers these anyway.Each chapter has several subsections, usually one on each major theorem or property of the function in question, and these consist of the main discussion and proof, a few corollaries, and a couple of exercises that illustrate the usage of the theorem. At the end of the chapter, some more sets of problems are given; these mostly consist of proving identities and formulas involving the functions, so answers are not needed, but it would be nice if there was a showed-work solutions book available for students. The problems themselves are very well designed and some really require the use of novel methods of proof to obtain the result. The language is a bit in the older style with some unconventional spelling and usage, but it does not detract from the subject material at all (actually, I personally liked this form of writing), and the price is about right.The only real complaint I have with this book has nothing to do with its content; it is the printing quality. The text font is simply too small in a number of places and also sometimes looks \\"washed out;\\" while it is still readable, such a classic gem as this definitely deserves a better effort on the publisher's part. (one of CUP's other works on the same subject, Special Functions by Andrews et al, has much better printing, although is not as good as this in other respects)For those interested in the field of special functions and looking for something to start off with, A Course of Modern Analysis would be, hands down, my first recommendation. You cannot really do much better than this."},{"Title":"A course of modern analysis,: An introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions,","review":"Although I was aware that he'd read other books, and knew much more than is taught here, this was (in my years as his grad student) the only book that I saw Lars Onsager pull off his shelf, well-worn and dog-eared, it was! It's one of the many 'Onsager tales' that circulate among his former students and postdocs that he'd worked through all the problems in this text (just for mental exercise) as undergrad at NTH. One can believe it if one takes the trouble to read his Ph.D. dissertation on weak electrolytes, where a pde is solved exactly by using an 'extremely inventive' method based on complex analysis (the dissertation lies in Yale's Beineke library). I later used the book, along with Stakgold (on boundary-value problems) to teach a first semester grad 'math methods' course to physics and engineering students. I must say that in that time the grad students had no difficulty working the problems, although I certainly did not assign the hardest ones (Tripos...). I usually went as far in series expansions and complex variables as the Mittag-Leffler expansion, spending about a half a semester on W&W before switching to delta functions, boundaty value problems, and Stakgold.

When I first sat down to read it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This is the only book I have ever seen on complex analysis (or any scientific field for that matter) in which the authors cover so much material (everything from residues to integral equations to elliptic functions and MUCH more) and yet manage to make the whole text fit into a framework which is relatively easy to follow, even for someone completely new to complex analysis. Moreover, the majority of the many hundreds of excercizes in this book range from moderately to nail-bitingly hard, and encourage a true understanding of the material being covered. I would reccommend this book for ANYONE who has mastered basic calculus and analysis and wishes to begin learning complex analysis and the theory of special functions. The book's coverage of the following topics is especially noteworthy: The gamma function (the book uses the INFINITE PRODUCT as the basic definition), the hypergeometric function (and the confluent hypergeometric function), bessel functions (a field in which G.N. Watson was a leading expert), and the Weirstrassian and Jacobean elliptic functions and theta functions (I LOVED the intuitive development of the theory of the elliptic functions, which is made to parrallel that of the trigonometric functions, which are of course familiar to the reader). I would ESPECIALLY recommend this book for those pursuing SELF-STUDY (although it is NOT for the mathematically weak-of-heart, but no book on the topic is), as it is quite self-contained and readable for a book on complex analysisis.

Neville's father was George Wentworth Watson who was a schoolmaster, but is more famous for his work as a genealogist. He played a large role in the publication of The Complete Peerage, a 13-volume database of the British peerage, generally accepted as the greatest British achievement in the field of genealogy. The first edition was published in London between 1887 and 1898. George and Mary Watson had two children, a boy and a girl, the eldest being Neville.Neville was educated at St Paul's School in London where he was very fortunate to have the outstanding teacher of mathematics Francis Macaulay. He mixed with equally outstanding pupils, for Littlewood, less than a year older than Watson, was also a pupil at the school. Having won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, Watson matriculated there in 1904. At this time there were three young fellows of Trinity all of whom had a major influence on Watson's mathematics. They were Whittaker, Barnes, and Hardy. Perhaps the one from this trio who had the greatest influence on him was Whittaker, despite the fact that he left Cambridge in 1906, two years after Watson began his studies there.Watson graduated as Senior Wrangler in 1907 (meaning that he was ranked in first position among those who were awarded First Class degrees), completing the Mathematical Tripos in the following year in the second division of the First Class. He won a prestigious Smith's Prize in 1909, becoming a Fellow of Trinity College in 1910. This was particularly pleasing to him for he had a great love of his College, and throughout his life he collected prints of the College and of previous Fellows.After election to his Trinity fellowship, Watson spent four further years in Cambridge before leaving to take up an assistant lectureship in University College, London. From 1918 to 1951 he was Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at Birmingham. He married Elfrida Gwenfil Lane, the daughter of a farmer from Holbeach in Lincolnshire, in 1925. They had one son.Watson worked on a wide variety of topics, all within the area of complex variable theory, such as difference equations, differential equations, number theory and special functions. He is best known as a joint author with Whittaker of A Course of Modern Analysis published in 1915. The first edition of the book has only Whittaker as an author. In 1922 Watson published The theory of Bessel functions which was another masterpiece. Titchmarsh wrote of Watson's books (see for example [2]):-Here one felt was mathematics really happening before one's eyes. ... the older mathematical books were full of mystery and wonder. With Professor Watson we reached the period when the mystery is dispelled though the wonder remains.One piece of work undertaken by Watson deserves special mention. It involves the problem of wireless waves, which were quickly found to travel long distances despite the fact that theoretically they should not have been able to follow the curvature of the Earth. A mathematical model had been constructed where the Earth was represented by a partially conducting sphere surrounded by an infinite dielectric. Such a model had been used by Macdonald, Rayleigh, Poincar&eacute;, Sommerfeld and others. Although Watson was not interested in how best to model the situation, he was, however, very interested in using his expertise to determine mathematical solutions to the given model which others might then check against observations. He obtained solutions to the problem in 1918 which showed conclusively that the model was not a satisfactory one.In 1902 Heaviside had predicted that there was an conducting layer in the atmosphere which allowed radio waves to follow the Earth's curvature. This layer in the atmosphere, now called the Heaviside layer, was only a conjecture in 1918 but it was suggested to Watson that, having shown the previous model to be wrong, he now look at the model resulting from the postulated Heaviside layer. Watson showed that if the layer was about 100 km above the Earth's surface and it had a certain conductivity, then indeed the solutions obtained closely matched observations. That Heaviside, and Watson, were correct was confirmed in 1923 when the existence of the layer was proved experimentally when radio pulses were transmitted vertically upward and the returning pulses from the reflecting layer were received.Watson undertook a major project by examining in detail Ramanujan's notebooks, extending his results and supplying proofs. In fact he wrote twenty-five papers relating to results in Ramanujan's notebooks, and he spent many hours making a hand written copy in wonderful script of all the notebooks. He enjoyed numerical calculations and spent many happy hours doing numerical work on his calculating machine.He was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1919. In 1946 he received the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society:-... in recognition of his distinguished contributions to pure mathematics in the field of mathematical analysis and in particular for his work on asymptotic expansion and on general transforms.Watson was also very active in his support for the London Mathematical Society. He served as secretary from 1919 to 1933, president from 1933 to 1935 and acted as an editor of the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society until 1946. The Society awarded him their De Morgan Medal in 1947. The Royal Society of Edinburgh elected him to an honorary fellowship.We find a little of Watson's personality described in [2]:-He was the university's expert on the timetable; students with unusual combinations of subjects usually had to be referred to him for advice, and for many years after his retirement the dates of the academic year were governed by the &quot;Watsonian cycle&quot;. ... He took great trouble with the style of his letters and his conversation and enjoyed finding a pungent phrase to express his points of view or his criticism ... he made no secret of his aversion to cars, telephones, and fountain pens. He loved trains - whose timetables were as familiar to him as those of the university lectures - and unusual stamps.Article by: J J O'Connor and E F Robertson"},{"Title":"A course of modern analysis,: An introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions,","review":"1- The book is not printed.

The book works because of the understated and slyly entertaining way that it goes about unraveling the Enron bankruptcy. It is particularly effective because rather than being all preachy and sanctimonious, it presents all the necessary facts and background material to let the reader reach her own conclusions.The real clue to what the book is about is in the section at the end of the book called \\"The Enron Files,\\" which contains copies of everything from deal approval sheets that are missing Jeffrey Skilling's signature to the \\"suicide note\\" left by Cliff Baxter. These exhibits, though some of them are difficult to read given that they were reduced to fit on a single page, give the whole Enron case a certain X-Files quality. Indeed, the book reads a lot like what Special Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder might have written about the case--combining Scully's scientific objectivity with Mulder's talent for psychological profiling of the major perps--in this case Lay, Skilling, and Fastow. Like any good X-Files episode, it raises more questions that it answers. What is truly scary about the whole affair is that there is no alien conspiracy to blame it on, just the lax governmental oversight that Enron bought and paid for with its campaign contributions.What Went Wrong at Enron is certainly not the last word on this scandal and deals only tangentially with the other scandals that are popping up all around it.

It is an interesting and entertaining look at how Enron fell because of deeply corrupt business practices. However, the author does not explain many of the business terms and ventures as well as he should have, with a title that states it should be readable for everyone.It is not overly complex, but you should have some background in business to truly understand some of the ways that Enron messed up. Nevertheless, this is a well-written book that tells an astonishing story. It is unbelievable that the people who were in power at Enron were so bold."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"Fusaro, P. and Miller, R. M., 2003. What went wrong at Enron, Everyone's guide to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. John Wiley and Sons, paperback, 240 p.The moral and cultural lessons of Enron range from the need for ethical behaviour, grounding in truthfulness, honesty, transparency and a need for complete disclosure in accounting and corporate structure. This is the ultimate source of insight into how it all happened. Other sources also point to the underlying dangers represented by a betrayal of trust within the capitalism market system.The Enron style of approach to flourish in newly deregulated energy and utility markets that have been engineered by governments since the mid 1980s. The levels of executive culpability and it shows the decay and or frailty of underlying value systems which should stand against such events. The events and actions that led to Enron's demise have far more and significant implications to the fate and quality of our own society.But is Enron a systemic problem or is the ultimate problem the nature of market capitalism itself. If the latter then to avoid more Enron's it is necessary to have moral and ethical tethers to clearly defined absolute terms such as right and wrong (good and evil) in a corporate business environment, otherwise concepts on which an economic system depends, such as trust between all participants, will ultimately breakdown.Internally, the dynamics of the Enron enterprise set out in this book show a salutary lesson of what should not be present in an apparently healthy and profitable corporate enterprise: failure of 'knowledge conditions', senior management being isolated from those at operational levels (?); individuals pursuing sub-goals that are contrary to overall corporate goals; restrictions on the flows of bad news as opposed to any positive 'spin'.The underlying causes of an Enron outcome are in fact within the nature of corporations themselves. Their hierarchical structure, limited span of control, self-interest, limited discourse and intimidatory corporate culture all point to a flaw in the nature of many public-listed corporations. Some suggest that the Enron case is one which warrants a revaluation of the shareholder centric model of corporations; management actions should not longer be orientated at maximising the current share price.Some see the lessons of Enron as being a company that, when in trouble, was unwilling to admit its own shortcomings and thus became driven to cover-up a few bad decisions by making even worse ones. An early admission and some critical changes in operations could have saved the trading side of the business. Instead profit growth at all costs an unwillingness to admit that poor decisions had been made, led to even more exaggeration and fraudulent reporting.The key problem with Enron was that it had all the surfical signs of a good corporate citizen in place with corporate social responsibility, business ethics tools and status symbols all in place. The greatest danger is that the Enron situation is not atypical of many aspects of many corporate organisations: those who closed their eyes to wrong doings (in Enron) were rewarded; others who sought to give warnings were punished; the win-at-all-costs mentality. The Enron lesson is that business is in the long term only going to survive by virtue of developing and following ethical behaviour. No one single error occurred just the compounding of many errors, all of which were preventable. It was based on a success at all cost culture where the ends always justified the means.Enron is not explicable as just ethical and moral failure without examining why these failures occurred. Enron was a corporate product of both willingness to bend the rules and the opportunity to bend them. Others suggest that there are limited lessons to be learnt from the Enron story: that is to say Enron is bankrupt because of speculation and legal but unsound accounting and financing schemes. This view suggests that this proves that the free-market works; speculators and those at the margin of the market must suffer as and when the market turns. As such Enron investors were punished by the stock market for their poor judgment. The energy markets adjusted to Enron's collapse with few problems. As for the stock market crash, well, booms and busts are a natural part of a healthy capitalist economy.A must have book for anyone who wants to know the inside story.Other academic reading:.

It's a concise retelling of the events, so that's nice. But it imparts no greater understanding or context. Among the problems: The writing is bland. The book gives almost no explanation for Enron's rise before the calamitous fall. It never makes clear exactly why Enron had to go bankrupt. This account spends hardly any time on Arthur Andersen's role, even thought it led to that accounting firm's ruin. The authors also have an odd obsession with Michael Milken, even though he seems peripheral to the Enron story. If you've missed the news in the past seven months, this book can quickly give you the outline of the Enron saga. Otherwise, save your money."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"Let me start by admitting that I lost a tidy sum of money in the whole Enron disaster and would be happy never to see that word again. Then I saw Richard Pachter's rave review of this book in the Miami Herald and figured that maybe I could learn something from reading it. I had no idea of some of the things that Enron up to (criminal problems as far back as the 1980s) and the authors do an excellent job of fitting all the pieces together. I only wish that someone could for once write a book like this before disaster strikes."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"The book was thrown together.

Fascinating reading."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"Enron's greed and financial scandals, along with the rise and fall, are interesting in itself. This book, though it does explain the fall and is easily readable, isn't intriguing enough to capture the reader's attention. In fact, more than half is a description of how Enron came to be and what there business model is. A chunk of the book is just photocopied evidence pasted in the appendix. Only a minute section describes the scandal and accounting frauds.The author loves anologies. He devotes pages to baseball card trading, and then sort of compares it to Enron's business. While these analogies help with understanding the business model, it's often over-simplified with a glaring lack of details. What I found was a lack of hard numbers and statistics which meant I couldn't put the failings into perspective. Also, the first half of the book where he details Enron, he seems to be praising their business, then hand wavingly, he points to a few corrupted examples. It almost appears that the author thinks Enron would still be a powerhouse if it wasn't for a few specific incidents.As a book, it gets the job done. It shows the errors of Enron in a way that any non financial person could understand. It does tend to oversimplify, and it's glaring lack of numbers and details hurt it in the end."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"\\"What Went Wrong With Enron' desrves some credit for trying to quickly explain the collapse of the company just six months after it declared bankruptcy.

Gas producers and consumers sought ways to hedge unpredictable costs and variable supply. Enron's contribution was to develop customized contracts that met the needs of the market, broker the deals as an intermediary, or act as a party to the contract. Offering the contracts on the internet was another innovative plus for what had been a sleepy Houston utility. Not by chance, CEO Ken Lay was an economist and student of market dynamics. If the strategy made money in the gas industry, why not expand it to other areas in need of a market maker to control risk. Authors Fusaro and Miller see a company mesmerized with its ability to to be that key market maker in an expanding range of areas that would include water supply, pollution credits, weather-related risks, etc. And why not export the strategy to other countries. So, Fusaro and Miller see hubris at work, a company arrogantly moving beyond its core competency in energy matters. For them it is primarily a market story. There are some brief observations about Enron's hothouse work culture and morality in the markets. But in the end, the authors' view of Enron is that of a company that created a market and was crushed by it. Debt, competition, inadequate planning, and the loss of investor confidence brought them to bankruptcy helped by a few, dubious 'special purpose entity' (SPE) deals. They may be right. But what will occupy the courts for years will be the less abstract tales of greed, fraud, and dereliction of duty. There is the sad failure of auditor Arthur Andersen to function in its role as, well, auditor. Also: I can find no comment on the board of directors (What they didn't do and why they didn't). WHAT WENT WRONG at ENRON is a less than complete picture of the matter, but it does provide a perspective that saves us from puzzling over Enron's explanations of its SPE's, the company's filings and footnotes that strangle meaning, and the ethical failings of desperate people."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"I just picked up the first Enron book to market. What Went Wrong At Enron does a great job pulling the story together. The approach is simple and discusses all the key events and people.

Thousands and hundreds investors, including Enron&iexcl;s employees who vested their retirement benefits in the s401k plan solely with Enron shares&iexcl;K..The horrible downfall alarmed the investment community, hurt the professional society (accountant, lawyer, underwriter etc.) and credibility of the monitoring commission&iexcl;K. The U.S. government reacted with the new legislation (Sabanes-Oxley Act) as an &iexcl;attempt&iexcl; to tackle the problem, trying to put the company&iexcl;s management back on track to shoulder its fiduciary duty to the company&iexcl;s shareholder. But, does it work? The extent to which the various parties&iexcl; responsibilities is still clouded.If we do not really analyze the root causes which led to the Enron&iexcl;s downfall, we never know the answer. This book, written with the targeted general audience, is published at the right time to give the public a good chance to find the ashes in the smoke. At least for the moment.According to this book, the tragedy was played by an arrogant CEO, greedy senior executive, loyal whistleblower, with the backdrop of a wrongly conceived free economy principle. The book is well written and gives insightful analyses based on the available evidence and traces. Some of the factors leading to the tragedy noted by the authors are:*X The use of SPE (Special Purpose Vehicles) in accounting to keep off the accounting profits as well as to hide the potential liabilities*X The constantly fearing environment built by the Corporate Culture emphasizing on a sense of urgency*X Over-extension of operations in the deregulated energy and telecommunication market*X Mark-to-market accounting principles*X Less than full company&iexcl;s disclosure tendency*X Valuation problem of customized contracts* Making commitment as a counter-party to every trade in arbitrage markets*X Trading from natural gas to electricity to bandwidth to 1800 different products in the Enron online*X Conflicting company&iexcl;s strategy: asset-lite vs. debt heavy financed investments*X Manipulated earning estimated to meet expectations*X Deals financed by high Enron&iexcl;s stock price*X Excessive investment in optic fibre networksThe list could go on and on. In fact, Enron went to the extent that deals were made just for the sake of making them. The more you read about the book, the more you feel it is a Shakespearean tragedy &iexcl;V things are certain to get worse with all of these interrelated factors playing on stage. The general audience, those who believed that the play had a good ending, bought the tickets but found that the play was ultimately turn out to be a tragic one. They suffered. However, the director said: &iexcl;You bought the tickets because you believed in the play had a good ending. I didn&iexcl;t say that it would end in that way.&iexcl; Refund? No.The investigation into Enron&iexcl;s alleged sham trading and potential fraud scheme is still in progress as of this writing&iexcl;K..I highly recommend the book to the general readers, although it is better if you are financially literate. It is a thought-provoking and interesting read, especially to the CPAs."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History","review":"This book really helped me to understand the Enron scandal.

Baxter was about the only high-ranking figure to preserve any sense that Enron's monkeyshines were unethical. His suicide has not been fully resolved to be indeed a suicide and, as the authors of this book point out, the note is in block letters.Block letters MAY have been used to conceal something darker and about the same time they were used by the Anthrax mailer. I do not mean to imply anything unprovable. That's because I am well aware that at a certain level we despair of getting at the truth about the behavior of people with power, from OJ Simpson to the JFK assassination.But what is in plain view is a breakdown in trust.The ability of Enron to construct a financial fantasy, in which debt was off-loaded to new entities constructed at light speed, is not something that could be done with manual technology, or implemented by lower-level and midlevel personnel with job security.Starting with OMB director David Stockman's use of a primitive facility of the first spreadsheet (Visicalc) to present a \\"balanced\\" budget to President Reagan which then deprived social and welfare agencies of funding in midyear, automated technology has enabled the transformation of accounting into literature.Unfortunately, what was produced was not odes or haikus. Instead, people with 401Ks during the Nineties actually believed their future to be secure for a change, only to find themselves the victims of a fictional narrative. This is because the degringolade happens quite fast, in modern systems, in reverse.This book shows the dangers of the \\"employment at will\\" doctrine.In the 1980s during the first wave of downsizing, metro newspapers had a large number of ads from law firms promising redress in case of termination. These ads have disappeared because the appeals bar, in the 1990s, rescusitated the old doctrine that the law is not interested in an unfair termination, except in cases of racial discrimination...with age discrimination gradually falling from favor as realistically actionable.One member of the Federal bench, Richard Posner, wrote an essay around this time in defense of employment at will and in response to a legal scholar's attempt to show that a less arm's length relationship made for stronger families and communities. One gets the sense from most of Posner's writings that, quite over the heads of the ordinary people at Enron, a sort of Euro style *KulturKampf* was being conducted.By the time of Enron's hey-day, termination could not be questioned and was a managed process at most companies. Books about how to handle termination described the employee, not as potentially just mad as hell but as \\"distraught.\\"The feminized term implied genteel handling.At Enron, intelligence was coded into a form of brutal shrewdness. People below the level of Baxter who maintained any sense of good practice apart from the bottom line were coded by the performance rating system as rather stupid and eased out.Of course, this coding, which was the norm at most growth companies, MEANT that people at all levels did what they were told.This is in spite of the fact that an old accounting principle happens to be one's ability to explain one's tax deductions or annual report to a neutral man-in-the-street. Enron's CPAs and network admins were, in addition to being employees, men in the street yet were expected to toe the mark.The result has been a recession now known to be double-dip (and the number and depths of the dips is not a known quantity.) The boom was fueled by a trust that was erased.This Humpty Dumpty will not, I am afraid to say, be brought back by exhortations to play nice in any system where the rewards for playing dirty exist and where ordinary people are terrorized by employment at will.When I was in school, ordinary students were proud to be accounting majors or even majors in data processing. Some of them actually felt that their hard work would welcome them into a demi-priesthood in which they could opt out of megasuccess in favor of a more sheltered life. They felt that their expertise was both technical and an adherence to standards.In accounting, this was the refusal to record income that wasn't received. In data processing this was, in the 1970s, a \\"stuctured programming\\" movement that declared that a rigourous approach to merely writing instructions to a computer was better because a truthful result occured.But as seen in this book and a recent series on Arthur Anderson in the Chicago Tribune, enthusiastic loyalty to internal professional standards was coded in the 1980s and 1990s as being a speed bump on the road to mega-profits.The result is that the in-crowd members cower in their trophy homes waiting for summons in the mail and the ordinary slob is looking for work in companies that cannot fund new hires. The country as a whole slides towards an unprecedented event in our history (a war of aggression) in preference to a serious moral inventory, which is instead recommended only to individual losers of the struggle.Some of us have a bad habit of wanting to be informed and the authors of this collection do us an excellent service."},{"Title":"Why Our Teenagers Leave the Church","review":"Read this for a class.

Try out some of the many great exercises as you read. Simply reading this will most likely help you to start feeling better and less alone! The better you feel, the better you speak.There is a learned behavior associated with stuttering.It is about more than controlling your lips or tenseness.This book will actually show you what to do to begin dealing with stuttering in a way that works! It works!Do you need some proof that the cutting edge ideas in this book work!!?I used to stutter so badly and had so much shame about it that I would get in line at a restaurant for a meal and if someone got behind me in line I would get so nervous about stuttering that I would let them go first so I could have a chance to say what I wanted without holding up the line. Feeling humiliated hurt more than waiting in line until everybody was out of it. My thinking was that if less people heard me I would feel less humiliated. I wasted so much time doing this in more than one way.Stop taking second seat to your own life. There is a mindset to healing yourself and regaining your rightful place as a dignified, happy and capable human being!Through researching the many helpful resources in connection with stuttering I now have reached a place where I have a choice to access confidence and calm. This is of more value than than words can say. Stuttering could have kept me from doing what I really wanted (studying and playing and teaching music).Stuttering is telling you something. This book will show you how to listen to it, learn the lesson it may have for you and then move on to better things to occupy your life with!!Who am I to know all this about stuttering? I was the kid who cowered in the back of line for many years. I was the person who had many speech therapists and read many many books. I was told by one therapist thatI would always stutter. The information in this book lines up with a winners mindset. This is the information that worked and is working for me more than anything else I have tried.And now?I teach guitar for a living. I speak for up to 60 minutes at a time with nearly 30 students a week. I know what works and what doesn't when I'm in the heat of battle or have had a tough spell, I will reach for this book and it resets me and reminds me about what works! Am I 100% fluent? No, BUT I do something most 100% fluent people do not do. I talk all day for a living and on top of that, I also get up on stage, sing and play music while adding banter in between sets. Sure I still stutter now and again but mostly I know how to handle it and know exactly what to do if I want to be rid of it forever. Just keep on doing what I'm doing...most of it is in this book. Your attitude is everything! A bad attitude can defeat you before you even begin!This book is right on the mark. The information in it aligns with everything I believe about overcoming this vicious circle of stuttering and anxiety. This book is informed and even recommended by many people who have also overcome stuttering.(Do a search for John C. Harrison and his stuttering hexagon.)I've seen results in myself, results that I know to be true. Stutterers can overcome stuttering. There are several examples in this book of it as well. These are very real people who you can contact and chat with as well on the neurosemantics stuttering chat on yahoo.This book works with most other techniques as well so there is no reason to hesitate to work it into your tool box. Buy whatever books you can about stuttering. But do get this one first and foremost as I honestly believe it is the closest to the winning spirit that I have ever read.This book contains information straight from the newest technologies available. There is more to learning to feel good and confident about your speech than the physical movements of tongue, lips and breath.There is so much more to stuttering than stuttering itself. This book addresses how to find out what is really going on. It will make you see stuttering in a way that may allow you to open the door and walk out of it.All the best to you!"},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","review":"This is absolutely the best book I've read about stuttering. It digs deep into the root of stuttering. In it, I learned that the traditional physical therapy that I recieved as a child barely scratched the surface of my stuttering. I was so comfortable with the therapist and the enviroment where I recieved treatment that I never stuttered infront of him; therefore, he declared that I did not have a problem with stuttering. The problem was that I still stuttered in the outside world where I did not feel safe and secure. Dr. Bodenhamer provided me with the first real world techniques to apply in everyday life. A wonderful aside to the book is that he also has an online support group so that his readers can use to help each other and share their stories.

My speech has improved significantly when I effectively applied the principles written in this book. It is important for me to realise that stuttering is a learnt behaviour and there is hope for cure. What this book addresses is the fact that stutterers focus so much on what others would think of them rather than focus on what others say and the environment around. Like most stutterers, the fear of meeting new people and being in the middle of the attention i.e being asked of all sorts of questions can be freightening. I can now think of a few instances where this fear has diminished and I communicated near 100% fluency. I was able to look at the person asking me questions and not worrying about the other people standing around would think.

Additionally, a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues, coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry. Also do a Google search - there are some interesting articles about research on the left vs right brain usage that are beneficial to be aware of and focus on."},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","review":"David FriedmanI highly recommend this book.

Written in Bob's professional and well practised manner, it not only looks at and discusses, blocking and stuttering, it also provides useful and appropriate solutions. Using the skills of Neuro Linguistic Programming to help reprogram thoughts and actions, even those well hidden ones it leads the user to a profound and lasting change. (I think only for use by the consummate professional to make the changes postively permanent).

Bob has certainly discovered and reveals much of the mystery."},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","review":"A truly inspirational book and a must read for any Stutterer looking to examine the reason behind their blocking. Focuses on the theory that blocking is primarily cognitive and examines the root of the beginning of the stutter.It's a good easy read with helpful excercises to set you on your first steps to a new life!!! I would encourage any one looking for a solution to stuttering to check out this book.This book is a must have for anyone looking to change their lives and provides you with the tools to gaining fluency."},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","review":"What this book will do for you:1. Give you step by step information on how to side-step your stuttering / blocking habit. This is important - the book does not dwell on how to \\"solve\\" the problem of stuttering. Rather, it focusses on how to \\"form new habits\\" of fluency - thereby \\"forget\\" stuttering.2. Concentrate on the cognitive aspects rather than the physiological aspects of the problem. Most stutteres believe that theirs is a cognital problem rather than something to do with their physical body. However, traditional stuttering therapy has mainly focussed on the physical aspects of the problem.3. The book is well structured. It has easy language that any one can understand.Overall - I would say this book is a breakthrough in mastering the art of fluency."},{"Title":"Mastering Blocking And Stuttering: A Cognitive Approach to Achieving Fluency","review":"Very interesting and useful book.

The book \\" gifts from the broken jar \\" can help us see the transient nature of everything and remind us to focus on the brighter, positive side of life. While recovering and healing from a non-apparent brain injury the author stumbles upon many truths of life that we all wonder about from time to time. From her interaction with kids, husband, mother and friends the author derives fresh meaning in the ordinery, simple words, gestures and events and from her experience we can see clearly that life is not about having it all, but it is about being thankful for what we have been given and deriving meaning and nurturing from it.Once we begin doing that, the maladies listed above might just free us from thier grip.A book so inspiring, strong and clear that I would read it again and recommend for injured and non-injured brains alike.'"},{"Title":"Gifts from the Broken Jar: Rediscovering Hope, Beauty, and Joy","review":"Gifts From The Broken Jar: Rediscovering Hope, Beauty, And Joy by P.J. Long is a memoir that encompasses how one's life can change on every level in a single instant. Psychotherapist and author P. J. Long experienced such a cataclysm when an accident caused permanent brain damage. For the first few months afterward, she was unable to reason clearly, hold a conversation, or take care of herself; she was a stranger to herself. The passage of time brought incomplete healing, as she was unable to perform the simplest tasks without complete silence, and still experienced severe difficulty attempting to function or communicate. But in picking up a pen and putting feelings on paper, she was gradually able to learn how to reach out. Her testimony and reflections upon life, as she works to repair the breakage in her own mind, come through with unparalleled power and honesty. \\"I realized that what is initially most troubling for brain injury patients is their diminished ability to function\\", she writes candidly. \\"'Not doing the things I used to do' translates pretty quickly into 'not being the person I used to be.'\\" Gifts from the Broken Jar is a testimony of strength, of finding joy in life and adapting to change.

And I really miss that other person. She wasn't perfect, but I liked her. Now she's gone.\\"On September 16, 1999, P.J. Long embarked on her last horse-riding lesson. A gust of wind spooked her horse, and she was thrown, landing twice on her head. She walked away from the accident, but in the days to follow odd symptoms appeared, and she began to sense something was seriously wrong with her. She slept twenty hours a day and could not remember how to do simple tasks in sequential order. Several months later the doctors finally gave their verdict: She had suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). Her life would never be the same.Gifts from the Broken Jar is Long's memoir of her struggles to find \\"that other person\\" and come to terms with her new self-image. No longer able to make mental assessments requiring higher cognitive reasoning, Long realizes that her career as a psychotherapist and college lecturer is essentially over. But through her journaling and e-mail \\"discussions\\" with her close friend, novelist Christin Lore Weber, Long discovers that she is still herself. It's not so much her brain functioning and coping mechanisms which have changed for the worse; it's her outlook on life and how she approaches things which have changed for the better. She observes life from a different perspective now, appreciating the simple beauty of nature and the love of her family, no longer frustrated to be labeled as \\"only\\" a homemaker, wife and mother.This book presents a touching and inspiring chronicle that reveals how sometimes it takes a hard knock on the head to realize the good God has worked in our lives all along. -- Cindy Appel for the FEARLESS REVIEWS"},{"Title":"Gifts from the Broken Jar: Rediscovering Hope, Beauty, and Joy","review":"As a person with brain damage, I felt like I knew the author, and she knew me.

Evan's adventure is fast-paced, funny, and really smart. Evan is hilariously bold (stealing from his dad's office and then selling the goods on EBAY? Flying to Paris on his dad's gold card? Hello?) -- but what really makes the book is his wise-ass take on it all. I couldn't put this book down and totally recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor, a sense of adventure, and who loves a good story."},{"Title":"Finding Lubchenko","review":"I personally think that \\"Finding Lubchenko\\" should be sub-titled \\"Ferris Bueller Goes to Paris.\\" The main character, Evan, is a smart-aleck troublemaker who lures his nerdy best friend, Ruben, into trouble. Ruben and Evan end up skipping town to go to Paris for a week, accompanied by the lovely Erika, where they have many adventures. Ruben and Evan's backgrounds are backwards from Ferris and Cameron's (from the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Evan has the difficult, strict father who yells all the time, while Ruben has the liberal, lenient parents who don't notice what's going on right in front of their eyes. However, reading the dialog between Evan and Ruben, as Evan basically bullies Ruben into getting into dangerous situations, made me think of Ferris Bueller over and over again.Finding Lubchenko is actually a mystery/thriller. Sixteen-year-old Evan is called to the principals's office one day to hear the news that his wealthy father has been arrested for murder. The fact that his straight-laced, Lutheran father could have actually committed the murder is never a serious possibility. However, Evan's own shady activities (stealing from his father's biotech firm) put him in a difficult bind. He has the evidence to free his father, but to share this evidence with the FBI will surely get Evan and Ruben into deep trouble. Evan decides instead to find evidence regarding who really committed the murder. This requires a trip to Paris (charged to Dad's credit card), and a somewhat dangerous investigation following the path of a real killer.Despite the presence of a murderer, and the extremely dysfunctional relationship between Evan and his Dad, this is a relatively light novel. Evan's voice, expressed in first person, is entertaining and smart-alecky. The book is peppered with brief tangents illustrating Evan's relationship with his Dad, Evan's unrequited love of Erika, Evan's insecurities, and the teen night life in Paris. Most of these asides contribute to the development of Evan's character, and particularly illustrate his relationship with his widowed father.I found Finding Lubchenko to be a fast-paced, enjoyable adventure, with an engaging teen voice. I will keep my eyes open for other books by Michael Simmons.This review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on April 24th, 2006."},{"Title":"Finding Lubchenko","review":"Simmons has invented a new subgenre, the touching thriller, and his novel succeeds at being both. Meet Evan Macalister III, a sixteen-year-old slacker living in Seattle with his incredibly wealthy tightwad father. In his father's eyes, Evan can do no right and so does not see the point of trying. He is a \\"charming, funny cutup\\" and incredibly nonchalant, a teenage James Bond who gets mixed up in bioterror. The story here, though, is better than any 007 movie.Motherless, he and his seventy-year-old father suffer a huge generation gap. The touching part is the way they navigate their relationship. His father is arrested for murder and Evan finds himself with some evidence that would clear his father but implicate him in some criminal activity of his own. Aided by his nerdy partner in crime, Ruben, Evan discovers a clue and decides that the best course of action is to look for more evidence that would not incriminate them. The action moves to Paris as they hunt down the mysterious Lubchenko. The Bond girl is Erika, Evan's other best friend, on whom he harbors a secret crush. She speaks French and joins the caper to translate when they head to Paris.Told in the first person in an incredibly consistent narrative voice, no sentence is out of character. Evan walks a moral tightrope throughout and the buildup to the climax is masterful, a perfectly paced thriller. Simmons employs a unique style of characterization; instead of assigning them adjectives, he has Evan tell a story about the characters' behavior. So when he tells the story about his father's business partner offering him beer at twelve years old, the reader knows what sort of man he is. Though there is underage drinking, there is also a mild anti-drug message. The language is relatively clean and the single violent scene is necessary. Chapters are short, as few as four pages. This title has appeal for young adult readers tired of the same old stuff. One of the most exciting reads to come along in a while--the intriguing cover art and title are only icing on the cake."},{"Title":"Finding Lubchenko","review":"FINDING LUBCHENKO is a new novel by Michael Simmons. The main character is a cocky and arrogant 16-year-old kid by the name of Evan Macalister. The story is told in Evan's words and I have to admit, as the reader, I had a love/hate relationship with Evan. The kid in me admired his bravado, but the parent in me would like to lock him in his room and put him under house arrest. The truth is, Evan gets in your head and even a little in your heart. His mother's death a few years earlier left a void in Evan's life and I wanted things to work out for him. His outlandish behavior and over confidence actually hides a lonely young man who has learned a way to cope with a remote father.Since Mr. Macalister, Evan's millionaire father, is not willing to give his son a lot of cash, Evan who works part-time in his dad's medical company takes to stealing what he considers unused electronic equipment and selling it online. Evan actually says that he \\"liberates\\" the items! When a man from the company is murdered and Mr. Macalister is arrested, Evan's realizes that the police need the murdered man's laptop computer. Unfortunately, it's one of the items that he had sold on eBay. Evan learns that the computer is in Paris and a man named Lubchenko holds all of the answers. Evan feels guilty and wants to help his father. He talks his two best friends into going to France with him. Of course, his Dad's credit card is used for a lavish visit to Paris, but finding Lubchenko is not as easy as they had hoped.This breezy, humorous story of teenagers seemingly outwitting adults is something that, I think, both parents and their teens would enjoy."},{"Title":"Finding Lubchenko","review":"This is a fun fast paced story that all should enjoy.

After a few hours with the book, I realized that I had lucked into something truly special. I took vector analysis as an undergraduate, and I have taught the course several times as a professor; in all that experience, I have never encountered a vector analysis text of comparable clarity, brevity, and scope.In my opinion, one of the best vector analysis texts currently available is Marsden and Tromba; however, their book---like most of the vector analysis texts currently in print---is clearly directed at an entirely different audience, with entirely different background preparation and objectives, than Phillips' little book. For example, instead of re-hashing the multivariable calculus that students SHOULD have learned in the first calculus sequence, Phillips covers the following valuable topics, in addition to the usual preliminaries which appear in virtually all vector analysis texts: (i) electrostatic fields (Ch. VI), (ii) harmonic functions (Ch. VII), (iii) scalar and vector potential theory (Ch. VIII), and (iv) retarded potentials (Ch. IX). Chapter X presents a thorough discussion of the now-quaint topic of dyadics, which is perhaps only of historical interest for those who have studied modern tensor analysis.Each time I find myself consulting a text for a question over vector analysis, this is the first book in my library to which I turn. It is a shame that Dover or another publisher has not kept this irreplaceable text in print; to my knowledge, there is no comparable text currently available."},{"Title":"Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-'69","review":"Since I first read this little classic, Edward Whymper's book on scrambling in the Alps has always been my favorite mountaineering book. Something about his style of writing makes one feel they have not only read a delightful tale, they have actually incorporated it into their own memory. His pencil etchings are so evocative, you can almost smell the brisk air of Zermatt and feel the weathered texture of the Swiss dwelling. You can once again experience the thoughts of trepidation and anticipation which accompany a good outing in the mountains. This is Victorian mountain writing at its very best, in an age before high technology and polarfleece added safety and comfort but put some palpable distance between you and the experience and blunted the directness of your perceptions and observations. I've spent many of my own happy hours scrambling in the Alps, but somehow Whymper makes it seem like I'm doing it anew. Sure, it's always interesting to read of the difficulties of Everest or the tales of hardship on Half Dome, but Whymper was among the first, and high technology and modern photography have not allowed us to better put you into the heart of the experience."},{"Title":"Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-'69","review":"This is a great book whether you are an armchair mountaineer or an avid climber. It is a classic of the genre by a pioneer of the craft. There's some humble bragging in the text that is a common thread(note title), but overall a great read. It will be a keeper on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-'69","review":"I read this as historical research but quickly fell in love with it as a work of literature. There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer. His conquest of the Matterhorn and the tragedy that quickly followed give the book its emotional core. If you like adventure stories, I don't know how you don't love this."},{"Title":"Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-'69","review":"I have enjoyed very much reading this book. That's why I award it with 5 stars, it is amongst my favourite books of mountaneering, with Lionel's Terray Conquerers of the useless.Although it has some chapters with technical details about glaciers, railway tracks and so on, it is amazing to be involved in the gold age of alpinism."},{"Title":"Scrambles Amongst the Alps in the Years 1860-'69","review":"A wonderful story of non-technical climbing from the 19th century. Inspiring."},{"Title":"Spanish: A Bilingual Music Program (The Complete Lyric Language) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I bought the CD version of this in a local bookstore. I just took a chance on it, because I hadn't read any reviews or heard anything about this CD before. I was pleasantly surprised!My daughter (age 5) and I (age much greater than 5) listen to this CD often, and have both learned a lot of words (and grammar) from it. It's really creative how they've combined English and Spanish into the same songs. During the course of the songs, they switch between English/Spanish and Spanish/English, so this CD would be useful and enjoyable both for English speakers learning Spanish as well as for Spanish speakers learning English.Don't be fooled by the cartoon-like packaging. The songs are very well written and performed. They do make rare references to \\"Dolly\\" and \\"Billy\\" (the \\"Family Circus\\" characters) at the beginning of some songs, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the songs.We've found that the tunes are quite catchy. This CD was an encouragement to me that I could learn Spanish, and after picking up quite a bit from these songs, I've started studying Spanish more intently (via some audio courses). A booklet containing the lyrics is included with the CD version (and maybe the tape version too?), which is helpful for studying/understanding the lyrics.I rarely write Amazon.com reviews, but I was surprised that there were no reviews for this item yet, and felt that it really deserves a good word.My only regret is that this is not the first in a series of CD's! It would be a really fun way to learn even more Spanish."},{"Title":"Mr. Dooley in peace and in war","review":"Finley Peter Dunne(1867-1936),a Chicago Irish-American newspaperman, was the creator of \\"Martin Dooley\\",saloonkeeper on Chicago's \\"Archey Road\\"(based on the real Irish district of Archer Avenue),who became the most famous fictional commentator and \\"popular philosopher\\" in America from the 1890's up to World War One.The Mr Dooley essays, written in a now archaic Irish brogue,appeared in newspapers and popular monthly magazines,and were eagerly read by everyone,from Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt down.Mr Dooley's opinions and ruminations brought a sane, witty, wise and humorous analysis to bear on numerous subjects and controversies,ranging over politics sports and hobbies,personalities and cultural trends of all kinds.Dunne's Mr.Dooley is both a friend of the poor and dispossessed,and a good natured realist about political schemes to \\"improve\\" humanity.\\"Mr.Dooley in peace and in war\\"(1898),was the first book collection of the essays which had appeared in newspapers and magazines.It was a response to Mr.Dooley's arrival as a national phenomenon,after his few years as a local Chicago celebrity, which followed the huge success of the essay \\"On his cousin George\\",which dealt with Commodore George Dewey's triumph in the naval battle of Manila bay during the Spanish-American war.The collection is approximately half on subjects relating to this war, and half on other topics(hence the title).To enjoy Mr.Dooley properly,it is first necessary to become accustomed to the dialect brogue used.This is a little daunting at first,but is fairly easy to get used to-and a reasonable knowledge of life,culture and politics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century is obviously an asset.The latter applies to quite a lot of this collection,with its emphasis on the war with Spain and discussions on the currency issue,populist politics etc.Dunne's next book,\\"Mr.Dooley in the hearts of his countrymen\\", is a collection which may in some ways be more immediately accessable to modern readers, as it contains a lot of Dunne's earlier essays on more general subjects-the police,opera, ghosts etc,which can be appreciated entirely without the specific background knowledge of the events being referred to in say,Dunne's \\"political\\" essays.Dunne may now be an aquired taste,but he is an invaluable guide and mentor,both for students of his era,and seekers after deep truths about human nature and the world. By way of an introduction,just read one of these essays \\"On criminals\\" and you,like me,should want to hear from the sage of Archey road."},{"Title":"Mr. Dooley in peace and in war","review":"Finley Peter Dunne was famed both for his sportswriting, covering the Chicago White Sox, and for his humorous columns featuring the imaginarysaloonkeeper, Mr. Dooley, who would spout his \\"wisdom\\" in a broken Irish brogue. Dunne had been writing these essays for nearly a decade when theSpanish-American War came and his (and Mr. Dooley's) criticism of it, as an imperialist enterprise, won him a national readership, plaudits fromintellectuals, and friendship with folks like Mark Twain and, improbably, with arch-imperialist Teddy Roosevelt.The essays rely heavily on wringing humor from dialect, something that got laughs more reliably in that era of minstrel shows and the like. What's mostinteresting today about their politics is that they're of a piece with Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Orwell's Shooting an Elephant, in that they'reanti-imperialist because of the effect it will have on the colonizers, rather than the colonized. Here's a representative sample:**Wan iv the worst things about this here war is th' way it's makin' puzzles f'r our poor, tired heads.

On the other hand, Mr. Dooley seemsright, even know, not to know what we should have been doing in places like the Philippines and Cuba. The former seems to have benefitted significantly from our involvement, even if its peopleresented us, and the latter would certainly have fared better had we gotten reinvolved as recently as forty years ago. Yet, if you look at how ambivalent we all are about the prospects fordemocratizing the Middle East and about whether that's even a fit role for the U.S., you have to wonder if we can ever resolve the tension between our desire to \\"do good\\" and out fear of beingmorally tainted by our involvement with cultures so clearly \\"other\\". One's admiration for Mr. Dunne ends up being tempered by the knowledge that what he's making fun of something that's actuallyrather admirable in our national character, our uneasiness over our role as the world's crusader for peace and democracy."},{"Title":"Wild Conquest","review":"This is the story of the Great Trek told from the viewpoints of the Afrikaner trekkers and the Africans they ended up subjugating.

His brand of empathy is at the root of South Africa's successful transition to democracy."},{"Title":"The Matrix of Faith: Reclaiming a Christian Vision","review":"What Jeff Pugh has accomplished with this work is nothing short of amazing. While the faiths of the world battle over interpretations and power structures, Christianity finds a new voice for itself that emerges from its own past. In The Matrix of Faith, Pugh examines the issue of postmodernity and takes uses a series of voices from Martin Luther to Anselm of Canterbury to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and challenges contemporary Christians to find a new way of understanding the narratives of their faith. An important work for any young scholar seeking an entrance into the world of postmodern theology or any member of the Christian community seeking a new way of living their faith."},{"Title":"The Matrix of Faith: Reclaiming a Christian Vision","review":"From Augustine to Bonhoeffer, Pugh draws on the life and writings of various classical Christian thinkers, to let the past address today's postmodern concerns. The book is a challenge to one untrained in philosophy, but the last chapter especially is worth the effort. Showing us the changing faces of Christianity through history, the author warns against attempts to freeze Scripture. It may be easier to live with one definitive interpretation, but the result is a loss of the living spirit of faith. Faith needs confrontation with differences in interpretation in order to remain alive and meet the needs of today's pluralistic culture."},{"Title":"Practical Iridology and Sclerology","review":"This book truly is a disappointment. Way too oversimplified and overpriced for what you get. Other simple introductory texts by Bernanrd Jensen do a much better job at laying out iridology basics. I can't believe I actually just wrote that considering the lack of up-to-date European research NOT represented in the work of the late Dr. Jensen. Figures are low resolution hand drawings. Color plates of cases at the end of the book give no commentary whatsoever. Bamer is also unclear in describing certain iris configurations and should have included more detailed slides to help clarify his presentation. Also, the herbal and nutritional treatments are much too generalized to possibly be suitable for each and every person presenting with a given configuration (herbal medicine simply isn't practiced that way by traditional standards). Anyway, the only thing this book has going for it is a very brief introduction to sclerologic diagnosis -which is a relatively neglected science until recently. With about 30 large-font 5 1/2&quot; x 8&quot; pages devoted to this subject- including poor resolution hand drawn pictures- Bamer may have just as well omitted the subject from the book altogether. My suggestion: don't waste your money on this book. Instead, buy Jensen's much less expensive intro to iridology, Visions of Health or better yet, contact the National Iridology Research Association regarding iridology seminars. They're a great resource."},{"Title":"Practical Iridology and Sclerology","review":"this book is showing and teaching not only the arts of iridology and sclerology, but also explain the healing relationship with all the other major organs, and those that you can diagnose through these healing arts. i personaly learned a lot from the sections in the book that showed the healing recommandations of herbs,and vitamins, and some case histories that followed by colorful photos. you dont have to be an iridologist to understand this book, because is writen in a very simple way,yet a fulfiling one.as a orthomolecular-nutritionist that using many kinds of diagnosis,i can honestly say that i learned a lot from this book, and i highly recommand it to everyone who is seeking for natural health with the help of this truly amazing book."},{"Title":"Quiet Desperation","review":"Because I read to fall asleep at night I thought it might take a while to get through this book.

Like a detective, Woscoboinik searches for clues, reiterations, bridges between different Borgean works. He avoids free-wheeling imaginative inferences and personal interpretations. In the course of his research he has gathered information on Borges's life from various and sundry sources, including numerous in-depth interviews.Through close readings of several short stories, Woscoboinik follows Borges's path as he evolved from his &quot;narcissistic solipsism&quot; to the establishment of Oedipal links. He borrows the title of this book from Borges himself, who in &quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot; refers to sexual intercourse as &quot;Secreto,&quot; understanding it only as an act of procreation. Hence Woscoboinik follows the track of fantasy associations, among them those relating to the &quot;primary scene.&quot; Further chapters deal with the treatment of feminine characters in Borges's short stories, with the dreams and nightmares constantly retrieved and reiterated through his work, memory and the challenges of self-identification, and with the Borgean view of the problem of time.Readers of this book need not have specialized knowledge either of literature or of psychoanalysis. Borges fans will find a respectful, non-reductionist interpretation of his work that will increase their admiration for him."},{"Title":"The Secret of Borges: A Psychoanalytic Inquiry into His Work","review":"Es un libro muy bien escrito y muy respetuoso.

And what has been the role of people themselves in this adventure during the last 200 years? The information in this book is complete, the analysis deep, and the author achieves the highest level in gaining the attention of the reader. The third part of the text is a zestful and documented proposal for the recovery of the political comunity, as the way to solve the contradictions of our modern market-driven world. Philosophers, sociologists, politicians, third-sector leaders (and inteligent social-driven individuals) will find this modern planning classic of enormous help in their tasks."},{"Title":"Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action","review":"That was the message I took from this book. Planners, for the most part, are mandarins of the state, performing bureaucratic and policy functions to further the needs of capitalist political economies. The influence this book has had on practicing planners is clearly minimal: most college educated American planners are not radicalized by their university experiences and end up entering the sprawl industry (private or public sector). Friedmann's favorites, advocacy and radical planning, are essentially POWER politics in whatever realm one deems important (env., energy, urban, social, etc.). Friedmann never says it, but I think the GREEN movement comes closest to what he wants 'radical' planners to engage in-- rather than process permits for the real estate industry. Good for a history of planning, but a review of the last 20 years of what planning has accomplished (anything positive?)would be nice for the next edition."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"This novelette, originally published in 1774, established Goethe as a German literary superstar.The story features Werther, a middle-class artist, who falls in love with Lotte, who is engaged to Albert. Although Lotte loves him in return, she remains faithful to her fiancee. &lt;spoiler warning&gt; Since he cannot have Lotte, Werther decides to commit suicide.This book was radically different from the earlier books of the German Enlightenment. The Sturm und Drang group wished to publish more middle-class works and 'Werther' is an example of that. Werther is a very emotional man; he wears his heart on his sleeve. Some readers may say that Werther is a whiner, but that is not the point. All of Werther's emotions are extreme; he takes complete delight in admiring the countryside and falls into deep depression when his love remains unsatisfied. As his depression increases, his grasp of language becomes more and more eratic.Goethe also constructed Werther as a semi-autobiographical character. Goethe had also fallen in love with a married woman who could not return his love. One month after she left him, Goethe heard of an acquaintance that had committed suicide due to a similar situation.Goethe comes just before the Romantic movement in Germany. One Romantic ideal was that the artist, or man in general, due to his position as a human, can never be perfect and must always fail. Romantics were obsessed with death, and especially sick people (like Beethoven), because death, supposedly, finally united Man with the Infinite, or Devine Perfection. I think Werther loved Lotte so much, because he saw something within her; one can call it the Infinite, the Devine or the Ideal. Since Werther could not experience the Infinite through Lotte, he decided to reach the Infinite through death.Goethe, perhaps, wrote this work to put his life into perspective. He could have very easily taken Werther's path, but he, obviously, decided that his life was still worth living.Goethe would continue this idea of Man seeking the Infinite, or Perfection, in his great opus, Faust, which I recommend to all readers. The difference between Faust and Werther is that Faust did not commit suicide but was redeemed in death. Werther's death and funeral does not have as much pageantry. The last line in Werther is: 'No clergymen escorted him.'I have included all the information above because I feel that an understanding of Sturm und Drang and Goethe's situation leads to a greater appreciation of 'Werther.' Otherwise, one might interpret Werther as a hopeless, pathetic whiner. But he is quite possibly like all human beings; he suffers because he experiences very human emotions."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"This book is an absolute must for anybody who wants to understand the spirit of the romantic era and the \\"Sturm und Drang\\" time. The feelings and emotions are driven to their limits, what lies in all of us is expressed unrestrictedly. The translator does NOT use the old English style (which some other translators inappropriately do), so he sucessfully comes very close to the German original.Read it! You may discover how human you are!"},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"a suicide and the love that precludes, defines, and concludes the life of a man. it's hard to describe a book of this magnitude, as it's likely that everyone who reads it will release different thoughts and emotions. definitely a human novel."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"But I didn't. Widely considered a literary classic, I honestly didn't get what the fuss was about.Granted, Goethe is a man of towering genius; his understanding of human nature is very much in evidence here. However, reading the book, I feel it is very much a product of its time. The narrative format (letters written by the protagonist) as well as the excessive sentimentality, were products of the \\"Age of Sentimentality\\" that swept through much of Europe during the latter half of the 18th-century. One's take on the book, therefore, correlates highly with how one reacts to the features of this period. The constant snivelling and braying that occurs throughout the book is unendurable, and the unlikeliness of the events is compounded by the artifice of the narration itself (the epistolary novel). However, because, it's Goethe writing, there is the occasional timeless observation (\\"When we feel inadequate to ourselves, everything seems inadequate to us\\") that only Goethe can put into words. Its moments such as those that salvage an otherwise uninteresting read.As is common with Norton editions, the text is packed with useful annotations, biographical notes, and critical studies. The translation is also good, maintaining the tenor of Goethe's words but updating them for modern ears.Since this text was a crucial contributor to the \\"sturm und drang\\" (storm and stress) movement, one perhaps would be best served by appreciating the historical value of the text, and discounting its \\"factual content\\" (to steal from Benjamin). Otherwise, I fear one might run into the same problems I did."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"This book is a wonderful and brilliantly written story. It goes into depth on the subject of a young man's sorrow and his fruitless efforts of young love. There is an immense amount of symbolism. There are so many philosophical ideas and ideals that can be gleaned from this book and even some psychological ones too. It will call certain religious ideas into question and make the read think real hard. In closing to this short review, I would advise the reader to look very closely to the last line of the book. Very interesting there."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"As far as I understood the inspiration for this book comes from two of Goethe's friends - Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem who shot and killed himself after he borrowed the gun from J.C.Krestner. This tragedy made a profound impression on Goethe.As soon as this book was published, it enjoyed huge popularity and it was translated into numerous languages. It was the first German book of this kind and even Napoleon Bonaparte read this book up to seven times.The Sufferings of young Werther is a psychologic and a very tragic tale of a young man who falls in love hopelessly with a married woman. Werther proves to be very intellegent and smart but chosing what he chose to do made him indeed very stupid after all.Of course in order to find out what Werther did, and how the story unfolds - you'll have to read the book yourself but if you listen to my advice don't read it if you're in love with someone and you're single as Werther was because it wouldn't be a wise thing to do. At least that's my opinion (concern). Cheers."},{"Title":"The Sufferings of Young Werther","review":"This is a horrible book! It should be read to inmates who get life imprisonment."},{"Title":"Landmarks in Linguistic Thought Volume III: The Arabic Linguistic Tradition: 003 (History of Linguistic Thought)","review":"Versteegh provides a thorough and very readable overview of traditional Arabic linguistic thought from its origins in Qur'anic exegesis in the 8th century CE through the use of Arabic linguistic theory in the description of other languages in the 14th century CE. Each chapter in the book begins with a translation of a representative document or fragment, followed by a commentary placing the text in its historical frame of reference and constrasting the ideas with those of other (period) scholars and modern linguistic theory. These are presented in chronological order, building on the previous as the theories evolved.The collection does not assume a strong knowledge in Arabic or Western linguistic thought, though this can of course be useful. It provides a springboard for further exploration of Arabic linguistic study and makes an excellent reference when reading more specialized works.One of the more interesting sections is Chapter 4, &quot;The Debate Between Logic and Grammar.&quot; Here Versteegh describes the intersection of the Greek and Arabic linguistic traditions, and the heated debates that occured in Baghdad during the 10th century CE. This clearly illuminates the differences between the traditions, as well as showing the 'politics of language' and the impact of language on national and religious identity."},{"Title":"Backroad Wineries of Southern California: A Scenic Tour of California's Country Wineries","review":"This book was very helpful for wine tasting in a sometimes neglected area of California.

It's a best-seller in Carpinteria, because this is the first time the Mexican-Americans in that community have been asked to talk about those days.\\"Thank you, John McCafferty, for telling our story. Until now, no one was interested,\\" one member of that community said.Many of the Aliso students, now grandparents themselves, still have vivid memories of their school years -- the separate and unequal school building, the lack of encouragement for those who wanted to take college-prep courses, and the unwritten but enforced separation between themselves and the other children in town. They also remember those teachers who truly cared about them and helped them succeed in spite of the difficulties.Many California communities segregated the Mexican-American children into separate schools, a practice that ended in 1947 with a court decision in Orange County -- seven years before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the segregation of black students was unconstitutional. Much has been written about that historic decision. Now, at last, California's own story is coming to light.McCafferty's book, with its extensive research and many interviews, should be read by all those who are interested in the history of public school education."},{"Title":"The Traveling Charbonneaus","review":"I loved this book.Mr.Schallehn is a gifted writer, whose characters are easily recognizable and infinitely believable.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Traveling Charbonneaus","review":"Bernie Schallehn skillfully and effectively employs the journey metaphor in his novel The Traveling Charbonneaus. Not only does the Charbonneau family travel to out-of-the-way places in the north country of New York State to play country music in expectation of their long awaited big break, they also journey in other ways to discover who they really are as individuals and as members of a family unit under the leadership of patriarch, Wen\`dell(his favored pronunciation), the local septic cleaner. As years pass, a \\"big break\\" eludes the family, except for instrumentally and vocally gifted daughter Chantelle.Some members of the traveling Charbonneau Family Band never leave home, yet loyal and loving wife June asserts her individuality when she makes the decision to travel with the family no longer since by Wendell's edict, Chantelle doesn't exist due to her \\"betrayal.&quot;Daughter Patrice, gifted with extensive knowledge of musical instruments and engineering, takes the risk of falling in love with her father's choice of replacement for Chantelle in the family band.Cherished son David learns coping strategies for dealing with his disability. Soon David begins to acquire personal integrity and much greater independence.Much later and an undisputed musical success, Chantelle risks a surprise visit home. Patrice finds true love and a committed father to her son. Even later, June and David find even more independence working together at the local IGA. Through it all, Wendell Charbonneau continues to \`live large,\\" make music, and love fiercely. He is committed to his belief in this truth: Neither he nor we are what we do for a living. The tragedy is that we often live as if we are. Wendell is such a literary force to reckon with he keeps readers on the edges of their seats as he lives his life pulling out all the stops. Near the end of the book and Wendell's life, we also see his greatness and heroism in other memorable ways."},{"Title":"The Traveling Charbonneaus","review":"Look, if you like your characters and plot lines mindless and predictable you'll want to skip past this and Schallehn's other books.

Along the way you'll get a chance to do what alot of us got out of the habit of doing since the advent of cable tv--think.Take this trip with the Charbonneaus--I'm guessing you'll enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Earthquakes and Faulting.","review":"Christopher Scholz has written a welcome update to the classic 1990 edition of his book, and if you thought that Crustal Deformation was a field where nothing exciting happens, think again! Substantial chunks of the book have been re-written and re-organized to bring the text bang up-to-date with the cutting edge of tectonics and rock mechanics research.The beauty of this book is that Scholz, along with his students and research associates, basically has been the cutting edge of research in this field for the past 30 years. The book therefore reads as a guide to the evolution of ideas and a personal memoir of scientific exploration, while allowing the reader to follow the same thought processes, and more fully understand what we currently think regarding these subjects.The text is a monograph, quite different from the usual condescending tone found in textbooks, and can be understood and appreciated by readers of widely differing abilities, from interested laymen to fellow researchers. Thorough explanations are given for each topic, with examples taken from actual scientific papers, putting the reader in touch with the original papers, a glaring omission in many other textbooks. The language is never more complicated than it needs to be, and Scholz's straight-forward explanations and no-nonsense style make comprehension almost too easy, leaving the reader a real feeling that one has learned something at the end, which will come as a breath of fresh air to any student that has suffered through a horribly dull and irrelevent lecture, only to remain scratching their head at the end.The book is a tribute to the intellect and longeivity of the man's career, blessed as he is with a happy knack for being proven &quot;right&quot; by the passing of time, and continuing accumulation of research results. A classic text, and again, a must-read for anyone with a desire to know more about the planet we live on."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Earthquakes and Faulting.","review":"Prof. Scholz of Columbia summarizes the science of rock mechanics.This book is the easiest way to gain a first foothold in the physics of how faults behave.

As a side light, Chris has also written a book for the general reader on the excitement of discovering the tectonics of Africa, Fieldwork: A Geologist's Memoir of the Kalahari, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Earthquakes and Faulting.","review":"From the point of view of content, the book is as good as the previous edition. The criticism below (and the missing two stars) are entirely the fault of the publisher.The print quality and the layout of the paperback edition (7th printing, 2012) are well below average, considering the price of the book. Most black and white figures look like bad photocopies of old ones (the photos especially are virtually unusable) and the \\"new\\" color figures (including the cover itself) are very pixely. In fact, all figures appears to be enlargement of previous ones without any redrawing. The printed text is closer to medium gray than to black and the chosen font type and size make it more difficult to read than the old edition (even though the latter had a smaller font size). It also has the peculiarity of not having any blank pages in front, and plenty of blank pages in the back instead, for no obvious reason whatsoever. The pages are cut so that they appear shifted upwards, with a very small margin at the top and a wider one at the bottom, which gives the book a very cheap feeling and adds further distraction when trying to read it. Finally, the number of pages in the old and new edition are about the same, the amount of content is about the same, but the new edition is significantly thicker, taller and wider than the old one (which was a very convenient size to carry around instead). From the print quality, the book is worth at best $30, not $90."},{"Title":"Mechanics of Earthquakes and Faulting.","review":"It came on the last possible day of the given range, but it was in very nice condition. No complaints."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"I purchased this book because I thought it was next in line in the Leo Waterman series....the only thing common with Leo is the setting....Seattle at its best and worst. The character of Frank Corso, tough and cynical, reminds of who Leo Waterman might become if G.M Ford continues to write the series (please,please!) Frank, who has demons of his own, stays aloof from relationships with others, but determines to not only care for an old girlfriend, but find who caused her injuries. There is plenty of action, but also courtroom drama as well. I would count myself lucky to have a friend like Corso! I will continue to read the Corso books as well....G. M. For is an excellent writer and I truely enjoy his books."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"I really enjoy Mr. Corso books, Leo seems to be a unlikely hero, but he feels for his unruly team of drunks. He makes me look at the homeless and less fortunate with humor, and more patience. The writing is entertaining and witty."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"Corso, a writer, digs into corupt and violent big boss dealings. Suspense keeps you reading and the novel has many different characters involved, the old girlfiend, the gangsters, the lawyers, earthquake witness and many more as Corso puts together the whole picture of what happened. Worth your time."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"What can I say, I love G.M.Ford books. They are just my kind of continuous action plots with a healthy dose of suspense throughout. Mix that with a subtle sense of humor and to me, you have got an enjoyable read. Black River is no exception. Highly recommend it for non-serious reading."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"Whether it's Leo Waterman or Frank Corso, Mr Ford writes the kind of books that keep you up nights unable to put the book down! I read every thing he writes knowing it will be a story well worth reading with well developed story lines tied neatly together with a soul filling ending. I love it when the good guys win!"},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"The protagonist here, Frank Corso, is a prolific, often off-beat writer who had been fired by the NY Times. Since, he's struck out on his own.In this Corso intallment, which follows \\"Fury\\", he's out to get the bad guy, Nick Balagula. Balagula built a hospital with inferior material. It collapsed during a very minor earthquake and killed many in the process. Balagula has been slippery as an eel in the past. This time Corso wants to see him nailed and justice served.In the past Balagula has slipped through the system through crooked officials & jurors who have been bought off. His actions are no different here. Once again he portrays himself as being victimized.The story starts with a quirky hit shooting of a seemingly innocent guy. That sets the stage. The rest of the book revolves around it well. Corso's old girlfriend witnesses a connection between a story she's doing and a story Frank's writing. She becomees savagely attacked & is hospitalized. She, herself, now becomes a target for murder.Frank Corso makes his second appearance in this second book. He's quirky & a likeable guy for sure. The cast of characters plays out well. Drama plays out well in the courtroom during Balagula's trial. Courtroom dramas can be dry; not here. It's written very well. Of course, there is other mayhem in the story playing out at the same time by other characters. All revolving around the initial story.It's all written well, right down th the scenic desciptions of the area and character development. G.M. Ford & Frnak Corso have done very well here. I'm sure they will continue to succeed in future installments as well."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"Awesome book! Worth every penny - I really don't mind the wait when I get such a solid deal on a read"},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"G.M. Ford is a Seattleite and, thereby, a homie of mine. I got glowing recommendations from J.P. Dickey and Bill Farley at Seattle Mystery Bookshop just after his first novel was released and immediately picked it up to read. It bounced off me like Happy Fun Ball; didn't like the characters, didn't like the plot, just...didn't. So, I wrote off G.M. Ford and never bothered again.Last week, a friend gave me a copy of \\"Black River\\". This is a good - and very literate - friend, so I stifled the groans and decided to read it, just so I'd sound credible if the guy asked about it. Sure enough, there were the labored analogies, the weird and disconcerting turns of phrase that broke up the velocity of the read like tiny speed bumps as I tried to figure out WTF G. Ford was thinking, and the somewhat desultory tone that I found a drag on the proceedings in the first novel.BUT...as I plowed on through, something emerged that didn't in that first novel: a plot. The semi-moribund Leo Waterman has been replaced by Frank Corso, tough guy, writer (you KNOW this is fiction. Spillane was the last tough guy who worked as a writer and he's long gone) and dancer upon the knife-edge of legality; a man perfectly willing to ignore or subvert the law if it suits his Higher Purpose. Corso is interesting, enigmatic, and has History - major, dark, sinister history. The only drag upon Frank is his idiotic ex-girlfriend, Meg Dougherty, an irrationally-drawn thumbnail sketch of a Seattle-style goth chick whose histrionics frequently emit loud clunking noises like a wrench tossed into the ship's gearbox. After three books with ol' Meg, I'm thinking that Corso would be much better alone and that Ford's goodbye note at the end of the last one I read should be enforced by either guns or a court order or both.G.M. Ford, in technical terms, may just be as good as Dennis Lehane's liner blurb repeatedly insists. His plotting has become as relentless and efficient as a nail gun; the \\"thwack-thwack-thwack\\" of plot points being nailed to the wall with speed and uncanny accuracy creating a speed-freak's wet dream of mystery crafting. Stuff Happens in Ford's stories - a LOT of stuff, and not just the predictable. His plot twists are genuinely creative and he has a real gift for that rear-view logic that clarifies seeming incongruities in the plot. In the end, Ford's books - especially \\"Black River\\" - get zipped in and tucked neatly away in those final pages, with damned few of those nagging, Spike Lee-ish, unresolved issues and moral ambiguities that bug readers everywhere. The summations may not always be neat but they're damnably effective.Learning to appreciate someone whose work you've written off is, in many ways, far more satisfying that digging in right off the bat. And I'm glad to finally be able to give a Seattle Brotha props that he richly deserves."},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"This is the second in the new Frank Corso series. I have to allow for the fact that I liked the absence of Meg Dougherty for awhile. She just seems to COMPLAIN SO DAMN MUCH. This could be me. I feel the same about a Parker book when Susan Siverman has to take an extended vacation. I am kind of relieved.In Black River, we meet the Russian mobster Nico Balagula. Brrrr. Nasty man. Reminds me of the hit man-drug marketer 'Vassily' in Michael Crow's Luther Ewing novels.Well you know the plot. Frank gets to attend the third trial of Balaguls, who faked samples of concrete strength on the building of a hospital which collapses, killing dozens.With the earlier trials witnesses kept disappearing, their corpses discovered later. Hmmmm. This is a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, Mr. Ford puts together a rivering story of revenge and retribution, always a sure fire page turner.I like Corso. He's a tough hombre, a writer making a lot of dinero from the sale of his crime novels. We don't know a lot about him which I imagine is part of his cachet but for the reader, it becomes a little irritating. We know a lot about John Rain (Barry Eisler) and the aforementioned Ewing. There, it makes us understand why they do the things they do.Still a highly recommended crime novel. Why the 4 stars then? The ending shows a relationship between Corso and the State which is so improbable it makes you wonder what was Mr. Ford thinking. I firmly believe that the reader will accept any ending a good writer gives them, as long as the characters act in their own context. It doesn't work here. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"Black River: A Novel","review":"Frank Corso, a true crime writer in Seattle, is following the case of Nicholas Balagula, a mobster who finally cut one corner too many. A hospital in California has collapsed, killing 63 people, 41 of them children. Balagula's sticky fingerprints are all over the tragedy, and Corso wants to see justice finally visited on this \\"Teflon Don.\\" But the paths that lead back to Balagula are many - and unraveling them will take all the talent and courage Corso has. What does truck found with a body that is riddled with bullets from three different guns have to do with a vicious attack on a former girlfriend, Meg Doughtery, that leaves her life hanging by a thread? And how do the bodies of two previous witnesses against Balagula that were found floating in the river connect to the disappearance of a man Meg had gone to interview before her car was forced into a devastating accident? What picture are all these seemingly unconnected pieces forming? Are they actually connected? And, can Corso find the truth before the mobster walks away from all the voices of pain and death that cry out for justice?Frank Corso sees himself as a flawed human being. He is flawed more than some - but much more human than many. He is likable without wanting you to like him - and appealing without trying to appeal to anyone except himself and his own conscience.BLACK RIVER is an edge-of-your seat thriller. The action never stops, and the plot moves quickly, pulling you along with it. This is a hard-boiled detective mystery with a heart. Frank Corso is someone I will have to visit again.
