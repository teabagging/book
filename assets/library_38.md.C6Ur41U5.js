One would only wish that the stress of the book was placed not only on the popes' political and financial escapades. The book simply alludes to the pagan or satanic interests of some of the popes but doesn't go into details.

Unsatisfied by &quot;Velma Still Cooks in Leeway&quot; (ditto)? Truth can often be much more interesting and engaging than fiction, as it is in this case. As a person who takes a great deal of interest in the ministerial life, I found it hard to put this book down. A young, beginning pastor with a PhD in Theology is called to a rural parish in New Cana, Illinois, where most of the church members, whose lives revolve around farming, are related to one another. It's the typical clash of cultures, the educated, citified parson attempting to relate to a largely uneducated congregation of country folks. As they grudgingly learn to accept one another, there are many eventful occurrences, from unwanted pregnancies, open adultery by a young couple whom the pastor offends by using a cuss word, the arrest of an abusive parishoner in the church building, the battle for power with an unscrupulous undertaker, to a rather comic attempt to varnish the sanctuary floor. The final event in Pastor Lischer's ministry at New Cana, the church anniversary picnic which doubles as his farewell, is rather poignant. As he says while watching his little girl ride a pony for the first time that afternoon, &quot;My wife and I each felt a twinge of regret as we watched her and realized that she was losing the sort of community she would not remember and never know again&quot;. May we all experience that sort of community some time in our lives."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"This memoir deserves much more circulation than it is receiving. (My entire state-- Rhode Island-- has bought only one copy!) It is a beautifully written, intelligent and touching look back nearly 30 years to a Lutheran pastor's youth and the small town church he led. How much more profound is this account of a pastor baptizing babies who are about to die than an account of one more celebrity. Lischer's memoir also describes an America that once was. I have no idea if &quot;community&quot; still exists in Illinois as it did in the early '70s, but somehow many scenes in this book, such as the final picnic, made me weep. At the same time, Lischer is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. A truly great book by a phenomenal pastor."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"This book is good for a laid back look at a small country church in the &quot;sticks&quot;. The reading is easy, entertaining and informative.Although the author's religious background (Lutheran) is different from mine (Reformed, Christian Reformed Church), I never felt slighted (well, except for the one time he referred to us &quot;Calvinists&quot;).I was a little nervous about the lack of his references to God and God's leading. However, I gave the benefit of the doubt that it was the intent of the author to not throw &quot;religion&quot; in the face of the reader. That has pros and cons. I would have liked to have read more about his personal religious journey with God, not just with other people.Overall, an enjoyable book, especially for someone like me who is usually more heavily into non-fiction."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"This was another one of those books that I really couldn't put down. I'm about to enter the seminary and a pastor loaned this book to me because it accurately reflected the life of a minister--especially a minister in a small town. It was fascinating to say the least. One aspect of this book which I found particularly interesing was the bredth of the problems that Rev. Lischer had to deal with: a teenager who is pregnant and fears telling her father because he'll beat her; a seventeen-year-old girl who's having an affair with a thirty-five-year-old man and doesn't understand why people are against it; advice to the man who is considering quitting his job at a factory to concentrate on farming full time; should contemporary songs be introduced to an extremely traditional congregation?; a young, frightened woman who is about to undergo emergency surgeory and her husband. I found myself asking myself what I would say in these situations as I may very well be facing them some day soon.One piece of advice that Lischer points out once, but occurs more that he realizes is that reflecting the love and compassion that God has for you in your dealing with others tends to work. When Lischer treated people with respect and love, as God would have us treat others, things turned out pretty good for him; when he attempted to impose his own personal political feelings, things tended not to work out as well. Lischer does attempt to impose his own views quite often in the book--from the time he tried to have the American flag removed from the sanctuary of the church to his own biases concerning against &quot;restrictive&quot; tradition in the modern Lutheran church.In sum, this has been an incredibly helpful book for me as I went about making my decision to enter the ministry. Although this book is well worth the read, I did have problems as an ordained minister tended to write against traditional religion and I was disappointed to find that Lischer wrote little about the domestic ups and downs of pastoral work (he briefly mentions a fight he and his wife had concerning the amount of time spent working versus the amount of time spend with his family). Recommended."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"Unlike Richard Lischer, my preparation for ministry did not include Lutheran prep school. Like him, I came under the influence of some distinguished teachers. One of them recommended I read Reinhold Niebuhr's Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic yearly. At least that frequently, I pick up the diary this late pastor-turned-professor kept during his thirteen-year pastorate in Detroit early in the last century. Though Lischer's book will not inspire similar devotion, it is valuable. For one thing, genuinely good explorations of parish dynamics are rare and usually fairly technical. For instance, though Edwin Friedman's Generation to Generation: Family Process in Church and Synagogue is excellent, a degree in sociology would help one benefit from it most fully. For another thing, reflections on ministry tend to be so spiritual as to ignore the persistence of long-standing patterns of behavior and relationships. Reading Chuck Swindoll or Lloyd John Ogilvie, you'd think neither one ever forgot the Host for hospital Communion or got crossways with a funeral director. Lischer picks a middle way, which is also ultimately unsatisfying. Lischer's approach is to tell the stories, largely unadorned, of his three years in a Lutheran congregation in rural Illinois. The stories are good ones: a hopeless young woman whose life is redeemed through the congregation's love, an adulterous young couple who actually clean up their act, a disastrous funeral redeemed by the sweet notes of a trumpet. Every pastor could chime in. Lischer has been criticized for making himself the hero of his stories, and unfairly: He is as often knave as knight. A better criticism acknowledges that the stories need interpretation. What is their significance in Lischer's formation as a pastor, and ultimately as a professor? How do those events illustrate both the persistence of sin and the fulness of God's grace? Lischer raises issues and then fails to explore them. He alludes to his wife's yearnings but says little else. Those of us who served small, poor parishes with young families know of the pressures. Seeing how the Lischers handled theirs would help us see how God helped us. The funeral episode, complete with the elders' tongue-lashing, raises the issue of boundaries: How involved should a pastor become when s/he is sure a parishoner is making a mistake? I want Professor Lischer (for that is what he is, make no mistake about the gulf between the academy and the parish) to make his book more like Neibuhr's diary. Early on, he comments that his sermons spoke to the people's heads but not their hearts. The irony of this book is that he touches our hearts when we need more food for our heads. Lischer is also disingenuous. His book has the feel of a middle-aged man looking back on his youth with appreciation but without much understanding. I came away with the feeling that Lischer wants us not to notice that his three years in New Cana were what the people knew they were: A springboard to a &quot;wider field of service,&quot; first in Virginia Beach and then in seminary teaching. Are we really supposed to believe that the Virginia congregation approached him without any indication that he might be willing to move? Such things do happen, but they are rare. Tracy Lischer is now an attorney. We put down Open Secrets with the feeling that the Lischers decided that parish work was beneath them. It is this attitude that is dooming many congregations to mediocre leadership. Are any pastors who chose to stay in congregations working on books?"},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"This is a wonderful book and was hard to put down. It is about the life of a pastor's preparation for and then active work with his congregation. He tells his story with humor and gives the reader insight into the life of a pastor."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Lischer is honest with the reader throughout the entire book, which I really appreciated. It can be a bit deep and sad at times, but, so is life! This book presented an actual look into rural pastor life."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"Looking at a church from the outside can leave an interesting first impression. Seeing a church up close (especially the microscopic upcloseness of those who have been leaders in ministry) can be downright ugly. Richard Lischer in his book, Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church, shows us the microscopic ugly side and then helps us see that ugliness from a totally different - I believe a more God-ward - perspective.The book is the true story about his first pastorate in a small country church in Illinois. As he shares the three years he spent at this church, he discloses both the dirty glory of people that at times shine the love of Christ as well as the mixture of immature and inexperienced mistakes he made as a young senior pastor. Without glossing over reality, he tells a touching, subtly humorous story about how God works in marvelous ways through His body, the church.Overall, I found this book a very enjoyable book - the kind that you can just sit in front of a fire and read from beginning to end. It reminds us (and this is a necessary reminder especially for those of us who enjoy theology) that when the theology is all hashed out and we know we're right, that it then needs to be applied to real life - unfortunately, the two don't always meet well and it is then that we must rely on God to give us direction - whether to capitulate the theology for the sake of a person's life or stand firm for the sake of a person's soul. The answer is not as black and white as one might think and this book makes that clear. Finally, from a ministry perspective, it captures the heart of anyone that has done any leadership in ministry. I highly recommend it.For a more detailed review, go to the blog in my nickname and click on the Readings category."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"Richard Lischer's &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is a charming book detailing his three years as a pastor of a small Lutheran church in New Cana, Illinois. This was Lischer's first assignment as a pastor fresh from divinity school (he's now a teacher at Duke's Divinity School) and contains many candid, poignant looks at his experience.Lischer writes eloquently and honestly about his experiences in divinity school (very little of the book is spent on those experiences, and this is unfortunate because what glimpses we do get are both humorous and insightful) and his time learning how to be an effective pastor at a small church in a rural midwest town. He's honest in his approach as he portrays his feelings of nervousness, disappointment in his assignment, and his occasionally blunt/occasionally amusing opinions of those who make up this congregation. He discusses baptisms, visits to hospitals, talks with confused church members, wooing new potential members, funerals, and the interesting interpersonal relationships that develop between a pastor's family and the congregation.Overall this is an enjoyable, quick read, but I feel it could have been far more interesting if the author had spent some more time discussing his ministry (and his approach to it) and less time on the personal stories of those in the congregation. Nevertheless, a worthwhile read if not a typical glimpse into beginning life as a pastor in a small midwestern town. Recommended."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"I felt like I knew every single character in this book. Richard Lischer's concise, tight descriptions enabled me to find a place in this book and settle in for long visit with the people of his congregation. His humility and honesty in protraying his younger self was such refreshment. What a delightful glimpse behind the altar! I thought each story was a perfect, tiny picture, like a Vermeer, in which the mundane becomes not just note-worthy, but extraordinary."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"An unqualified recommendation to buy and read the book. It is good writing, good story telling and good for the reader."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"This is a well written chronicle of a young pastor's first call to a rural congregation in East Illinois.First, the admirable points of this work. He is a good writer, able to express himself imaginatively and with a nice, tight style. Evidence in support of his current call to preaching professorship at Duke. This chronicle provides compassionate journey to loving the people and the realization that many seminarians have unrealistic expectations of themselves, their first call, and what it means to be an undershepherd of The Good Shepherd. I especially am fond and can relate to his sayings some small churches of the Lutheran fellowship, the chain saw massacre of his parsonage trees and the saying: \\"country people never pay a professional to do expertly what they can do recklessly for nothing.\\" (I believe this applies to certain congregational leaders irrespective of confessional assoication or congregational size) The heart the Lord gives him for hurting, needy people is well documented and important component of a servant of the Lord.However, now for the negative spiritual direction of Lisher which is severe to this reviewer. Having read his excellent work on MLK Jr.'s preaching, I was drawn to this work to sense Lisher's theology, since he doesn't really critique MLK Jr. in the way that any Lutheran would. He gives quick evidence in this work that he either never truly believed as a Lutheran, or that he became frustrated with the true, narrow way and fell away. One can understand this mainly because of his theological pedigree. He was at the sem when he became purposeively infiltrated by \\"pseudo-Lutherans\\" who had a game plan to take over the church and take it into the modern era. Cheap shots in my opinion are shot about the Sem walkout, when there is absolutely no proof that it concerned what Lischer argued with his cong. pres, \\"women's ordination.\\" Further against all Lutheran theology is his blatant admission that he really didn't cling to faith in the gospel, but in some sociological community idea. What a shambles these frustrated Lutherans try and make of incarnational, sacramental theology. Luther clearly sides on doctrine over life, but not Lisher, who at this time in his ministry claimed to be Lutheran. It's a sham and a shame!One must appreciate the delightful writing style and remicising with a new pastor, accompanying him on calls and counseling and interaction with layleaders and leaving for a new call. This was all the stuff for which this book is for this reviewer the reason why one should read and enjoy. However, the theology is fluff and chaff and won't bear a Scrtptural/Lutheran Confessional examination."},{"Title":"Open Secrets: A Spiritual Journey Through a Country Church","review":"If you were to ask me to describe the book in one word, I'd say candid. It is actually too candid at times. This is obviously not about salvation and evangelism and being born-again. In fact there is nothing in the book that indicates the author himself embodies any of these essentials for the life hereafter. Indeed the sporadic raw language and beer drinking incidences tell the opposite.But it is the story of a man who sincerely wanted to follow &quot;his calling&quot; however spiritually incomplete this was, and who was willing to put eight years of academic training in preparation for it. That calling was one of ministry to shepherd flocks of lay people who mean well in their duty to follow Jesus' teaching. &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is the diary of his first three years as a Lutheran pastor in the rural surroundings of a small town in the U. S. state of Illinois.In line with the title of the book, the writer truly opens himself to vulnerable admission of his mistakes and genuine submission to learn from the church people. People who take their spiritual leader too much for granted by reminding him bluntly that he doesn't own the church, they do. The man obviously means well and is sincere in his pastoral pursuit as he puts up and gives in to the set ways of the close-knit cultivator clique.It is an interesting real-life, real-people account of one ordinary individual who's background and childhood precipitate him into a religious vocation of philosophers and movies quotations. In the end, both pastor and church people learn from one another about some of the important Christian characteristics of the New Testament. But sadly nobody gets saved."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon: A Supplement","review":"the book is not as described, the picture show different from the actual book, I notice that after I received the book, try to avoid this seller"},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon: A Supplement","review":"Liddell and Scott have long been the authority for English speaking students of ancient Greek.

On the other hand, many of the articles are from experts in their fields and as an overall evaluation, the editors and contributors improved over the first edition witch was very limited in terms of coverage."},{"Title":"The dragon: Fifteen stories","review":"this book contains a broad selection of the works of Zamyatin. He is one of the great writers of the 20th century and is virtually unknown in our intellectually challenged education system."},{"Title":"The dragon: Fifteen stories","review":"I first heard of Zamiatin when I read he was an influence on George Orwell. I believe Orwell read a hand written copy of Zamiatin's novel, \\"We\\" that was being passed around certain literary circles. Even at that time, a hard copy of Zamiatin's work was difficult to find.This collection has been out of print for a very long time. I'm assuming once Zamiatin takes on more popularity, one of the major publishers will make this collection more available.I was extremely pleased with the condition this book came in. I was expecting a very old copy that may have been delightfully dog eared (which I would have been pleased with because I know it's out of print.) Maybe it was the luck of the draw, but the collection came to me in such great condition. The translation is excellent as well and I am glad to have these stories along with his novel.Zamiatin's literary essays are also extremely rare and I hope a publisher takes a chance to print them again."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"This fictional account of Jewish partisans fighting their way through war ravaged eastern Europe is incredibly moving. The characters are so realistically human in their reactions to the chaotic conditions that they encounter. The book explores a chapter of WWII history that is not very well known and does so from the perspectives of ordinary people caught up in the swirling events and joined together by a desire to survive as well as by a common hatred of the Nazis. There is an incredible life affirming wedding scene in the midst of countless grim episodes that demonstrates the human capacity of endurance. The translation is excellent and the narrative is crisp and fast moving. One of the best literary works dealing with the European war.Unforgettable!."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"Primo Levi, from what I know was a very gifted and sensitive man. Levi never forgave himself for surviving the holocaust, he felt guilty because his own life was spared, eventually he committed suicide. A very little known fact of World War II, was the work of the Jewish Resistance. Millions of European Jews perished in the holocaust, some managed to get away, a few managed to hide, and there also were the Jewish Partisans; those who fought. If not now .. when? is an absolutely beautiful story of those souls who fought the oppression. This is not a graphic book of the suffering of the holocaust; this is a great novel about a group of people who in spite of all the suffering keep moving forward. They do hold it together, they make friends, love, sing, and cry, celebrate and mourn. This is not a war glory story, it is a people story, and how they changed and adapted, how they kept going. Yes, the overused expression of &quot;triumph of the human spirit&quot; so appropriately describes the theme of the book, but not always; Levi was realistic enough to see to that. I was profoundly touched by this book and thoroughly enjoyed it as a non-Jew. However, I never saw this book as a journey to Palestine, as suggested by some. These were people rising up to fight injustice and to stay alive, they largely moved aimlessly. To interpret this book as a part of the Zionist ovement would in my opinion be wrong. This is translated book, it is excellent in English, and it must have been even better in Italian. I wish I could read it in its original language."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"While the book isn't a true story, the characters are based on real people Primo Levi met during the holocaust. It surprises, inspires and humbles the reader to know that humanity can exist in the midst of such horrible chaos.I liked the fact that there is not happily ever after, that the characters must fight to produce their own future. But, it is good to know that along their journey, they met many who would help them.Primo Levi is a wonderful writer. He stays true to character, winds the subplots into the main plot without jerky interruptions and allows the characters to be real, not stereotypes."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"&quot;If am not for myself, who will be for me? If am for myself alone, what am I? If not now, when.&quot; This is a famous passage of Rabbi Hillel, and they are the appropriate words to use as title for this book. It is a fictional narrative of a group of Jewish partisans, following their track from Russia to Italy, along 1943/45. Without sensationalism, avoiding detailed descriptions of horror, and using a touch of humor, Primo Levi describes the hardships of partisans who rebelled against injustice armed themselves and carried their own personal war against the enemy, united by a commmon goal to reach Palestine. Interesting characters are developed, and a narrative always with tension and emotion. A Tale of heroism based on documented records of WWII. Primo Levi is not evasive when it comes to his honest thoughts about the enemies (whether Germans, Russians, or Polish) but his message is one of universal human solidarity. Beautifully written, with a fantastic human touch."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"This is one of Levi's last works, the story is about a fictional group of Jewish partisans operating behind German lines in Russia and Poland from July, 1943 to the end of World War II. Levi himself joined a partisan band in 1943, although it was in Italy, not Russia, and he was soon captured and sent to Auschwitz. Although the plot and characters are fictional, Levi has gone to great lengths to make his story as authentic as possible. This novel is based not only on his own personal experiences, but on conversations he had with others, and on other published accounts of the experiences of Jewish partisans operating behind enemy lines on the Eastern Front (Levi even provides a bibliography at the end). This is a book of hope, not of despair. Levi explicitly eschews accounts of the death camps in this work; it is not a work of \\"Holocaust Literature\\". It is a story of the Jewish resistance with universal overtones.What makes this book more than just another \\"war story\\" is the rich cast of characters, drawn with sympathy, humor, and without a trace of sentimentality. Typical of these is the leader of the partisan band, a man of great charisma, and a brilliant decision-maker, who understands that in the forest, surrounded by enemies, with the life-sustaining morale of his small force hanging in the balance, his violin is almost as essential for the group's survival as his weapon. What gives this book such great authenticity is that none of the characters are paragons of virtue; they are ordinary, flawed people forced to draw upon every last ounce of courage and resourcefulness within just to survive to fight another day. Front and center to the survival of the group is the fierce loyalty its members have to each other. Even as the war ends and they are no longer in deadly peril, the members of the band share a common destiny in which the fate of one is the fate of all.I found this book very difficult to put down once I started it. It would be hard to find a more vivid, well-told tale of what it was like for the partisans along the Eastern front of World War II."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"Unlike Levi's autobiographical works , this fast-paced existential adventure details the personal bonds amongst Jewish Partisans active in Eastern Europe during WW2. These brave , determined souls fight the Reich, make love, and forage for bread, while they gnaw on the meaning offered them in a world at war. An unpretentious examination of human fight, this novel ranks as Levi's most portentious examination of the heart of the rebel in the context of the Holocaust. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"....A very little known fact of World War II, was the work of theJewish Resistance.

In my search I found To The Lighthouse and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. I also found Periodic Table by Levi. The book was shatteringly good. Who was this man? Why hadn't I heard his name mentioned before in the pantheon of Holocaust authors and literature?If Not Now, When? is classic Levi. In his immutable style he weaves the tale of Jewish partisans making their way across Eastern Europe into Italy in the final 18 months of WWII. Levi doesn't stretch, he doesn't aggrandize, he doesn't use hyperbole. His telling is straight and clean and true. Many authors have grandly failed to described the chaos in the final months of the war. In his direct style, Levi accomphishes it amazingly.It seems authors and their works always find their place in the world. But Levi didn't in his lifetime and he hasn't yet in ours. He deserves to be read and acknowledged as one of the best.(Please Note: I, in principal, believe that the rating of reviewers seriously affects the alturism of the review process. Therefore I request that you do NOT indicate if this review has helped you or not)"},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"I can hear what you're thinking - \\"Great, another book about the Holocaust!\\" I can understand your impatience, actually. Books and plays and movies have dealt with the Holocaust since only a few years after it was over, and even compassionate people can only stand so many images of misery and cruelty. Nevertheless, I'm going to ask you to go ahead and read \\"If Not Now, When?\\" for two reasons. First, it's not really about the Holocaust itself. Second, it's by Primo Levi.Taking these points in order, this novel takes place not in or around the concentration camps, but among groups of Eastern European partisans fighting the Nazis during the period from 1943 to 1945. Now, let's assume that you've read books or seen movies about the camps, and you may be ready to encounter more of the same in future because you're a decent person and prepared to confront human evil. Even so, I bet you'd love to read an account of people fighting back, even when those people have to struggle at times with cold, hunger, Russian or Polish or Ukrainian partisans who don't like Jews, and occasionally with each other. There's a time to accept one's fate and a time to pick up a gun - if nothing else, \\"If Not Now, When?\\" gives us some variety in our knowledge of the war years. That it's based on fact just makes it all the more delicious.To repeat, then, I urge you to read this novel because it's not about the Holocaust, but rather about a different response to the Nazi horror. I also urge you to read it because it's by Primo Levi, who not only experienced that horror but wrote about it as well as or better than anyone else. He was not a partisan nor an Eastern European - he was an Italian who didn't even speak Yiddish - but I can't think of anyone better suited to give us these adventures, partly because of his approach to Holocaust narrative. He always insisted upon his role as a witness, not a commentator, because there's no comment you can make about such atrocities that would be the least bit adequate. As a result, you get not only the struggles and horrors of partisan warfare, but also the inventiveness, the creativity, the satisfactions and even the humor.Levi survived eighteen months in Auschwitz, and when it came to writing about that, he had the advantage of a central character to concentrate on - that is, himself. Sensibly, he realized that he needed a central character in writing about the partisans if he wasn't to produce a disconnected series of vignettes. So this novel focuses on a Russian watchmaker named Mendel, an artilleryman in the Red Army who fires his gun once before the action of the book begins, gets separated from his unit, and spends the rest of the war moving from group to group, meeting and losing companions, harassing the Nazis and grabbing a moment from time to time to grieve for his wife and family.Here's where we learn that Levi was indeed a novelist, or even an artist. \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is an act of witnessing, all right, particularly in its style; it's always hard to know how accurate a translation is, but at least in English Levi uses plain words and sentences for the most part. So far, this piece resembles journalism as much as literature. Structurally, however, the story grows and develops. Levi chose his events, his characters and his plot in such a way that the partisans, and Mendel in particular, end up in a different psychic environment than they began. We first come across Mendel alone in the forest - he meets a companion, travels with him to other guerrilla bands, eventually finds a sort of home with a mostly Jewish group, makes friends and enemies and lovers, and gradually becomes a man with a plan and a goal. That's a work of art, folks, under the control of a truly great author.The point is this: I can imagine some people disliking the idea of applying artistry to the Holocaust. In a certain way it seems disrespectful, as though turning something so incomprehensibly despicable into a work of art ignores the human pain in it and turns it into mere grist for the aesthetic mill. There are those who do exactly that, but not Levi. He writes this in such a way that the artistry makes the story more human, not less.I think it works by digging deeply into the events and how the characters react to them. There's no glossing over anything here - rather, by examining this material so closely and handling it so expertly, Levi gives you the sense that everything about these people is worthy of his attention, and yours. Some artists approach things as though they are important because the artist notices them - Levi's approach is exactly vice versa.And it scarcely needs to be added that this respect for people and their lives is exactly the opposite of the Nazi world view. So Primo Levi never picked up a gun in Eastern Europe, but with this novel he made himself into a partisan after all. By itself, that makes \\"If Not Now, When?\\" worth reading.Benshlomo says, Literature has its uses."},{"Title":"If Not Now, When?","review":"This review, in correspondence with the paucity of thoughts and emotions evoked by it, shall be correspondingly brief. Levi based this book, his only novel, on true accounts - listed in the bibliography - of Jewish partisan resistance during World War II. I've no doubt that it is very true to life. But this virtue becomes a fault for the reader, or for this reader. People thrown together by war are interested in only one thing: Staying alive from one day to the next. There is little or no room left for the life of those two essential organs: The mind and the heart. The primary questions the book raises on page after page are: How are we going to eat? How are we going to survive the various groups who seek our death? It's interesting history. But it simply does not make for a gripping read. I've never read a book in which the adjective \\"plodding\\" was more apt, literally and figuratively.Gadeleh, who becomes the de facto leader of the group, sums up the perspective conveyed perfectly:\\"I believe in only three things: vodka, women, and the submachine gun. Once I also believed in reason, but not anymore.\\"The prose conveys this \\"banality of war\\" mentality so effectively that it becomes an altogether deflating experience to read it."},{"Title":"Gilbert Stuart.","review":"Beautifully done overview of the greater works of Gilbert Stuart.....and the special section of George Washington portraits is astounding. I've not seen some of these portraits of Washington before. As Gilbert Stuart is one of my favorite artists, this book is a real treat for me.

Anyone who truly loves portraiture will thoroughly enjoy this fine Yale University production. I'm hopeful to be able to view the originals that this publication promotes of Stuart's work scheduled to be on view at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington in early '05.

It is \\"selfish\\" not to take care of your Alzheimer's-afflicted relative in your own home, it is \\"selfless\\" to take care of your Alzheimer's-afflicted relative in your own home.I think that this is already the baseline model that each of us brings with us when we start deciding how to accomodate an Alzheimer's patient that we love. No new outlooks from the labs of academia here. Nor is there any educational material about how ethicists arrive at the conclusions they do.The format of the book is descriptions of seven composite family scenarios. The tone of the writing underlines the judgemental quality of the thinking by narrating in a sing-songy rhythm, and using character descriptions that remind me of the lesson book we used in my Catholic catechism class during grade-school.The selfhood discussion comes too late in the book. The concept of \\"selfhood\\" and the effects of Alzheimer's on selfhood would have made a much better focus for this discussion than the \\"family-care good\\" \\"institutional-care bad\\" framework that was so overpowering. They should have featured why a family would want to protect a patient's selfhood, and how other considerations like safety, inconvenience, and concommitant and equally important tasks (such as parenting young and teenage children) might come into conflict with (or dovetail with) protection of the patient's selfhood.Projecting the long-term consequences to each individual of the choices that they make during Alzheimer's disintegration in a family member would have been a less judgemental angle to approach issues of \\"selfishness\\" from. There was no recognition in any of the scenarios of the effect of long-standing mental illness in family members, including but not limited to the patient, or ethical ways of viewing \\"dysfunction\\" in families facing the care of an Alzheimer's patient."},{"Title":"Alzheimer's: Hard Questions for Families","review":"This book is a wonderful resource for family members with loved ones suffering from dementia.

If you like books thatdrop names of famous persons all over the place, you'll like this book.All in all, it's almost totally satisfying, even to this non-golfer, and who doesn't even watch it on TV! Although I do read about it in the daily paper. Because what I do like is reading. On almost any topic, as long as the book is well-written, craftily plotted, with some wit and characters I wish I could meet, in person. There are a couple of small and annoying editorial glitches, plus one habitual trick that I almost wish the author would have left out. Set during the Crosby Pro-Am Golf Tournament at Pebble Beach in January, 1974, the author, AP golf writer John Logue, continually writes &quot; . . . would in future years . . &quot; or &quot; . . . would win this tournament (or some other one.)&quot; It's nice to know what would happen in years to come, but it might have been better had he made it contemporary, and looked back, rather than all that looking into the future.That's a minor niggle, though. Much can be forgiven for writing of this high quality; there is a serenely poetical walk-through of each of the holes of this famous course, carved as it is out of cliffs and ocean, and exceedingly vulnerable to the whims of Mother Nature. On its own, this chapter could send you heading for a travel bureau - or an instructor in golf, so you could experience it firsthand.Bing himself plays a minor role, finding himself in the hospital. His brother Larry, plus entertainers Phil Harris and Clint Eastwood, rub shoulders with all sorts of major golfers of the time (and earlier) - Nicklaus, Weiskopf, Bolt, Strange, Snead, Hogan - who wander through the pages along with the eventual winner of the rain-shortened tourney - Johnny Miller.This is the fourth of a series about golf writer John Morris and his lady, Julia Sullivan.

Both look forward to the event and a chance to renew old friendships. The Crosby is an invitational only tournament, consisting of the crooner, his friends, pro golfers, and Hollywood celebrities. It is also a time when old resentments rise to the surface, manifesting in fisticuffs between two senior citizens.Morris breaks up the combatants before anyone is hurt, but moments later one of the fighters begins to foam at the mouth and ultimately dies. While trying to revive the man, Morris smells almonds on his breath, leading him to suspect cyanide poisoning. The subsequent autopsy confirms Morris' suspicions. Morris and Julia decide to help their good friend, the local sheriff, on his investigation. When the second combatant turns up dead, a victim of cyanide poisoning also, the sleuths realize a killer is on the rampage and needs to be stopped.Fans of golf, historiography, and amateur sleuths will want to follow the latest escapades of Morris and Sullivan. Though 25 years have passed since the events described in A RAIN OF DEATH took place, readers will be shocked at how much the world has changed.

She was Glinda, the Good Witch of the North! &quot;With a Feather on My Nose&quot; is Burke's autobiography, detailing her illustrious career as an actress. She played in such memorable roles as the wife in &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1941), Mrs. Topper in three &quot;Topper&quot; films (1937-41), the original &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950), John Ford's acclaimed Segeant Rutledge (1960), and many more long forgotten gems. But her book also recalls dating J.M. Barrie and Somerset Maugham, as well as being one of Broadway's first leading ladies long before she made movies. She was born in 1884 and grew up in London, where her father Billy Burke was an internationally famous clown. The toast of Broadway, she married the great impresario Florenz Ziegfeld in 1914. She began to settle into early retirement in the 1920's, but returned to acting after the Wall Street Crash wiped out Ziegfeld's fortune. The book also mentions she was nominated for an Oscar in 1938 for &quot;Merrily We Live.&quot; She certainly did, living a life full of excitement, glamour, and prestige sorrily lacking in today's starlets. Burke died in 1970, and this book has been hard to find outside of antique bookstores. It is rich in Hollywood history, told from a first-hand and non-regretting participant. She is buried in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York."},{"Title":"WITH A FEATHER ON MY NOSE : THE STORY OF A GAY REDHEAD WHO BECAME A FAMOUS ACTRESS AND MARRIED FLO ZIEGFELD","review":"Here is a little book that says a lot! Maybe you would think that this charming &amp; witty lady, with the fluted voice and a 1000 words/minute, married to one of the most important showman of the century would be rather vain? Or you look at the book and think, &quot;Well, that is a short one!&quot;. Prepare yourself, this book is a real pleasure to read!!!!! She says a lot with humor, philosophy and a firm appraisal of the past and doesn't lose lots of book space with false pretense, orrid gossip and infinite lists of shows she did (for that, see Sophie Tucker's &quot;Some of These Days&quot;). BUT, if you are searching for an Hollywood autobio, you might be a little sad: Ms Burke prefers the career that gave her the most reward, the stage and a very good description of her life with that man she loved very much, Florenz Ziegfeld. And please read carefully not to miss the 2 lines on her most remembered role, Glinda in &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;!!!!

Yorktown and the Japanese Carrier Fleet)","review":"I was surprised at the quality of this book, in light of its age and in comparison to numerous more recent works on the subject. The latter, such as \\"Shattered Sword,\\" \\"Midway Dauntless Victory,\\" and \\"A Glorious Page in Our History\\" have the advantage of extensive revelations made possible by the declassification of WWII military archives in the 1970s and -80s. Despite that, \\"Rendezvous at Midway\\" is still remarkably factual and well stocked with interesting details about the ship and the Battle of Midway.An important bonus is the section covering the Battle of the Coral Sea, the fundamental precursor to what happened at Midway. Writings on Midway abound, but good, concise descriptions of the earlier battle are much scarcer. This book provides exactly that, which very significantly adds to its value.Regrettably, the book does contain some factual errors, although they mostly can be attributed to the limits of what was known about Midway in the 1960s. The authors credit the Yorktown air group with sinking the Japanese carrier Kaga, which we now know was the work of USS Enterprise squadrons. (Yorktown airmen actually downed Soryu, which the authors credit to the Enterprise.) There are several other minor historical glitches, such as placing VF-3 pilot Dan Sheedy in the CAP that defended the Yorktown against Japanese air attacks, instead of what actually happened to him, a tragic crash-landing on the USS Hornet while returning from the strike against enemy carriers. (The authors mention the Hornet incident but have the wrong pilot in the cockpit.) There are also some typographical errors that should not have escaped the editor's red pen, like referring to VF-3 skipper Lt. Commander Jimmy Thach as \\"Commander Thack.\\"But such mistakes are relatively few and don't significantly detract from a very worthy account of the Yorktown and its combat history. Anyone who has even a modest collection of Battle of Midway literature should be pleased to add this one to the stack."},{"Title":"Rendezvous At Midway (The U.S.S. Yorktown and the Japanese Carrier Fleet)","review":"I read the book many times when I was a kid, and I really felt the USS Yorktown was one of the great ships that held the line at Coral Sea and Midway. Her sister carriers Hornet and Enterprise did not receive serious combat damage until Guadacanel when the Japanese plaster those two ships. If she was not sunk at Midway, Yorktown would have been there at Guadacanel holding the line was well. That ship gave as good as she got thanks to the resourceful and teamwork of her crew both in a group and as individuals."},{"Title":"Rendezvous At Midway (The U.S.S. Yorktown and the Japanese Carrier Fleet)","review":"This book is superb especially about the enlisted personnel of the Yorktown at Midway and Coral Sea. This ship really held the line while the other carriers Enterprise and Hornet were absent from the battlefield except at Midway; however, those Enterprise and Hornet air groups did not do well at Midway especially the Hornet particulary the fighter groups. Yorktown's fighter group was the only fighter group that saw fighting at Midway from fighting the Zeroes while trying to protect the torpedo planes and defending their carrier."},{"Title":"Hispano-Americana: Introduccion a LA Literatura De LA Conquista Al Siglo XX (Spanish Edition)","review":"In my upper level Spanish college class, I used this book last semester, and am using it again this semester.

David Harris has written an insightful, informative book on the three leaders who were involved in the Iranian hostage take-over. It is the best written book I have read on the subject. The book is clearly written and with such sensitivity that I didn't want to put it down. By focusing in on the personalities of President Carter, the Ayatollah Khomeinni and the Shah of Iran, I came away with a much better understanding of the three men and the incredible mistakes and misunderstandings that can happen in the world of international politics. Harris writes with a dramatic and visual flare that makes it a pleasure to read.Judith Dwan HalletDocumentary Filmmaker"},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"Though I was only seven at the time of the Iran Hostage Crisis, I can vividly remember how the Crisis touched everyone in America as I observed in my household. I remember the nightly new and papers menioning the three players highlighted in this work. With the exception of Carter, I knew very little about these three before picking up this book.Harris provides the reader with a detailed account of each leaders rise to and/or fall from power. In a coup of thorough research, Harris attempts to lay out every twist and turn in the international negotiations to release the hostages. Though the subtitle mentions only Carter, the Shah, and Khomeni, Harris details the actions of numerous other players who interact with the three leaders and influence the course of events in Tehran.The pace of the narrative is like that of an excellent thriller. Harris cuts back and forth between Washington, Paris, Tehran, and the carious locations of the Shah. He does an excellent job in capturing the emotions of the folks involved. The description of the disastrous rescue attempt is fantastic and exemplifies how small things can derail military operations. Harris also concentrates on how a world leader--be it the shah, president, or the Secretary General of the UN--has to be extremely careful in how he or she speaks.One thing I really liked about this work is the final chapter in which Harris details what has happened to each person we met along the way. In so many works of non-fiction and history, we are introduced to folks who are dropped from the focus of the author.Ultimately, this is an important work because it looks at the birth of the hatred of the United States espoused by militant Islams. It is fascinating and disturbing to think that this incident that brought down the presidency of Carter was initially to be a three day \\"statement\\" by a group of students in Tehran."},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"This well written book brought back unpleasant memories of America's first ignominious encounter with radical Islam. I was just out of high school, and can vividly recall the national despair and exasperation over the hostage crisis. In many ways, 1979-80 was the nadir of our post-Vietnam national funk.Harris' book provides an excellent window on the hostage crisis, and the machinations in Washington and Tehran to resolve it. Harris portrays most Carterites in sympathetic terms (perhaps no surprise considering the author's leftist politics), especially Ham Jordan, whose secret, trans-continental diplomatic efforts had him functioning as a de facto Secretary of State. Brzezinski is cast in a much less flattering light, and is derided for his hawkish posture. It's interesting that Harris chose not to (or was unable to) interview Carter's National Security Advisor. The diplomacy advocates Vance and Christopher come across as naive in their aversion to military force or coercion of any kind.On the Iranian side, Bani Sadr (president) and Ghotbzadeh (foreign minister) are gullible in the extreme. From their days together in exile in Paris, it is clear that Khomeini was using these moderates to mask his extremism and advance his legitimacy internationally. The Shah (\\"His Imperial Majesty,\\" \\"Light of the Aryans,\\" etc) is venal and weak, although when the moment of truth arrived, he blanched at unleashing the Iron Fist to quell the rebellion.UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim is untrustworthy and through arrogance, incompetence or both, did more than anyone to undermine the secret Jordan-Ghotbzadeh agreement to spring the hostages.The book is a surprisingly brisk read, given the weightiness of the subject matter. The author's decision to focus primarily on a small number of key players certainly helped speed the narrative pace. But I was a little put off this technique. For example, the State Department official who participated in Jordan's diplomatic gambit is referred to repeatedly as \\"the Assistant Secretary of State\\" - no name, ever, is associated with him. I kept wondering who this mystery diplomat was. Other characters are referred to generically as \\"the NSC official\\" or \\"State's Iran specialist.\\"The author also errs in the epilogue when he asserts that Warren Christopher served as President Clinton's Secretary of State for eight years -- what about Madeleine Albright? These mild criticisms aside, \\"The Crisis\\" is an excellent read and highly informative.The Hostage Crisis was one of the more dismal episodes in recent American history. It helped to fell a sitting president, underscored the perception of American impotence and served as a capstone to the nation's decade-long diminishment on the world stage."},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"If you enjoy historical writing that tells a story instead of hitting you over the head with numerous footnotes and citations, this is the book for you. Long before Al-Queda the US was forced to deal with Islamic Terrorism in the late-70's, and this book does a great job in explaning how it all happened.The writer, David Harris does a great job in extrapolating information from existing sources and a number of interviews with people who were involved in the crisis both in and out of the Carter Administration. The strength of this book is his retelling of the human toll of the crisis and how a number of strong personalities were forced to work with one another.For those of us who remember this time in history, it appeared as if the Carter Administration seemingly bumbled every possible opportunity in addressing the crisis. The book explains how it happened by examining what took place and who was involved both in Iran and the United States. Thanks to his work, we get a better idea of what many hitorical figures such as Jimmy Carter, Khomeni, Zbignew Breziniski and Cyrus Vance were like.As a result, I came away from this book leaning something and enjoying the reading while I gained the information. Solid book that's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"This is a fine book. The research is thorough, and the writing is compelling -- there really are no lulls in the narrative. (My only quibble is with the author's alternating use of first names and surnames throughout the text. Somehow, it just doesn't quite work.)"},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"There is a natural fascination with what may be happening behind the scenes, and that certainly extends to what secret diplomacy may have been underway to resolve such an urgent crisis as that of the 1979 seizure of the hostages at the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Harris, formerly a contributing editor at the New York Times Magazine and Rolling Stone, provides much interesting material about the various diplomatic initiatives. He is strongest in writing about the middle of the crisis, rather than the early days or the final resolution, which have been the subject of several detailed (and more authoritative) accounts[4] as well as much conspiratorial nonsense. Harris gives particularly interesting accounts of the role of Iranian foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who wrongly thought he knew what would persuade Iran's revolutionary leaders to let the hostages go; he ended up under arrest and was executed for his role in a plot to overthrow the government. Harris also highlights the role of private citizen Henry Kissinger as an intermediary with Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.But The Crisis suffers from some serious problems. Harris provides no indication of his sources for particular statements. And in his afterward about his sources, he acknowledges that some quotes come \\"from multiple sources, which I have bound together inside a single set of quotation marks.\\" He lists an impressive set of interviews, including many in Iran, as well as extensive use of primary source materials. But he also acknowledges \\"a special debt to the work of Gary Sick, William Shawcross, Pierre Salinger, and Amir Taheri\\"-three of whom have written books full of unsubstantiated innuendo that rely heavily on fabricated sources.Furthermore, Harris's title misleads. He barely discusses the origins of militant Islam as a political movement. His account is not so much about the three main actors cited in the title-President Jimmy Carter, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and the shah-as about the maneuverings of their top aides. The failure to deliver what the title implies is particularly important when one reflects upon how little result there was from the secret diplomacy on which Harris concentrates. In fact, the hostages were taken so that Iran's revolutionaries could isolate their erstwhile allies in the Westernized wing of the anti-shah movement and consolidate Iran's anti-American orientation; once that purpose had been accomplished, the hostages were released. The diplomatic maneuverings did more to prolong the crisis, by suggesting that the United States was too timid to react strongly, than to end it."},{"Title":"The Crisis: The President, the Prophet, and the Shah-1979 and the Coming of Militant Islam","review":"I know, a lame title for my review, but it neatly sums up David Harris's \\"The Crisis.\\" This richly detailed, insightful book provides both a panoramic and microscopic level of detail into not only the Iranian Hostage Crisis but the geopolitical forces that were coming together in the late 1970s that bore fruit on Sept. 11, 2001.As an opening comment, the portrayal of decision making in the Carter Administration is both exhaustive and maddening. Carter comes off as a caring, if wobbly leader who shows great courage and leadership one moment and jellyfish spine the next. Harris does a great job of giving the reader background into the US relationship with the Shah and our diplomacy in that region during the 1970s.After Carter is elected and the Shah's hold on power becomes more tenuous, the coil unravels and we see the seeds of the hostage taking planted. Indeed, as The Shah (or as Harris annoyingly refers to HIM) teeters on the brink of losing control of his country, Carter's political tin ear (and Zbig's awful advice) start the downward spiral. Zbig comes off poorly as he continues to argue for blind loyalty and support for the Shah even as the political winds are turning into hurricanes in Iran. Even more disheartening is a little remembered attack on the embassy NINE MONTHS before the full scall takeover that should have served as a not so subtle hint that our policies needed to change or we risked reaping the whirlwind. Harris neatly ties together the Shah's nomadic odyssey after he leaves Iran with the effect Carter's allowing him into the US triggers among the radicalized students in Iran.Once the hostages are taken, the feckless and toothless response of our government will make any Democrat hang his head in shame and cause them to understand why that party is viewed as \\"soft.\\" Instead of taking immediate and aggressive action (i.e. release hostages or your country ceases to exist) the Carterites engage in endless months of negotiation without any apparent understanding of the \\"negotiating\\" strategy so common in the Arab World. That being said, some of the book's most interesting chapters involve Carter CoS Ham Jordan's back door negotiations with French liasions to the Iranian government. The clock and dagger elements of their meetings are really enjoyable. That said, the Carter folks showed little to no grasp of how to negotiate, constantly agreed to extend deadlines, saw hope in false starts and in short, could have, with a quick call to Tom Friedman, who was reporting for the NYT at that time from Lebanon understood how they were being toyed with.When Carter does green light military action it ends in tragedy and the US looks even weaker. The disheartening loss of life and the limp support of Cy Vance (he resigned in private before the attack commenced, making it public two days after the tragedy) are not some of our nation's finest moments. Indeed, the hostage crisis largely ends because the utility the hostages had as symbols of US turgidity pale in comparison to the internal strife in Iran and (TRUE IRONY) the invasion of that country by none other than Saddam Hussein (yes, Virginia the very man who has cost us 1300+ lives and 200 billion dollars is the same guy who indirectly got our hostages freed).On the macro level, what is even more frustrating about this episode is that we learned few if any lessons from it. Little is spoken of with regard to adding Arabic agents to the CIA, strengthening intelligence on the ground, analyzing why the hostages were taken in the first place, etc. Indeed, some of the main players (particularly Warren Christopher, whose final efforts to seal the release were heroic) ended up right back in the next Democratic administration. Don't get me wrong, the brief cameo that the Reagan folks make in this narrative is not good, as Harris details the efforts of William Casey to cultivate leakers within the Carter White House, steal debate briefing books, and *possibly* negotiate with the Iranians to NOT release the hostages before election day. These tactics will sound very familiar to anyone who know about the \\"win at all costs\\" tactics of our current administration. This in addition to the efforts of Kissinger and David Rockefeller to lean on Carter to allow the Shah admission to the US in the first place show that poor decision making occurred in both parties.It is clear that radical Islamists took from this experience the idea that we could be cowed and that thought was reinforced four years later when 240 Marines were killed in Beirut and Reagan withdrew, when hostages were taken in Beirut and held for years on end, when Reagan Admin. officials traded arms for hostages, and carried on into the Bush and Clinton years.This book IS a must read for anyone who wants to not only revisit a particularly dim chapter in our nation's history, but understand some of the roots of 9/11."},{"Title":"Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy (with Web Site, Chapter Quiz Booklet, and InfoTrac )","review":"this book is very well organized, easy to understand and gives a great overview in chapter 15 of each model. highly recommended for beginning therapists and as a reference for not-so-beginning therapists."},{"Title":"Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy (with Web Site, Chapter Quiz Booklet, and InfoTrac )","review":"This is an excellent textbook appropriate for a first year graduate class.

The book also gives very detailed explanations of the perspectives, a little bio of the perspective founder, and also provides information on how to use the perspective in today's world. Another unique factor is that the book provides seperate sections within the chapters to explain the the role of the client and therapist. Of all the books I own this is the most comprehensive book that illustrates how each perspective contributes to each other, how they are similar, and how they are different, while demonstrating how a therapist can use each theory."},{"Title":"Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy (with Web Site, Chapter Quiz Booklet, and InfoTrac )","review":"Corey's text is an essential text for those wishing to enter the counseling/therapy field.

In my own particular case it made me faced some realities that had deep roots years back, to say my childhood. This is worth the hundred dollars. Do not hesitate buying it. If you do not like any of the philosophical points of any given theory you will probably like the other one of the next chapter and so on......The chapter describing the life cycle is extra excellent...well the hell incredible.....the best you know which cycle you are in the better prepared for future stages in life the better the chances of not getting absorbed by depression.

It actually explains all those terms that even the most erudite writer sometimes assumes that we all know. That is not to say that this is a book for absolute beginners though. The ingenous listing style means that like and similar terms are grouped so a reader can expand their knowledge easily. It is also a book to read (and how many encyclopediae can say that) as it is intriuging to discover new terms, new techniques and more by reading sequentially. One reviewer has pointed out errors in classification but, as someone involved in indexing in the past I'm surprised that a first edition is so accurate.

I've gotten a little weary of all the nutrition police screaming that anything other than steamed or boiled food will kill us all.The author certainly knows his stuff and I was impressed at the variety of foods one can fry and how to fry them as well. Taylor is also telling the truth when he says that if cooked right, fried food is surprisingly not greasy.I tried my hand at his recipe for Southern Fried Chicken. I followed the instructions to a T: using a deep-fry thermometer and keeping the temp between 365-375 degrees F. The result? The crispiest, most tender and delicious chicken I've fried.

And his writing style is warm and friendly with lots of stories about the many people he has met along the way, and how their experiences have influenced him."},{"Title":"The Fearless Frying Cookbook","review":"With today's health consciousness it was interesting to pick up a cookbook named The Fearless Frying Cookbook written by Hoppin' John Martin Taylor. This book contained over 125 recipes that are almost all fried in one fashion or another. Recipes have the ingredients fried in butter, olive oil, peanut oil, lard, sesame oil, and vegetable oil to name a few. The recipes obviously do not offer any nutritional information. Many of the recipes are poorly laid-out making the cook turn the pages to look at the balance of the recipe that may only be a few extra lines.While many cookbooks keep the recipes to the same or approximate serving sizes, this book goes from 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 and 8 to 10 with some recipes designed for 3 and other unusal serving sizes. Almost all of the recipes are quick and easy and contain ingredients readily available at all basic grocery stores. The book is designed with three different font sizes or styles which make it harder on the eyes of the cook, but easier to pull out the ingredients the directions and the prefaces to each recipe.Recipes include such items as Sopaipillas, Chickpea Fritters with Sorrel, Fried Egg Salad, Fried Calzone, Fried Shark, Sesame Fried Fish, Pan-Fried Crab Cakes, Deep-Fried Turkey Breast, Pan-Fried Pork Chops, Fried Lamb Patties, Okra Fritters, Fried Bananas, and Fried Ice Cream.Published by Workman publishing, The Fearless Frying Cookbook bills itself as a cookbook with recipes that are &quot;surprisingly greaseless&quot;. I give Hoppin' Taylor credit for putting together an entire cookbook on today's most sensitive health topic - frying of foods, but I would have like to see the book contain a few more alternatives to each recipe and the courage to show the nutritional data on each recipe."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"Interesting, but I have not finished the entire book yet.

Feb. 2010, immediately elicit the reader's trust with an objective, scholarly, informative overview of the Book of Enoch, providing an evaluation of a highly uneven, problematic literary work, yet one that throws light on one of the sources behind the greatest epic poem in English literature (Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\") as well as the attraction the book had for perhaps the most difficult of latter-day prophet-visionaries, the poet and painter William Blake. The writers wisely caution the present-day reader against anything resembling a \\"literal\\" interpretation of the text, which was written by poetic, imaginative, creative minds for like-minded readers--an audience persuaded less by logic and reason than by metaphor, literary tropes, and vivid imagery.Blake used Enoch as the subject of his paintings, seeing the book as a demonstration of the \\"mating\\" of the divine and the human and consequently as a text intended to provoke its readers into discovering the spiritual identity of the human. But Blake's was a Romantic reading, typical of Shelley, Byron and the early 19th century poets who viewed Satan as the revolutionary hero of Milton's Christian (albeit universal) poem. A present-day reader is more likely to: 1. view Enoch as a colorful jeremiad against self-deception and pride; 2. respond to the rhetoric of the text in terms of the excellence of its parts rather than the coherence of the whole."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"Book is not an easy read but worth all the time you put into it's study"},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"What seems to be missing from these reviews is the most logical inference to be taken from Enoch and other apocalyptic Jewish apocrypha: These works illustrate the entirely human literary link between ancient Jewish mythology and what would become Christian mythology.If you think anything biblical is inspired by a Supreme Being, works such as this should make you think twice. Here is where we find the first emergence (along with Zoroastrianism and the Greek monotheism of the Platonists and Stoics) of ideas that would come to be considered Christian (because mainstream Judaism stuck mostly with its older texts.)Rather than thinking that Christianity was some kind of special, all-knew \\"revelation,\\" here we can see it slowly evolving out of apocalyptic Judaism before Jesus of Nazareth ever existed.

I can see some parts as being possibly inspired, but question others in comparison to the present cannon of Scriptures. Historically insightful."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"The book of Enoch obviously had a dramatic influence on the development of the New Testament. It is quoted directly as a \\"prophecy\\" by Jude, one of the brothers of Jesus of Nazareth. It explains references in the Epistle of Peter about angels chained in darkness, it has numerous word for word parallels with sayings of Jesus. There can be no doubt it was believed upon by the first Messianic Jews, otherwise known as \\"primitive Christians\\". It inspired them to reject racism, accept gentiles into the congregation and High Holy days, and to replace the condemnation of death penalty under the Torah with social ostracism and forgiveness for those willing to live by the rules. All of this was made possible by the pre-existant Messiah from Daniel 7 greatly elaborated in the Book of Enoch, along with the Lake of Fire for unbelievers, and details on the duties of specific angels. The Book of Enoch also explains the origins of human warfare, makeup and the fashion industry, astrology, abortion and murder for personal gain. It is obviously a vital *prerequisite* to understanding the confessions of the New Testament. The EMBARASSING part -- weather is explained by angels dropping hail from holes in the dome above the sky, and the Sun is said pass from a hole in the wall East of the world and land in a fire put on the West side until the next day. In fact, it says that stars are angels and graphically depicts one being tortured for failing to fly his circle in the night sky correctly. There are cases that only the first 16 chapters are authentic, which contains the direct quote from Jude, the Lord's brother. But still... other essential themes from the New Testament unfortunately inherit the blatant scientific ignorance, there is no avoiding it. That said, the Bible also contains incredibly naive explanations for weather and geography that are simply relegated to descriptive literature even though clearly they were taken seriously when written (such as stars falling from the night sky and landing on the earth, angels opening doors in the sky to let wind come out, etc). Personally, I trust God and believe in his Son, so I don't let the fact that beautiful families he loved thousands of years were born when they were ago stop me from worship. After all, if they saw us neglecting our devotion to God, and our own families, they might laugh at how weak, primitive and ignorant we were compared to the families of their time."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"Book is in good condition, but not the book I thought it was. My husband is very disappointed in it."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"This pseudepigraphon of the Old testament was rejected for what seems obscure reasons, like most of the time with apocrypha, and yet this book is probably essential. It shows that God's creation was far from being perfect, which we knew of course. But it also gives the episode in which some angels known as the Watchers because they were supposed to be watching the human race, got fascinated by the beautiful women on earth. But these angels were not pure spirits and they were sexually very well provided ( the great stars whose privy members were like those of horses 88:3) and males. Hence they descended from their heights and took some women and procreated a new race of beings with them, the famous giants who destroyed the earth. And the book contains two versions of the tale, the first one with women procreating giants, and the second one with cows, this time procreating elephants, camels and asses. This is a perfect parable for those scientists and technicians who invent anything and menace the life of the planet and of humanity with the implementation of their inventions. This will bring about God's decision to send the deluge and wipe life out completely or nearly. To clean up the damage god causes even greater damage : the radical, though not quite final, solution. But this book is also essential because there is a complete vision of the other worlds, paradise and all the hells that were being prepared for the coming apocalypse and that were surrounding the human world. The descriptions are very vivid and the trip in these climes reminds us of Dante's Divine Comedy. And that is not all. The book contains a strong section about astronomy, summarizing all human knowledge at the time about the sun and the moon, not so much about the stars, except the twelve sun portals that will give the twelve zodiacal signs. It also contains a strong prediction in the shape of wisdom chapters and verses and in the shape of dream visions that the rich and the powerful will be destroyed, even if God has to stir some trouble down on earth among their victims or subjects to have them removed from power. Finally it also predicts there will be a final day of judgment when the Elect One will perform divine justice in the name of the God of the Spirits. This is very similar to the Book of Revelation. In other words it is an important source and model for that Book of Revelation. Finally it reveals very clearly that Noah is an albino, the fear his birth caused among his relatives, first of all his father, and how Enoch saved him from destruction, which was normal in those days for off-standard children, with the argument that he had a divine mission to fulfill and that he, Enoch, knew about it because it had been revealed to him in his visions and his communication with God. This book is thus both tremendously human by the desire to get a compensation for the oppression of the majority of the people by a few rich and powerful persons or the fear an albino baby can cause among human beings, and tremendously visionary in a way that announces Isaiah, Ezekiel and John but with an extreme sense of retribution, punishment and destruction in suffering for the rich, the powerful and the violent, essentially, plus the dishonest, the blasphemous, liars, and sexual perverts, meaning here fornicators. This book should be reinstated in the Old Testament and it cannot be ignored, especially since it is one of the sources of inspiration of the English poet William Blake. It gives a vision of the Jewish and Christian religions that has a lot more power by its imagination, its humanity and its great descriptive and evocative style.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"this version of the book of Enoch is very indepth,easy to read.Enoch is a very odd character Genesis states that he walked with god. What did it mean The book gives us the back story to what happened than.The story of lust,betrayal,greed,and hate.Sex hungry angels who try to take over the Earth with there demonic offspring.The book of Enoch comes from a better source than even the gospels,texts left alone for almost a thousand years.There were no rewrites,no editorial changes by people saying&quot;Well this is what they meant!&quot;A pure source of history found with the dead sea scrolls, and in Ethiopic temples.Even if you don't believe it at all,the story is excellent!"},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"I just got this book yesterday, but I can't put it down. This book is full of Messianic prophecy that predates Christ by thousands of years. Jude in his inspired epistle says that the book was written by Enoch himself. If you are a believer of the inspired Word, then this should cause you to sit up and think. It also explains the origin of the demons, and it's not what you've always been taught. The early church all accepted this view of the origin of the demons. I won't spoil it for you. You'll have to buy the book. Here's a hint: We Bible believing Christians accept the worldwide flood of Noah as literal, we then see many flood legends around the world in the collective memories of many people groups. We also see many legends around the world in the collective memories of many people groups in regards to Nephilim. In various mythological tales from Rome and Greece, we read of the god's coming down and having relations with women and bearing demi-gods. The early Christians were aware of these stories and of their true origins. They also knew what demons really were, and what Peter meant in his second epistle when he said that the angels that had sinned were sent to Tartarus (hell in the KJV). All this and more is made clearer by reading the book of Enoch. This book has many verses that are almost the same as those found in Scripture. I have been writing them down in the book as I come across them. Many are from the book of Revelations. Some are from the Gospels and some are from the Epistles. This gives me the distinct impression that the writers of the NT were aware of and in agreement with the Book of Enoch. Here are a few examples: 1 Enoch 50:2 On the day of affliction on which evil shall have been treasured up against the sinners. Romans 2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. 1 Enoch 51:1b ...Sheol shall give back that which it has received, and hell shall give back that which it owes. Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them 1 Enoch 63:6 (speaking of the unrepentant rulers of the earth) And light has vanished from before us, and darkness is our dwelling place for ever and ever. Jude 13 (speaking of false prophets) ...to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. Jude also speaks in this verse of the \\"wandering stars\\". 1 Enoch speaks of the stars also. I could go on and on with the Biblical references and perhaps I will add to this review over time. It just seems to obvious to me that the Biblical writers were reading and using this book. The only downside is that parts of the book may be lost, and other parts added to it over the millenia. It seems that although this book was inspired it was not God's good pleasure to keep it wholly intact. I feel that this book should be regarded as very important, and I personally regard it as at least a deuterocanonical book. That is, at least of secondary importance after the 66-73 books of the universally accepted books. In saying that though, this book is accepted as canonical by the Ethiopic church, which has at its foundation one the Apostles."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"I gave this two stars because the formatting is awful; no real consideration for the electronic book format. Also, the middle third of the book is really boring because it is a metaphorical representation of angels breeding with humans using animal husbandry as a basis for the explanation. While this may have been an effective way to explain things to Enoch's son Methuselah, it isn't very effective for me. :) I'd rather he just lay it all out there in straight talk so I can wrap my head around it without translating it into modern thought.It is still worth reading though.The beginning and end of the book are fascinating. It begins with the way angels changed the history of man by teaching them things which God did not want them to know. And it ends with a short explanation about what Noah was like as a baby (reminded me a little bit of the last book of the Twilight series with regard to the baby Renesmee), according to Enoch, Noah could talk immediately after he was born, so right there we can see he was wired differently than everyone else around him. This is a very cool bit of insight that our forefathers decided we didn't need to know. I feel a bit gypped that I waited this long to read it. This is exactly the kind of stuff my mind craves. And exactly the kind of stuff those folks that assembled our current Bible decided I didn't really need to know. I'm trying not to hold a grudge. ;)"},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"Okay, the reviewer below is wrong about a couple things: A-Jesus said angels &quot;in Heaven&quot; don't marry; he wasn't talking about ones that might take human form! Also, Enoch never in this text is a mediator between God and men. Even if he was, Jesus didn't become the mediator until his rise to Heaven. Now for the actual review: While much of the Intro is wild speculation to say the least, ( I doubt the NT was as influenced by &quot;Enoch&quot; as Mr. Charles thinks ) it is still an invaluable document in studying how the Jews did eagerly await a PERSONAL Messiah and they believed in an EARTHLY manifestation of His Kingdom. The Book of Enoch is stunning in it's glowing poetry and vivid images; this text was of great importance to both William Blake and even modern day Anne Rice. I doubt strongly this is some &quot;lost book&quot; of the Bible, but it has added so much to my faith in the canonical Scriptures that I heartily urge ANY lover of the Word, or truth-seeker, to obtain and study this fascinating ancient text."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"The book description asks &quot;If this book was so important to Christian beginnings, why was it removed from the canon and banned?&quot;. The reason was that the Book of Enoch is essentially not compatible with the Christian gospel. The core story of Enoch, apart from the myth about angels marrying which is explicitly contradicted by Christ (&quot;and do not marry for they are like unto the angels&quot;), there are many other conflict points with the New Testament. The principle one being that Enoch functions as a mediator, a role that 1Tim2:5 allows only for Christ.One can also note that the Enoch version of events where Michael accuses the rebel angels is again explicitly contradicted by Peter (&quot;even angels do not accuse such beings&quot;) and by Jude (who even names Michael as not accusing). Maybe this is why it was not accepted by the church?Enoch originated about 300BC, and the oldest copies, dating back to about 150BC are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. The best modern translations are to be found in the G. Vermes or Martinez editions of the Scrolls, or in the J. Charlesworth OT Pseudepigrapha set from Doubleday. The 300+ page facsimile edition of R.H. Charles' 1912 translation is also worth obtaining for the copious notes, but the 110 page version only contains the text. The translations by Laurence and Schodde are not worth acquiring.Despite all the modern enthusiasm that surrounds this book it is worth remembering that it has always been contested. Trypho the Jew, the Talmud, Pseudo-Philo, all the Rabbis prior to the 8th Century, St. Augustine, St. Jerome were only a few to contest the midrash interpretation of &quot;Sons of God&quot; of Gen6:2 as angels. The book was rejected from the Jewish canon, the Septuagint and Vulgate, and consequently the Apocrypha. After 400AD it was preserved only in minority Ethiopian and Slavonic traditions.It is often noted that Jude quotes from this book, which is true - although with obvious sarcasm as the context shows; Jude's epithet &quot;the seventh from Adam&quot; is taken from Enoch60:8 not Genesis. Tertullian did quote from it and consider it as scripture, along with various other pseudepigraphical and apocryphal literature. It is also true that Peter gets his details regarding the &quot;angels that sinned&quot; being cast into Tartarus from Enoch. As also is indicated by the mentions of &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;cunningly devised fables&quot; with which Peter precedes it."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"I ordered this book, The Book of Enoch, on April 9, 2010.

But since she owns the ranch, she has two goals, to build up the ranch, sell it, go back east, and keep her past secret. One night, a young stranger is shot and killed in her barn. In a pouch around his neck, Matty finds a piece of paper with markings that look like a map of her ranch. She wonders about it, but soon other matters take up her time. The Civil War has just started and the army wants her horses. She manages to sell only a few horses for much less than what they are worth, but worries that the army will come back and take the rest. If this happens, everything she's worked for the last six years will amount to nothing. But this is the least of her worries. A drifter, Tonio Bernini, comes to the ranch and asks to stay on her land in some caves called the \\"cuevas\\". Matty agrees, but tells him he must be gone before winter comes.Tonio is an unusual man. He doesn't have a horse, but walks everywhere he goes. He's very knowledgeable of the healing properties of plants and herbs. Matty is very attracted to him, even though she knows that he is keeping secrets about his past.Matty gets an offer to buy her ranch from a man nobody knows anything about, just that he is from Texas and is a Union soldier. Matty refuses to sell the ranch and dangerous things begin to happen. A brush fire is mysteriously started that almost burns down the house and barns, some of her cattle are killed along with her prize stallion, and Julio, her foreman's son, is murdered. Winona, a free black woman who lives on the ranch with Matty, is accused of being a witch and almost burned to death. Matty finds out that a gold mine might be on her ranch and someone will stop at nothing to own it. What does Tonio have to do with everything? What does he know about the mysterious map? Secrets and lies from Matty's past are about to be revealed and she must fight for her life against a dangerous enemy.This book starts with a wallop and steadily builds to a gripping conclusion. Listen to the Mockingbird vividly re-creates the dangers of life in the New Mexico territory during the Civil War and one woman's triumph over adversity. Matty is a strong woman trying to make her way in a man's world and succeeds admirably. The romance between Tonio and Matty is poignant and sweet. Tonio isn't the usual alpha male, but he is still a great character. Penny Rudolph is a great storyteller and if you like westerns with a touch of romance, you'll like this story."},{"Title":"Listen To the Mockingbird","review":"In 1861 Matilda \\"Matty\\" Summerhayes is a rancher.

A stranger, Tonio Bernini, a mysterious man who turns out to be a \\"healer\\" who studies with priests, comes to ask a favor. Matty allows the man to stay in the caves on her land, but she wonders if she's done the smart thing.When war comes to her New Mexico ranch, Matty is apprehensive about the controlling Confederate Army and put at risk when the Yankee's make their claim to the territory. Someone tries to buy her out. Was it the same person who tried to burn her out? Death comes to her door in the form of her past. Matilda Summerhayes is a strong, resourceful woman, but will it be enough?I felt the heat of the desert sun, the cool of the shade and the water from Mockingbird Springs.

It's been sitting in a special bin right at the front of the store along with many other rare and expensive comics.But that's not why I am confused, no. The reason I am confused is that the cost for this one at the comic book store is currently at only $80. I say \\"only\\" because compared to what these guys paid for it, $80 is down right cheap.No, it is NOT certified 9.6 or whatever, as it is just sitting inside a regular bag and board.

Even if I buy this one for the $80 and send it off to be graded, I am almost positive it will not be accepted as being in mint condition, just good, so I figure sending it off is pointless.But I will tell you this, issue 1, the regular cover, 1st printing is currently being sold on TFAW for $24.99. At just over a year old, this means the $80 copy must have also gone up in price as $80 I believe is the original selling price.

His selections range from the international (All About My Mother, Cachorro), camp classics you've probably never heard of (The Apple, Boom!), to more obvious gay classics (Auntie Mame, All About Eve) and less obviously gay films (Fight Club, Jackass: The Movie), revealing trivia and famous quotes from each film as he goes along.The book's main strength comes from the narrator's voice: a self-described film \\"nerd\\", Duralde reads less like a stodgy, know-it-all critic, than a friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate fan. He's not afraid to trash a film either (I won't reveal which one of the 101 films he lists as a red herring for the hilariously scathing review he gives it).Lightweight in size but heavy in content, this is a perfect holiday gift for friends, film fans, and of course, that \\"funny uncle\\".

Informative, witty, funny and interesting any movie lover will be want to own this book. It is concise and succinct with clever symbols to help describe the film. It will help greatly with trips to the video store and Netflix lists of films to rent."},{"Title":"101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men","review":"101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men is a seminal tome in more ways than one. Well, actually, only one. It hasn't got any of the good pictures in it. But it does have 101 movies that are essential to a broad range of the gay aesthetic. It's got movies for drama queens, diva queens, show tune queens, bears, disco queens, grunge queens and size queens. The only gay subgenre it's lacking is the queer sports movie, and I'm sure once Duralde has seen Summer Storm and Guys and Balls he'll add something appropriate to Bride of 101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men he keeps promising (unless that what he's titling the lesbian companion piece he keeps promising as well, in which case he'll have to include Bend it Like Beckham or, better yet, Personal Best).When I came out, I was told I couldn't get my queer card until I'd seen Torch Song Trilogy and Murder by Death. Both are missing from 101. I'm not going to fight too hard for Murder by Death which is simply a very good example of camp and not particularly queerly significant beyond that, but I will say that I can't imagine a list of queer movies complete that doesn't include Torchsong.But what is in the book is delightful and insightful. I knew Fight Club is about the slashiest thing every made, but it didn't occur to me to put it in a list of must-see movies for the queer cognoscenti. But even the obvious choices - Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Sunset Boulevard, Valley of the Dolls, Sunday, Bloody Sunday and many more - are given new life and new perspective with plot synopsis, evaluation of what's important to the queer viewer, quotes from the movie and an interesting visual classification system.Duralde examines these movies with wit and sensitivity. He makes you want to expand your DVD library, and in some cases your VHS library, not only with the movies he lists, but with the movies he mentions in passing discussion about other movies.And, for the record, I've seen The Broken Hearts Club and it isn't nearly as awful as Duralde makes it out to be, but it is awful.I cannot remember the title or anyone who was in it, but it you're looking for a movie emblematic of what bad queer cinema is, the one with the fireman who begs his girlfriend for a threesome without specifying the gender of the third participant and then is horrified when she brings some guy from the neighborhood who's been crushing on him for years into the bedroom is the one to choose."},{"Title":"101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men","review":"That said, I normally wouldn't have thought, judging from its title, that this book would appeal to me.

Two days later, I turned around and opened it up to page one and began to read it all over again.Anyone who appreciates film or film criticism should thoroughly enjoy this book. Even if (like me or some of the other reviewers) you're not a gay male, there's plenty to entertain you within the covers of this book. Duralde has a singular talent for discussing his topics without weighing down the reader with a lot of jargon, opinion or rhetoric. I completely absorbed his thoughts without having to analyse his statements. By incorporating his critique into discussion of each film, I could understand his point of view without having it get in the way of his hip, stylish method of writing.All in all, this book boils down to one word -- FUN.

They fit closely (Tidyman wrote the book and the movie screenplay), but there are a few differences. Shaft is a good character, with his own ideals and views of life. He's not quite as hard-boiled as other private investigators (Mike Hammer, Jack Hagee to name a few), but he has his moments.This book is a good read if you are a fan of mysteries, but especially if you like the private eye genre, then it's essential. Tidyman's description rivals other great authors of the genre, his dialoge reminds me of Elmore Leonard at times.The only thing that doesn't give this book the fifth star is that it has too many slow moments, and takes a while for the book to get going."},{"Title":"Shaft","review":"I approached this novel after viewings of the 1971 film. I still was lost, as Ernest Tidyman's writing - for this novel, at least - goes in and out of inner monologues without any notification who is actually doing the monologue. Also, the plot isn't really clear: Shaft is supposed to find the daughter of a Harlem mobster (here named Knocks Parsons, differing from his movie counterpart in name and physical stature) but there is also the matter of gangland wars occurring, and black revolutionaries being involved in the matter. It seems like Italian mobsters want Harlem and have kidnapped Knock's daughter to blackmail him into handing over his turf and they are doing this by framing or inciting war with black revolutionaries, and eventually Shaft asks Buford and Knocks to create a riot in a predominantly white neighborhood in order to save the daughter. It's confusing. Too, I think the movie was more credible in handling the daughter's rescue, since it is a straight-forward rescue.Shaft seems to be impulsive in this novel, and not a clear thinker. For example, he kills a mobster in cold blood who is supposedly leading him to the kidnapped girl. However, based on the described circumstances, Shaft doesn't know what is behind the door at the location the mobster led him to, and killing said mobster seems to kill his lead to the girl.As for the love interests, there are two Shaft girls in this novel: Ellie and Valerie. Ellie is arguably Caucasian here in the novel based on the description of blue-grey eyes and pale, white flesh, but \\"black\\" in the film; of course, she could be biracial, but Tidyman doesn't give any evidence of this. Valerie is a girl Shaft meets at his usual hangout, the No Name Bar; in the film she was named \\"Linda,\\" I believe.Overall, a passable introduction to the John Shaft character, but there are stronger books featuring the character that followed."},{"Title":"Shaft","review":"this book was quite possible the best book i have ever read, keeping in mind i have read all of the works by shakespeare and faulkner and hemmingway. This book just blew me away in its goodness. everyone must read it or else die"},{"Title":"The Beauty of Doing Mathematics: Three Public Dialogues","review":"This is another book from the famous Yale math professor, Serge Lang. However, this isn't a textbook - it's a collection of 3 dialogues Lang gave in Paris in the 80s.Certainly the discussions are very interesting. The interactions between Lang and the audience, comprimising mostly 'ordinary' people but also high-school and college students, set this book apart from a textbook. Lang does a fairly good job at covering the material (relating to primes, Diophantine equations, and a bit of geometry/topology) and explaining it to the non-mathematically-inclined. Of course, with this come problems - Lang only skims over the material and much of what he says is not supported by proof.If you would like an interesting read, I would recommend this book. However, if you would actually like to learn something about Goldbach's conjecture or elliptic curves, (first and second dialogues, respectively) a textbook or book dedicated to the subject is a much better source. To compare it to an everyday situation: if you had a conversation with friends, and taped and transcribed it - reading it certainly may be interesting, but not very informative.However, if you like material like this - I suggest you also search for &quot;Martin Gardner&quot; here on amazon.com; he's an excellent author for those not deeply involved with math (and even those who are)."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"If you think you are getting a Griffin story-DO NOT BUY this!

Griffin, under the name Alex Baldwin, published four book in his 'Men at War' series. Later, after he became famous for his other series such as 'Brotherhood of War' and 'The Corps' they were reprinted under his own name.I liked the series when it was first published, and I like it's continuation here. The story follows the usual Griffin format of several continuing stories with each new chapter continuing one story line. In this book the guys are back in the US (mostly) chasing down Nazi saboteurs who have come in by sub and are blowing things up.How good is it? If you like Griffin's style and stories, this is a good one to read. It seems that his son has joined him in writing. Mr. Griffin went into the Army in 1946, so he has to be about 80 now. Perhaps because of this, the book suffers from some 'new writer' problems. I hope that his sun continues the verious series, not only this one but some of the others as well.

The characterizations are enjoyable to read but the story drags a bit.Griffin is adept at including little bits of history into his stories which are little known by the general public. That makes them more interesting and this book is no exception.

It is not his style of writing which is uniquite and holds you attentive so that you do not want to put it down. I was quite disappointed in the book."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I have read and in many cases reread 28 W.E.B. Griffin novels. I've grown accustomed to his usually marvelous blending of historical fact and pure fiction, tight plots, believable characters, powerful narrative: thrillers in every sense of the word.Thus I am saddened to report that \\"The Saboteurs\\" possesses none of the qualities listed above. It is, in fact, boring.Griffin has excelled at running several stories at once in his various military series. Such simultaneity helped push breath and life into his characters. In \\"The Saboteurs,\\" co-authored with his son, William E. Butterworth IV, there are only three primary plot lines and each of them fails.There is the Major Richard Canidy, an unbelievable hotshot OSS operative who is supposed to rescue atomic scientists from various parts of Europe. Gone is the vitality of earlier Griffin military characters. Instead Canidy isn't even a cartoon character. The authors apparently kept running into brick walls, so they used a simple plot device when they lacked a bridge: Canidy goes to the bathroom. Eight times, by my count, within 130 pages. (I stopped counting.) Perhaps there is a hidden message here: Canidy has an overactive bladder; he drinks too many diuretics. Whatever, his visits serve no purpose and are, to put it mildly, puzzling.Trying to add historical color, Canidy becomes involved with the 1940s Mafia with a backstory about J. Edgar Hoover. Here, Griffin makes a major error when he claims that Hoover made his reputation battling \\"mobsters\\" in the 1920s and 30s. Not so. Hoover wouldn't even admit to the existence of the organized crime (the \\"Mafia\\") until the late 1950s. Rather, Hoover went after bankrobbers like John Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde, who had no connection with organized crime. This kind of mistake is unthinkable for the Griffin of yesterday.None of the characters have the memorability of those in earlier works.Another backstory is the infiltration of German saboteurs into the United States. This plot line never quite makes it. The Germans are feckless. Griffin never brings this story to the point of interesting the reader: you know that one way or another the Germans will be captured or killed. No suspense there.Much of this novel is given over to describing the decor of various locales (i.e., the pattern of the wallpaper in Canidy's hotel room); pouring coffee, wine and Griffin's trademark single malt Famous Grouse scotch. These devices in moderation served Griffin well in earlier novels, but here they are excessive, boring and add nothing to the story.In Griffin's earlier novels, there was always a sense of danger: some of his characters put themselves in harm's way and didn't return or suffered substantial injury. In \\"Saboteurs\\", there is no apprehension for any of the characters: the story is so slim that you know no harm will come to them, lest the book end abruptly in too few pages.It pains me to be so negative about a W.E.B. Griffin war story. As noted, I've enjoyed 28 of his works. But \\"The Saboteurs\\" is worlds removed from Griffin's work. The dedicated fan might want to pass it by to avoid disappointment. Those unfamiliar with Griffin would be well advised to start with his earlier works: they will keep you entertained for years.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"WEB's books are always a mixture of great character development (we CARE what happens to those people), history, and action. This book was almost all character, some history and the barest taste of action.The character portion was abysmal. No real development on any front (except one minor cliff-hanger), lots of cameos and recaps of past novels in the series and paper-thin newcomers (who certainly won't be in future novels).The history was based on one fact and a lot of fiction around it. One has to suspend normal levels of disbelief in order to accept the coincidences.As for action, the major event promised throughout the story takes place in the last 20 pages. Butterworth seemed to be in too much of a hurry to cash his advance check. His father would have taken 200 pages to make that portion real and exciting.If this were the first Griffin that I'd ever read, there would never be a second. As it is, I'm so enamored with the various series I'd probably give Butterworth one more chance. However, I'll buy it used or take it from the library, rather than rush to pre-order."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This was the weakest of all of the W.E.B. Griffith books that I have read. I think the co-writer of this book was really the primary writer on this one since it really did not feel like Griffith's other novels. The character development was lacking and the \\"heroes\\" of this novel were really by-standers throughout the book. I never really felt involved with them and they were never really involved in coming up with the resolution. The resolution was through the stumblings of the villains and not anything positive by the \\"heroes\\". I felt that the \\"heroes' were not even the main characters of the book. Overall, a very poor imitation of Griffith's past works. PLEASE write the next one yourself!!!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Don't waste your time nor money on this \\"short story\\". Griffin, sadly, is going the way of Tom Clancy and his Op Center fiascos. Using his name to foist another writer and this book upon his loyal readers reeks of greed. As a devoted fan of Griffin, I never hesitated to buy any of his novels, but this ends that knee jerk faith. Once the excessive descriptive verbage is stripped away, the plot and story line is simplistic and uninteresting. This is a sad departure from entertaining books such as The Corps."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Big, big disappointment. Not up to standards. Just ends with about a half dozen subplots unresolved. I assume the son wrote this book--at least that's what I choose to believe. If Dad wants these series to continue--and we readers hope he does--then find yourself a good co-author and don't have your son continue. At a minimum, get him a good editor."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"As a long time reader of Griffin, I would say this is his poorest by far. I have read and re-read the Corps and Men at War series several times and always feel warmed by the characters each time. I felt let down by this effort. I can only hope that Butterworthless wrote this while Dad was out of town. The characters are barely tollerable much less believable, the plot very loose and the ending should have taken another 200 pages. I really he hope he gets back on track."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I am a great W.E.B Griffin fan. I have enjoyed most every book up until now. It was difficult to follow at first when the time line went from Feb to Mar then back to Feb without any real reason but to follow the two story lines. When my wife mentioned that this book must not be as good as all the others because I keep putting it down, I had to agree. Most of the others kept my interest and they were real hard to put down.The plots could have been more exciting. The Germans could have been more interesting. Fulmar could have started back at the beach where the young man Coast Guard man went missing. Then at the bar when the bar tender/friend was killed after thinking things were not right. But this was once stated and moved on. Investigation into the crime was not started it was just assumed they were out there doing bad things and that the FBI or the OSS would catch up with them. Then to have two blow up in a train and two shot by the Mafia because they didn't pay... boo hiss the OSS didn't have anything to do. Then to start with the Sicily thing and the yellow fever but then dont' say to much about it once Canidy got there, then throw in the nerve gas right at the last, that was lame. What happened to Oh whatsher name in England???? Ann or is this where the next story picks up. She is safe and Canidy meets up with her again and bangs her again and leaves and she gets blown up again.... (what a future plot) Then meeting up with the Mafia in Sicily, after all the research and worrying that there would be trouble, Canidy walks in get the professor and walks out. Not too much of a plot there. Why not some adventure, some misunderstanding... and then let Frank come into the picture and help. Geeee I almost want to change my name to Butterworth so I can help W.E.B with his next book. I am sure it would be better than this one. (The key is with all these bad reviews, no one is going to want to buy our used books.)Better luck next time Griffin. I too will read the reviews before I buy the next one. I bought this one on preorder, now I wish I hadn't.Hope this helps anyone who reads this."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I have read all of Griffins books and have enjoyed each and every one. This \\"book\\" is a complete joke. The promised story about Sicily is an afterthought at the end of the book. There is no character development and subsequently I didn't really care about what happened to them. Of course because nothing really happens we don't need to care what happens.Griffin should be ashamed of himself for putting out a piece of junk like this with his name on the cover."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Prior to purchasing this book, I first read the other reviewers' comments and was all set for a major letdown. Unfortunately, I wasn't disappointed.I first got turned on to Griffin's works with the Badge of Honor series. I had grown up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia - home to the 14th District, scene of many of the antics of Matt and others in that series - and many in my family were cops. I myself was a police officer for nearly 12 years, and these books really resonated with me, particularly the settings in neighborhoods and places that I'd long since left. I moved on from these books to the Brotherhood of War series and was initially quite pleased.However, while reading one of that series, I detected many errors and discrepancies with characters and locations, leading me to believe the novel was \\"ghosted.\\" I'm sure it was, hence the \\"correction\\" novel, \\"Special Ops.\\" The most glaring example was the consistent reference to Camp Mackall as \`Camp McCall'. Anyone who ever served any time in Fayetteville knows what the reservation's name is and what goes on there. So, whether his son, WEB IV, or some other author ghosted it, it was pretty obvious it wasn't the original.I next moved on to the simultaneously published Corps novels, and again enjoyed them quite a bit. In particular, the McCoy character is the \`everyman' we all long to be, but most of us cannot. The satisfaction received by living vicariously through a fictional character in a series of books we enjoy is particularly relishing. However - and speaking of eating something with relish, another of Mr. Griffin's pet phrases - there are many problems that show up in this series, too.I've read all of the series books many times over. As an author myself, and former network television producer, I find crisp, clear writing stimulates me to do my best, so I read other works a lot. But each time I pick up one of these books, something else, to be quite frank, peeves me off.There are numerous - far too numerous that any copyeditor worth their salt would miss - errors in spelling, names, locations, dates, ranks and many other seemingly arcane details to be excused. How, for example, does Ken McCoy move from having a sign outside his home in Tokyo reading Cpl. McCoy to being Capt. McCoy within a few pages, even before his pater familias Fleming Pickering has heard the story of McCoy's being \\"kicked out of the Corps\\" in Book IX? Other examples, of which there are many, have names transposed, and even one character talking to himself! And whatever happened to the years 1943-1950? There was a lot of good stuff, interesting times and even better human interest-type plotlines left go when he jumped from the Gobi Desert to Korea.And so it was with some trepidation that I first picked up The Saboteurs. My anxiousness to read another great story - trying hard to forgive the mistakes, as the \\"yarn\\" was a good one - gave way to despair rather quickly. Caniday, a character I'd come to like, although he could have used more development once moving to England, has descended into hell, suitably redecorated as a bathroom, according to many other readers. I found the storyline not fragmented as much as a series of short vignettes which, while seemingly related, really never gel let alone weave together. In short, the book became boring to read and a disappointment to own. I'd rather have borrowed it from the library and spent my money on something else more worthwhile.While we're on the subject of problems, I was wondering if anyone else picked up on the fact that Final Justice in the Badge of Honor series seems to have moved forward thirty years in time, even though the characters only age two years or so? Laptop computers, high technology, NSA-like erasing software with multi-gigabyte drives? Yet the originally books took place in the 1973-1974 time period, when computers were not on the desktop yet - and the smallest mini's were literally still the size of a large executive desk. While it makes for an interesting detective story, particularly with the reliance - as often is the case - on high technology to aid in solving a crime, there really is no place for it in this novel, and I believe it was a device invented by whoever ghosted this book to cover for a lack of plot development. Matt Paine has become the Jim Kirk of the Philadelphia Police Department, \\"spreading VD throughout the city\\" as it were.It's a shame to watch a revered sports hero hang on too long, unable to play up to the standards they and their fans set for them. It's just as big a disappointment to see a favorite author begin that long, slow descent into oblivion. A good ghostwriter, son or not, should be able to follow the \\"bible\\" of the series and produce a seamless continuation.Where is Franklin W. Dixon when you need him?"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I can see where Griffin attempted to shore up the writting in this book but the plot was weak, not sharp, and drifted.

The story ended aburptly and that made the book a waste of time........Sad."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I've read a great deal of Griffin's novels and have enjoyed his writing but I was most disappointed in Saboteurs. He builds great characters only to unceremoniously and quickly kill them off leaving you to wonder why he spent so much effort telling you about the character. The title characters are sacrificed seemingly early in the story. About 20 pages from the end, as a second story develops, one wonders how it can possibly take place in the remaining pages. It doesn't. Instead of the great storytelling one expects, the writer breezes over the storyline to a rather abrupt conclusion. I'm sure there's a sequel in the works, but I won't be buying it."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"All Griffin books are pretty much the same, and I've read them all. This one lacks a cohesive beginning and a decent ending. It's like they cobbled it together out of other stories, parts deemed not good enough for past books. They were right. The resolution of this story, both of the saboteurs and the Sicilians are laughable, and implausible. I'm glad I got this one at the library, because if I paid any money for it I'd want a refund.This is for die hard Griffin fans (like myself) and even then, not for all of them. At least I got some sun at the pool when I read this."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"After 20 years, this book clearly shows that the master of military fiction/history has allowed the torch to be passed to his son and clearly posses little if any of his dad's skills. From the basic story, which is o.k. to the descriptive tools (weak at best), the story ends with nothing. It just ends, as though the author had something else to do and didn't have the courage to say good bye to the listener. It's horrible. I really hate to see this book and having waiting for a new book every year or two for many years, I now dread another (which I'll buy as well I'm sure). Any reader, who has followed any of his five series, will be greatly saddened by this book; I'm sorry for the great writer, William Butterworth, we've come to know and love as \\"W. E. B.

Usually talent skips a generation, and Daddy Butterworth should know better than to have his son pitch in with such an effort, then get egg on both faces and lose much of the value of the elder's franchise.All I can say is that I was disappointed (it ends in mid-plot) and happy that I took this one out at the public library. That is to say, I wouldn't buy it for any price, and probably will be kicking the WEB Griffin habit pretty fast."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This was not one of his best by far.

I suspect he had little to do with the writing--only lent his name probablyBoring. Much detail about life in the US in 1943 and most of it wrong (I remember those times).

Butterworth IV, whose name also appears as an author, must have done most of the writing. Character development, plot, and overall qualilty of writing are not what I would expect from a Griffin novel. Characters which have appeared in earlier books in this series appear again, but it is just not the same. Griffin either needs to start writing himself again or get out of the business.

Griffin for many years and generally buy the hardcover rather than waiting for the paperback. This time I made a mistake. Griffin is obviously trying to pass the baton and the income from his franchise to his son. However, while Griffin is good at character and story development his son is not. In this book the German sabatours in the U.S., who should be the cream of the German intelligence operation, do stupid things so they conveniently get killed off. There are a number of instances of happenings which beg to be developed which just aren't. Particularly, the hero facilitates the escape of a number of Italians from the clutches of the Germans. This just happens with no associated story development. Needless to say I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I am a veteran, a pilot, a professor and a former cold war warrior. I have been a great fan of Griffin's books because they were technically accurate -although his knowledge of instrument flying is twenty years out of date--and they remind me of situations I have been in and of people I have known. The Saboteurs is a disappointment. Mr. Griffin's books were interesting in part because the characters were real and that may be because he was writing from personal experience based on people he knew. The characters in this book are flat.A very minor point; in the previous books, Eric Fulmar was not illegitimate. I can only infer from this that Mr. Butterworth needs more supervision. Still, it was a fun read and one can only hope that Mr. Griffin will be a more active participant in writing the sequel."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"The old man is getting old and he's trying to set his son up to be a writer. I get it. But what it completely irresponsible is that WEB wouldn't groom his son to take over his legacy. And even more reprehensible is that Butterworth didn't study his father's craft in order to maintain the high writing caliber and crafted storytelling. Butterworth obviously was told to write some chapters, and WEB just stuck them in to make it look seamless. I don't know what's worse: That Griffin didn't aptly teach his son how to be an author, or that Butterworth fells so entitled to his father's readership that he didn't bother to learn. I will never buy anything with Butterworth's name on it, and if that comment by the other reviewer is true - that Butterworth is just a publicist for the Boy Scouts, then he should be ashamed of himself, trying to fill his father's shoes without ever having worked as a writer or even as a journalist."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Good plot with pertinent diversions, lulls only to catch you when you are least looking to further the main story line.Good character development and very good historical fiction accurate to the actual facts."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Not worth the money.

These newer works of Griffin seem to be published without an editor ever having glanced at the pages.

That's it for me, I'll never buy another of his books.W.E.B., Truman wasn't sworn in as VP until January 20, 1945.

I've read every single one of Senior's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them for what they are, fictional rendering of loosely based history centered around an overpriveleged gregarious main character, be it spy, marine, aviator or cop.

There's a story tightly woven with bits of history and characters to cheer on.I just re-read the Brotherhood of War series and I'm looking forward to re-reading the Corps series in a few months.

It is rich historical ground to play with and they have done it well. Sure, there were a few spots where things moved a little slow, (I can think of several hundred pages of Winds of War or Shogun that were like that) but I think it is obvious that the authors are building a lot of background for things yet to come.Local detail is rich, characters show that usual \\"WEB\\" touch that we all love, and I suspect his son's involvement is a harbinger of great team work to come.So don't listen to the critics here. The problem a highly successful author such as WEB faces is the benchmark set by some previous absolutely exceptional work, which makes it difficult to achieve recognition for what is nevertheless a darn good book such as this one.

Griffin book and loves them. He is his biggest fan. He said the book was fantastic."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"W.E.B. Griffin and his son, William E. Butterworth IV, have collaborated on a fast-paced novel about the heroes of World War II, a return to the popular Men at War series. \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan is the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and has the job of networking his agents to the best of their abilities. The action moves around the world, in chronological order of events, from Sicily, London, New Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma, New York and Algiers. Major Richard M. Canidy is the first agent Donovan has to reign in from overzealous proceedings in his recent past. Canidy went solo on a mission to Hungary and now must face the consequences for his rogue actions.Timing is important in February 1943. German U-boats have sneaked into Atlantic waters, wrecking havoc close to American shores. Highly trained, Hitler's SS units have been successful in landing agents in the United States to detonate bombs in areas of high civilian concentration. These enemy saboteurs will make their presence known and instill fear in the public. Canidy, his boyhood friend Eric Fulmar, and agent Stan Fine have been called in by Donovan to locate and eliminate the suspected saboteurs. Canidy's summons, however, carries the undertone of rebuke for his Hungarian escapade. Canidy fully expects to be assigned a desk or, worse, to be fired. But Donovan has a different agenda for his rogue agent.The authors profile real personalities of the times, alongside their fictional agents, to bring the reader directly into the story. The well-documented rivalry between FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and the OSS office is on display in THE SABOTEURS. Hoover soft-pedals the explosions on American soil to contain terror in the public. Hoover's harassment of citizens with possible anti-government sympathies is played against the tactics of the OSS, a direct-action approach. An FBI agent suffers embarrassment by Fulmar's superior physical ability in one comical scene.Canidy's assignment is to invade German-occupied Sicily and to evacuate a scientist, Dr. Rossi, whose life is in danger. The doctor's colleagues have been infected and murdered with a deadly Yellow Fever virus. Before Rossi is deposed likewise, his brilliant mind can be used against the Germans; he has knowledge about developments in atomic fission.Canidy finds himself aboard a vessel owned and navigated by mobsters from New Jersey, fishmongers who conceal illegal activity by legitimate business on the Atlantic loading docks. These Mafia personalities are well-developed characters and do elicit sympathy during the read. The mob's heyday is colorfully drawn, with historical accuracies about well-known, incarcerated mobster leaders. Canidy is at their mercy in order to land successfully on Sicilian shores.Female characters round out the list of players in the story. Ann Chambers is the love interest in Canidy's life, a string constantly pulling him to London, her base of journalistic operation; she's the missing equation in his quest for happiness. A German actress beguiles Fulmar and becomes a target in his hunt for the German saboteurs. One of the same Germans being hunted by the OSS himself falls for an American, a prostitute abused by her employer.THE SABOTEURS is a compelling story based on real tales from World War II and is dedicated to their memories. Any reader who relishes pages from history will enjoy this return to a successful premier series. The one regret is that the book is too short. One thirsts for more and hopes that Griffin and Buttterworth will compile and release many more.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Consistent with all of his previous works of well-researched historical fiction, Griffith and an Editor/co-writer deliver another tale about the origins of the CIA during World War II--this time focusing on both German sabotuers in the states and U.S. serviceman starting to address the Nazi War effort with their own resistance in Italy. This is the continuation of the stories of Dick Canidy and Eric Fulmar, friends from childhood and heroic even if somewhat superficially sketched. As is true with most of his heroes, they share a toughness and a devotion to doing what is right while not missing opportunities to enjoy themselves. This time their stories interact with J. Edgar Hoover, the Manhattan Project, the Mafia, and, of course, Wild Bill Donovan."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"When one reads a book by W.E.B.

One thing can alway be predicted, you will look forward to his next continuing novel in either series: Honor Bound, Brotherhood of War, The Corps, Badge of Honor, Men at War or Presidential Agent. The Saboteurs is no exception."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"The Saboteurs was well worth the wait. W.E.B.

The book is fast paced and action packed always with the hope of more action in a future book."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I've always enjoyed these W.E.B. Griffith books and looked forward to this one, but alas, it wasn't to be. This has different story lines that never seemed to come together. It's like a series of short stories within the same time frame, but by 3/4 of the way through, they still hadn't come together, and I flat gave up on this book. There are too many other books to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Like a few others who have posted here, I am not one to leave reviews, but this time I felt a compulsion to speak out after reading the newest novel with Griffin's name. I am sad to see so many negative reviews, but at least I now know I was not in some advanced state of dementia when I read The Saboteurs. Never has a Griffin book taken me so long to finish, and unlike every previous novel where I have always been sad to reach the end and read the last page, this time I was disappointed that I had read it at all. I have always accepted there would come a day when the novels would end. After reading this novel, I would prefer they ended vs. evolving into this new style.I was pleasantly surprised to see this out of cycle release on the book shelf, as I am used to maybe one release a year usually in January. Since it had been a while since I had last read the adventures of Donovan's men at war, I decided to pull the previous four novels off the book shelf and re-read each one to get up to speed. Then I began the Saboteurs, and quickly realized the author of this novel was not the author of the previous four. Had this been my first Griffin novel, there never would have been a second. Whereas WEB made you feel as if you were a fly on the wall watching all that occurred, his son moves the wall out of the mansion and into the outhouse.Case in point, WEB would make you personally feel the potential loss of a certain reporter in London, have you worried and make you ask your friends if they had seen her. The author of this novel barely gives it a side note, and then almost never mentions it again. And when it comes to the sexual liaisons Butterworth, um... less is more.I could go on, but in reading all the other one star reviews, just about everything I wanted to say has already been covered, and unlike Butterworth I do not feel the need to go on ad nauseam about things that no one wants to read.I have to assume Butterworth will read these reviews, probably be stung by them, and hopefully learn from them. I will give the Griffin Dynasty one more chance, and hope the next Griffin novel is a return to the glories of yore.Wilson Meloy"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Having read and absolutely enjoying ever other book he has written, I was devastated by the poor overall quality of this book. W.E.B. Griffin DID NOT write this piece of junk!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I bought this book because I had read an entertaining WEB Griffin book about a Luftwaffe pilot in Argentina.Unfortunately, it looks like WEB didn't write this book. It is absolutely terrible.There are 2 or 3 plot lines, all of which are pointless.One plot line includes German saboteurs in the US. The FBI and the OSS are after them independently. Who wins? Well one set of saboteurs blows themselves up accidentally. The other set crosses the mafia, and is killed by them. So the entire subplot involving J Edgar Hoover, The FBI, FDR, and an OSS Agent is totally pointless. The mob is involved in another plotline wherein The Protagonist Guy (hereafter, TPG) wants to create an espionage network in Italy. It's really just an excuse for stereotypical mob talk and toughness. After many pages, TPG goes to Italy and doesn't require mob assistance. The entire subplot is thus pointless.In the first few pages of the book, a scientist sees bad things happening around him. In the last few pages, TPG rescues him. The 300 pages in the middle have nothing to do with this scientist. The rescue happens in about the last 4 pages. TPG walks though German-held territory without seeing a soldier, walks into the town, gets the professor, and they walk to the dock. In an unbelievable coincidence, a mob-related fisherman from NJ (whom TPG knows) pulls up RANDOMLY at the dock. Randomly. The scientist and TPG get on the boat. But as they are leaving the dock, TPG finds out that a freighter RIGHT THERE is carrying NERVE GAS. He leaps off the boat saying, \\"If I am not back in 10 minutes, leave without me...\\" (*snort*) A few minutes later, the freighter blows up! (There are apparently no guards and nothing is explained. This whole freighter thing happens in a single page.) But it's been 10 minutes and TPG isn't back! The boat starts to leave! TPG jumps out of the darkness an onto the boat! YAY! And then TPG's pickup submarine arrives 4 days early and picks them up at the wrong spot. What luck!

Characters - weak at best. Plot - barely interesting. Intrigue - non existing. Ending - it just happens to run out of pages ... you feel nothing ended and there isn't any lead to another follow up book or masterful end to a villain.I hope this is not a reflection of the end for WEB.

I was scratching my head, trying to figure out just what was missing here.In all of Griffin's previous works, his characters all sizzled with energy, the dialogue was appropriately *salty*, and the plot lines were almost ALWAYS a bit interesting. Sadly, none of these elements were present in this volume. Even the major protagonist , Richard Canidy, comes off as a *sad sack*. This COULD have been an exciting book, considering the element of German infiltration and sabotage in the eastern U.S. Even the young coast guardsman with a buttered sandwich didn't really help much!

And now Griffin seems to be joining this list with this book. As one reviewer put it, this story which begins with some promise goes nowhere. Hopefully this is an aberration for Griffin from his past books because it is the first of his works that really is not up to his usual standard.It remains to be seen if this is so when his next book appears.The only reason I give this book 3 stars is the insight it has on J.

Granted, most of his series have left a lot of the combat out of them, but this one was a big hole in the book.

Griffin again falls back onto the FBI OSS rivalry and the old boy net of FDR's government. The vision of the military and intelligence services as a playground of the rich and well connected, which has some grounding in actuality, is again overplayed. Those unfamiliar with the history may be a bit confused - but WEB fans are familiar with this internal conflict by now. The problem with this novel is that it stops abruptly half way through the central events. I fear what we have here is a set up for numerous shenannigans as Patton and Monty race to Palermo in a forthcoming \\"Invaders\\" or some such novel. Ah well, if the tale had been finished, this would have been a great beach book. I'll wait until then and give it two stars for now, but reserve the right to add some more when I see the next half.

Next time I'll wait and buy a used copy, YOU keep your money,"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This book reads as if it's only half the story. It's literaly half the length of Griffin's other books (about 250 pages vs. a typical 500 pages). It reads as if Griffin was forced to tack on a quick ending in order to meet a publication deadline. What happened? My guess is that this book was largely written by his son who is a new novelist and perhpas a slower writer than dad. He could not finish the book on time, so the publisher made him quickly come up with an ending for the half finished book so that it could go to press on time."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Did Griffin really put his name on this???

Then I thought I would read what other people thought of it. I was very surprised to find a few (very few) who thought that it was a good read. I am WEB's greatest fan...read them all. This is awful...not worth the paper it is written on. Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book. There really isn't a plot or story line...there is nothing!!!

There is a lot of detail, obviously for some too much, and as often happens in Griffin's books the ending is rather quick. But maybe that's the charm of his books, you don't spend 15 pages on a dog fight, but on the way the OSS or the military works. Let's remember the first book in The Corps series was great but was really a build up to the START of WWII and the rest of the series.I'm not willing to give up on the series yet. Maybe I should not have read the reviews before the book since I then tended to look for too much detail. To me this book is really written like his other when it comes to the ratio between background, action, personal lives, etc."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I cannot help but think this book was cranked out to just meet some deadline. We have all the usual Griffin characteristics such as several of the primary characters having more money than some small countries. All of the women are beautiful. The lower-ranking officer bumping the higher-ranking officer off of a flight. After reading these same scenarios in many of his other books, I'm getting a bit tired of them. And maybe that is how the book was written- just grabbing a handful of existing scenarios, shuffling them around, and write a bit of new dialogue to fill in the gaps. This book also demonstrates another recent characteristic of Griffin's books, namely the entire book is a build-up to some pivotal climax. Yet the climax itself is maybe a page long and extremely anti-climatic.I will agree these are never meant to be classic literature. But would it hurt to have someone else read the book before it is sent to the publisher? Then maybe we wouldn't have to read about the taxi driver putting the cab's transmission in Park. I really doubt many taxi's had automatic transmissions in 1943."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I can't wait for a WEB publication. This book is , I really don't know.

Botterworth IV, begins prior to the invasion of Sicily. And, as usual with Griffin's books, weaves often little known historical events into the stage for advantures of his fictional heroes.

Canidy prepares for an operation in Sicily and Fulmar chases a group of German saboteurs in the states. Much of the story revolves around the characters Fulmar is chasing, and the underworld figures Canidy is dealing with, The plot moves well, and leaves the reader wanting more.

If this book was written by IV, then he needs to start his own series, and let WEB continue writing - alone - books in his series. If there is another in the \\"Presidential Agent\\" series, I hope IV stays out of it. Otherwise, it will be another series that comes to a very disappointing end.By the way, I paid $9.99 for this book new ...

This one is set sometime after the Terran Empire rediscovered Darkover. Now there are both the Darkovan natives, as well as men from Terra living on Darkover. This novel begins in a way that we have seen several times before: with a crash of a Terran vehicle on Darkover. This time it is from a team based at the Terran outpost at Thendara. Andrew Carr is a member of the Mapping and Explorations team that is slowly gathering information about Darkover. In a winter storm, the plane crashed and it was only through what Andrew thought was a hallucination that he was able to survive for very long in the storm. Andrew had visions of a woman named Callista guiding him away from the plane and to safety, but he had difficulty believing that these visions might be true. Eventually, Carr does come to accept that the vision is more than a hallucination, but someone communicating with him.Damon Ridenow has been called to help find Callista, who has gone missing without a trace. Before Damon arrives at Callista's home he has to travel through someplace called \\"the darkened land\\" where the land is in shadows, uninhabitable and attacks can come from invisible assailants. Not a place you would want to spend much time. After passing through \\"the darkened land\\", Damon learns more about Callista's abduction and also meets Andrew Carr who was led there somehow by the vision of Callista. When Andrew and Damon discuss what has happened, they see the connection and that the only way to save Callista is by working together. Damon is surprised to discover that Andrew, a Terran, also has the potential to be a telepath, which Damon believed was a skill native to Darkover.Throughout the Darkover series we hear that there are non-human races on the planet: the chieri and the cat-people. While we see the chieri once or twice, we have never seen the cat-people before and this was an area that I was interested in. For the most part, they are not developed as a race or as characters, except that we now know that some can be telepaths like humans (and chieri). We also know that they are mainly enemies of humans (though they have worked with the less reputable humans from the Dry Towns), though Damon does allow that their motives and culture are so far removed from human that it would be difficult to truly comprehend it.This is a short novel, coming in less than 200 pages, but I found it to be fairly entertaining and I suspect that it sets the stage for the much longer \\"The Forbidden Tower\\" which features many of the same characters. \\"The Spell Sword\\" serves as introduction to Andrew Carr, Damon Ridenow, and Callista. It is fairly good for a fantasy novel, though it does not feature the depth of some. This is a straight forward story with some action."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"Darkover history has a lot of magic weapons, for an example the legendary Aldones sword. This story is about another sword, one with a matrix in it that aloud Don Steban, one great warrior that has been hurted in battle and can not walk, to fight trough the person who is holding it. This book, also, present us to Andrew Carr, a terran who has been haunted by the spirit of a Keeper wich is trapped by non-humans appart from her friends and family. He found himself atracted by the strange planet and when his plane has crashed in the Hellers he needs to believe in the strange woman, which appears only to him, to survive. Another important caracther that appears in this book is Damon Ridenow, a man who has lost his faith in himself when the Keeper of Arilin Tower send him away. This man starts here his journey, to get back his own confidence and leadership; the following steps in his path will be shown in the book named Forbiden Tower."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"Andrew Carr is stationed on Darkover, drawn there by a strange vision of a woman he has never met. When his plane crashes in the wild mountains of the planet, it is a power that he does not believe that draws him to safety. Both he and the Comyn Lords of the hills will have to overcome their prejudices to rescue Callista-- the mysterious woman of Carr's visions.The Darkover series is absolutely brilliant. I still find it the best of Bradley's work. The Spell Sword is an excellent example. Prejudice, culture shock, gender, and self-confidence are the themes that make her work so very good.Highly recommended, either as a separate book or as part of one of the omnibus editions. The Daw paperback from 1974 comes bound with a note about the chronology of the series."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"I hadn't read this in about 20 years but decided to try it again. I really do like many of Bradley's Darkover books, especially the Renunciate books. However, The Spell Sword, one of her earlier works, has little depth to its characters and is not as well written as her later books. As another reviewer said, The Forbidden Tower, which I really like, has these same characters. The Forbidden Tower was published 3 years later and Bradley had improved her character and plot development skills most satisfactorily by then. The Spell Sword left me feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with the weak characters presented in the book. What little informationthe Spell Sword has can be found in later, much more well-written books.Its most interesting to read the Darkover books in chronological order (as listed at various websites), but you can skip this book and go directly to The Forbidden Tower and you would not have missed anything."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"As I go through the Darkover books in the order in which they were written, the quality of MZB's writing continues to improve, but the stories seem repetitive. A person from Earth comes to Darkover, is drawn unexpectedly into adventure, and subsequently decides that Darkover is his true home. The Spell Sword is no exception to this pattern.I did enjoy this book, partly because (as I implied) it is better written than most of what came before it. Here, we meet Damon Ridenow, a bookish Darkovan who is caught off guard when he and his traveling companions are ambushed by mysterious, invisible attackers. Meanwhile, a Terran named Andrew has crash landed in the nearby mountains, and visions of a woman lead him to safety -- and to Damon Ridenow. Together, they do battle with the powerful, invisible foes who attacked Damon and who are besieging and terrorizing Darkovan towns, holding hostage the woman of Andrew's visions.These foes are certainly the weak point of the book: we know they are \\"cat people\\" and that they've discovered a matrix crystal that gives them great and dangerous power, including that of invisibility. But a mysterious enemy should only be mysterious to a point, if you want them to be interesting. Their motives and their physical characteristics (they aren't always invisible) are left so ill-defined that I found myself imagining a bunch of Felix The Cats with evil grins attacking our protagonists. The cat people never become scary nor interesting.The Spell Sword is another readable, but somehow lacking, Darkover book."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"Andrew Carr is part of the Mapping and Exploration team which is charting the planet of Darkover for the newly-arrived Terran Empire. Like all Earthmen, Andrew is cynical about psi powers, so he shrugs off a meeting with an old fortuneteller in the Spaceport's trade city who shows him a beautiful red-headed girl in her crystal ball.What Andrew doesn't know is that this dim, cold world is filled with people with vast psychic powers they call \\"laran\\" or \\"donas\\", and Andrew himself has been suppressing his potential in the noisy, crowded empire. After his plane crashes in the icy mountains, Andrew receives visions of the lovely Callista, who has been kidnapped by nonhumans. The Earthman must overcome his prejudices and inner mental blocks to aid her kinsman in her rescue, then ultimately find his place between the two worlds.Classic Bradley.

Darkover drew him, Darkover haunted him-and when his mapping plane crashed in unknown heights, Darkover prepared to destroy him.Until the planet's magic asserted itself-and his destiny began to unfold along lines predicted only by phantoms and wonder workers of the kind Terran science could never acknowledge."},{"Title":"The Spell Sword: A Darkover Novel","review":"The story line is so exciting, and the characters so lovable. A person can't help but get into it, and have a hard time not thinking about the story or wondering what's next.

It is illustrated, as opposed to the photographs used in some of the other books, and the pictures are cheerful and bright.

Later, a car is derailed on one page, then mysteriously is back on the tracks in the next one. Mud is next to the tracks on one page, then over the tracks on the next, etc. When Diesel comes to rescue Thomas, the train is already past the mud. As far as the story goes, Diesel changes his mind and decides to help Thomas \\"because he is ashamed.\\" Up to that point, Diesel had been acting in response to unfair, judgmental treatment (steam engines being impolite, assuming Diesel will be bad before he has a chance to do anything, then the cars mock him for accepting the criticism so meekly), and aside from a scolding from Sir Topham Hatt, Diesel has no more interaction. The assumption seems to be that because Diesel is \\"bad,\\" he should accept disrespect. It's a kid's story, which some may use as a flippant way to excuse these kind of details, but I feel that kid's stories teach whether they are meant to or not, so they should be held to a higher standard."},{"Title":"Thomas and the Naughty Diesel (Thomas & Friends) (Pictureback(R))","review":"My daughter loves Thomas and friends.

I found this book to be charming in every way."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the characters in this book spend entirely too much time thinking about sex. I'm not a prude; it's just that it seemed completely out of context.They make first contact with aliens; they think about sex. They find themselves on an inexplicable, incomprehensible landscape; they think about sex. They fear imminent death; they think about sex. They meet God; they think about sex.This seems at first to be a brutal view of human nature, but later it becomes downright bizarre. Even chimpanzees who find themselves in a completely alien place and have no idea how they got there wouldn't think about sex five minutes later, but these characters do.The characters sound interesting - an intelligent woman, her 14-year-old son, a chauvanist pig, a regular guy, a young girl, and her older, wiser mother. Nevertheless, they all have just one thing on their minds.In case your curiositiy is piqued, no, this isn't an erotic novel. If it was, all of this would make sense. Instead, it's as if the cast of a bad porno movie was suddenly transported into what would have otherwise been a fascinating SF novel.In a twist of plot at the beginning of the story, the characters are forced to start their journey without the team of scientists they planned to bring. I'm afraid all of the truly interesting and intelligent characters missed the boat."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"Like the author's previous works, White Light examines the human condition against a backdrop of ideas of the grandest scale. Unfortunately, in this instance it feels like the authors have lost control. The characters are one dimensional, able to only focus on wanting sex, having sex or reacting to the consequences of wanting/having sex. The main feeling you have for them is that they all need serious therapy. This against a background that is awesome in its scope and vision, although the effect is diluted considerably since we are given no real explanation for what we are seeing, why it is happening or why it is important. The main effect is that the authors raided their idea files and threw everything into the pot. The characters travel across the universe, encounter cosmic engineering, alternate universes, the Tiplerian Omega Point and ultimately Heaven and God and the only thing they ever think about is who's sleeping with whom. The characters are too twisted to relate to and the background to confused to do more than frustrate me. I closed the book feeling disappointed and frustrated."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"As an avid Science Fiction reader I was surprised in the quality of White Light after some of the reviews I read. The characters were never developed. The story itself was extremely disjointed. It seemed that that the authors had creative ideas and tried to bring them together but cared nothing about the fact that it became absurd. One final observation was about the excessive sex involved. At first you could see the connection and it did help in understanding the characters. Later it became obviously overdone and borderline comical. I have never disliked a book more."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in a while. I kept reading, hoping it would redeem itself, but instead it only got worse. The misogynistic Wolf, the main character, never grows past his obsession with women's genitalia. The women have no depth and remain objectified. The plot, if one can call it that, becomes horribly improbable and stereotypical at the same time - star gates which magically transport, good aliens who can telepathically speak to us, bad aliens trying to wipe out humanity, etc. ..."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"It started out slow and a little interesting. Then, it moved into some real action with some believable SF.Then came the profanity and the sexual overtones. I could deal with that, but after about 100 pages it grew old. And to make matters worse, all of a sudden the book moves into totally unbelievable situations and events. I don't mean unbelievable like \\"Wow that's cool!\\" I mean it like \\"There's no way this could happen, that's stupid...\\"And to top it all off, there was still about 125 pages to go and the story was going downhill fast. It seemed like the writers recognized that the plot was fading and they hadn't developed an ending. So, they apparently decided to throw in a lot more sex scenes more often.The writers should have stuck to SF and not to their sexual fantasies.I finished it (against my better judgement...) Only because I am waiting on a book in a series that I am in the middle of. If I had it, this book would have gone by the wayside very quickly.Anyway, the first third of the book is \\"ok\\" to \\"almost good\\". After that, you can decide."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"This book was too grandiose for its own good. The characters were one-dimensional. The plot was unbelievable. The authors were not even careful to keep track of what happened and keep things consistent."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"I have read s-f for many years (since Heinlein's heyday in the 50's), and in general I am rather accepting of not-so-great novels. I have read and greatly enjoyed these authors' previous work (Alpha Centauri). White Light is the worst SF story I have read in a long time. The &quot;space exploration&quot; part is lame and seems quite unsophisticated or convincing, and the same goes for the &quot;cosmology&quot; part. As previous reviewers have noted, the characters were not likeable nor even very interesting. Regarding the sex, that was about the only part I sort of liked, but I wasn't looking for an erotic novel. If someone gives you this book and you have nothing else to do, maybe it is worth reading. Otherwise, forget it!"},{"Title":"White Light","review":"In my opinion this novel contained too much sex. I understand that this is part of the human nature, however, there should be a limit. I also didn't like the ending where everyone went off into their own utopia and as usual, everyone lives happily ever after... BORING!"},{"Title":"White Light","review":"Barton and Cappobianco have done it again. White Light has all the best of their previous collaborations and solo work, but none of the flaws. Yes, as many have said, it is hard to like their characters - that's because you aren't supposed to like them, you are supposed to find them human. They are well-thought out and complex (but not in the popular typology of popular authors where you can figure out a whole character from page one). Their ideas about the metaphysical AND physical are too much for most readers - that is, if you don't want to actually think while you read, perhaps you should try a different book. White Light is, as with their previous efforts, full of insightful references from the SF genre, designed to increase the depth of the work. If this book isn't nominated for the Nebula I may just have to believe Barton and Capobianco about what idiots the members of the human race have become. If you want to read the best SF novel of the year you will have to read this. It makes those of us who have been reading these two hunger for more; from both of them together and apart (that's a subtle message to Capobianco who needs to follow up his wonderful novel, Burster)."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"I reviewed the book before it was available for sale. I found it brought back memories of books I read that were published in the 50's and 60's. With a modern twist and a mood four foul language, much like some of Harlan Elison's books it makes you feel like a part of the story. The main characters were grouped with a tighter focus. In my opinion, the two mains were Wolf O'Malley and Cory Saurez. Maybe it's best to say they were my favorite. Wolf is reminiscent of a Chuck Norris and Captain Kirk/William Shatner character. He just can't get enough of his women. Cory is the pawn / or fall character. A helpless teenage girl who has mixed emotions of love and sex all rolled in to one. Not to mention a few characters flaws resulting from abandonmont and confusion. To put it short the Post Nuclear Earth is going to Hell. Money, Influence, Sex contributes to this crew of six meeting and going to a colony planet, only to be sent further out to look for more habitable planets. In the process they find the Pleons whom are fleeing from a godlike race trying to engulf the universe. In the process Wolf, Cory, Stu, Mark and Thalia find themselves on a search for their inner being and the God o f the Universe in birthing kind of experience. I highly recommend this book if you are bored of the current SF/Fantasy drivel that has been on the shelf for the last 15 to 20 years."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"Most of these reviews focus on the fact that the \\"book has too much sex\\". Well, that's kind of the point. The novel is heavily focused on the failures of its characters. Yes, given the backdrop of all this cosmic wonderment - alien species, the end of the universe, black holes - they are still **human** and still very much looking out for number one. This is the major character flaw of the human race, the inability to act selflessly to further the species, something the alien \\"conquerors\\" appear to have done rather well in their quest to \\"engulf\\" the universe. The ending of the book has some major religious implications, and will possibly confuse anyone not already familiar with Tipler's Omega Point theory. But the entire book can be summed up by this one line, spoken between two characters near the end - \\"Everything matters, Mr. Wolf. That's why excuses always fail\\". Yes, the book could have been better, but Barton and Capobianco have always been obsessed with the negative dynamic between any group of characters, the interplay between wants and needs. In reality each and every character in their books, ALL of their books, are looking for redemption and reconciliation. In this book, their characters finally find it."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"I remember reading this when I was younger, probably around 14. This was a book that started out normal, and then I don't know what happened to it.Initially I thought the book lacked many key elements, and quite frankly if you're going to look at it in a strictly science-fiction / fantasy spotlight, then you're going to miss some of the finer details. A book, is not written to coform to a category, but rather; a category is written to conform to the book.This book is chonicles and exemplifies all of mankind's fallacies. The belief in auto-supremacy, the belief that man is higher than all, etc. The objectifying of women is another one of mankind's shortcomings. Regardless of what anyone says, this book does indeed highlight many, many things that should be of concern for today's society.The people gathered together are truly representative of a microcosm of today's society. Greed, sex, money, drugs, and \\"nubile\\" flesh, dominate everything.What it all boils down to is it's all about the sex, but pay attention, you'll learn something about yourself if you think hard enough about it."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"This story is bascially the worst of every soap opera plot combined with 2001. The use of profainity is unnecessary. And the she slept with him/he slept with her subplots steal every potential storyline in the book, making a terrible novel. The only good thing about the book is the excellent cover. That is the only reason this got 2 stars instead of one. Read the Odyssey books by Arthur C. Clarke instead."},{"Title":"White Light","review":"This is the kind of book I rarely see these days. Immensely enjoyable, yet profoundly troubling. My only complaint was that it was over too fast."},{"Title":"My wife made me a polygamist","review":"Walter Trobisch was a missionary from Germany to Africa. When he arrived at one of his missions, he learned that the women often preferred polygamy because the work of women in the group was very hard, and with polygamy, there were more hands to do the work. They lived on a subsistence level. Also, because of frequent warfare between neighboring communities, there was often a shortage of men, and thus many women would never find a husband unless the men practiced polygamy. If a man divorced his wife, she would be destitute. Even though the Christian faith promotes monogamy, Trobisch preferred to encourage people not to divorce their younger wives because of the havoc it would create for everyone concerned. Instead, he encouraged people who married in the future to be monogamous. This book takes an example from the community, and lets him tell his story, by way of illustration of why Trobisch chose not to assert that polygamous men should divorce their \\"extra\\" wives in the name of Christianity. It is a very readable and enjoyable book, and gives tremendous insight into the fact that we must not run roughshod over local cultures in the process of spreading the Gospel. This is just one of many delightful books which Trobisch has written. It is too bad these are out of print, because they are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Flightdeck Performance: The Human Factor","review":"This book analyses accidents from an aviation psychology standpoint.

Jonathan Hayes, Viscount Whitley is going home to his country estate, Esdale. He is going home to see Constance Manning again. Jonathan Hayes has been in love with Constance since they were children. Constance Manning is in love with Jonathan's younger brother, Sidney. Sounds like a winner? Nope, only a page turner, there just wasn't enough sparkle to get past the rating of 8.Charlotte Louise Dolan: \\"Summer Escapade.\\" -- Rating: C-Oh, oh, SUMMER ESCAPADE is troublesome. Terrence Kinderley was a young bachelor, living the good life, until he \`inherited' his niece, Marigold. Kinderley so wanted to be the perfect guardian that he drew a bubble around his young ward. He forbid Marigold to experience life. He feared something dreadful would happen to her. His love and concern were literally suffocating her. Today such behavior would be child abuse. Good heavens, but the author created a monster in her hero. Therefore, this reader could not accept the idea that this man spontaneously fell in love and everything turned perfect in the Kinderley world! Not fun.Sandra Heath: \\"Brighton Betrothals.\\" -- Rating: CSandra Heath may have a smooth pen, but BRIGHTON BETROTHALS is lacking spice. Her aunt has summoned Patricia Fairbourne to Brighton. Why the summons? Her aunt wants to get Patricia out of the country, away from her books, and into THE social mix. After all, the girl must get married. Lord Robert Haldane has a reputation and though her aunt has advised Patricia to avoid his company, she finds herself very attracted to this cordial and courteous gentleman. Sandra Heath can write, but here her story lacked fire.Melinda McRae: \\"A Country Wedding.\\" -- Rating: CMelinda McRae has penned a rather pleasant story. When she was twelve, Cecily Montford declared her undying love for Ainsley Powell. As a twenty-two-year-old, man about town, the declaration appalled him. Cruelly, he lashed out. The rejection crushed and mortified the sensitive twelve-year-old. Ten years later, they meet again at a family wedding. Who should offer the first apology? A COUNTRY WEDDING is pleasant but colorless.Sheila Walsh: \\"Midsummer Masquerade.\\" -- Rating: CGideon, the Marquess of Grenville has brought his sister, Lucy, to London for her Presentation. He could do without the help of the meddlesome Caroline Maitland. Caroline Maitland, the troublesome woman he finds fascinating. MIDSUMMER MASQUERADE is a pleasant read, but it is also a slow go.Mary Balogh writes the best of the lot. Would I recommend this anthology? No! There are too many good books out there in romance land -- so why bother with mediocre?Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"A Regency Summer (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"To say that this book was disappointing would be an understatement. The only story that was the slightest bit interesting was 'The Treasure Hunt' by Mary Balogh. It is about a young woman, Lady Constance Manning, who realizes too late that she has engaged herself to the younger brother when she is actually in love with the older one. Even that story was somewhat unsatisfying as, in the end, we are left wondering if the younger brother sacrifices his own love so that Connie may be happy or if he is also happy to break the engagement. However, the story itself is very sensitive and touching in the usual Balogh style. I hope she writes a sequel for the younger brother, Sidney. But the other stories are so boring that it is a chore to turn the pages. My recommendation: wait until all short stories by Mary Balogh get published in one volume."},{"Title":"Muhammad at Mecca","review":"W. Montgomery Watt wrote Muhammad at Mecca in response to his perceived need for a new look at the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) set in a fuller historical context. He states that part of this need arose from the broader desire of twentieth century historians to see historical events in relation to the economic, social, and political background prevalent at that particular time. The author asserts that the special feature of this biography of Muhammad is thus not that it combs available sources more minutely than others have done previously, but that it pays fuller attention to these material factors, and attempts to answer many questions that have hardly been raised in the past. When this work is juxtaposed with Watt's other work Muhammad at Medina, the two together constitute a comprehensive history of the life of Muhammad and the origins of the Islamic community. The author declares in the introduction of this work that it is first and foremost written for the historian. He warns though that there is inherently the human inclination of 'tendential shaping' by early historians to make allowances for distortions or even to make it more acceptable within the shadow of other religions such as Christianity or Judaism. Though many bibliographic sources used for this work are based on earlier primary sources, one must remember that there are no known written sources other than the Qur'an about the life of the Prophet written prior to about 150 years after his death."},{"Title":"Muhammad at Mecca","review":"Muhammed at Mecca is a remarkable volume that covers the first part of the prophet of Islam and the early days of his young nation prior to 622 CE, the year of Hijra when Muhammed left Mecca to Medina which also marks the first year of the Muslim calander. With much skill and ability to retrodict events and put them in their historical context, Watt offers this book as one of the most authentic works on the subject.The volume is an academic work and might not appeal to all kinds of readers save for academics and those who are very interested in the subject. Watt employs the modern methodology in classifying, crediting and discrediting almost all of the primary sources of the time. Watt then objectively treats these sources and draws conclusions that a reader can rarely find in other places.His gifted style helped a great deal in making a lengthy volume full of details entertaining for the reader and rather catchy. Those who are interested in reading about the whole story of Muhammed and his mission should also buy Watt's second volume, Mohammed at Medina, which covers his post Hijra years until his death in 632.Too bad the book is out-of-print. Publishers should consider marketing a second edition since it would certainly deserve the attention and interest of many scholars and readers today."},{"Title":"States and Sovereignty in the Global Economy","review":"This is a useful collection of fourteen essays; the contributors are mostly from the USA, but with two each from Canada and Britain. It covers the historical development of the state in the global economy since the 18th century, the relationships of states, sovereignty and capital accumulation, regional issues of globalisation, and the recent changes in global information technology and financial practices. It also presents case studies of the European Union, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico, Southeast Asia, China and Africa.While written from a perspective critical of neoliberalism, as are most studies with any claim to scholarship, it merely describes the realities it deplores, without exploring the possibilities of change. Probably the best book in this field is Globalisation and progressive economic policy, edited by Dean Baker, Gerald Epstein and Robert Pollin, published by the Cambridge University Press in 1998.Vivien A. Schmidt, in a fascinating chapter on France, Great Britain, and Germany between globalization and Europeanization, scotches the myth that the EU has anything to do with workers' rights or democracy. She concludes, \\"The European Union in particular has afforded European business unprecedented supranational policy-making access and influence at the same time that it has reduced national government policy-making autonomy.\\"Eric Helleiner shows that those who gain from financial globalisation frequently overstate its effect on macroeconomic policy autonomy. He shows that the notorious Mitterand U-turn towards capital liberalisation was not forced by capital flight, but by the European Monetary System, which kept the franc in tight limits. By contrast, Sweden and Norway, which were not in the EMS, kept their currencies floating, allowing them sustained growth throughout the 1970s and 1980s.The authors show that globalisation is not some automatic, irresistible process. It is a bogy, to frighten us into believing that capital is all-powerful. Capitalist states, primarily the USA and Britain, created the global financial institutions, the World, the IMF and the World Trade Organization, to strengthen the employers against workers, their trade unions, their industries and services. But when workers decide, we can control capital to reinvest it in our workplaces, industries and countries."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver\\", a book review by Johannes and Vitali, two German pupils in the 10th gradeAfter we read the book in the English class at our school we'd like to give you a book review with our opinion about this book and we hope that this might help you.Jonas lives in a community where you are always observed and where you have to do everything you are told. At first he is happy in his community. He has friends and has a usual life as a citizen in his family unit. He lives together with his sister lily his father and his mother. In the community there are different ceremonies for every age.After the Ceremony of twelve Jonas is declared to be the new Receiver of Memory and starts his training with getting memories of many eras before he lived. He gets memories of war, elephant hunts, snow and riding a sled, sunshine and such things. But very important is that he learns to see colours. That's important because no one of the citizens can see colours. In this world they achieved \\"sameness\\". They got neither weather nor any differences between them. When Jonas begins to discover the dark side of the community he is in fear of it. He begins to see, that nothing is as perfect as it seems.He discovers that in this community many people are murdered every day when they break a rule or when they got to old. When the foster child Gabriel of his family unit shall be killed he decides to escape with him to \\"Elsewhere\\", a different and better world.The opinion of Johannes:At first I found this book boring but when we read further parts of the book it got more and more interesting then I began to read this book with more interest and I began to read it very fast. In the end I found that book interesting and informative but I think that it is not really good written.The opinion of Vitali:I found it interesting to read about a book which deals with a different community and with other rules then we have. But I can't imagine that no one apart from the Receiver can see colours or hear music. First I found the book a little bit confusing, but then it was clearer. The book is well written but for a German pupil it is a little bit difficult to understand all the vocabulary. Also I think that the ending is felicitous, because it makes you think further, what could happen."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had high hopes for this book, because I love Lois Lowry's Anastasia Krupnik series. Unfortunately, what started out a promising, fascinating read really fizzled at the end. The author did a great job creating a Utopian world that isn't all it seems to be, but I think she copped out towards the end. The resolution of the story is too ambigious for my liking. When I invest the time and effort into reading a challenging story like this one, I expect a payoff at the end, and this book disappointed me. It's one of those \\"Well, the ending is whatever you want it to be.\\" If you don't mind that kind of story, then go ahead and read it. If you prefer your stories more neatly packaged and fleshed-out, skip it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would like to start off by saying that I've never in my life read a book quite like this. I've read many kinds of books and this book is very unique.This story's main character is a boy names Jonas. Jonas is a smart boy and I liked his personality. Jonas lives in a community that is unlike any other; his community is under what they call Sameness. No color, no differences, no snow, etc. Such things would make it boring to live their. But, of course, no one knows of those things, so they're perfectly happy.There is one person though that knows about all the joyful and painful things of the normal world, the world they call Elsewhere. He is called The Giver and was chosen to hold all of the memories of the past that no longer exist in their community.Now, Jonas has been selected to become the next Giver, and he must face the difficulty and pain of receiving memories.The reason I only gave this book four stars instead of five was because of a weird and creepy ritual. You'll figure out what it is.If you're getting bored of normal fiction books, I would suggest to read The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book I am reviewing is The Giver by Lois Lowry. This book is about a boy named Jonus who lives in a community. I don't know where Jonus's community is because there is little description in the book. It could be anywhere. Jonus is a boy who is like an ordinary boy until he meets the Giver. But Jonus's community is very strange. They can't see color and at a certain age you get released. Some people in the community think releasing is a good thing. Also each family is only allowed to have a boy child and a girl child. Jonus can't understand things about his community but there's one who can. The Giver. The Giver is a wise old man who can see memories that others can't. But not all memories are good such as sunburn and breaking your leg. Jonus learns lots from the Giver and even receives some memories. Jonus becomes a whole new person because of the Giver. For example'Jonus gets tougher and wiser than he was earlier in the book. In this book I don't think there is a time period. It could be in the future or the past. If you're looking for an adventure book and a thrilling book, pick The Giver. I like the whole book except the ending because I did not think the book should end that way. I learned that our world is a lot better than Jonus's community. Lois Lowry has also written Gathering Blue, and lots of other great stories. I think Lois Lowry likes writing adventure books and science fiction ones."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, as it brought me happiness as well as grief within its visually colorful scriptures. Jonas, a boy of only twelve, discovers that he is destined to do more than what meets the naked eye, no pun intended. His community, known for its equality, or rather today this can be labeled as communism, assigns Jonas to work as the keeper of memories, where he is to deal with the pain and strife that the rest of the population does not deal with. This is supposedly done to ensure the happiness of his clan. Ever so slowly Jonas realizes that his life had been shielded from reality. Jonas had been lied to about what life was supposed to be like, and in this trap of bland grays, Jonas decided that he had to escape.I felt that Louis Lowery almost perfectly described this utopia in which Jonas resided. Everything was explained in utmost detail to give everyone the distinct view of life through Jonas's eyes. Lowery's use of allusion to the topic of Communism was also a powerful topic that I felt was delicately embedded within the text. Very craftily it was used to depict a community where everything was \`provided and cared-for equally,' but not necessarily \`perfect.' I would recommend this book to any age group. It is simple to read for any age, but what you get out of the book lies in how deeply you understand its levels. ..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is great literature.

Super thought provoking, great for stimulating discussions on the importance and challenges of freedom."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was given (pun unintended) this book as a gift shortly after its publication, but never took the time to read it. Well, I finally did, so here's an adult approach to the novel. First off, I have to say that the first 150 pages of this novel are stunning. The writing is brilliant and the ideas, though simplistic (but then, this is expected for a children's novel), are provocative. I'd say the best description of this would be that this book is the one Philip K. Dick would have written, had he written a children's novel. Unfortunately, the depth of the writing collapses in the end. I guess Lowry suddenly realized she wanted to keep the book under 200 pages in length, and just quickly wrote an ending that lacks almost all of the intelligence of the earlier work. Issues simply are'nt resolved that easily. Well, all in all this is a great book, more mature than I expected (dealing with the issues of puberty and abortion certainly don't usually fall in the children's novel category), but with an ending that could have used quite a bit more polish.

It makes you ponder and appreciate all the things we have in life and how important the simple things are.

I cannot wait to read the second book.Some parts I thought were very tragic, but that makes you care for the characters more. This is now one of my favorite books. Hooray for Lois Lowry, a writing genius!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you're an adult, don't be put off by the classification of this book as a teen novel.Jonas lives in a controlled drab community without realizing it. Much of that which makes us human - choice, wonder, beauty, the appreciation of nature, community, family, pain, love, conflict, memory - has been stripped by choice from the members of the community to ensure peace, comfort, and sameness.At twelve, Jonas is chosen to receive the community's memory, and with it he experiences pain, pleasure, and love. His eyes are opened to the wonder of creation and life, which of course are denied the others. He gains wisdom, including horror at the dehumanized state of the community.The conclusion of the book is sometimes said to be ambiguous. For the unreflective or ununderstanding, their reactions to the conclusion probably will reflect their own lack of vision. For those who, like Jonas, have eyes to see (or \\"see beyond\\"), the conclusion fits perfectly.I'm told by an ex-teacher that The Giver is taught in the eighth grade. The edition I read (Dell Laurel-Leaf, 1992) includes a discussion guide. Some of the questions would help understanding, but they won't take the reader to the deepest level."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine you live in a bubble. Things can't get in, like pain, loneliness and misery. But neither can pride, love and joy. Lois Lowry has created a world where this is everyone's lifestyle. In The Giver, people don't choose to live this way, they just do. A boy called Jonas peacefully lives like this until he meets the Giver, who makes little holes in his bubble letting in the once forbidden emotions and feelings.Jonas is pretty content with his life. He lives with his mother, father and sister Lily. He's got two good friends Asher and Fiona. Even his father got permission to have a baby called Gabe live with them until he must live with different parents. Sure, he has to follow strict rules, must take pills to get rid of \\"stirrings\\" can't lie, must have the \\"right\\" life a child should have, and can't ask questions regarding any differences between two people (it would be rude, after all). But to him, people have been following these strict rules forever.But time is suddenly spiraling very close to the Ceremony of Twelve where his lifelong job will be assigned to him. For everyone else it seems so obvious what they'll be. But for Jonas? Nothing's really fitting for him. When the time finally arrives, Jonas is assigned, or more, selected to be the new Receiver of Memory, a job he didn't even know existed. His responsibility as the new receiver is to take memories of living, really living from the old Receiver, who will pass that name to Jonas and become the Giver.Jonas is suddenly revealed to a whole new world. Snow, sleds, sunsets, tranquility, sunshine, flowers, colors, families and most importantly, love. But the Giver must now show him why all that was left behind and a concept that they have lived with so long called Sameness replaced it. He must show Jonas the fear, the loneliness, the pain. But even with a terrifying memory of war, Jonas is not defeated, or even down. He now knows what he must do, especially after a horrible realization and truth about a childhood question. He knows he must free these memories, giving everyone the chance to live a real life, destroy Sameness and save an innocent baby's life.When we first step into Jonas's life, nothing really makes sense. You're always asking yourself, \\"what did they mean by that?\\" It has sort of a strange feel. For example, the word animal is no longer a noun, they were taken away. It's an adjective only. This is a little passage of the book where Jonas is talking to Lily. \`\\"They acted like....\\" \\"Animals?\\" suggested Jonas. Neither child knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit in.'A proverb that comes to mind with this is \\"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.\\" Because in the book it shows those of us that wish for a perfect life should see what that could do to us. Lois Lowry gives you the power to believe what happens next. In an intentional clever way, the book is a bit vague at points, letting you ask yourself what should be there and what it means. For example, throughout the book, there is a mysterious concept of \\"release\\" a great punishment for some, and a huge reward for others. But for awhile it's just a gray area that you can use a dark pencil to put in what you want there.Nearing the end, the rapidness slows down a little, but only enough to really understand what's going on fully, unlike the other parts where its always 2 feet ahead of you. The very end gets a little blurry, but so does Jonas's mind which makes us feel like we've been brought alone with him. And the conclusion is up to you on how things should end.The Giver can be sci-fi or fantasy, depending on how you read it. It's for a person who likes thoughtful books that make you think and don't end when you've read the last word of the last chapter and continues in your head for days. But it's also for people where that's the last kind of book they want, and what they do want is an exciting, want-to-jump-into-the-text feeling while reading the book. And people in between? Of course! This book is ideal for any 12 and up. Looking at you perspective on life a little differently can never be outgrown, so this is a fascinating book for adults as well as kids."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A review by KayteeThe Giver is a novel set in black and white talking about the color of emotions. This book is focused on telling the world how there should be no hate, no crime, no hurt or pain. It also describes everyone being happy and living a cheerful life, as we all know, that's not how it is in this world unfortunately. A young man given the name Jonas was given the chance to become the quote on quote \\"Receiver of memories.\\" As he turns 12 years old he's known as The Giver. He sees everything in a good way but realizes how much of a difference there is in the world.I didn't enjoy reading \\"The Giver\\" at all. The beginning of this book was so boring, and didn't catch my attention one bit. But as a read on and on I would get more into it. But soon enough it would lose my attention again. The beginning was a little bit strange at some parts. Towards the middle I enjoyed a lot! I think it is because that's where all the action is, and the ending, well, let's just say the author really lost me there! I think this book deserves two starts because it's that kind of book that can catch your attention at some points but others you just feel as if you don't want to read it anymore. Hopefully next time we choose a book to read I'll know its one I actually have an interest in.I strongly do not recommend this book to a young adult. I think this book should before mature audiences because he talks about injections as well as his love for a lady. I don't think that should be allowed for a 9 or 10 year old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in 7th grade, and I am so glad it was assigned! Out of all the books I've ever had to read, this takes the cake! The plot of the story is extremely unique, as are the characters and events.Jonas lives in a controlled world where the people are virtually the same. These people know nothing of uniqueness and individuality. When Jonas turns 12, he is given the job of &quot;Receiver of Memory&quot; and must take on the memories of a man called The Giver. From then on, the pain and confusion Jonas must handle affect him and he has to make a decision. Argh, you really can't understand how wonderful the plot is until you read the book yourself. I promise, once you start reading, you will NOT be able to put this down until you know what is going on. Not only is the storyline itself genius, but the details are extremely interesting and will keep you turning those pages.The Giver carries several themes and messages that you'll be able to apply to your life right away. I won't reveal them now, but the book also has great symbolism which you may or may not pick up on depending on certain aspects. In any case, do not pass up this fascinating read.Even my 45-year-old mother thought it was incredible :-)Definitely worth your time and money!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is incredible! I enjoyed every minute reading it. Some people say that the ending is unclear, but I loved the ending. It lets people make up their own ending. For example: some people think Jonas dies in the end, while others think he really finds Elsewhere and continues his live there. I think people could start reading the book in 6th grade, so that there are a lot of different analysis and not just those of older people who maybe think a bit more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've read my share of books day in and day out of my life but few stay with me like Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver.&quot; I first picked it up in fifth grade and never understood it leading me to buy a copy and re-reading it to see what I missed. Little did I know it turned out more haunting the more times I read it.The title character Jonas goes through a rollarcoaster ride in this novel that even adults should read as well. Imagine living in a &quot;negative society&quot; like that of 1984, this book does just that again but everything is more controlled. Imagine having no pain, no true feelings, no love, and this books strips you clean and makes you proud of the world you live in today.The ending is left unexplained like my weekly &quot;X-Files&quot; and left for the reader to decide what really happens.The books is sad, I've read it at least 8 times now, and I'm 17 years old. This is how much this book has molded me into a greater person.No doubt if you pick up this book it *will* change your life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very exciting and interesting book. It is abouta boy named Jonas who is selected to be the Receiver of Memories. TheGiver has a very important role in Jonas' life because he is the one who gives Jonas all of the memories he has and ever will have. The jobs makes jonas and the Giver the only people who have memories in their community. They are the only people in their community with memories because the memories were giving citizens of the community pain and grief. When that happened, the community made it so only one selected person would have the memories, the pain, and the pleasure. This job is very painstaking, but it pays off. it pays off because Jonas can see in color, and nobody else in the community can. At first, Jonas' community seems like a utopia because there are no accidents, pain, grief, or hunger; but Jonas wants love and feelings to be a part of his everyday life. they aren't part of his everyday life because feelings were taken away with memories. Jonas decides to run off to another community, so he can change his community and give people memories of love, feelings, and choices, so they could lead nomal and happy lives. You see, if the Receiver of Memories leaves the community all of the memories he or she had to go back to the people in the town. I feel this book is very interesting and suspenseful. it is nice and juicy with descriptions, too. I think this story definitly was told from Jonas' point of view. If I were Jonas, I just would have run away as soon as I found out that there were no feelings or choices. The message this book gives me is that we already live in a utopia. This could be true because with every advantage there comes a disadvantage. This way we are living in the Utopia, or it doesn't exsist."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a absolutly fasinating great wonderful spectacular and intelligent book (isn't it unbelievable Sally? ;).That book should be read and loved by everyone. I read quite a few of the reviews, and was appaled! To think that someone could say that one should save their money and read a classic is HORRIFIC(how silly are they? ;). This book by some is considered a classic. This book leaves a lasting and godly impression. This book was an insight to another culture, real or not, and that is very very very very valuable. I am in 10th grade and just read &quot;The Giver&quot; for the second time. I could probaly read this book fifty times and still discover new things(which makes it if possible--even better ;), as I probably will.PS: Cu in class Mr.Wunsch"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book about a year ago and it made me react. I felt so sorry for the people who lived there. Then again, I felt sorry for Jonas because of everything that he had to go through. This book has an amazing plot but the ending is pretty hard to understand. It would be nice to know what happened to Jonas and Gabe after leaving."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is not for everyone as there are some dark and scary parts. The idea's are original, Jonas is a good main character and the ending is ambiguous which makes the reader think. A very interesting book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This books allows students to imagine a world completely different from theirs without them being bogged down with lots of lingo that sometimes goes along science fiction. The characters realness is captivating, and the reader finds himself/herself turning the page with anticipation. While Jonah, the main character, and his friends live in a society very different from any students have encountered, the personalities of the characters are so appealing and believable that they will have no trouble relating to them. This book is excellent for middle grade students as an outside reading assignment or a classroom novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion, the Giver, by Lois Lowry, can be compared to such great works of literature as 1984, or Fahreinhheit 451. I feel that it is a classic of the genre, or someday will be. It is a remarkable book, and it deserves much praise."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a very Grand Book. One of the best Books I have ever read. There are a few books that I have ever read that are better. Its about a boy who grows up in a perfet world, or a not so perfect world.

Thats another reason for you to read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was way to slow. But otherwise in some parts intresting and exciting, but in other parts very confusing. I recommend this book to people who have alot of time, and that like boring books. Thisp book also just left you hanging at the end, but in the middle of the book it was kind of exciting and adventurues. However you have to piece this book together very well if you want to truly understand it. But I just reccomend this book to adults, its not bad or anything, its just not something a kid would want to read. My likes of this book was there were some intressting parts in the middle of the book only. My dislikes were the boring part that weren't exciting at all like at the begening and the ending."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect world&quot;.

Unfortuately, their society is also arranged so that people live without choices. There is very little emotion. Respect for life means something completely different in their community.

When the children are twelve, they are assigned their occupations, which will not change for the rest of their lives. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of memories. He begins a journey, from which he will never recover. This is a very intersting and thought provoking book. There are some very disturbing ideas addressed in this book.

For example: 1.You may not chose your own mate.Why?Because of gender issues.No boy+boy or girl+girl relationships. 2.Only BirthMothers can bear children.Why?So mothers won't have to feel the loss of children. 3.No color.Why?The only solution to racism.

(I'm foreign exchange from America, I'm not British) everyone was puzzled at the end. i knew about it from reading it in fourth grade, and i'm in seventh, and it still carries me from day to day. this is the kind of book that needs to be made into a movie, but that might destroy it. the key idea would be for Lois to come on set, design the ideas, the buildings, everything, so nothing is wrecked. but that it isfar to hard sometimes, i know. i can't even capatialize, i loved this book so much! this book is the kind that leaves you dreaming of the possibilities, and a sequel might ruin it's glory as a creative tool in Lang. this is a good recomendation for teachers who want to reach people my age, because it traps you inside. some of the girl at my US school never read, besides zines, and they loved the book so much, they even borrowed a copy over night to get far into the book for the next day! check this book out, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A perfect world, wow! My book is called the Giver it is by Louis Loury. The Publisher is Bantam DoubleDay Dell Publishing Group Inc. It was published in 1994. It is a must read! Jonas lives in a perfect world. He is 12 and an easy going person. In this world there is no color no joy and most of all no love. He has to bring these things upon them so he leaves the community. If you like fantasy, I am sure you will like The Giver. In the end he leaves for elsewhere. 10 to Adult would enjoy this book. Mostly a boy but it varies."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a well-written and well-composed book. Lois Lowry, the author, deserves an award on the amazing job she did portraying the utopian ideals. This book is truly one of the best I have ever read. Jonas, the main character, is a smart and deep character. I could not put the book down. At first you truly believe that the society they live in is for the best. As you read on you learn more about the community and the way it works. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I got this book because it was recomended that I buy it. I wasn't sure if I wanted to, so I asked my friends. They said it was a great book. So I decided to get it. I was so happy that I got it. I have read some reviews saying it had some bad material. I guess if you are under 10 I could agree with this, but for everyone else this is a must read. I didn't even particularly like sci-fi books untill I read this. For some other great sci-fi books read The City of Ember and The people of Sparks (which is a sequal to The City of Ember.) If you play neopets my screen name is Alex22591alex Thank-you for taking the time to read my review. If you wish you can read some of my other reviews."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry does a good job of writing a fast-paced dystopia novel where society, making a sort of deal with the devil, trades in their humanity--their choices, their capacity to error, their inclination for diversity and adventure--for a safe cozy womb-like existence where a false perfection kills the human spirit. Jonas, the main character, is a twelve-year-old boy who, like Jim Carey in the Truman Show, must re-evaluate what freedom is and act on his courage to change his destiny. A society that seeks to remain ignorant in the name of a utopia is a great theme that is explored effectively in this novel. For some companion pieces, I recommend H.G. Wells' short story In the Country of the Blind and two films: the aforementioned Truman Show and Pleasantville."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The fact that I had to read it for class did not help me appreciate this book. I did not like the main character, Jonas, or any of the other characters. I was utterly bored, even with the few interesting pages this book provided. I did appreciate the messages that (my class and) I got out of this book (such as how differences are important). The ending, though some may enjoy being able to make up their own, annoyed me. I had many unanswered questions by the end of the book. It bothered me that Jonas, knowing the cruelty of his lifestyle and that there was a better place, would leave his impressionable sister there. Jonas is willing to save the baby, but not his own sister? Having read The Outsiders the year before (which I had enjoyed immensely) I had high hopes for this book. Reading this book made me return to my previous opinion that the teachers who choose which books the class is to read enjoy torturing their students."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"4.5 of 5 stars - Highly RecommendedOver the past two days, I finished reading The Giver. (There are no spoilers here.) This was a great book. Today, many assume that higher degrees of efficiency of a society and its members are intrinsic goods for the advancement of the human specie. Brave New World is one book that takes that assumption to an extreme, and notes the perversity and inhumanness that result from such an extremely efficient society. The Giver is another such book, one that is less dark and less explicitly bitter than BNW. The settings and plots of these hyper-efficient societies are different enough that make both books interesting and poignant reads. However, as BNW is definitely suited exclusively for an adult audience, The Giver is enriching to both adolescent and adult. And whereas BNW is science fiction mixed with biting satire, The Giver is more of a lighthearted science fiction with a hint of fantasy -- the way in which the Receiver receives his experiential knowledge.The protagonist of this story is an early adolescent, as the author's hope seems to be for young readers to try to relate to Jonas. This book is a good teaching tool that one can use in trying to teach younger (maybe even older) ones to think more critically about life, to break out of the sphere of popular culture in which so many young ones are comfortable, yet suffocating in ignorance. The author's writing style is crisp and lucid, the way that I prefer my authors to be. I give this book 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up. My only complaint is that I disliked how open-ended the ending is. I appreciate the author's desire to be artistic and ambiguous, but I felt that for this type of young adult's book, she should've made a stronger sense of closure. Aside from that minor complaint, I enjoyed reading this book, and the author kept me engaged from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finnished reading the book The Giver in my 8th grade Languge Arts class. I really wasn't a big fan of the book. In the beginning it didn't really grab my attention it was really boring.It took to long for something to start building up. If I did not have to read the book with my class I would have stopped reading the book. I felt that the author made things really hard to understand and had a few things that did not even make sense. I felt that the ending was done well, but it just left to many things unanswered. Things that I was anxious to find out. I know that it lets the reader use their imagination, but still you can't end a book with that many unclear and unanswered things. I feel that if the ending were done different then maybe it would give people better closure about the uncertainty. One thing though that I did like though was how the author introduces and reveals kind of twists and turns and shocks in this book. So in conclusion if you are going to read this book expect frustration coming your way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book when I was in fourth grade and I thought it was really great. I read it over and over- about 5 times in all -and every time I found something I hadn't paid close attention to before. Later, my mom read the book to see why I liked it so much and she read it twice! It's a great book for any age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished Lois Lowry's book The Giver and it was all right. There was no action in it. He lives in a society unlike ours. There is no color, pain, fear or war. At 12 you get your life's occupation. Although I wouldn't want to live in a world with pain, fear or war, I would like to make decisions, like my job, spouse and have my own children. If you want to read a book about a different society The Giver is your book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I gave this star four stars, the book was good but it had something that I didn't like. Author tells us in the book that the life were living in right now is really great. At least we dont have lots of rules to listen too. This book has lots of surprising parts. The bad part in the book is that at first you wont kinda understand, but thats me. Jonas is a great charceter he play a good part in this story. In the beginnig for everyone, they cant see no colors,they cant use the word love, and they cant even pick their own jobs for crying out shake. This book is awesome, I'm really glad that we dont have that community in this world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry's book is fascinating to say the least. She leaves you to make many conclusions on your own about what is happening. The ability to read into the story your own world view is almost frightneing when you consider that this is a childs book. However at the same time from a sociological and political stand point it raises some very serious questions for the adult reader to struggle through. The theme is one of what would life be like in a &quot;perfect&quot; society where everyone was safe and content but never made decsions for themselves, if the government (elders) were trusted to make the right decision for everyone. It touches on such tough issues as euthanasia, society role or class, and socialism. As you can imagine these are some very deep subjects for a children's book. I would reccomend that any parent read this book before or at least with their child so that they can dicuss these important topics with them. Let us pray that our society never becomes this &quot;safe.&quot; Overall a very quick read and worth a couple hours of your time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"AT first I thought the book would be very boring, like most you have to read in school, but as I got father in the story I started to become interested in it.....it is so confuzing, but so powerful, I like the symblolism Like the main character being Johnas and how the old story of Johnas being trappend in the whale.....and Gabrial the baby and Gaberial the angel.....I would recommend this to anybody"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book &quot;The Giver&quot; tells us about a world, which seems to be the perfect one, because there are no negative emotions, there is no pain, no war...but soon it comes to your mind that it is surely not the perfect world. There is no love, no joy, there are no colours, no music... . When you read the book, you first think that the people in that community live in a perfect world, then you think that they should miss something (joy, love, ect.), but then you realize that they are not able to miss things like that, because they have never known these things. The storyline is very vivid and makes you think about our world today and how it would be, if we had to live in a community like it is shown in the book. You also get frightened, because the book takes place in the future, so you ask yourself, if our world will change one day and will be like it is described in the book. It is better to read the book one more time after the first, because the plot is such complicated and with the knowledge from reading the first time you are able to understand the book much better and not only step by step. We think, you should read this book, because it opens your mind to think about the definition of &quot;perfect&quot;, the meaning of feelings and about the future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My class had to read this book. I am in the 7th grade, and this book is great. I couldn't put it down! I thought it was interesting learning about how different Jonas' community was from our world.

I recommend it for middle schoolers or anyone who likes a good book that will keep you turning pages!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a wonderful book. I read it because it was on the reading list for the classes I am to teach. I feel this is a great book to use to teach children how unique we are as individuals and how wonderful it is to be this way. I also like how Ms. Lowry left the ending open ended. You don't know, really, what happened to the children. You can imagine it in a couple of ways. The only thing that was attractive in the community to me was that careers were chosen for the best reasons. I wish we were able to evalute or own strengths and weakness better in this area as people. I think some children may have a problem with the concept of &quot;release&quot;.

There was too much discription, so I couldn't get beyond the first couple of pages. I put it back on the bookshelf for a couple of months. Later after I read through it, I found that it was one of the best books that I ever read. In the Giver, Lowry did an excellent job of giving his readers a peek at a different culture where a council makes all of the big decisions of a persons life like who work what job (the job is the Assignment), when a he\\\\she gets a spouse, and when the couple can start a family unit. Jonas (main character) has lived in &quot;the community&quot; since he was born. In this community there is no color, no mountains or hills, and no great or evil events. Because of this, everything is neutral. Each year the children are given special privilages to represent thier age. At eight years old, they are given new bikes and are allowed to start community service. They work a certain number of hours in order to get their Assignment. At twelve years old, they are allowed to receive their Assingment that the Chief Elders chose for them as long as they completed thier community service hours. As an Eleven, Jonas was ready for the Ceremony of Twelve. Twelve isthe last age that is celebrated in that culture. Aperson who is twelve years old is then an adult. At twelve, the rest of the adult privilages are given to that person. At the Ceremony, Jonas was picked for the Receiver of Memories, which is the most important Assingment in &quot;the community&quot;. This person holds all of the memories of the world before &quot;the community&quot; existed, when there was color, mountains, and great of evil events. These memories are too painful for the citizensof the community and noneof them are allowed to know the memories. Now his whole life is going to change since he can't communicate what he knows to anybody. I like how Mr. Lowry showed the difference between &quot;our world&quot; and &quot;the community&quot; in more than just one way. People who like fiction and different cultures should read the giver by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"if someone asked me what book desereved to win book award in my sleep i would say the giver and thn role over. this book is the ideal book to read for someone who is starting o read more mature books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, a 12 year old boy, knows nothing about the horrors of the past.

Nobody knew that Jonas's job would have such a big affect on his life. It opened his eyes to the truth about his community.

But as he recieves memories he sees a new society, of how things used to be. A place where color, music, pain, and war exists. He also notices the flaws ot the society that he lives in today. WHat will he do about it?I found this book to be both moving and inspiring. Like other books I have read it forces you to think of what the future could be like.

It is well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is interesting, but I do not recommend it to anyone who is squeamish. This book talks about some very hard concepts that become frighteningly real. This master piece brings to life the horrifying concept of not being able to chose or to be an individual. I love this book but it is sad and inappropriate for a young reader."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this for the first time when I was 11 or 12 and I absolutely loved it. We had quiet reading time in my English class the year I read it and I recommended it to other kids I knew. I remember distinctly looking across the room one day to see one of my classmates reading it staring at me with an \\"Oh My GOD\\" expression on his face. Ha ha.I have gone back to this book and read it as an adult and it holds up. It's just a really solidly written, interesting book and GREAT absolutely great for young people who are just starting to get into that mode of curiosity and rebellion. :D"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was substitute teaching an 8th grade class, they were reading this book as an assignment, so I picked it up and started reading.

As a caveat to my review, it is important to mention that she is 3 yrs behind grade level and relatively immature for her age. It took reading half way through to get the \\"utopian\\" idea. Prior to that language could be tough to follow without knowing the theme. I would have enjoyed more time with the giver and the development of that relationship along with a more purposeful recognition of Jonas' realization of his community and parents. I realize this was written from Jonas' perspective, but she made me care about how the \\"community\\" would manage the memories and I felt I was left wondering. I did enjoy the story but felt there was more to say. I am not sure what she will make of the story as a whole. There are certain topics within the story that she will understand, with guidance, but I don't know how well she will grasp his \\"mental leaps\\" ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A nice quick read about making choices regarding the quality of life lived verses living a life of promised security."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have always loved this book. It was my favorite book when as 10 and was so glad to find it on here! Definitely a different kind of book, no matter what age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is written by Lois Lowery. This is a story about a boy that finds out that there is more to the world than he thinks.The Giver is about a boy named Jonas and The Giver. They are both interesting because they are the only two people that can go beyond the rules. I like how The Giver thinks, he is always unpredictable. But Jonas always thinks before saying a single word.A lot of different things happen in the book such as Jonas finding out lots of other things that he didn't know&#61472;how to see colours and how it feels to have pain. I learnt that a perfect world is not good. These themes are important because they set out the main story without them there would be no story.The main relations between the characters are Jonas and The Giver and Jonas and Asher. The strongest relation would be between Jonas and The Giver because they spend a lot of time together and Asher is Jonas' best friend. One time Jonas was very unsure that if he should betray everyone and run away but The Giver helped him and told him what he should do.The main part that I like is the part that Jonas finds out that he is the new Receiver OfMemory. When he went threw his special training and got told that he was allowed to do almost anything that was my favourite part. I liked that part because he was allowed to break the rules.The language used in the book is very imaginative. The book creates a picture in your mind and makes your imagination run wild.I think the audience would find it interesting if they like books that show them different types of worlds.I recommend this book for ages 12+. It is a good book full of things we wouldn't ever think about, for almost anyone because it has good words to describe things.By Kushal Kant (SKTG)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas and The Giver.

In this community everything is either the same or picked for you. Everyone's job and spouse are picked by the elders, All colors are the same, and the weather never changes. When a kid named Jonas turns twelve he is chosen to become the next \\"Receiver of Memories\\". As he is going through the training to become the next \\"Receiver\\" he matures and he realizes that life isn't better if everyone is the same and that their spouses and their jobs are picked for them but that life is all about making their own choices and that things like colors and weather just make everything happening in life even better. Overall this book was great except that the ending kinda left you to imagine what happens and doesn't embellish on what happens."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In The Giver there is a boy named Jonas. He is eleven year old boy that lives in a world which is made perfect in everyway, no hunger, no pain, on war and no danger. When he turns 12 he is given the most respected job of them all, the Giver. This job consists of holding all of the memories of the people. Through many stages of his training he becomes more mature and relizes what the world is all about....happyness and love. Soon he has to make many vital desicions which change the course of his life.I recomend this book so anyone that is looking for a suspensfully, a sit at the edge kinda story that will stun you more that anything realistically now. I hope you understand this novel and really get to love it. Some times we take things for granite and dont realize it. This book points out what life would be like with having nothing, no emotions and no feelings toward anything.by: spencer hockey"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book I am writing about is named \\"The Giver\\". It is about a boy named Jonas, living in a Utopian world. This book is a good book because it is a different and weird community. This is a different community because they only celebrate your b-day up to 12 years, and the Elders pick your job for you. Jonas' community has bikes and no cars. When Jonas turns 12, he receives the job called the Receiver of Memory. After he gets it h wants to change the community. I think you should read this book because you get to read about a community that has weird rules and it is kind of a weird community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book changed my life. I don't mean that in a cheesy Lifetime Movie sort of way, but it made me reexamine reality, psychology, and all those things I take for granted. What must it be like to be unable to feel love? How important is color in my life? Why do we need memories and what would life be like without the strong interpersonal relationships that I've formed with my friends and family? These are very deep and difficult issues that are brought up in \\"The Giver,\\" which makes it a million steps above so many other books in its age category.When I first read this, I must have been no more than eleven years old. At the time, it was one of the more profound things I'd read and I marvelled at the issues and the symbolism, such as how the emergence of color was used artfully to express the growth of a whole new consciousness and awareness.I am now twenty years old, and I've read it a great number of times since I was eleven. As I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate the anger and confusion faced by Jonas as he tries to deal with these completely foreign ideas. However, I've also come to appreciate the gaping plot holes and unresolved issues, the far too quick ending and the realistic problem of figuring out population decline.These things don't make the book bad, in fact it's still one of the best books I can remember reading. They do, though, make me feel the need to take at least one star off of the rating. As an older and more accomplished writer today, I would like to see Lois Lowry tackle these holes in the constructed society of \\"The Giver.\\" This book is recommended for anyone, however. It's meaty enough for adults to sink thier teeth into it, but it's straightforward enough for younger people to understand the concepts raised."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read this book many times in my schooling career and I believe it holds a great message that should be read by everyone. Unfortunatly i think the book was written for a younger crowd and there are other books out there that better exemplify the plot and meaning of the story. I would highly recommend this for an early reader around the eight grade."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first received this book, I thought it looked boring. But I am so glad that I gave it a chance! The back cover description really doesn't tell enough about the story. But that's why I'm writing this review. So you can know just what the story is about (free of spoilers), and my opinion on it.Jonas is a boy who lives in a community where everything is structured and in control. Babies are birthed by birthwomen, named, and given to couples with only one girl and one boy in each family. Jobs, husbands, and wives are assigned by the leaders of the community. Children are not allowed to ride bicycles until they are \\"a nine\\". All of the people of the community have lives planned out for them, and they can have only as much knowledge as they are allowed. In this strange world that these people live in, there is only one person who knows of the beauty of originality and love: The Receiver. He must bear the weight of all the glorious memories of life and the painful ones of death for the entire community, even if it means that he will be the only one to realize how truly emotionless everything is. When Jonas is assigned this job, he must learn these memories from the past Receiver, who, since he is no longer receiving, refers to himself as \\"The Giver\\".This unique and entertaining page-turner is unpredictable, and will keep you wondering. Just when you are content with all that's happening, a new twist makes you wonder and keeps you reading. This book was very detailed, though the ending was slightly foggy for me. And it actually pulls you in, and almost makes you feel what the characters are feeling. I recommend it to all readers!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever wondered what the word \\"utopia\\" means? This book's about a utopia gone wrong. If you like those kinds of books, you will love this book because this is the kind of book that's for you. In this story you will find Jonas, a boy who lives in a place where everything seems right when it's really wrong. He discovers this after receiving a gift of memory of the past and present. Jonas fights to make his world right. We recommend this book to all. --Sterling Bradbury, Jesse Pho, Kelsey Jarrett and Heather Murrah in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This fantastic book The Giver is about Jonas who is 11 years old. His community is all the same. They all have been named not by their parents but by the Elders. Their jobs, kid's families, and even their spouses are chosen for them. They live in a world with no colour, or music. When you become a 12 you get an assignment. Jonas was assigned a special job, The Receiver of Memory. Some memories he receives are scary, frightening and painful, but some are rather enjoyable.This book caught my attention because the memories got more and more intense; it was also a bit shocking. I couldn't stop reading it; it was the best book I have read because it made me think about things in a different way. No wonder it won the John Newbery Medal!By: J.A.C 7R"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book after the first 2 chapters was pretty boring and I wanted to stop. But I kept reading and I couldn't put it down!This book had not too many exciting parts but interesting ones. Who would theink that everyone being the same would be interesting? The part that I thought the author should change is rhe unpredicable ending where it keeps you thinking that there should be more to The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" By Lois Lowry is very interesting and very confusing at the same time. The book is based on a utopia type world where everything is the same and everyone is very courteous and polite. It is one kids duty as receiver of memory to learn about all the horrible, painful, and also fun memories from the past. This book was very interesting to read because it is based on something so very different from the real world, so it makes it very unique. Some confusing parts of the book were when it is talking about how they can't see color and Jonas, the main character, learns to see color. In conclusion \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry was a very interesting book and is good for anyone from age nine to sixteen."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I felt the giver had ver interesting ideas, but they were expressed so slow and boring.

He is never hungry, never has to deal with war, and he never has any reason to believe that something is wrong with his life and the society that he lives in. When Jonas is picked to be the Receiver of Memories, he embarks on a dangerous and exciting journey. Jonas begins to learn the truth about his society, and what is kept hidden from public view. He realizes the hypocrisy that he has to deal with everyday, and he learns that maybe the world isn't so perfect anymore. What will Jonas do with his new knowledge?I thought The Giver was a great book. It is the only book of its kind to portray a perfect Utopian society realistically. Lois Lowry uses her colorful writing skills to create life-like characters that everyone can relate to and an exciting plot with surprises at every turn. I would recommend this book as a good read for anyone who is into science fiction with a twist."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading Lois Lowry's book \\"The Giver\\". One of the reasons I liked this book is because it wasn't quite a totally \\"out there\\" book, but it did have a certain element of fiction in it that to some would seem fanciful and far-fetched, but I believe Lowry approached in a real way. Jonas is living in a perfect world where everyone is behaved and nothing ever goes wrong, until he is \\"selected\\" to become the next receiver of memory, and this will turn his save world into something dark and twisted. He finally gets to look around and see something real for the first time in his life. I believe that The Giver provided an accurate perception of Lowry's dream world, and also it had a certain element of suspense that is a rarity among books today. It's unique and makes you think, which is why I enjoyed reading the book so much."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Who hasn't imagined living in a perfect world? I can attest to wishing for a perfect world where there is no war, no hate, and no hunger, a world of perfect happiness once upon a time. But, as is aptly shown in \\"The Giver\\", such a world comes with a price. You cannot have perfection and free will. They seem to cancel each other out in this world. The first time I read this book, I just read it. I think I was about twelve and I read it because it was something to do. I didn't think about it, I just read it like one would read a newspaper ad, not thinking, just reading.However, it was only recently as part of a VHS assignment that I encountered The Giver one more and found myself intrigued by the images and concepts it held. I can't imagine a world without color, without music, without love. How can a world survive like that? How can the heart survive? A child with everything else can die without love.The utter lack of freedom was also a disturbing image from this book. Every person must meet certain requirements or face being \\"Released\\". Perfection is expected and nothing else is tolerated for long. Children are assigned numbers, not names at birth, and each adult is assigned both a spouse, who they never intimate with, and a career, without choice. How can anything survive in this atmosphere of utter control? What happened to imagination and creativity? Where they too sacrificed with love and color for this perfect world?This book was profoundly moving, and I am so glad that I was able to encounter it again as a young adult. My added years have given me insights, and experiences that I did not have at the tender age of twelve when I was first handed my copy of \\"The Giver\\".-Jessica J. Smith"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read. I can really say that this book changed my way of thinking.

Pershing I.S.220, \\"The Giver\\" By lois Lowry is an interesrting book because in many parts they are have a lot of funny parts, serious, action... mostly action.

If I was stranded in the middle of nowhere I will bring this book to keep me company in my life because I can learn to do what the main character does in the forest where he doesn't know where to turn in the forest.

A world where everyone was the same, there were no choices, and everything was under control. A life free of worries or fear. The Giver by Lois Lowry describes this \\"perfect society\\" within its pages. The Giver does a great job of describin the many consequences of this perfect society in an exciting and easy to read book.Lois Lowry proved that good authors do truly use their imagination in her description of society in The Giver. She goes into thorough detail describing every function and the many rules within the society. She also uses an exciting storyline to give information about such a society. Lowry also uses her book to include a message about our world. This message is of how we need conflicts, emotions and even pain to live a thourough life. She tells of the many disadvantages to a \\"perfect society\\"Lois Lowry does do a great job with her details in her book. However, The Giver is not the book for very high level readers. It is written with simplicity, readers from grades six and above would most likely be very capable of understanding this book. However I believe many of the older would enjoy reading about the many concepts that are introduced.Many of us would most likely be able to realize the drawbacks of an attempt at a \\"perfect society\\". However The Giver gives us an insightful simulation of one of these societies created. It is an easy read, therefore good for all ages. I would highly suggest reading the giver to everyone who wants to expand their thinking on society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverIn Jonas' world, there is no pain, almost no memory, no color, poverty, no wrong choices, and no bloodshed. Jonas is given one of the most important jobs, the Receiver of Memories. The job is very painful but is also very important. He has the ability to get memories from the Giver. These memories come from the past way before their time, and the Giver keeps them and gives them down to the Receiver and then when the Receiver gets all of the memories, he turns into the Giver. I would recommend this book to people who like books that have tense endings.This book has a good climax. At the end, Jonas had the choice of taking his brother Gabriel past the mountains and or waiting and telling the Giver about it and letting Gabe getting released. He chose to take his brother past the mountains. Then, it all came out to be a dream.This book also makes people think about how hard life would be if our life were like that. In the beginning, a pilot makes the wrong turn and scares everyone in Jonas' world. Just for that, he got released. Also, if a birthmother births twins, one is released because they don \`t want to see two of the same people walking around.The book has good themes such as the importants of memory. The only memory keeper in the book is the Giver. Without anyone else having memories, there is no wisdom.This book is pretty seamless, but the theme is very well thought out. Like I said before, the importants of memory is very important, without it there is no wisdom. This book is really well thought out and planned, so if you like books like this one, you should read it.J.

This is a must read for all middle school students even adults can enjoy this heart-warming tale of life in a perfect world. It really makes you think about how boring it would be if there was no color or no pain whatsoever. You should really get your hands on it so you can enjoy it as much as i did."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My mom introduced this book to me when I was younger and it is the only book that to this day, I continue to read. As an adult, I enjoy children's books, but as a student, reading was one of my least favorite things to do. THE GIVER is my favorite story. It kept my interest as a young reader, which was difficult to do. This story turned me on to reading because of that. Before this book, I did not realize that reading could actually be entertaining.The author is descriptive and pulls the reader into the book with Jonas' story and struggles. It is about a time when things such as color do not exist. Everyone is pretty equal, and no one is out of the ordinary. Once a year everyone comes to a ceremony where each child advances to the next year of life with new responsibilities. This year Jonas begins training for his life's work. He is given the role of The Receiver. Under this title, Jonas receives information from the past from The Giver. The Giver is the only one with memories from the past, which are the only resource the community has to make decisions hoping to not repeat the mistakes of the past."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you remember a time in your life when you parents or teacher said to you \\"You're special, because there is no one else like you in the whole world\\"?Lois Lowry emphasizes this question in her novel about conformity and a completely controlled society called the Giver. On a scale of 1-5, I rate this book a 4, because of its immortal lessons beneath the cover. This book presents extremeties to which there is no hurt or pain, but also no love or true happiness.Jonas, the main character, is a boy who has entered his time to be \\"chosen\\" for his assigned job in his completely controlled community. He is chosen as \\"The Receiver\\", which is the most honored job in the community. \\"The Receiver\\" holds all memories to which the society over the years has chosen to do away with- all the memories which make life unique, including color, and most feelings and emotions. Throughout the book we see Jonas emerge and realize these emotions are essential to a fulfilled life, even if the good comes with the bad."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry deserves all the acclaim that it receives. The Community and its rules and regulations are an imaginative way of viewing what society could become. The Giver reminds us that uniqueness is a part of everyday life that everyone very much takes for granted. It also stresses that the ability to love and cherish our families is also something we must never forget. However, in my opinion, The Giver is left a little unfinished. Lowry does a wonderful job in describing the community and all of its events, but when it comes to the climax, I feel as though it kind of just leveled off. My only criticism is the ending. It definitely could have been more descriptive and informative as to what happened to the Community. I did enjoy reading it though, and I do feel that it is a good book to use in a classroom environment. It leaves many opportunities for discussion and debate. It is conceivable that that was Lowry's exact intention: to spark discussions over the ending and the many controversial topics within the story itself.If one was looking for a higher level book that is very closely related with this I would have to say Brave New World by Adolus Huxley. It is the mature, adult version of The Giver in its questioning of future societies and its regard to love, family, and memory."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is captivating book about a lifestyle quite different from our own. Lois Lowry shows her incredible imagination and creativity in this story about Jonas, the main character, living a restricted life and proceeding to realize there is a better way to live.Before reading this book, I took my individuality for granted. While the story of The Giver is not true, it opened my eyes to a different and controlled way of life and made me realize how privileged I am to be able to make my own decisions. There are a lot of little things taken for granted in our world. Lois Lowry gives you a glimpse of what life would be like without them.The Giver holds many twists, turns, and surprises. As you read about Jonas's life, you will find your feelings changing from happy, sad, and confused about the life this boy has to lead. You may find the lifestyle appalling or you might find it incredible.A key element in The Giver is the difference of opinions. Would you stand up for your beliefs even if it meant utter rejection from everyone you knew?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When reading the giver for the first time I found it to be strange and not all that enjoyable, but after reading it for a second time I found that I noticed things that I hadn't noticed before.Some of the things that I noticed the second time around was that all of the characters except Jonas and the Giver see in black and white. There were other things That I found out along the way but you'll just have to read it and find out what they were.All around I would recommend this book to anybody who reads. It's a book for all ages and is enjoyable and entertaining. I also found that the book made me think about things that I use to take for granted like my freedom to be who I want to be, and act the way that I want to act. It's a definite got to read for anyone who's living in the world today and feels like they are just one person in a crowd."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a good book to read in your spar time.It does have some dull moments.It is about a twelve named Jonas that has to relize that his world is wrong.He can't learn to think untilhe meets some new people."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very interesting book. It tells about an imaginary world that seems so perfect. The further you read into the book the more you begin to relize that the world can and never will be perfect.

It would have been better if she would have gone into more depth on what happened to the main character. I wouldn't won't to ruin the book for so I you so i won't say much more. If you want a book of fantasy this is the perfect book of the almost perfect world. I would recomend this book to just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver will draw you in a feeling of suspense when you begin to read it. I thought that it was an interesting book to read. It's not like other books that have happy endings. This ending was calm to me. You begin to realize in the book that that Jonas' world is not like ours. They don't believe in war or violence. The different Assignments their people received were interesting to me, because they had no choice over what they received. Bottom line, it's a good book to read for the avid readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this book was very interesting and out of the ordinary. In a good way. It was very creative and unique. I like how they explained the different jobs that everyone got. Jonas was my favorite character. At the beginning of the book,I thought that the title didn't fit the book until I got to about the middle. I wish that some of our city rules and laws were like that. I really enjoyed this book because I like reading fantasy books and you could tell that this one was. I makes me wonder if the future could\\\\will really be like this. The things that I didn't really like about it was that, It was alittle confusing at first but most books are. I also wish that there had been a more happy ending, and alittle more details on what happened next.

To me it was a really boring but exciting book at the same time from the beginning to the end. I thought that the comunity was really dumb, I don't think that the community should have gone to Sameness. Jonas was my favorite character. At the beginning of the book, I thought that the title didn't go along with what everything was talking about, but once you got to chapter 11 it started to make since. At the end I thought it got real exciting. It makes me wonder if the world will/could ever be like the small community. If it ever is then it will be very bad."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an ok book. Althogh it was not the type of book I usally read it was good to get a change.

There were some parts of the book that I just did not like alltoghter like going into sameness or \\"releasing\\"(better know as killing) the twin and old people. Yet there were some things in the book I think our goverment should look at. Such as no more world hunger and no more war. That would be awesome!

It is a very good book and if you ever happen to get a chance to read it I would definatly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a mystery book. Some parts were hard to figure out and some were really interesting. The middle of the book was the best. When he became the Reciever and started recieving the memories. The ending of the book was sort of odd but sort cool. It was interesting how they came up with the plan to escape. I was glad that him and Gabrielle made it over the hill. My final opinion is that the book was neat and i liked it. It was a well written book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that the book was awsome! It really caught my interest and I liked that Jonas was different from every one else in the story. It makes the story more interesting when jonas discovers that he is different from the others, and he gets these amazing memories. The only bad thing about it is that he cannot share these memories with any of his freind or family, just Gabriel. Jonas also is not allowed to discuss any of his training, or take medication to relive the pain from his training,and the painful memories that he recieves from the giver.(Oh I forgot to mention some of the memories are aslo painful) Jonas uses some of his peaceful memories to help Gabriel to sleep at night. I would definately recomend this book to others.And that's all I have to say about this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book was awesome. I really liked it. My favorite part was when Jonas received the memory of love. I also liked the way the aurthor used forshadowing in this novel. So that every part of the story had a reason for being there. In my own opinion the saddest part in the story was the releasing of the twin and Jonas saw the real meaning of being released. The reason I thought that this book desearved 4 stars was beacause when Jonas fled to elsewhere they didn't tell us what happened when he got there. But if they had the the story would have gone on forever. I beleive that the aurthor of this book has a great talent be cause when I read this book I realized that life is so much more. If we didn't have pain then we wouldn't have strength, and even though love may hurt sometimes it is great to have loved someone at all. So thank you Lois Lowry for this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Disappointing that the CD was obviously overwritten with the story. It was possible to hear some of the songs in the background. All the song titles are still showing - no chapters or book references. I was disappointed and feel a little cheated since it was supposed to be a brand new copy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book but the ending I can't decide if I like it or not.

Ending just early enough to leave you wanting more"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book really makes you think and I really enjoyed itJoan (the maim character) has to start thinking for himself and is a good story of a child becoming a man/boyThe only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because I already read the book once before, so it was a little boring because I already knew what was going to happen. But otherwise it would've been an obvious 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Short but thought-provoking. I picked it up because I've seen this title every time I read a review on an utopia/dystopia young adult book and was curious. I've read various books with very similar ideas (Delirium and Matched) of a society where everything has been decided for them to avoid suffering, wrong-doing and chaos; but is that a life worth living? No uncertainty but also no control. No suffering but also no passion. No choices, no freedom.Jonas was selected to be The Receiver of Memories of everybody that has ever existed so that people don't have to carry their burden. Only he will learn from these experiences and will have the wisdom to advice society on unprecedented matters.&#34;The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories are meant to be shared.&#34;I had this interesting thought that this is how I feel about reading books. I experience someone else's memories or stories and it makes me wiser although they are situations I've never been through."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We all dream of the perfect world where everything is at peace there is no racism or heart break or pain. Well inThe GiverLois Lowry takes you to this world.Everyone has the same colored skin so there is no racism. You don't worry about heart break because your spouse is chosen for you. Can't decide what color shirt to wear well no need everything is the same color. Even if you don't think you are good at anything a job is assigned to you. Physical and mental deficiency from birth? no worry every baby is up to up to par. Don't like today's music no need there is no music. Rude remarks are not tolerated.This book is a great example of how utopias don't work. A utopia is an ideal place with social perfection, but this cannot be achieved. When your job is chosen for you and you can't change it you don't always get something you particularly want. This book follows Jonas and his journey through this utopia.And don't for get this is a trilogy!The Worlds of Lois Lowry 3-Copy Boxed Set (The Giver, Messenger, Gathering Blue)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I got caught up in the story immediately. The book is geared toward younger readers but it is a story for everyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book, and the pacing of the book was very fascinating. The first half of the book seemed almost entirely like build up, and then the resolution came in the second half of the book.This book is set in a futuristic society that's a mix betweenBrave New Worldand 1984. The society is completely controlled, but they live in self contained \\"communities\\" of about 2500 people, that are vigorously regulated. For example, only 50 babies are allowed to be born into the community at any one year. My guess is that this takes place around the year 2500 - 3000, but technology has stagnated because of these self contained communities, so technologically they're still stuck in the 1980s.The book is classified as science fiction, but the only science fiction element is that Jonas gets a call to be a \\"Receiver,\\" and he also ends up being a \\"Giver,\\" which means that he can receive old memories and give old memories. In this book, the whole community has rejected emotion and memories, but the problem with that is that you can't get rid of emotion and memories. They have to go somewhere. So, the community decided to make a job called Receiver, which contains all of the emotion and memories in a single person, to protect everyone else from these emotions. This makes the job of the Receiver really frustrating, because he or she can't share the emotions or memories with anybody, besides the previous Receiver who has to die after just a year of training.It's the first of a four-part series, but it stands alone well as a single book. I highly recommend it.Pros:+Very tight, well put together story+Fascinating and thought provoking. I'm going to be thinking about this book for months to come.+A very fun, quick read+If you read it as a family, it gives a lot of interesting topics for discussionCons:-A little slow at first"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that The Giver was an excellent book. I loved the way that Lois Lowry depicted a world without memories of legends. It was an original plot, and I think it would be scary if such a thing really did happen, that the entire world lost touch with its roots, save for one person burdened with having to keep the memories. This one person, the Receiver, had to then call upon the memories to help save the community in the book. I know that if something like that ever did happen, Franklin MA. and Franklin High School, not to mention the rest of the world, would be devoid of all emotion. This would be devastating because we need emotions to be human."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a really cool. It is about a boy who is chosen by the elders of his Utopia type community to have one of the most honored, but painful job a the reciever. He must recieve all the memorys in the world. Memorys of good times, memorys of war, unknown to his somewhat &quot;perfect&quot; community. But when he realizes these are mere memorys, he desides to pursue his own life, not chosen by a bunch of old people. So one night he escapes the community with his baby brother &quot;newchild&quot;, Gabe. He rides on his bike through the woods, encountering strange animals unknown to him, and terible snow storms. Then, he looks over a hill and he sees a city. But not just any city, a NORMAL city."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the 5th Grade I read THE GIVER with my class. It was a story that took a while to understand, but once you did you didn't want to put it down. The story is about a boy named Jonas living in a perfect society, no crime, no poverty, no nothing. He has no idea of his birth parents or siblings. All he knows is that from now on his life is living there and consuming the starnge job of Reciever. This is a kind of book where you have to be mature. There are a couple of parts that have to take a serious person to sit and read with no laughing. So, I strongly say to read this book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is living in a controlled community where everything seems to be perfect. Everyone is the same. There is no color, emotions, and such to separate them from one another. Beginning and ending in December, every child born within that year is in a group together in which they all progress at the same pace. The newborn children are placed in a nurturing center until the next December comes along. Then they are each distributed to a family unit that has applied for a child after being cared for by The Nurturers. Family units have two children, a boy and a girl. Every year a ceremony in December is held that advances all children born in the same year up to the next age. In the Ceremony of One children receive names, Ceremony of Nine children receive Bicycles, Ceremony of Twelve children receive jobs, and so on. Jonas is nearing the 'Ceremony of Twelve' at which he and his group of Twelves will be receiving their assignments. After being presented to the community as The Receiver, the highest position of honor, he is to begin receiving his training from The Giver, who will give him memories of life's pain and pleasure. Jonas soon discovers that the community is not as perfect as he had once thought. I enjoyed reading The Giver and gaining an idea of how cruel one would have to be in order to support perfection. The situations of our lives in this imperfect world that could not be prevented and the ways in which those situations were attended to in the controlled community were interesting to think about. I believe that The Giver is a genuinely entertaining book for all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver is a very interesting book. It contains a culture that is different than any on earth in many ways. The descriptions Lowry employs to bring the different world to us are vivid and do place you right in the community with the people. Reading The Giver gave me a new perspective on the functions of society and how people live in it. If everyone read this book, would they see that every action they make is a statement that proclaims their precious individuality? Lowry's book is valuable as it warns people of something that would be horrific if it happened in our world, that many may consider to truly be an advance of humanity."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I first started reading this book, my boyfriend laughed at me. He told me it was something he had read in 6th grade. But I don't think a 6th grader can fully understand the message in this book. It makes you realize how lucky we are to live on this earth, even with all the bad things that happen. Jonas's world was not perfect, even though he believed that it was at first. How can a world without color, love and emotion be perfect? To me, love is the basis of all life. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that will make him or her think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young boy who lives in an utopian/cultic communitty. It is a world with no pain and suffering but also without compassion. It may seem like the perfect world, but it's not. There whole lives are chosen for them by elders: who to marry, what child they will have, what they can be, etc. When Jonas is selected to be The Giver, he is taken to an old man who teaches him the evil in the world, and also the good side. Now Jonas must chose between a world of peace without freedom or a world with choice. I think this is an excellent book because it makes you think about how lucky we are to chose our own destiny. However, as I read this book, I began to think of how people take our freedom for granted. I highly recommend this book to the young and old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Personally, I didn't really care for &quot;The Giver&quot;. Yes, it is a good book, with a good plot, but what spoiled the book for me was the way the characters acted. When I read a book, I like to have more than one character be three-demensional. As I read this book, I grew increasingly fustrated at the behavior of the other characters actions. The only characters that seemed to have any remote form of demension were The Giver and Jonas. In my opinion, if the other characters that were mentioned on a regular basis, perhaps the book would have been more enjoyable to me. However since that was not the case, I cannot find too much that I enjoyed from this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;I have read the book The Giver by Lois Lowry and I mustsay that it was very suspenseful! With each chapter I read, Icouldn't put down the book. The end of each chapter made me wonderwhat was going to happen next. It made me stop and think about howdifferent cultures really are. Compared to ours, Jonas' community isvery different from my town... It makes me stop and wonder -- couldthis really happen? It it even possible? These are questions I cannotanswer because it would ruin the story and my opinions may bedifferent than yours. Read The Giver and find out foryourself.&quot;...&quot;The Giver will grab your attention andleave you hanging to see what is going to happen in the next chapter.I did not want to put down the book at all. Lowry builds the suspenseup at the end of each chapter. I liked reading about Jonas' culture-- a community very different from my own.&quot;...&quot;The book,The Giver is very suspenseful from the moment you pick it up to themoment you put it down. Believe me it will get your attention on thefirst page. It's like you are really there throughout the book. Ifyou get a chance to read it you should do so because it is a goodbook!&quot;...&quot;I read The Giver in my ninth grade and someparts were high in action, mystery, and suspense.

It was an ok book but sometimes it was boring maybe it's because I like action. Well it's got a nice ending anyway! Hope you will enjoy The Giver. Keep Reading - Mandi :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Wow.&#34;The Giver&#34; is one of the most terrifying, cruel, yet hopeful books I've ever read.Twelve year-old Jonas lives in a world of Sameness. Every need is taken care of, everyone is employed, being educated, or being taken care of. It's a world of uniformity and plainness. &#34;Family units&#34; consist of a set of parents, one boy, and one girl, each assigned to the adults when the children become Ones. There are no surprises, nor pain, a little emotion.Soon, however, Jonas realizes there's more to life than he ever thought possible. He is chosen as the Receiver. His training includes learning things only one other person in the community knows. And that person is the Giver.My 13 year-old son, who had to read &#34;The Giver&#34; for school, encouraged me and my wife to read it. It's a quick read, which is why I'm offering very little in terms of plot. But is brevity is packed with many emotions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've loved this book since middle school and have been desperate for a good read lately. I've read this book several times and have called this my favorite book for the better part of two decades, but have never owned it. It was just time. My only complaint is that it's too short! I wish this book would just go on and on. I realize it's for a younger audience and probably appreciated it length when I was a less experienced reader. I'm glad to own it now so I can read it to my heart's content."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Taking a look into a possible future eutopia is always interesting. The writing style didn't really catch me, but the concept made me want to read on to see what would happen. An ok book, but I can imagine the conversations one could have with young adults while reading this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I would give the book like a 9 because it is like a saga of books well it is but this is a different kind of text that is hard to understand. I would pick this book for like a project because it is kinda hard to understand.

I haven't read it but Lois Lowery has been on many H/S reading list as a former bookstore owner.

A must read for any child from 8 yrs to 15 yrs ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Really a good read. A great story and wonderful characters. I should have bought the paperback trilogy. Highly recommend saving money and buying the boxed set."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I must confess, I bought this book to test out my Kindle's ability to play talking books. I must say for this book at least, the audio is abysmal. There are a female and a male voice, and neither has any inflection at all. Well, I know the audio works, but don't care to use it.As for the book itself, it was quite good. It is about a society where the highest aim is to be like everyone else, dress like everyone else, eat what everyone else does, and except for occupation, to do exactly what everyone else does. And you don't pick out your own occupation or your own mate or your own children; the state does it for you. Communism on steroids.Sounds dreary and it is, for a while. The young protagonist starts to see things most don't, starts to feel uneasy about it, and in the end, he goes off on his own to try to find a better place. There is a lot more I didn't tell you, and it IS a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've loved it since I was a kid! It is beautifully written and great for pretty much all ages.

I had a good time reading it and I thought it was a really neat book. I think the author did an excellent job writing this book and I know that I had a good time reading it. I don't really enjoy reading books because usually there's much better stuff to do but since we had to read the book for a grade I had to read it. I never expected to like reading a book that I was forced to read but I actually had a really good time with \\"The Giver. I got really into it and finished reading it in about four days.

The Giver makes you want to relate back to your own life. The way there are so many rules it makes think of them being controled by that speaker. This book was just wonderful. It made you want to be with Jonas and his friends. It was very intrigueing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Reading the book, \\"The Giver\\", it sparked a different way of thinking for me and that's why I liked the book. Many of Lois Lowry's books reveal the same imagination and revelation, as does \\"The Giver\\". In a way, you can relate to many of the characters and their actions. Also it feels like you're there in the story with its in-depth detail, surrounded by these characters. It is an easy-to-read book and each page makes you want to turn it and read more. This book is so interesting that you'll want to read the words slowly and focus on the whole content or read it in one sitting so you don't have to get back to it and forget the storyline."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I was first told about the book The Giver I was skeptical about it. I wasn't sure the book would really be good. To be honest I sat down and after reading just a few pages I was hooked. Lowry has the ability to pull you into this world and make you feel for the characters. Not only do you feel like you know the characters, but you feel like you're in this community. While this idea of a \\"perfect community\\" seems a little far-fetched at times I think it could actually be a real place. With the things going on in the world now and in the past I can see why someone would want to create a world to escape to. While I wouldn't want to live in a place like that I can see why some others would. Jonas and all the other kids seemed generally happy and so did the adults. Everyone had everything they needed and no one complained. In this book Lowry creates a captivating society that just pulls you in until the very end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think this book is a great book because this book makes you think about our life and how we thought we had it bad."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is probably the most interesting book that I have ever read. Lois Lowry's story of the Community that is devoid of feeling and color takes you on a deep journey, but that journey grinds to an unsatisfying halt. Lowry claims that she wrote the ending of the Giver to be so vague because the book is so many different things to so many different people and that everyone has a different idea of how it should end. To me though, it just feels like she rushed to create the ending and is cheating us by not even offering a sequel. This novel had great potential, but the ending ruined it. A good author starts strong and ends strong and gives the reader something to take with them in the last few moments. Lois Lowry does neither of these things and that is the big disappointment."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What I like most about The Giver is that Lowry doesn't sugar coat the frightening, harsh world she created. Instead, Lowry assumes her young adult audience is intelligent and more mature than some adults give us credit for. All the negative reviews that focus on the twin babies scene or bathing scene ignore the other 98 percent of the book, which is well written and held my interest throughout. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ending- I know Lowry wanted to leave things unsettled, but the ending could have been more conclusive, one that hinted that many of the disturbing things in the story would remain unchanged. Also read An Audience for Einstein, another good book about memories that doesn't insult the younger reader's intelligence."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is my all time favorite! It leaves so much for the imagination to ponder and is a little frightening to think that one day lives could become this way. The story of Jonas' courage and passion is one not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a good book because even though I didn't really enjoy what I was reading about, it was written in a way that made it interesting. It sounds like the story takes place in the future. Jonas lives in this perfect world. It is a controlled enviornment run by a group of elders. The book is about Jonas recieving his assignment. This is the job he will perform for his community. Jonas recieves a very important assignment and the Giver helps him discover life outside the community.(Gabby, ELHS)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As there are so many reviews that has some kind of spoiler in them,I won't be describing what the book is about. After I finish this book, the first thing that came out of is \\"WOW.\\" This book describe that a world need conflict and opinion and most of all-LOVE.I'd recommand to age 10+."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book,as distrubing as it was, was an excellent sci-fi book that, though odd, makes us all see that there is not, on the Earth we know, a place where everything is perfect as we can not know true happines or pleasure without first expiriancing pain and suffering. Jonas makes me think more, though this is a reach, more about the freedom of choice, for in the Community, there is none. The book striked as a powerful reminder that there is not a better world than that the one we live in, for there would be no happieness if it were the same as the Community, and no feelings. Without feelings, we are not human, and the people in this book scared me that some day there really may be a place that comes around here or in some other life where there are no feelings, color, or, most importantly, love.I also recommend, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and The Price of Immortality (AWESOME BOOK)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I did not actually READ this book. I listened to it on Cassette, but even so this book had me hanging till the end! It can be a little boring in the beginning and you have to be able to understand what is happpening in the characters world. This book gave us a little insight of what it may be like in the future. I found parts of this book a little disturbing and it sent me wondering about our world. If you read this book, be ready to ask questions and also give yourself time to figure out some what is happening. let the facts sink in. This book is a little complex, but I still loved it.

Now that i listened to it i changed my mind.]"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First off, this was a really good book. Second of all, I would like to get something off my chest. Why does everyone(almost)think that books with anything thougthful, serious, or bad are not appropriate for children? I'll admit that a five year old should not read this book, but what about the kids who are seven or eight and could understand this book? Should they not be able to read it just because of some disturbing things? They are the ones who need to read it so that they can stop the world from becoming that way!Now that I've done that, I'll move on to the book. This is a really great book. The author has created a whole new world, but sort of like ours. This book makes you think about our soceity, and what it has become. It makes you thankful for all the simple things, even pain and the ability to choose a job and be different from other people. There is also one other thing missing from that world. Color. It is all a colorless gray, but no one, except The Giver and The Receiver, knows any different.Get this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think there are many reasons to read this book. The story takes place in a whole new world, where everything is perfect and there are rules for everything. In the community, all choices are made by a Commitee of Elders, who decides the future of the community. I recommend reading this book to everyone, because it's very interesting and it's narrated from a different perception of the future, where everything is so organized and perfect that there is no liberty. A very good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, The Giver, is a pretty ok book I guess. In some parts you get confused because Lois Lowry didnt really explain it that well. In some chapters it made me want to think ahead of what was going to happen next. In the beginning the book was pretty boring. However it was ok later on.This book makes you think of your own pictures in your head. Some things in the book shocked me like Jonas recieved memories and the punishment Babies and the Old's got.This book has very good vocabulary words, that some of them you have to look up while your reading ( unless you know the word) i recomened this book for kids starting from the age 12. Even so in that age, you will get confused a little. Lowry says something doesnt exist like war and the weapons, but later on it says that Asher and other friends were playing with imaginary \\"WEAPONS\\". Overall this book is very interesting..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry deals with a community, which seems to be the perfect world, but it's a place without any feelings!!!!I recommend the book to all people!!The background is very serios and important, because many people in our world want to reach an Utopia!(no wars, no hunger, no diseases..)but have you ever thougt about the situation then?? Someday you'll reach the point where no love is existing any more. The consequences of such an Utopia would be a birthcontrol and perhaps a \\"deadcontrol\\", because there would be too many (sounds stupid !) people on earth !! I found the book very interesting and worth reading it!!But I'd never, never, never want to live in such a world...Imagine---they have no feelings. No love, no happiness, no real friendship, no own choice...NO OWN LIFE!!They are just existing, not really living, because everything in their life is \\"planned for them\\". What's the sense of their life??Is there really a sense?WHY do they live??Everthing is controlled: Love, climate, landscape, job, children...everything!!!The more I read the book, the more I liked it. I'm german, but at the end it was so easy to read as a german book.I hope that our world will never become such a place to live!!Beware the feelings!!!\\"For all the children, to whom we entrust the future!\\"(Lois Lowry)Read it!!!!!!!I recommend the book for everyone, yo guys it's really worth reading it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I saw this book the first, \`perfect world' I thought this book's story might be magic stuff.

However all books have some problem I think. There wasn't main or many problems but this book doesn't have much instruction or explanation. Like when I see some things that are strange to me, I just could think that's just because this book's background's different as ours. I know this writer tried to make some new story.Second, thanks to the writer Lois Lowry who wrote this book. Because when I read this book, I felt like I'm being in Jonas' world and I always wonder what will happen after.Third, Jonas' world that she made was interesting and gave me a chance to think about that type of story.

I was appauled to find so many bad reviews!The Giver is one of the best books I ever read. Those who didn't understand it, or thought it was too advanced for young readers, DID NOT fully understand it! While, I admit, there was violence, and the like, it was realted to the storyline, which makes it all right. And too those who say that parents 'should not let thier children read this book', or something like that- I read it at 10 WITH my mother, who urged me to read it. So it really depends on the parent, the child's level of reading, and personal taste.But hey, I'm justr a 14-year-old kid.

This book tells us of a world where no one has color, no one raises their own children and no one has anything special about them except the Giver. The Giver is the one being that holds all the wonderful and happy thought outside of this community. But he also holds the reality of the so-called \\"REAL WORLD\\". This is a great book, it demonstrates how our world would be if we didn't not have freedom to express ourselves. Jonah Breaks this ongoing circle by running away, and not choosing to accept his new position as the giver.This novel contains Irony in a way that it does not tell you the exact meaning, but you have to attempt to translate it yourself. It gives you the hard evidence but in the book you have to think and explore your imagination to get the full meaning. The Theme of this book is to look outside of the box. Don't judge people for being themselves or for being unique, because without that what is the world other then nothingness.The Tone of this book is sad but in a way you can rejoice about the way Jonah starts to think. There are many different times in the book when Jonah is confused and doesn't know what to do but he always makes it through until his death. Even in his death he finds a peace though. He learns a lesson and teaches one as well.I would recommend this book to anyone that feels that they don't fit along with everyone else. It might change the way you think of your self and the confidence you have for yourself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a world without choice. Everything is cared for. No one goes hungry. No one feels pain. To live in this world, the people have given up all their choices and emotions. The Giver details how Jonas becomes the reciever of memory for his community. He learns about the pain and the emotions of their past, and he and the giver take action.I found that the book was well written, and rich with symbolics. If you were to look into it deeply you could see what it was telling you. I did not like however, that the actual story did not seem to have a real solid plotline. There was no real cause and effect. There was no reasoning. It seemed like a bunch of random incidents tacked togeather to create a meaning.Overall though, it is a good book that will wrap you around it's finger for a few hours and leave you wanting more. Just wanting a bit too much more for my liking."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world with no pain and no suffering. Imagine a world where marriage partners are selected and children are assigned to a family. Imagine a world with no color, no war, no pain, no suffering. Imagine a world with no sunshine, no snow, no hills, and no memory. Imagine a world where everyone is equal and all choices are predestined. Welcome to Jonas' world.Jonas lives in the world of Sameness. Memory has been removed from the citizens to eliminate pain and suffering. Everyone in the community has a job that is assigned to them when they turn 12. Jonas, upon turning 12, was honored by being selected as the next Receiver of Memory. He begins to train with The Giver, the previous Receiver of Memory, who holds all memories of former life and soon realizes that he fails to experience not only the bad in life, but also the good. After several weeks of training, Jonas discovers a shattering secret and despite the dictated laws for his job, he plans action against the ironically corrupt system.Having read \\"The Giver\\" when I was in 3rd grade, I didn't note on all the symbolism and the deeper meaning behind the book. Once I reread it, however, I was amazed. I was amazed that one author could create such a scene and predicament within one story that raises so many questions. When I finished the book the second time, I sat back for a couple minutes and simply thought, \\"Wow!\\" Even though \\"The Giver\\" reads on the level of a 3rd grader, I would recommend not picking up this book until mature themes become evident in everyday reading.Overall, \\"The Giver\\" was a phenomenal book. Lois Lowry's style and diction depicts what the perfect world could be like, while throwing the ultimate question into play: would it be worth living without pain if you also had to live without joy?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I read The Giver I was a little confused in the begining. This book is about a young boy who is given the chance to take over a very important role in his community. He learns a lot from his experience and decides to make a very important decision. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or fictional type of stories. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I would a more kind of sci-fi horror type of book. I do like fiction but not this kind of fiction. To me this kind of fiction is unrealistic and kind of immature. Some parts of this book did suprise me and the book does kind of keep you on your feet wondering what is going to happen next but I do have to say that this was not a favorite of mine but might be for someone else."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book about a boy named Jonas who lives in a town with laws about sameness.

He is very apprehensive, as he has no idea what job he will be assigned. Jonas knows that once he gets assigned his job, everything will change; his recreation time with his best friend Asher and the importance of his school work.I really enjoyed The Giver because Lois Lowry is a very good author and the plot and characters are very unique.

Everyday I would look foward to reading it andto find out what happens next.

When you read about the main charecter, Jonas, you feel as if you where right there with him, being embarresed, being afraid and even feeling his pain as he watches a \\"release\\". The book somehow, teaches you not to always take things the way that they are and to try to change it, I think it tought me not to be afraid of being different.

Then Jonas learns about the true feeling of love which is a wonderful feeling, which we sometimes take for granted, when Jonas gets feelings there not all happy, some are cruel and evil, such as hate.

No one can see colors and there is one person that keeps track of all the memories. That person is &quot;The Reciever&quot;. Jonas has a friend, Asher, who is a wild kid. Every December there is a ceremony like a birthday because you turn a different age. Each time you turn a different age you get something or something happens to you. When you turn 9 you get a bicycle and when you turn 12 you get your assignment. An assingment is the job that you will do for the rest of your life until you retire. They chose the assingment from the volunteer hours to do. For example if you do a lot of volunteering at the Nuturing Center your assingment will probably be Nuturer. Each child has a number at the ceremony which is the order they will be called up. The Cheif Elder skips Jonas's number then comes back to it. Jonas wasn't assinged, he was selected to be &quot;The Receiver&quot;. He gets trained by the old receiver, which Jonas calls &quot;The Giver&quot;, and gets to hold the memories. The Receiver is greatly honored because he can make decisions from past memories. Jonas gets the happy memories, but remembers the Cheif Elder saying that there would be pain so asks the Giver to give him memories with pain. During his training he sees colors for the first time and feels pain for the first time. Jonas's father is a Nuturer and he has to make a release. A release is releasing someone to another community. He watches the release and finds out that his father just kills the baby. Jonas runs away from the community and on his journey he feels pain, sees colors and sees hills. He also hears music which The Giver told him about."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i just recently finished reading this book in my 7th grade language arts class and i LOVED it! i never like the books that we read in class but i really enjoyed this book. there are so many things to think about and to love about this book. if u like books that explain things and have a wrap-up ending then u wouldnt like this book at all, but if u like thinking about things then u will LOVE this book. this is a great read for everyone. im gonna suggest it for everyone to read.BUY THIS GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;Welcome. We must get started. You're one minute late.&quot;As I said before, you are one minute late which means you missed the subject of my review. Well, I'll repeat it, but don't be late again. &quot;The Giver by Lois Lowry,&quot; that's all you've missed.Ahem! Where to start...Ah I have it. The characters. Pretty interesting, and there are more then I list here: Jonas, a boy at 11 when you meet him, but yes, he grows an almost 2 years. He is a very curious boy who has ended up with a special life, to be the new Receiver in Training. What does he think of his highly honored job? Well, I won't give away what he does, but he doesn't prefer his honor. Asher, an interesting character, has had trouble with language ever since being a little kid. A somewhat humorous kid you will see. Lily, Jonas' sister is a very curious girl at 7 and always has something to argue about. After a little explanation of what she's talking about by her parents, the argument soon ends. His mother and father aren't as important as all , but still important enough. The mother (you never find out any of their real names) is a nice person who is in the Department of Justice. The father is a nuturer. A nuturer is someone who takes care of youngsters untill they are assigned a family unit to live with. He takes a child to his house and sneeks a peek at the naming list. The childs name is Gabriel. Jonas' father isn't supposed to have the child at their home untill that is decided by the other nuturers later in the book.&quot;Call me The Giver.&quot;The Giver is Jonas' insructor. What he does is transfers memmories from the past from him to Jonas.The setting (I thought) was an odd one. A community of sameness with no colors, feelings, that sort of thing. Well when Jonas is &quot;selected&quot; to be the new Receiver in Training, his whole life changes. He sees colors, he has feelings, he discovers books and so much more! Soon these feelings overtake him and because Gabriel is to be released from the community the next morning Jonas frees him from his misfortune. How you ask? Well, read The Giver by Lois Lowry to find out!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is meant to be a children's book, but kids young and old can enjoy this thought-provoking novel.

The Giver, takes a while to get into. But once it gets interesting, its hard to put down.The Plot of the story is very simple. But to understand it fully, you will need backround information .In the village, once every child turns 12, they are assigned their job. They do these jobs for basically the rest of their lives. Jonas is the chosen receiver. Being the receiver is a great honor because the position is very rare, but it is also a great responsiblity. The receiver holds all thememories so the Council of Elders can come to him/her for advice, t omake the right decisions for the village. If people had their own memories, they'd go insane because they wouldn't know what to do. They whole idea is that Jonas bust go through the painful experience of training to be the receiver. The Giver, the previous receiver, who gives him the memories, trains him.I liked this book fo many reasons. Lois Lowry is a veyr skilled author and Gathering Blue was one of my personal favorites. I also liked The Giver because of the down to earth characters who seem like real people. These are just a few of the reasons I liked this book. I recommend this book to anyone age 11 and up who is looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A French philosopher has said, \\"Think for yourself and let others enjoy the privilege to do so, too. There are some people who want to ban books, but others think they shouldn't be banned. Maybe some books, but not The Giver. There wasn't anything bad about the book that I could find. It's about a boy named Jonas who lives in this place called a community. In this community everyone is equal because of the rules. Everyone gets a job and goes to school. Jonas' job is to be the next receiver. He visits the old receiver daily and receives memories. Jonas and the old receiver don't like the affects of the rules, so Jonas runs away so the community will have to deal with the memories on their own. Does that sound like a book that should be banned? No, it doesn't. However, according to the American Library Association, it is one of the 100 most frequently challenged books. This is just people trying to overuse their power. Besides, aren't we supposed to be allowed to read what we want? Wouldn't that be taking away freedom of choice? Just another book gone so someone can feel good about themselves. I don't think it's right."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am a 8th grade student.

There are birthmothers, who have birth, and there child is taken away and at 1 year old, placed in a new family. Spouses are not chosen, but forced. Pills are given at the age of 13 to stop people from 'liking' one another. All children have the same birthday as each other.Lowry did a VERY good job writing this book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a remarkable story which tells what life might be like if our world was perfect, although there are some flaws in this world. The story follows the life of a singled-out individual named Jonas. Jonas was selected to be the next Receiver of Memroy for his community. His job is to contain all of the memories of the past. The memories will include everything from a peaceful picnic, to a hateful war. After his selection, Jonas begins to notice the flaws in his world and decides that there needs to be change.The book includes happiness, sorrow and loneliness as Jonas is beginning to feel separated from the rest of his community.I've heard that this novel has been banned from some states in the U.S. and personally, I think that is absurd. Most young adults can deal with another person having affectionate feelings for someone and the needle-in-the-head issue is not as big as it seems. I give this book 5 stars, making it my personal favourite novel.Braydon Mercer"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A fantastic future world creation. Young and old alike will enjoy this amazing vision. The young narrator lives in a community of the future where all citizens are selected for their jobs and trained at the age of 13. There is no choice in this society but thereby also no haves and havenots. The citizens live happily in their roles and don't question what they have or what they don't have. Because everyone, everything is the same. No one has ever known suffering or hunger or need, but in having never known it, they don't even know what it is. When he is selected as the receiver of memories, our narrator realizes that the world has not always been the way it is. And in so learning, he starts to question whether everything is always for the best.An amazing work that will make you think about society, community, risk, and choice. Will spark many deep thoughts and discussion. A great read that will definitely make you think about society, structure, and opportunity."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"One of the most unique books I ever read, The Giver really shows you how important feelings and memories really are; what humans would be without them.

I did, and I liked it. It is about the distant future when everything is colorless and the same.The main character?s name is Jonas who was selected to be Receiver of Memory. The Receiver of Memory?s job is to receive memories of pain, sadness, and agony so the people don?t have to experience them. But he also receives memories of colors, happiness, and joy so the people will have no feelings and all be the same. I recommend this book to everyone over 10.

It gets better."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this is a great book with tons of adventure and stuff likethat. it may seem a little weird and stupid at first but inthe end it is a great book. Read it!!..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is about society and humanity. The main role is played by Jonas who lives in a community with Sameness\\". Jonas thinks that he lives in a normal world and that he has a normal life in the community until his 12th birthday when he becomes a Receiver of Memories. As a Receiver of Memories he receives memories which are transmitted by the Giver. These memories contain feelings or colours. After that Jonas recognizes that the community is controlled and that everybody has to obey the rules. Nobody in the community knows what feelings or colours are, except Jonas. He cannot bear the situation that nobody has an individuality in the Community and that is the reason why he escapes in the end. You can clearly see Jonas changing in the book. At the beginning he is happy and satisfied with his life, but trough receiving memories he changes and becomes more critical and more complex. The message of this Text is to make readers aware of the world they live in. I think everybody has a right to be individual and free. And everybody can decide for himself and nobody should change this. I read the Giver only once. The themes in the Giver are interesting, but the end does not meet my expectations. Because I would like to Know what happens with Jonas in the end, when he is in front of the house. This open ending does not say something about this. Because of this I give only 3 STARS."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book the giver by Lois Lowry is about an 11-year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a community which is completely different from our society. The community is controlled by the committee of Elders. There is no fear, no pain and no war. At the Ceremony of Twelve where the 12-year-olds receive their assignments, Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories. It is the most honoured job in the community. The Giver, an old man, transmits the memories of the past to Jonas. He and the Giver are the only ones who have these memorys. Jonas receives memories of nature, of joy, pain, colors and feelings like love. After receiving all these memories, he begins to understand that life in his community is strictly ordered and manipulated. Because of this he decides to leave his community with the hope to give the members their memories back. The ending of the book is open, because we do not know if the members get their memorys back or not and if Jonas has a new, better life then.Lowry's intention is to make the readers aware of the world they live in and to warn them of an oppressive regime.The characters in the book are all the same. There are no differences between them. Jonas and the Giver are exceptions.For German people, the giver is difficult to read except you are a person who is very good at English like English teachers.The Giver is structured chronologically. The author Lois Lowry does not write anything about the setting at the beginning of the book. You are thrown into the story.At the beginning of the book it was difficult for me to read it, because there were many new English words which I do not know . First I did not like this book ,because you are thrown into the story and do not know anything about the setting. But when I read it further, it became more and more exciting. It was interesting for me to experience what it is like to live in such a community which is full of rules, manipulation and no chance to change something. It makes me think about our society and how I would respond if I were in Jonas situation. All in all I would say that The Giver is very good. I would give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What would it be like to live in a world where everything is exactly the same for everyone? \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowery is a truly extraordinary book that ponders this very question. Jonas, a young boy, never gave much thought to the way things were until the day he was chosen to be the next Receiver. The Receiver is the one person who holds all the memories of the way things were, \\"Before\\" A decision has to be made. Should he allow things to remain as they are, or should he attempt, against impossible odds, to change them.I greatly enjoyed the book. It made me realize how great it is to have a world of diversity. Pain is not always bad, it is what makes us stronger. Lowry thoroughly explored the concept of good vs. evil, and pleasure vs. pain. I recommend this book to anyone who wonders what it truly means to be your self in a \\"follow the leader\\" kind of world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book back in 5th grade, along with a few of Lowry's other books, and it still holds the same amazing results as it did that first time I read. Why? Because of the picture she paints with her words, asking you kindly to imagine her world, a terrifying world of equality. Imagine a world without colors, music, smell, anything at all that makes life enjoyable now. You're not allowed to date, not allowed to do what you want, and not allowed to have hopes and dreams of your future, as your future is already chosen for you. It's scary, yet thrilling all at the same time. To imagine this is amazing, to think of it is ingenious. The idea is purely terrifying, the idea of such an equalized world that it would take out everything that makes it worth living, makes it exciting. I fear a world like this, yet it sparks my imagination."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that The Giver was definately a good read. Although it wasn't particularly difficult to read, it was thought-provoking. The tale of a new community in \\"sameness\\" is one that I have not yet heard. It was totally original and gave new meaning and depth to my memories and of what I think of as my community and my way of life. In never having thought of the lessons learned in everyday life the way that this book proclaims them to be, I sat in a pure state of thought after completing the selection. The only books that I could think of that could possibly compare to this are Madeleine L'Engle's- A Wrinkle in Time, George Orwell's- 1984, and William Gerald Golding's- Lord of the Flies. All in which people are set apart in some way and begin taking on their own culture and ways of life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is certainly an intriguing book that would most certainly challenge the perception and knowledge of any young adult who reads it. Through a young man named Jonas' journey into self-discovery and such profound incidents as seeing colors for the first time and feeling the horrid sting of true fear and pain in a world, which is so controlled and monitored that the people around him will never understand unless he finds the strength to share it with them. Showing us that a world of ignorance and perfection is by no means what it should be and forcing readers into considering their own reality and how the world around you must always be questioned, even presenting us with parallels into our current state of the world. Hopefully showing some young readers what it means to analyze the society around them and the barriers that societies build up, which sometimes must be broken.However, this is a mature book, even though it is a middle school reading level it deals with complicated situations and emotions, which some young readers may find upsetting and confusing. This doesn't mean it isn't a great book, but best for a mature young adult. A great discussion tool and definitely a book some kids will never forget."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"'The Giver' has been my favorite book ever since 8th grade. This is the type of book that really makes you wonder about the world. Will we live like the Jetson's in the future? Will we still live on earth? Will there be life on other planets? How will our world be run? All these questions run through my mind while reading a book like this. 'The Giver' is an excellent book and is also a very easy read. I read this book when I was in 8th grade and I loved it, and now that I have read it again as a senior I still love it!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed reading The Giver. I thought that there were new twists to the story with every chapter. As Jonas goes through his training and journey to new discoveries we learn as he learns, about the community and beyond. I thought that every detail of the community life and the citizens was well thought out. I liked the fact that the society had a Utopian shell and corrupt internal workings. It showed that people go throw great lengths to take away all of the hurt and pain but it also takes away so many of the joys of life that can become complicated. I liked the deeper meaning and the overall picture that the story lays out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Any reader of any age can find something appealing in \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry. It is the tale of a young boy, Jonas, who lives in a world of sameness, free of pain, but also missing color, individuality, and true emotion. When Jonas is selected by his elders to become the next Receiver, the most honorable position in the community, he has no idea what to expect. As his training progresses, he learns of an entirely different world, of an Elsewhere, filled with pain and delight, misery and bliss.I read \\"The Giver\\" as a child, and was spell-bound by the story it told. Reading this book as a child, I was able to relate it to experiences in my own life: my own happiness, my own sorrow, my own pain. I recently read \\"The Giver\\" a second time, now as a senior in high school, and the book has taken on an entirely new meaning. I could relate the story to my own search for individuality as I head away from home and into the world.I would highly recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anyone of any age.

He is given one of the most important and respected jobs of all-the Receiver. As the Receiver, he learns what life was like before the sameness and learns to love that more than the life he knows.I have read this book for the second time and I have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It really makes a person appreciate the little differences in everyone and hope that even if peace can be achieved through sameness, we still should love one another for who we are and not for who we aren't. We should appreciate differences and learn to be much more open-minded."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was unlike any book I have ever read before.

Jonas learns that the world he has grown up in is meaningless, and he decides to turn his life around while he still can."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Aside from \\"The Giver\\" being an amazing read by means of entertainment, I was fascinated with the fact that it truly is a book for all ages. When I first read this book in 6th grade for school, I thoroughly enjoyed the basic storyline and theme of the story. I was old enough to decipher the main idea of the novel. Now, a junior in high school, I was able to appreciate and enjoy so much more while reading \\"The Giver\\" for the second time. The apparent importance of emotions, individualism, memories and even the gift of sight was revealed. I definitely recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We like the book \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry very much because it's similar to \\"our world\\". We could imagine that there will be such a world like the book explains.

It seems to us that the ending is too short and sudden."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion the story of the book was very nice to read because I, as a non-native speaker, could read it very easily. It isn't written in a very complicated way so it could be perfectly used for our Enlgish lessons.An interesting and exciting science-fiction story about a totaliterian system which a young boy tries to chance.

This is amazing for me, I am a relativly slow reader, yet this book is so in depth,I found it impossable to but it down (I finished it 10 minutes ago) I have alwys been interstes in si-fi/futeristic books.

Actually, imagine our world without any surprises or different circumstances. A life lived the same way, everday. Instead of picking what you want to be in life, the task is given to you. Jonas, the main character, lives this utopian lifestyle at the age of eleven when the book starts out. At the age of twelve he recieves his assignment or job. Except he recieves a very rare and honorable position. Scared and confused, he recieves his \\"training\\" for his new \\"selected\\" occupation and takes on a new lifestyle that others in his community are lacking. A real world!I wasn't able to read this book in school because of the english courses I was taking. Thankfully I went back and read these books in my free time, for fun. The Giver is a great and very different read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that mentions a lot of issues that are discussed by politicians and leaders everywhere. The book has an interesting perception of the future. It is a world where there is no freedom and very little pain. There is no pleasure and you do not get paid. There is no need for money in this book. You don't get to choose your job or, whom you are married to and almost every thing is decided for you.The main character is Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy, turning twelve. That is the age when you get your job. Jonas gets the job to hold every memory ever since the dawn of time. This is amazingly descriptive and gripping story that leads you through Jonas's life as the Receiver of the Memory. I personally like the book because of its writing style and the way Lois Lowry pictures the future. She also does a great job of describing every little detail in the book. This book is like science fiction and fantasy combined.This book is good. I think you should buy it because it has a lot of interesting details and issues. It also has a lot of problems that we should solve but we don't bother to. It shows the importance and value of life and our feelings. It is sad because there are so many things you cant do or don't know how to do. They are not even allowed to read or know about the past. Everything is the same there is no rain or snow or sunshine.The book has everything that is important and not important. Jonas knows no pain. Then Pow! Wow! Bam! All of a sudden he feels pain. But he also feels goodness and happiness and for the first time ever Love! I think it is kind of sad that there is no love in the community or the world he lives in. Then Jonas decides to run away.

I enjoyed both books thoroughly, and would recommend this book to people of all ages.I would also like to note that the sales rank of this book is 451."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion the book is a goodchoice for pupils. The content is about a group of people who are under the power of the \\"Elders\\".They haven't got any possibility to choose for example the work they want to.

Everyone has a purpose you can't change.It's most interesting for pupils because it's written in a simple way, but also good for adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I liked the book because it made me think.

And in the end he had succeeded"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think the Giver is an interesting book that was well described by Lois Lowry. The characters were my favorite part, due to the well description. Lois brought up many different issues in the book, such as a world with no religion, abortion, and sameness. His world has no color, and that makes you thankful for what you have. I disliked the ending, I did not like how it made me pick my own ending. I like endings told to me, where you actually know the ending and there is no confusion on what the story is suppose to mean. Overall, it is a good novel. I would reccomend this to many people."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This thought-provoking book about Jonas's perfect community is a must for students to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is an intriguing science-fiction novel that is extremely hard to put down. It is a fast, interesting read for adults, teens, and children.The society portrayed in \\"The Giver\\" removes many vital traits from the citizens that make us human. Some of these are the ability to make decisions, the ability to make mistakes and learn from them, difference and individuality, love, and to a certain extent, intelligence. The people of the society are like robots, they are \\"programmed\\" to work, raise a family, and be released. The society believes that when you are released, you go to a different place. About 3/4 of the way through the book, the reader learns what it really means to be released. The truth will seem disturbing to the reader, but for the 'people' living in the Giver's society, it is simply how life works. They do not know any other way, and therefore do not speak out against it, or for that matter, against anything else that happens.Jonas, the main character, becomes the \\"receiver of memory\\" for the society. During the story, he goes through extensive training with the Giver (the old receiver) and starts to develop into a real human. He recieves memory of the past that show things such as sunshine and love, that the society is lacking. Jonas enjoys these feelings, he even knows that from experiencing the bad memories, he learns something. Jonas starts to feel alone, just as the Giver has for many years.\\"The Giver's\\" plot is very interesting. Although some details of the society and the characters are missing, the book is well written and enjoyable.I recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anyone. I loved the book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If I could I would give this book 3.5 stars. There was some good qualities. It was also a little disturbing at times, such as the part where you get released. I also did not like the ending of the book. If you are under the age of 11 then I would not suggest this book to you. Otherwise you will probably enjoy yhis book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young boy that is growing up in a plain community. There is no color and people get released from the community for little reasons that we would find weird. Jonas is anticipating his twelfth ceremony; it is so exiting to him. He is given the task of being the new receiver. At first he is scared about it because he doesn't know what to expect of it. After a while he is more comfortable with his assignment. He sees what life use to be like and he wishes that it could go back to the old ways instead of having sameness. He wants to have color instead of black and white. There is a little baby by the name of Gabriel and he could not sleep on his own so he gets to stay with Jonas' family. One day while Gabriel was being noisy and upset Jonas accidentally gave him one of his memories and it seemed to sooth the little boy. After that he did it to calm him down and his parents would let Gabriel sleep in the room with Jonas because he would sleep easier. Jonas was sick of living in the community and he wanted to get away and find something else, something that existed else where, where they played music and had color.He learned what it really meant to get released from the community and he didn't like it at all. In the community they could not have identical twins. The smallest one of them would be released from the community. Since the baby's arm did not have big enough veins, a shot was put into it's forehead and it's body would go limp. This was going to happen to Gabriel because he would not sleep though the night. Jonas loved Gabriel, also known as Gabe and he didn't want that to happen to him. The Giver decided that he would help Jonas to get away from the community, but Jonas knew that he would never be able to come back again. They traveled for what seemed like forever and they were running out of food. The weather started to change and it got bitterly cold, with lots of snow falling down. They had to use the memory of warmth to survive. Helicopters were out looking for him and the baby but they soon gave up on it. Jonas and Gabe found a sled on top of a hill and they hopped onto it with all the strength that they had left. They flew down the hill and when they reached the bottom they found a house with lights all around. People were gathered around and there was music playing. Jonas thought that maybe he heard laughter and music from the community that he just left but he figured that it was probably just an echo from the house that they just had found.I really found that the book was very interesting to me. The only thing that I did not like was how the people were released from the community. Other than that it was good. There are not that many books that I can really get into. I would not want to live the way that they lived in the book, but they did not know any better. It was the way that things had been for a long time and they were use to it. It is definitely a book that I would recommend that people should read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A wonderful book! I recommend it to everyone.

It is about a young boy named Jonas who is never fearful because everything in his world is under control. There are no wars or choices, for Jonas lives in the Community where everyone is assigned a job and rules are strictly enforced.When Jonas reaches a certain age group called the \\"Twelves\\" he is assigned a role like no other. His job is \\"alone and apart from everyone.\\" Jonas is selected to receive special training from an elderly person called the Giver. He retreats to the Giver everyday and is called the \\"Receiver of Memories.\\" Jonas soon discovers that he is named that because the Giver teaches him about things of the past that Jonas has never heard of. These things do not exist in the Community. The Giver introduces Jonas to things such as snow, sleds, runners, colors, downhill, and many other things that we experience in normal life. It is finally time for Jonas to receive the truth. The Giver presented to him all the pain and pure pleasure of \\"real\\" life. \\"There is no turning back.\\"I find it very interesting how Lois Lowry writes of a world that doesn't exist. I can relate to Jonas who apologizes many times though he doesn't do anything to warrant this. I think I know how Jonas felt on the first day going to the Giver. Why did he, of everyone in the Twelves have to receive special training when the last child assigned this job had failed?Personally, I admire this book and can't put it down. My favorite part is when the \\"Ceremony of Twelves\\" comes around the corner. This event is when those in the group that are to turn twelve, are assigned a job they must attend to for the rest of their lives. Jonas is the last to receive a task. I felt excited for him and anxious to progress in the book. It is difficult to find a least favorite part of this book or to change it for the better. I think the book is excellent as written.I would definitely recommend The Giver to those who enjoy suspenseful stories. There are no parts where one could predict what is going to happen next. The Giver does deserve the Newberry Medal, which it has been awarded."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is written by Lois Lowry.

He's chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. He starts to have doubts about the system and finally tries to escape.It's a very imaginative book but sometimes it looses the connection to reality. It is a bit predictable, because you can imagine what the end will be like when you've read the first chapters."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in grade eight core english, and I can\`t say how glad I am that it was in the curriculum. The Giver is a very good book about a society in which everything is controlled by the gover nment. Careers are picked for you, your spouse is picked for you, and your kids are picked for you. The book focuses on Jonas, an eleven year old kid about to recieve his career assignment and begin his training. The story that unfolds is very exciting and has many twists. The writing is great and the characters are interesting. One thing to note is that you should be prepared to deal with any immature people reading this book, as their is a small part talking about the feelings children recieve during puberty, and I definitely remember a lot of giggling during the class as we went over that. That doesn\`t diminish from the story, but just beware. Also, there are some disturbing themes which might scare some people. All in all, the Giver is an amazingly great experience which is very well written and shows a neat reflection on society as it is. Make sure you don\`t miss the sequels, Gathering Blue and The Messenger, which aren\`t nearly as good, but are still enjoyable. A note to Lois Lowry: Please write another book in the series. In the rare case that Lois Lowry might actually read this, I hope she would listen and write at least two more of these amazing books. If you told me to rate The Giver out of 10 I would say 13"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this not to long ago and it made me hungry for more.

Almost a morality play, The Giver sent me on to a book of philosophy about the moral aspects and responsibilities of memory.

The writing does not measure up to even the less well known Huxley or Orwell novels. But, it is not just some dumbed-down version of a dystopian tale, or a gussied up action/adventure fantasy with a message.Rather, it is thoughtful and workmanlike attempt to introduce ya readers to dystopian literature and to literary novels of ideas. (It that regard it seems to be in the same class as Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".)

While Lowry'scharacters are both realistic and likeable and her plotintriguing, her ending leaves much to be desired as it issomewhat ambiguous. I read this book with the twelve yearold student I tutor on two separate occasions, and thoughwe both enjoyed the story, the uncertainty of its endingdisturbed him and concerned me. Lowry appears to have beeninspired by an idea pertinent to our technology dominatedsociety, yet she hesitates in addressing the point she wishesto make fully. I do recommend the book on the basis of itsmany merits, but I suggest that it be read in the classroomor with a parent so that it might be discussed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book as part of a Young Adult literature class, and the attend a lecture by Lois Lowery. I can honestly say, that I wasn't that thrilled with the book. I felt like I'd read it before. I hadn't, but I read a book that had similar ideas that was written in 1938 by Ayn Rand entitled Anthem. Anthem takes place in the future, in a world where individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. All decisions are made by committees and individualism doesn't exist. Giver is essentially about a society that has eliminated pain and strife by converting to \\"Sameness,\\" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First I would like to say that I am probably not the intended audience for this book. I read this as filler while waiting for other books to become available on my local library's overdrive site.Though I enjoyed most of the book, the conclusion left me empty. It was as if the author lost the 2nd half, or couldn't be bothered to write an epilogue. To be honest, I would have felt cheated if it had taken more than an hour to finish.Judging this as a work of science fiction for all audiences, which might be unfair, the end could have been grimmer or the climax more chaotic to add gravitas to the protagonist's final actions.Imagining myself as a 10 to 12 year old, this book would have gone back to the library after the 3rd chapter. It would not have held my interest like 1984 & Animal Farm, nor had the moral effect of the Black Cauldron series, all of which I had read by that age. Maybe the reason for the Newbery award was that it was digestible enough to be added to 4th and 5th grade reading plans."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had a class on dystopian fiction in college with one of my favorite professors, so between that and the fact that this is, essentially, a book for young adults, perhaps I am jaded. I mean, I see why so many people like it so much, but after readingBrave New World,Nineteen Eighty-Four,1985and great heaping mounds of sci-fi, I find myself thinking \\"meh.\\" I had all the big twists figured out by about page 60, and the biggest well before that.So, bottom line: if you're just getting started in the genre, this is a great place for it. If you've been in for a while, I think you can skip it, unless you have an obsession for thoroughness or just want to be able to participate in conversations about this book knowledgeably."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"One of the most amazing books I've ever read. I read it when I was in fourth grade and I have remembered the book ever since. It's a great read for many ages and it makes the reader think about what life would be like with no emotional connections or anything like that."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry was a really good book that I feel let me down at the ending. The story's main character is an 11 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community that is assigned wives ,children, homes, and jobs. As Jonas turns 12, he recieves a job different from all the others. The Reciever of Memory. Throughout the story you will learn how Jonas learns about the pain, suffering, and happiness in the past that no longer exists in his community.I really enjoyed this book up until the ending. I liked the first person point of view that was portrayed. Lois Lowry did a good job creating a community like Jonas'. I gave The Giver 3 stars because it was a good book, but i felt like the author just wanted a way to end the book fast.Although I gave this book 3 stars, I recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. It was clearly well-deserving of the Newbery gold. The plot attempts to paint a picture of a perfect world. But as the plot develops, the reader sees aspects of this society which are more characteristic of the brutal reign of the Third Reich than the understanding and compassionate community which appears on the surface. The fundamental problem with Jonas's world is that it's a \\"perfect\\" world in imperfect hands.The story introduces enough twists and turns to make it comparable to any film ever made by Alfred Hitchcock or M. Night Shyamalan. The ending of this book seems to have been hastily put together and was very lacking in terms of conclusion and continuity. In short, it leaves the reader empty-handed so-to-speak. And that was the book's primary flaw which I observed.Overall, this is easily one of the best children's books I have ever read, and I have every intention of re-reading it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a controlled society in which no one is encouraged to be different.

The well written story draws you in, and does a good job of establishing a fascinating world where pain and suffering has been removed from society. The author does a good job of supporting the premise with solid back story, and plot development. The main character is especially well done and plausible.I wasn't sure what to expect as the end of the fast moving book neared. I worried that the author may not be able to pull it all together for a satisfying ending. Without giving too much away I will say that the ending leaves some interpretation up to the reader, making this book something unique and special, if not easy to classify."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book with suspicion through out the whole book. It is sad, surprising, and shocking. It has a ending that makes you think. I would recommend this book to 12 year olds and older."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a perfect world. Everything in the world has been carefully planned and designed and carried out to make the world perfect. Each family has exactly one boy and one girl.

Jonas is eager, though perhaps a little anxious, to turn twelve and learn what his role in his society is to be.He is shocked to learn that he is to become the Receiver of Memory, the one person in the society who holds all the memories, both good and bad, happy and sad, of the past in his head. He is given special privileges: he can ask any questions he wishes of anyone and he can lie. He studies with an old man, the former Receiver of Memory, a man who asks Jonas to now call the Giver.And the Giver does given memories to Jonas: color, snow, the sky, families, pain, and - most powerfully - love.As Jonas learns the black truths behind the perfect world he lives in, he and the Giver realize it is up to them to change this perfect world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Okay, throught out this whole book I was completely struck with the concepts and ideas this book continually threw at me. I loved every single thing about the book. It is truly a fantastic read, and I would definately reccommend it! However, when I reached the end, I felt unsatisfied. Now, I have no problem with books that have sad endings, but this left so many of my questions unanswered, and all my hopes crushed. Aside from that minor set back to this riveting novel, it is amazing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a short read and listed as YA but don't let that fool you. It packs quite a punch in imagining what a world would be if everyone was the same. And if everyone was the same what would happen if you were faced with knowing the world had differences. It would be akin to describing color to the blind or music to the deaf. If we were all blind and deaf the scariest part would be seeing and hearing for the first time. Our brains would have difficulty in comprehending and processing the new stimuli. This is the dilemma our main character faces.The aspect that frustrated me was that the way this world came about was never really explained but I can forgive that because it wasn't the focus of the story.Spend a couple hours to read this little gem. It is well worth it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very good book that everyone should read.

Jonas thinks that his community is perfect. Then when Jonas becomes the new receiver that all changes.Jonas finds out that his community is far from perfect after he starts to receive memories from the Giver. So Jonas and the Giver come up with a plan to fix all of this. At the same time Gabriel is about to be released the next morning. This changes everything. Jonas then decides to take Gabriel and leave the community forever."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A few people put this book down on comparisons to 1984. Well nothing has and nothing will touch 1984,that's for sure. But that aside this is a good book, it's nicely written.What grabbed me about the story is the lack of thought within the community. The communist lifestyle they lead restricts free thought and one has only a few objectives which never change throughout your life, it seems bleak. But the amazing or crazy thing is no-one cares, everyone basically gets on with things in a peaceful manner.In comparing this book to the present day of Western society we would presume we have more freedom, and in a sense we do. But really the freedoms most people have today are for material things. We have freedom to choose which TV you want to buy, hundreds of TV channels to choose from, supermarkets have foods from all corners of the worldand many types of fast food restaurants etc. This has no spiritual meaning what so ever, it's just stuff. Some parts of the world still live within the rules of nature and with limited resources.Do we have a choice on the way we want our governments to manage us? Well as far as I'm concerned, no!!! We will consume until there is nothing left to consume.The Giver looks at a p&ograve;osible other life, which seems more sustainable but less exciting. We in the West are at the other end of the scale as we are not living sustainable lives. We also live in a world of debt where if you collected all the money there is in the world we still couldn't pay of the debt!!!We do have one thing in common with the book and that is that we both are leading scary lives, one of consumption and one of near minimal consumption. It makes you think. This is the sign of a good book, there may be better out there but I would def recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Outstanding book! What a concept, this world of Sameness. No hills, no sunshine, no rain, no snow.. No love, or other emotions we experience on a daily basis. A woman and man are paired together, they get each one boy and one girl.. job assignments.. Another big one is NO color..What happens if you should get \\"released\\"? Lots of questions will be answered in this book.When you are a \\"twelve\\" you get your job assignments. Jonas is so excited, but at the ceremony he is passed over. At first he is embarrassed but then he gets the greatest honor of all. To be a \\"receiver\\". Jonas has no clue what that is about, but what it is is, the \\"receiver\\" gets all the memories, good and bad and keeps them so that if the community has a question, they can go to the receiver and see if their idea is a good or bad one, because they know everything about why they made the rules the way they are, because of pain, hurt etc.I hope I can explain it half as good as the book does. LOVED this story. I won't say any more, but if you haven't read this book YET, order it RIGHT now! You won't want to put it down! I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Review from class of 2017 and class of 2018 of the GISSVJannikThe book \\"The Giver\\" is a very well written novel. It has a very interesting futuristic setting. If you start reading the book you will probably find the story strange. Everything in this community is controlled and you have no free choice, because the community decides for you. For Example the Community decides you're job, you're wife and children. I think that it's a very interesting lifestyle. Also, once you start reading it's very hard to stop reading, because the book is so fascinating and the lifestyle is so different to ours that you just want to learn more about the lifestyle. When I finished reading a chapter I wanted to start reading the next, because each chapter has a very open ending. The end is also open and it's very easy to keep imagining the story in a lot of different ways. Like he dies freezing to death and hallucinates a lot or goes into a Christmas town and lives very happy.MarcelaI thought \\"The Giver\\" was a good book. Jonas lives in a perfect world. There is no war, or pain. The people there don't have their own choice. Everything is in order and the choices are made by the Elders. Elders are elderly people who decide what job you get, who you marry, and a lot of other things. I liked it because it had a lot of fantasy and it is set in the future. There were a lot of different feelings. Sometimes the book was sad, sometimes it was happy or exciting. Also, you can follow the book very well. The chapters have open endings. So sometimes when you finish a chapter you just want to read on.TobiThe Giver-I like Jonas's community very much, because how Louis Lowry explained the town and the way how they live there. She made the book like it is a real story. Second thing that I liked was the trip of Jonas, because you could feel the suspense of the writing. I also loved Gabriel, because he was like a real child in our \\"community\\". I think the receiving memories by putting the hand on the back is very interesting, because you can't just put a hand on the back and give a memory away, but it makes the whole community more interesting, so you want to know more about special things that they do. I don't like the ending, because the author leaves it open, so we don't know what happens with Jonas and Gabe. Also I don't like how they get released, because I think that is not nice and it is also not very human.MiriamThe Giver is a great book, because it is a fantasy book and I like those books. My favorite parts in this book are: When the apple changed from grey to red and Fiona's hair also changed. And when the Giver gave the memory of snow to Jonas. I liked this part, because the memory consisted over a lot of feelings and the writer described this part in more detail than others. What I think was exciting too, was when we found out that a release isn't nice and good. That the people are killed. It was really scary! I also like this book, since it depicts another idea for a world. They have strict rules and you can't choose your partner for life and they mustn't have kids. I don't want this to happen in our world, but it's a good idea for a book. It's also interesting that they don't have feelings and they can't see colors. And nobody is supposed to die in a natural way. In their community it is also different that the elders chose the jobs for you, which but fits to you. The Giver is good because, nobody has to starve and everybody has a home and a family. For all the people, who love fantasy and exciting books, the Giver is perfect. But to those people who want to have a real story it wait fit.EricOverall I liked the book The Giver, although I didn't like the end. There are some points of tension, where something unexpected happens, which I like. Another reason why I liked the book, is because of its setting in the future, where people do everything a lot differently than we do; similar to a science-fiction book. I also like how Jonas and the Giver move in an act of rebellion against the communities, which adds suspense to the book. Although some parts of the book can be a bit confusing at times, through this you always want to know what is going to happen next, so you always want to keep reading. I didn't like the end though, because one of the main characters almost died. I am also not a fan of open endings; I don't like to speculate on what can happen. It was a good book, which I can recommend, but I would not read it again, like I do with my favorite books.MaxI like the book \\"The Giver\\". I like it because it is exciting. I also like the book because it is very well described. It is also good to read. It is exciting especially when Jonas plans his escape. It is exciting because the author makes it suspenseful. Then when Jonas also takes Gabe I was totally surprised. It is very well described because Lois Lowry is a great author. She has written many books. It is fun to read. When the book got really exciting I could not put it down. In conclusion I think the book \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a great book because it is exciting, very well described and fun to read.PatrickI like the book \\"the Giver \\" because it is interesting to read and it has a lot of fun parts, for example, when Jonas gets assigned \\"The Receiver of Memories\\" in that time everything is about him and he is not the same anymore. From that moment on he isn't the same and sameness doesn't count for him anymore. I also liked the part when Jonas and Gabe escaped from the community. It is very serious and exciting because Jonas just tries to get away from the community. The only thing that I didn't like was that the book had an open ending.Frederik:\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a story about a community, where everyone is the same, except for small differences. Every year they have ceremonies. At the ages 1-12 they have to go on a stage and at age 12 they get a job. This story starts when a boy is chosen for a special job. Most decisions are made by a group of people. It's an interesting utopian novel. It tells us of the twelfth's year of the boy's life. He is the only person who knows about us, and the past. The rest thinks only now exists. In it all people are about the same. The community, where the boy is born, can control almost the whole nature. It is an interesting way of thinking about the future world, if we live on another planet, or control nature itself. He is alone except for \\"the Giver\\", who trains him. Enjoy reading this novel.Sabrina:Rating: 4 Stars out of 5Overall, I think that this book was really great. I love books that make me need to think about it so if you love that too, this is a great book for you. Without telling you too much about the book, I'll try to tell you about some of my favorite parts. When you start reading, you will meet the community. It is an abnormal place to live with strange and strict rules. The most important rule is the rule of sameness. Same bikes, houses, clothes, and more. They don't want anyone who's different in their community. If you are born a twin, too bad. If you are the lighter one, you die (SPOILER). If you are born disabled, too bad. You die. If you get really sick, chances are, you die. So right now, this book probably sounds pretty spooky but let me just tell you it is extremely interesting! The main characters name is Jonas and he is a little different than everybody else. He has gray eyes but most people don't. He has a special ability to \\"see beyond\\". When you turn 12 in the community, you are given a lifelong job. If you don't like it, you might be able to get a new one but you're pretty much stuck with it. A group of old men and women, called the Elders, watch you for a year and pick the perfect job for you. Jonas gets a very powerful and highly honored job. He seems to like it but then again, because of the rule of sameness, you don't have feelings so we'll never know. He \\"tolerates\\" the man he works for/with and becomes friends with him. They soon realize that the community is not the place for Jonas. He wants to change things. Lastly, he has an elaborate plan to get out. Read for yourself to see if it works out. The only thing I thought was not so great about this book was that I found some things a little confusing. After reading further into the book, I started to understand the concept more but some parts are definitely tough to understand.Moritz:I think that \\"The Giver\\" is an exciting book telling how other communities or countries may be organized. The book transferred me into a completely new world, which fascinated and frightened me. Specifically the relationship between children and parents interested me because children are assigned and not raised. Children and parents do not truly love each other, but still live well together. Furthermore some scenes just came out of the blue and startled me, for example discovering that Jonas's father was killing the small babies when releasing them. Some of the surprising scenes like where Jonas found out that Gabe was going to die, but his parents were still happy, made \\"The Giver\\" a great read. If I had to rate this book I would give it four and a half stars on one hand for the thought-provoking story and the open ending. I strongly recommend reading the book \\"The Giver\\".JohannesI think that \\"The Giver\\" was a good book. Why do I think so, you ask? Well, firstly, I enjoyed reading it as the Author was great at describing passages so that you go the feel of actually being there. Additionally, Lois Lowry put a lot of thought into the book. While this is hard to explain, it seemed to me how well thought out the community - and thus the book - was. Finally, I really liked the idea of the book - that there were people living by other standards somewhere out there.... Yes, I would recommend this book.Erin and Max:In \\"The Giver'' by Lois Lowry a young child about 12 years old named Jonas is part of a society where there are no differences. He thinks this is normal until the day comes, where he becomes the \\"Receiver''. The Receiver is a very special person, because he is the apprentice of the \\"Giver''. The Giver is a person who lives in a world like you and I. He knows colors, snow, sleds, hills... And Jonas is supposed to become the Giver. While he is the Receiver he becomes several friends, Gabriel (Which is a little baby) and The Giver also becomes a close friend. Therefore Jonas becomes all the memories and the Giver loses all the memories. He can not see colors anymore, he doesn't remember snow!Jonas does not like this. So he starts a journey to save the Memories of the Giver. At the end Jonas is on a sled riding down a hill.We think that the story has a good outline, but it can be a bit better. It also makes sense how all the events are in order. The book has an open ending which can be positive and negative. The positive side is that it makes the reader eager to read the sequel or eager to read other books that are similar (Hunger Games; by Suzanne Collins)Another positive Aspect about this book is, this book has very easy vocabulary and is easy to read. So it is great for school grades four to seven. The Giver is also very entertaining because it always brings excitement in the book, for example when Jonas becomes a twelve they skip him at the ceremony so you want to keep on reading the book.What really was a bummer is that it had a open-ending, even though it was good in a way, it frustrated us that we couldn't know what happens to Jonas. And the sequel only slightly hints what happens to Jonas and Gabriel, which makes it very frustrating. Also what was negative is that some parts are inappropriate, for example when the Elders become released (killed) it can give children the wrong idea by making them think that violence is the way to punish someone. Also what was not so good a lot of parts where boring, e.g. there would be only a dialogue between several people, which made it very boring. However, we definitely recommend this book! Even though it seems like this book has more negative aspects, this book is outstanding! You can never let go of this book when you start reading. We recommend this book for grades four to seven. Due to the bad talk, and the vocabulary is age appropriate for grades four to seven.Max:The Book the Giver by Lois Lowry is a book that takes place in a Utopian world where everyone is the same. This book is personally very exciting because it is about a boy named Jonas who thinks that he lives in a normal world but then when he gets his job as memory receiver he notices that everybody in his community is the same as everybody else (sameness) and that the people who are very different get \\"released\\" (death by a Shot). But in the End Jonas decides to change all of that by running away from the community with a Baby that is supposed to be released and therefore leaving all his memories that he collected in the past Year behind. If you like this book you should check out \\"The Hunger games\\" by Suzanne Collins.Caroline:The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy who lives in a community where everyone is the same. The main character, called Jonas, learns how life can be difficult, even if other people choose a life for you. It shows how one can change completely and how bad sameness (sameness means that everything is the same)can be. The book is a fun learning experience for those who wish to know what it is like in a different world. I personally think that the book is horrible and good. It is horrible because people in the community get released (released = death by the needle). Everyone sees in black-and-white, another bad aspect about sameness. At the end, everyone is unsure of what happens next (I guess that's why Lois Lowry wrote three books). On the contrary, there are no homeless people because other people choose a job for you. People do not have to worry about money, because everyone has whatever they need.Aryan:I think the book was pretty good but weird because they for example have to wear tunics or they have to share their feelings every evening after dinner. It was very interesting but one negative thing I have is that there is not a real ending that's why I don't like the book as much . Something else that was very good was that there are many topics to discuss. What I have heard is that The Giver is not banned from schools; so many schools read it so that's what I also like because I would not have known this book to be banned from schools. What I also think is weird is because the giver can give his feelings to Jonas (main character) another character in the book. I would recommend this book to people of all ages who like science fiction.Julia:I think the book is okay... I mean, it contains many topics to discuss both philosophically and in comparison with our normal life. The big negative aspect is that Lois Lowry unintentionally includes a horrible action that happened before in history (Euthanasia, which happened in Germany during World War II). Also, it has an open ending, which i find a bit confusing, but that's just my perspective. Aside from those facts, I would recommend it if you enjoy discussing things, especially for 7th or 8th graders or their teachers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver has to be one of the best books I've ever read. So let me tell you this was an incredible book! I too write stories and from what has been displayed in this one- oh boy! It's this place it takes you to in your mind-a place in which you feel you actually belong (even though the place they take you to in this book is way past bizzare). If it's a book you have to read for school or a club, then they've chosen wisely."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book kept me glued to my seat and glued to the pages.I never wanted the ending to come. This book is about a boy who grows up in a black and white world. This world is cut off from everything and is also protected from everything. Even weather. This boy starts seeing colors and is chosen by the giver to recieve lessons on what the world used to be like. He is now thrown into an adventure he will never forget. This book will also throw you into a reading experience you will never forget."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a strange town. One where this is about a rule for anything you do. (examples: you can't ride a bike until you're a 9. You can't be rude, or ask a question that might fall under rudeness.) In this town you aren't 9 yrs old, you're a 9. That's how it is with every age. Every year a ceremony is held for each age. Every year you may get something that changes you a little. But the ceremony of Twelves is the most important of them all. It is when the council tells each twelve what he is to do for his occupation. The council watches every child until the age of twelve to see what job they think fits each individual best. When Jonas is chosen as the town's new giver, he is frightened. What if he messes up like another young person did several years ago. This job is told to come with lots of pain. But, Jonas sees none when he comes to his first meetings. Then he learns of pain he has never known of, thought of, or could have ever possibly imagined. It is a struggle for Jonas. One he could have never thought up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This Book was probably my all time favorite! Very intriguing! The Giver plays with your imagination and fondles with reality. Louis Lowry is an excellent role model for young inspiring writers! A supurb book choice for all ages! It is so amazingly well written, so thought provoking! It is imaginitive and creative! A masterpiece! Read this book and you won't regret it. You really attach to the characters. Lowry really knows how to pull emotional strings. This book is a triumph! It was a joy to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In lang. Arts i got a e my first semester but i got a 85% (B)in the second semester, because it was all about the giver! Most of my class did not even really read the book, but I did! It was amazing, it held my attention from page to page and from chapter to chapter. It is a shame that some of my peers did not bother to read this intestering book, I think it is a MASTERPIECE! As you can tell it is a very good book. I enjoyed reading it very much. Lois Lowry is amazing. Keep making great stories."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was such a good book! I never thought it would be that hard to take a break from reading it.

I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was the best book Ihave ever read. It was imaginative and thought provoking.

Congradulations, Lois, you've created gold."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was first introduced to this book in eighth grade, where my English teacher read it to the class, one chapter a day. I loved it then, but once I read it again on my own, I was hooked. I just graduated high school, and I've lost count of how many times I've read The Giver. Every time I read it, I just can't put it down. The story is beautifully written, and the lifestyle introduced is so intriguing and unique. This is definitely one of the most interesting and touching books I have ever read. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I sat down on a long car ride deciding to read this book rather than be bored (which is what I expected to become reading the book or not). But I was NOT bored. The book was so astounding. It makes you feel sad to think of such a community ever existing. And even the people themselves being so brain-washed and ignorant to know how their &quot;perfect life&quot; is so controlled is a scary thought. I can read this book again and again. I definitely recommend The Giver to any reader, no matter what age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This well-crafted novel purports to be a young reader's novel, but I cannot imagine children or even teenagers getting as much meaning out of it as an adult. This is unequivocally one of the best pieces of literature of the 20th century. This novel constantly challenges the reader to adjust his perception of what is real and what is right. It is definitely a page-turner, full of unexpected twists that force you to readjust the way you interpret circumstances. The underlying issues --- gritty and complex as they are --- invite, in fact compel, further thought. Deep thought. I wanted to talk about this book, as I was reading it and afterwards. That, to me, is the signature of a classic; it makes me think during and well beyond the course of my reading. It might even impact my life. I highly recommend this book for all ages. If you read it in middle school, reread it now. As an adult, you will appreciate it on a whole different level."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"we read this past year in english class. i fell head over bum for this book. this is an amazing read(even tho it was forced up pon us by a teacher!) in a book store i would have tottaly looked past this book because i normaly wont read this kinda book, but even if your not into mistory books, this is one that is written so well that it really wont matter what u like to read. its just that good. the story line is amazing and you really conect with jonas. hes a brave soul. we should have more people in this world like him. it would sherly make this big bad world a better place."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I was unsure I would like this book when I 1st got it. Because I am not really a big fan of \\"classics\\" but, this book is a Utopian, for Young Adult readers. It met all my expectations. I loved this book. I really likes Jonas. His determination, drive, his heart. He had courage, even though he wasn't given that memory from The Giver. He, had courage I could never imagine.My heart broke when he found out what the release was. It was at that time, when his father said that Gabe would be released that I knew in my heart, that Jonas would not let that happen to that sweet baby, with the light eyes!I had hope for Jonas. This book is full of hope. It makes you cherish your own memories. Because the life that Jonas lived in, only sameness was filled in it. No love, No hope, everything was the .. same.In the end, Jonas has love, and he doesn't have to worry about hiding it anymore. For I believe that he will be ok, safe, happy and loved! He will love. He loves Gabe.This novel was a win for me. Please if you haven't read it. Read it. It is a fast read too. So if you have a read a thon coming up, add The Giver to your list. Add it to you TBR list anyways!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The main character here, Jonas, proved his talents and became the new receiver- in training. The giver and the receiver are kind of a cell, where you keep all the memories. The world, (described in this book), is nothing. No taste, no colors, no feelings, no emotions, no changes, but the same dull life of living with the rule.Through his trainings, he discovered many delights and pains, for that he never experienced it before. In addition, he was told why the world was so dull, full of mechanic voices meaning nothing. The committee had changed the world. The climate made the crops difficult to grow and the raw landscape made them almost impossible to live. So they used climate change, bulldozers to make everything easy and simple. After taking the nature into control, it was said that the committee took all emotions, pains, joys and selected a person to hold all those \\"dangerous\\" memories themselves- The Giver.Jonas, after a year, sets his mind of returning the emotions to the numb world, and carefully plans his move. When Jonas escapes, the Giver will let go of all his memories to let people FEEL the world. However, Jonas took a young child named Gabriel and the escape was delayed. While the escape, Jonas experienced the real, unchanged world, and he had memories himself. The REAL memories he experienced instead of transferred. At the end, Jonas finds his destination, and slides to what it may be a real world, or elsewhere.I think we should be thoughtful about our lives and enjoy it well. Who knows? Maybe our future will be the same as the people in the Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love books about a dysopian society, and this may be one of my favorite books next to Hunger Games. This book is thought provoking and shows what can go wrong when a Society strives to make everything the same, without any hurt, loss, and tries to protect a human being from everything including the good and the bad experiences in life. I truly LOVE this book. It's not long, but the words the author uses are so powerful and commanding. I would recommend this to everyone, especially those who love books about the future. It shows the importance of giving people the freedom to make their own choices, even if those choices sometimes cause pain or maybe the wrong choices. At least they have freedom."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I felt obligated to read The Giver, since I'd heard so much about it from friends who teach middle school English, I'd read about it in a number of scholarly articles about Young Adult literature, and it seems to be rising to the level of a YA classic. It's relatively brief, and it's a very quick read, and it seems almost purposely designed to be taught as a middle school YA novel. The futuristic setting in which everyone exists under a doctrine of Sameness in a socially engineered society and children's future occupations are determined for them at the age of 12 by a council of Elders, along with the absence of real emotions, colors, and memories clearly telegraphs a number of \\"Important Themes\\" that provide very rich fodder for trenchant analysis in middle school literature classrooms. Now, I'm not denying the value of this novel as a staple of 7th and 8th grade literature curricula--if I were still teaching secondary English, I could certainly see myself including this in my school's curriculum. In my opinion, however, the best YA novels are--first and foremost--good novels that will also appeal to young adults (e.g., any of the Harry Potter novels). Genre fiction definitely has its place, but I suspect that most young adults who read this novel read it because it's assigned to them in class and not because it has any kind of intrinsic appeal."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I picked this book up to read because I had heard it is a wonderful dystopian novel. It definitely was a great, if disturbing, read. I am very pleased that I finally got around to reading it.Jonas was born into a world were couples are perfectly matched and each are given one boy and one girl. The children are given medication starting at twelve years old that stifles any emotional urges and then are placed in work positions most appropriate to their disposition. Jonas is different though, no one can guess what work he will be placed in. Then he finds out that he will be the society's new Receiver of Memory; the one person in society who doesn't have to follow any of the rules and is responsible for the memories of humanity. The old man who give Jonas these memories is forced to revel dangerous truths about their society to Jonas, they are truths that are truly stunning.This was a wonderful book. It was easy to read and very well set up, the whole time you suspect that things aren't quite right but when the truth is revealed it is stunning. Much of the book reminded me of Huxley'sBrave New World. Jonas is an excellent character and watching him transition from one of the ignorant masses to an enlightened individual is both painful and fascinating.This is a short book, but it packs a lot of story and that story has a truly powerful punch to it. I found my self stunned and almost in tears at parts; so while this was not necessarily an easy read, it was definitely a thought-evoking and memorable one. I zipped through it quickly and found it very hard to put down. It is hard to talk about more of the plot without giving things away; but if you find dystopians fascinating and are intrigued by humans adopting sameness for safety you will find this book wonderful.My least favorite part of the book was the very end, which is incredibly ambiguous. As a reader you know what probably happens, but you are hoping something else actually happened.Overall this was just an absolutely fascinating read. It is creative and engaging and impossible to put down. It does pull some things from Huxley's aBrave New World. If you like this book or are looking for other excellent young adult dystopian reads I recommend the following:Divergent (Divergent Trilogy)by Veronica Roth,Matchedby Ally Condie,The Hunger Gamesby Suzanne Collins, andWither (The Chemical Garden Trilogy)by Lauren DeStefano."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is actually, unbeknownst to me prior to my reading it, a dystopian novel about the coming of age and the coming to wisdom and understanding of a young boy in a futuristic society. A book I missed reading in school, but which my children were exposed to in my own childrens' time, this is somewhat dated in spots, I felt, but held the same sort of message that we hear and see in our own world and society today through a plethora of young adult literature. That alone makes it worthy of reading!It's a small book, but every page is profound. Lois Lowry knows how to write exactly like my Rhetoric professor wanted us to write...with precision and acuracy. Her every word has a purpose and meaning. And, in that instance, we discover that we need to pay attention, acutely, to what she's telling us.This is a serious book with a warning for young and old, alike.I found it most poignant that Ms Lowry wrote \\"The Giver\\" for young people at their pivitol age. It's a book that is meant to make them consider the society they are apart of without a doubt, but it's also meant to make them question the world and the ways of life they've taken for granted. It hopes, it seems, to help them shed the scales from their eyes and take the plugs from their ears...to have the courage to rise up again the norm. For that alone, I found it worthy of the Newberry Prize.It seems to me that as adults we fear young people. We want to corral them, to keep them in check, to make sure they don't skate board near the Library. There's alot about them that reeks of uncontrollable power and unhinged disaster. There's impulse on edge, and the half-here-and-half-there sense of what's going to really damage their lives and the lives around them, and what's not. Because of this, teens and pre-teens have this magical quality to them...this freshness of vision coupled with this wildness of vision like the boys in \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" like those vampires and psychics and witches they \\"wanna be\\" in the YA novels.In \\"The Giver\\" we see such power in the young protagonist. He is pent up and on the verge of destruction in several instances. We see him risk breaking serious rules only to see him pull back and turn to the side of wisdom to protect those he loves. This is the quality that Lois Lowry is telling the young to emulate, this is the hidden treasure that the Giver has to offer~this potential to create a new system lovingly, or simply to destroy mindlessly.Ms Lowry acknowledges the terrible strength and power of the young adult to be victorious or to vanquish and offers an instruction of vision, values and valor. In a society where everything is ordered, equal, peaceful and happy...life is not valued, and people deemed less than fit for society are done away with like old newspaper.\\"The Giver\\" is a book worthy of literary and humanitarian awards, and it's a book worthy of being the classic it's become.I strongly recommend \\"The Giver\\" to everyone, young and old, who hasn't already read it...and even to those who have. It's a good time to reread this book. It's an especially good time to read it...Deborah/TheBookishDame"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm a big fan of YA lit, and friends have been telling me for years - oh, you've got to read The Giver! Well, finally I did, and man, I could not put it down. Jonas lives in a dystopian society, and at the age if 12, people in his society are given their adult job, and begin training for their role.Well, Jonas gets the unhappy and unexpected position of The Giver. He's to receive all the memories from the past world from the one man who still holds them all. Yes, the lucky Jonas gets to fully experience lethal war wounds along with Christmas day... How that impacts Jonas' life in the community is the story.One warning - it doesn't properly end - the author sort of cuts it off in an exciting point and we never quite find out what happens. If you're cool with ambiguous endings - this is a very engaging YA book, even for 30-year-olds."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a highly acclaimed piece of adolescent literature by the author Lois Lowry depicting the life of Jonas, a 12 year old boy living in an enclosed society. The setting appears to be a perfectly controlled environment in which all aspects of life are chosen and managed for the characters. Although the community seems to be a utopia in its appearance of perfection and sameness, Jonas quickly realizes the sacrifices which have been made to obtain such an illusion.Even though the main character of this book is 12 years old and the book is only 208 pages long, the subject content makes this book appropriate for a wide range of grades and adolescent students. I personally believe that both middle and high school students (as well as adults) would find this book intriguing and thought-provoking, enabling stimulating discussions. The book provides students with numerous critical thinking opportunities, including topics on pain, memories, emotions, knowledge, freedom v. security & peace, euthanasia, diversity, and the price of perfection. Social Studies teachers could use this text to talk with students about systems of governments, such as socialism and capitalism, along with potential pitfalls when people relinquish power to the government for concessions. English teachers could make text to text connections with other books featuring dystopias such as The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins, Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, and Animal Farm and 1984 by George Orwell.Teachers should be aware that potentially controversial topics for younger adolescents, including euthanasia and sexual development, (sexual dreams being referred to as \\"stirrings\\") are portrayed in the The Giver. Overall though, The Giver has no foul language or references to drinking, drugs, or alcohol and only limited reference to sexual matters. It is an excellent and engaging book for adolescent students who are ready for riveting discussions and powerful lessons."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was very good book.

Lois Lowry has potrayed the struggle in Jonas's life excellently. At the same time Lowry adds some parts to smile at, so the story will not be a full drama. Many parts also are hair raising and suspenseful. By far, I would say the Lois Lowry has written this book very well, with a surprise ending and all. Although, it is not fully appropriate for children under 8 or 9. I would recommend it to those who are above 8 or 9 years old. It was the best book I've ever read, and I plan to read more of her books.

The book teaches us all what a perfect world would be like.It really did not suprise me either because there were alot of people upset in this.Well, thats my thought. No disrespect to anybody."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is entertaining. It makes you think about moral and philosophical questions. However I feel that many of the characters' personalities were not explored enough. The ending also left too many loose ends and did not give enough closure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was written in a very interesting way. The utopian society in this book gives the book an eerie sense to it. What I found to be the most interesting thing was how it explained to the reader what would happen if the society was broken and what the &quot;chain-reaction&quot; of the consequences would be. Each chapter that I read gave me a sense that something was going to happen and normally I was right. The main character, Jonas, seemed to me to be a rebel throughout the entire book and was very descriptive in the way he saw his world. I loved how the community was described in a way to tell us how the days would pass in the utopian society. It explained to us how people reacted toward one another and how each family would go about their daily routines and what else that the family would do that our families normally don't."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I was in fourth grade, this book was read to me by my English teacher. I liked it then, but couldn't really get into it. I understood it, but I just couldn't grasp the emotions needed to fully enjoy the book. Now, in the 8th grade, we are reading it for an assignment. I have only 3 words--I LOVE IT!! We were assigned to read 1 chapter each night. I finished the book in less than 2 days. Once you pick it up, it's glued to your hands until you finish it, and then the basic idea is glued to your mind forever. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of 12 or 13. Anyone under these ages simply would not be able to understand the content of the book fully. All of the emotions that Jonas is feeling, the conflict that is brought about by &quot;sameness&quot;--you HAVE to be able to understand these concepts to enjoy the book. I strongly recommend this book. And to Lois Lowry--keep up the great work!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is vividly descriptive and very imaginative.

But the ending is a bit confusing to some people so READ SLOWLY and THINK about it. (If that's not too hard for you.) I finished this book in the evening when the electricity was out in the house, so even with the very dim light outside I had to stay out there, leaning against the balcony railing, and finish it. My mom kept telling me to come inside, you'll ruin your eyes, but I could NOT put it down. I'd just like to comment on another review, which said this book was like a cross between &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and &quot;The Truman Show&quot;....what?? Okay, it's a bit similar in ways, but it didn't really remind me of those movies. What I'm trying to say is: those movies are not really very similar to the book but if you like that sort of thing (I do), read The Giver anyway. Also highly recommended: Number the Stars (for ages 11-14) and The Golden Compass (for ages 13-113)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A real interesting and suspensful ride into your imagination. A real enjoyable book for pre-teens and teens. A well wrighten book. It sure deserves the John*Newberry*Medal. The bigging is a little on the boring side, but it starts to get better and better during the book. Once u get a hold of the book u won't wan't to put it down for anything. that's why I give it 5 stars. It's what it deserves. 5 stars for the great story called The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love the way Lois Lowry describes everything so carefully. Her ideas were wonderfully displayed! Recommended for anyone with an imagination and an open mind."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Teenagers these days are currupted to think that good books hve high-flying action and overly dramatic characters. While these can make a good story, a true masterpeice is something more. I read this book in the sixth grade (last year), and adored it. Why? It made me think. It made me ask myself what it really means to be human, and if a socialist society is really what as good as it looks. It kind of reminds me of WALL-E in the sense the people are surviving, but not truly living. Those who rate the book as boring don't seem to get the book at all. It's not the \\"Twilight\\" type, but it's not supossed to be. It's much better because you need to actually need to use *gasp* intelligence to understand it. If you read it for only the story, yes, it won't be to amazing. But the stylistic writing and messages it portrays are what make it so good. Remember my comparison to WALL-E? One of the most used arguments against that excellent movie is the lack of diolougue and that it is also boring. Sure, it may be easier to watch, say, Kung Fu Panda, but WALL-E is a genuinly better movie because it's not meant to be easy. It's meant to make you think. And that is what The Giver is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I say this book is a keeper, but I just keep giving it away. This is a great story that begs to be shared and discussed at length. I won't go into details about the plot, the characters, etc..because it's all been done before. My two cents is to say that this book is a gem because it encourages children to think. The Giver shines as an example of reader participation. You do not complacently read this book it forces you take a view, to figure it out, and to come to a conclusion.That's why its a great story and one your teen should be encouraged to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in the seventh grade and totally overlooked its importance. I only read it because my teacher made me. Well I joined a book club and this was the first book on our list. I went to the library and picked it up. When I got home I opened the book and finished it in a matter of hours.I must say this book is amazing. A utopian society absent of color, books, animals, and sex. EEekkk!!! I can't say I could live in a world like that. The story of the giver debunks any chance of humans living in a utopian society. I believe that Lois Lowry predicted accurately that in order to live in a world of peace we would have to live in a world filled with sameness.Definitely a good read, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Children shouldn't be the only readers of Lois Lowry's classic best selling novel. The fact that there are over 3,000 reviews tells something. The book is a must read in schools and now I know why. The book starts off with Jonah, a boy who will be twelve years old, and be given responsibilities beyond his imagination.Jonas and his family live in a world where there are no feelings, no colors, no imagination, no creativity, no planning, and a book of rules which I wished went with it.Jonas is chosen as the one to be the receiver and he goes to the elder man who is known as the Giver. The book reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 and a cultish scenario.I would recommend parents reading this book with their children and they will have a lively, interesting discussion to broaden their own minds and communicate with each other. This book can bring both adults and children together in appreciation for the choices that we have and can make in our world.I would have given it five stars but I think that the author could have used useful tools like explaining the book of rules, maps, and illustrations to help envision this strange environment but still it's an excellent book and I would definitely teach it in the schools.This book will make you appreciate life a little more and even the littlest things. A movie is in the works."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If you enjoy anything that has to do with morality within humanity, you should read this book. It makes one think of what life may really be like in the future, and also what could happen in our lifetime. It was written for children, but I am an adult, and have many adult friends who also enjoyed this book for it's moral questioning."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was great for a few reasons...Theme - a utopian society will always be relevant and always be thought provoking. Especially when its well written like The Giver is. I find the theme to be incredibly interesting, especially since I have only ever read one other similar novel which was 1984.Size and syle - It was short, very easy to read and follow. The thing I liked about it is that even though its technically a young adult novel, it can be read by all ages.The characters were interesting. The plot was fast paced and engaging.Overall, its a must read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found the book intriquing, perhaps a little rushed towards the end, but intriquing and thoughtful.A young boy called Jonas reaches his twelfth birthday and is assigned the job to be the community's receiver of memory, the one person in the community who feels and remembers. What he discovers about his life and his home will change him forever.This book fully explores the idea that for humanity to be at peace, then certain freedoms must be sacrificed. In the community, diversity is not marked upon for fear of upsetting others, people are assigned their partners and children are produced by breeding mothers and adopted by the 'right' family. Pain is unknown and so is hunger, emotions are not experienced and sex is unheard of. When the aged reach a certain age they are 'released' from the community, as are the punier half of twins and babies that do not develop properly.Lois Lowry has created a world to think about. What if we could all live together happily, politely? Lots of people think we can, but as we are all different could we. Would we have to take those basic of human emotions and suppress them beneath drugs and courtesy? Would we stop hunger by the simple expedient of choosing how many could procreate and who would live once they're done. Would we stop seeing the differences between ourselves by denying them? And is this society unrealistic? I think with the right circumstances, we could be there and that's what makes it frightening.An excellent book by an excellent author."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a self-contained community lives eleven-year-old Jonas. This community differs from real life settings. Citizens receive primary duties and adhere to community's regulations. Transgressors are chastised regardless of their age. There is uniformity in everything, from appearance to experience. Freedom does not exist because no one is aware of it. Religion is also nonexistent yet everyone lives in harmony because there is only one group called \\"the elders\\" who decide what is right and wrong; what is good and evil. Every child who turns twelve acquires a vocation suitable to his or her capacity and personality. Upon reaching the age of twelve, Jonas is assigned the single most important role, the giver. However, during his training Jonas discovers that outside the community there is life completely discordant from what he is exposed to. That people in this kind of life experience all sorts of emotions foreign to him. Finally, Jonas makes sudden decision to escape.This is a valued reading for youths and adults as well. The repercussion of Jonas' escape is a healthy fodder for dialogue between parent and child. As part of his Language Arts project, my son has to make a movie poster based on a particular story. Co-incidentally, he picked up this book. Not only he and Jonas are the same age, they also have similar disposition."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book sets the stage for a utopian society, and it's very believable. Who's to say that this couldn't really happen sometime in the future? However, what I really liked about this book, is that once Jonas found himself, he wasn't afraid to take action and stand up for what he knew was right. Loved it. The first time I read it was the sixth grade, and I still enjoy it. It's one of my favorite books of all time, it's a relatively quick read for an adult, but it really makes you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver presents the reader to a dystopian society that has forayed the people's right to CHOICE in an odious fashion; but nonetheless, it can at times be furtively appealing in an hypnotic way. To analyze this society initially it is quite inscrutable to identify how a people could so ardently support such an articulated \\"guidance.\\" While this book is merely fiction, it indeed sheds light on an ideology that either is intrinsically intelligent, or it is quite eloquently repugnant to the nebulous of human desire, freedom to endeavor. Being a Constitutionalist I prefer the latter rather than the former. To have one's perspective sculpted and wrought by a fashion of governmental control by means of familial degradation and division from a biological existence, sexual drive altered by compulsory pharmaceuticals, intricate scheduling of one's day, standards and virtues that are ubiquitous, one all encompassing day of \\"birth\\", population control, genetic manipulation, and procuring children and spouses by application and approval only, is quite destitute of any CHOICE. Is this inane? Is this madness? Or, if freedom was not known in the context that of which is lain before us in the U.S. Constitution-which both Republicrats and Demopublicans are obscuring-would this dystopia be so divisive? The society in this book is something one could indeed marvel by pretext to the actual context due to the lack of tyrannical behavior. We must not be disillusioned. We must not allow the propagators' evidence and statistical datum to dissuade us from having the penchant to pursue freedom as a virtue over security. For such a society in essence, no matter success, does indeed revoke the core and foundations of an inalienable right that our predecessors have fought eons for-FREEDOM! Articulating political structure is arduous and elicits much dissension along the way; however, do not let that make one despondent or draw forth consternation or political apathy. For if political structure, by and for the people, becomes a derelict, then for our children FREEDOM will be merely a vestige. Or, perhaps a more formidable coin, an antiquated myth.Lowry has definitely deserved to be upon the list of writer's that has hit a symphonic political note. While not as fecundated as George Orwell's (Eric Blair) writing, she has a latent exhortation for us, or at least for me. The book also has a rendition upon perspective of reality and that will certainly shift the tides of what constitutes this book's yield. I would suggest everyone to read this book, along with other dystopian and utopian classics. Each of those titles have their own way of exorcising the demons from both forms of society.The end did irritate me slightly, I wanted a more pronounced and clarified ending. Nonetheless, following with the book's thesis, THE MATTER OF CHOICE, Lowry leaves it to the reader to bestow your interpretation; which is elating for some and exacerbating for others. My ending was grim which was evoked by random forethought rather than by intention."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I Am a teenager...and i read this book...i thought it would be a really boring book, but HEY, it wasn't boring!

I enjoyed the way the book flowed, and the rather insightful concepts which were introduced in a very easy to understand format. I have to agree with another reviewer who admonishes people who would ban this book. It almost sends chills down my spine to realize that the future could actually become the lives that are portrayed in the book. I believe that people/ and/or groups that find offense to this read are just proving to me that what is portrayed by the author could actually happen in the future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is an 11 year old boy living in a different society that has eliminated emotions.

It's a quick read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a great book and is well deserving of the Newbery medal. The giver is a one of a kind book. Lowry has created a unique world that people will not forget. This book is a success. In my estimation anyone would like this book regardless of maturity and aptitude level. Before I started I didn't think I would like the book but once I started reading I really got into the story. How do you picture a perfect world? Reading this book will give you a whole new perspective.I have never read a book in which the setting was more important to the story than The Giver. All though none of us have ever lived in a world the slightest bit similar to the setting in the book from the way Lowry precisely and specifically describes it you feel like you are right there. In this perfect world there is no pain or fear and you always feel secure. Everyone lives in \\"Sameness\\", there is no color, no different weather, and the ground is always flat. Everyone in the town is assigned a job. You don't get to pick who you marry and the only people that can have children are birthmothers. You are given children if you apply for one and the council of elders thinks you would be good parents. If you get a child you don't even get to pick what its name will be that is also decided by elders. There are virtually no choices and no worries. Without this special world it would be an average book at best.When the book starts out Jonas and the rest of his age group are preparing for the ceremony of twelve where they will receive the assignment that they will have until they are too old to work. When the day of the ceremony comes Jonas is both nervous and excited but when it is his turn to receive his assignment he is skipped over and they go on to the next person. Jonas didn't why and sat there in shame. Finally, after everyone else received their job the chief elder calls Jonas up to the stage. She tells him he has been selected to be the receiver of memory and will be trained by the Giver. It is the most honorable and dangerous job in the community. Jonas had no idea what was in store for him.In the beginning Jonas is an oblivious eleven year old boy but as the book goes on he transforms into a very wise thirteen year old. He is a difficult character to relate to. There are times, such as when he gets annoyed with his father for calling him \\"Jonas-Bonus\\", that you can relate to. But one thing you can't relate to is that until he became the receiver of memory he had never lied in his life. That's what all the children are taught so that's what they do. Overall Jonas is likeable but not my favorite character. Liking him of disliking him had no effect on how I felt about the book. Most of the time you believe that Jonas will succeed and that he will be a great receiver of memory. But sometimes it seems like he will fail because he feels pain and contemplates quitting.On a scale of one to ten I would give this book a nine. Whether the Giver sounds like a book you would enjoy or not I would recommend that you read it. If you want to know what happens to Jonas and if he will succeed you will just have to read the book and find out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am in my twenties and never read this when I was younger.

The author that wrote the book goes into very detailed events. The book takes place in a small town where people keep their lives simple. They have one big ceremony for the birthdays. For every age celebrated they are given one present to represent how mature they are or should be. At age seven of what they call the group of sevens, they receive a new jacket with buttons to represent themselves a s pre-independence to others and themselves. At the ceremony of twelve's, each child is given a specific job that h as been chosen by the head chief. The head chief goes around town with her assistants and spend many minutes examining each child would be good at according to their potential.Jacob, the main character was given the job to be a Giver, the most respected people of all and the most highly important job in the community. As the head chief was awarding Jacob she had also brought up that soon will come pain and hurt which everybody expected Jacob to know because they didn't. Jacob was given an envelope and was told to arrive at a certain place first thing the next morning. The envelope that Jacob had received was one paper with a list of rules that were to be followed or optional. The one rule that he did not want to follow was the one that said he had the right to lie. Jacob was always use to telling the truth as well as the rest of the community. As soon as the morning rose, The Giver started to training Jacob right away. The Giver had told Jacob that he would be known as, \\"The Receiver,\\" until he was given all memories and all power. The Giver would have Jacob lie down and close his eyes as the Giver sensitively stroked his hand along the back of Jacob and began giving happy memories like snow to Jacob. After a while of training, The Giver felt like Jacob was ready to become the new Giver, he had told Jacob to use his powers to leave the community as fast as possible without saying goodbye to anybody. This was because the community had to learn how to take control by themselves and learn more painful and confusing things sense they always relied on The Giver. So Jacob and a baby named Gabriel headed for another community. Jacob used his heating memories to keep Gabriel warm. Soon they arrived safely at the community."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this book is about your character.

A world of peace, comradery and sameness. This is the world of Jonas, the main character in Lois Lowry's award winning novel The Giver.Lowry has created a magnificent novel that causes the reader to think about the idea of a utopian society. It focuses on the concept of whether a perfect society is truly attainable, and at what expense. Lowry bravely takes the premise of utopia and shows the reader that a world devoid of emotion is world devoid of both evil and good.I found this book to be extremely enjoyable, a true page turner. it is written with such detail that the reader can both feel themselves in the situations at hand and the emotions of the characters. This relatively simplistic book features timeless themes and I recommend it for children and adults alike. This is an excellent book for reading groups,and it is an equally enjoyable personal read. I strongly recommend this book for all those mature enough to comprehend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of science fiction, but this book was definitely an exception. It takes place, way; way, into the future. Even if it doesn't seem like it. They live in a perfect community. They make no important choices. Everyone's the same. You get assigned a job, a spouse, and kids. You have no feelings. You take pills to prevent you from getting sexual feelings to another person. You don't see color. You have no memory of the past and what happened before your community. It's a story about a boy who along with his friends get assigned his life job. But, his is different. He can do something that not everyone can't. He meets The Giver who gives him the memories of the past. Of love, of war, of pain, of Christmas, of hunger. He can see color. He has to hold in all the pain from the memories for the community. It shows how bad our World actually is. Him and The Giver can't take the pain. They have to do something about it. But they can't, even though they have to. But they have a plan..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think there's been enough written as far as plot description of this tale...but if not, then here goes:Jonas lives in what appears to be a perfect, Utopian society and upon the completion of his 12th year of life (just like all other 12 year-olds in his community) he's given his job for life. His title is to be 'Receiver', to become a recepticle for all memories and knowlege within his community.He goes into training with the former Receiver, who then becomes 'The Giver', and learns the truth of his environment...and how it is far from perfect, and how impossible the concept of perfection truly is.There's more to it, but that's the bare bones of plot.It's a wonderfully enticing tale, and the author chose a powerful subject as well as doing a wonderful job at constructing a society with very intricate rules and social graces. I was thoroughly drawn to this book...and I felt it was simply yet powerfully written. The simplicity was actually quite effective since the subject and story was rather complex.I felt the author kind of wimped out though, somewhere toward about 3/4 of the way...perhaps it wasn't the author...perhaps it was the publisher, which is really possible too. Lowry was starting to dip into darker waters which were extremely powerful, but it seems like the moment she did, there was suddenly this miraculous solution to the story...it felt like the narrative was about to spill the goods and then was silenced somehow. And I found this a pity because I was really getting into what i was reading, was really getting into the character of Jonas and his development and growth and maturity. He was stunted as soon as he began to grow up and gain some understanding, and this is the main reason I gave this book 3 (actually 3.5) stars.Perhaps the reason it was all cut so short was because it was a book that was also meant for children...but that doesn't seem like a good enough reason. I just felt like, Don't take me somewhere unless you're going to take me all the way. Don't abandon your reader...I felt I was abandoned as the story was tied up at the end with a very messy and strangly metorphorical ending. The book was not metophorical to begin with. It's too bad, because I really was starting to sink my teeth into it![..] I read the book myself about 3 times...and I just flat-out disagree. The author painted extremely innocent characters who didn't know what was considered taboo by OUR standards...and in truth, there also wasn't any kind of overt leaning toward any kind of sexual orientation. There was no weird nudity. Children volunteering at a nursing home and tending to bathing the elderly is not what I would consider sensual. A male child taking his shirt off to be more in touch with his surroundings is not a sensual thing, but rather unself-consious...why would it be otherwise???Whoever criticizes that is kind of missing the point anyway: There was NOTHING sensual in this book...if anything, the author made a point of creating a society that was sensually stunted and out of touch in that way, and actually took pills to remedy those cravings in order to never look at them again. So...what's all the fuss, people?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read the novel, The Giver, writing by Lois Lowry.

Therefore, it's a very good novel for reading.The Giver talks about a boy was called Jonas who lived in a unreal society. The society was called Community. Our real society is like \\"dystopia\\". Against, the Community is just like \\"utopia\\". \\"The relationships are not biological but are developed through observation and a careful handling of personality.\\" In the Community, there're lots of rules the citizen need to follow. For anyone who did some thing against the rules would be released from the Community, also you can call it \\"euthanasia\\".\\"Jonas's world was perfect. Everything was under control.\\" Jonas was going to be 12. The Ceremony of 12 was extremely important. After the Ceremony of 12, children would be with their Assignment group (end with play group), with those in training.All children would be given the Assignment according to their interest, preparing for future.Jonas had nothing interest. He is worried about future. Eventually, Jonas received the Assignment, the \\"Receiver\\" of memory. It's a particular job, because the \\"Receiver\\" could get memories and hold memories. These memoris were lots of kinds of feeling, some are direct and some are indirect. During the Assignment time, Jonas's teacher were called the Giver was training Jonas to be a \\"Receiver\\".Once, Jonas asked the Giver \\"What's your favorite?\\". Then, the Giver gave Jonas some memories of the Giver's family played together on holiday. Jonas didn't understand. He could not describe it by using a word.\\"love\\" the Giver said.Eventually, Jonas thought that the Community was immoral. Therefore, Jonas decided to escape. At the end of the novel, Jonas brought a kid who's going to be released when jonas began to escape. Jonas succeeded. However, where Jonas's going. The writer didn't tell.I think The Giver is a instructive novel. The writer want to tell us that \\"love\\" and \\"emotion\\" are important and necessary. The world won't be lively if there're not any \\"love\\" and \\"emotion\\". That's why I agree with the writer.On the other hand, the world without \\"love\\" and \\"emotion\\" also has some advantage. Just like the Community in the novel, \\"The relationships are not biological but are developed through observation and a careful handling of personality.\\" In the Community, there's no war. There's no crime. There's no violence. There's no hungriness. Also, There's no poor and rich. In the Community, the world is completely peaceable.The world in the Community is perfect, but everybody just looks like a machine. There must be no one in our real word want to be a machine, although the world is not perfect. Therefore, \\"love\\" and \\"emotion\\" are necessary.The Giver is \\"a powerful and provocative novel\\". I believe you'll enjoy it.1/1/2006Killua Fu"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Book ReviewThe GiverImagine not being able to experience color or the feeling of love. Well, this is everyday life in the setting of The Giver. This book, by Lois Lowry, is set in a community where simple things like feelings, colors, and weather have all been diminished. Everything in this community everything is the same including the people, landscape, and weather. However, one boy is set apart from the rest.Jonas never quite felt the same as everyone else. He sees things differently than others, which makes him feel odd and set apart. When he is given the high honor as Giver, he feels even more different. Being the Giver, he recieves memories unlike he has ever seen. In addition, he also creates a wonderful with his mentor, the former Giver.My favorite character in this book was Jonas. He often reminded me of myself at certain times in the book. I often feel different from my peers because I have talents not many obtain. I soon realized, like Jonas, that my different talents are usually what bring out the best in me and can be used in many different ways.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a plot that is extremely interesting and adventurous. This book takes you to a world that you wouldn't even think could exist. Ms. Lowry did an absoloutely fabulous job with creating her characters and describing things throughout the whole plot. I definitely give this book two thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I randomly picked this book up at the library and couldn't put it down once I started. Honestly, I was expecting the sort of teen horror stuff that Lowry is famous for and thought it would just be a quick read. Well, it was a quick read, sure, but certainly not easy to get out of my mind. It really has some great themes to discuss with others. I was thoroughly absorbed in the story and the characters and thought that Lowry did an excellent job of creating the world inside this book.I would recommend this book to adolescents and adults both and think it would be a very interesting book to discuss with both groups."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a perfect community; there is no pain or no pleasure. The families are selected by the elders. The elders also assign the jobs to them. Each person is assigned a job. Every year there is a ceremony and you become a year older. When you become twelve years of age, you become an adult and you are assigned a job. Jonas is now twelve, and is job is the receiver of memories. He is taking the place of the Giver. The giver was the last receiver of memory. He must now teach Jonas to be the receiver of memory. When he teaches him, he gives him memories of pain and pleasure. Jonas then learns about all of those things, and he realizes that even though they don't experience pain that they are missing many things in life like pleasure and such. Jonas wants to save the town. So he and the giver make a plan. The giver will stay back to help the town, and Jonas will run away. They do that and Jonas makes it to another plane with lights music pain and pleasure. I thought this was a good book. It had a good ending, it had a good story line, but some of it seemed impossible.This book had a good ending. It was very happy, a lot of books have ending where it does not turn out good. But this one makes you feel good when you read it. After living in a horrible community like that, Jonas finally got to go to a better one. It describes how he hears music and singing, that's very warm feeling. Also it tells how he thought he heard music behind him which means that maybe his old community got better.This book has a good story line. All the events are properly done. Plus I just basically like the book, and the way it goes. It is a pretty good idea. And it is very creative the way they made the town and all the customs of it. Also the jobs were well thought up, but mostly Jonas job, the receiver of memory.The thing I didn't like about this book is having a community like that seems impossible to even imagine. Like every thing makes either pain or pleasure, I can understand the no color or music but to live you have to have pain or pleasure. Also being twelve years of age, you're not usually mature enough. So that was the only thing I really didn't like.So I thought this was a good book. It had a little things wrong with it, but in the end I really liked it. I would probably read it again if I had time or there was a sequel. I recommend this book to other people that like reading. I rate it an 8 out of 10.-J. Hamilton"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have just reread this book with my daughter and I still can't believe how amazing it is. The Giver always reminds me of the John Lennon song \\"Imagine\\". It is an entire book written about what it is like to live in a utopian society. On the outside it is perfect but this book is about the dark reality of perfection. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago in one afternoon just because it was on my mom's bookshelf. It was so thought provoking that I still think about it today. It's a very quick way to have a new outlook on society and life. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had a friend who told me about this book, and although I didn't want to read it at first she kept pestering me to, so finally, with much dread, I picked up the book and began flipping through the pages. Wow. Thank you, Maria, because without you I would never have discovered the magic of The Giver.Jonas lives in a world very different from ours today. There is no fear, pain, or suffering of any kind. Basically, no one has any feelings. Suddenly, on his twelveth birhtday, Jonas gets an opportunity to discover a world beyond that (and change his own), with lessons from someone he calls the \\"Giver.\\" The Giver gives Jonas memories of times before people decided to change their world to an unsuffering one, and Jonas realizes that even through the suffering people have (poverty, sickness, hunger) that they get great things as well (happiness, hope, love). Not one person can finish this book without learning or taking away one thing from it. Lois Lowry shows how great our world really is, and that we should all be thankful for what we have rather than focus on the things we don't.I would reccommend this book to children 11 years and up, because otherwise you can't understand/enjoy the detailed plot line of Jonas's story. This is one of those books that everyone should read, and hopefully enjoy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We were assigned to read the giver at our school. Everybody moaned cheered but I didn't know if it was a good book or a bad. So when I started the very first page I was really confused about it. So I told my brother if he could read the first page with me. After he explained the first page I understood the rest of the book. After I finished The Giver I realized that as a writer it took so much talent to be so descriptive and so emotional about your books. So if your reading my article Lois Lowry I want to tell you that your book inspired me to write."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER is a wonderful book that is very well written and the plot was amazing.

Jonus was assigned the Reciever, the most important job in the community. He is trianed by the Giver. The job of the reciever is to recieve all of the memories and feelings of the past so that the community doenst have to go through all the pain and anguish from when there wasnt &quot;sameness&quot;. He also recieves good things such as love, and friendship, which the community doesnt have either. He realizes he needs to go &quot;elsewhere&quot; and leave all of the &quot;sameness&quot;. While he is trying to get there, he is face to face with acctual pain instead of just the memory. But as soon as he gets to &quot;elsewhere&quot;, all of his memories will be released into the community. I thought this book was so meaningful and i totally and completely agree with the author because I think she is trying to state that peoples differrences and feelings do matter and every one cannot be the same. I honestly think this is the best book I have ever read in my life. I recomend this book for any adult and for mature children who have stong feelings for advanced and meaningful books. I loved this book!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story takes place in a community in the future. the peope in the community get their life assignement at the age of 12.

Go out to your local bookstore and pick up the book The Giver!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is very good. Jonas lives in a society where everyone is the same. A society where you get chosen to do a certain job. Jonas is chosen the greatest of all assignments. The Giver gives Jonas memories that make Jonas go through hard times. This drives Jonas to leave and find out what a real society is like. Lois Lowry's treatment of the story keeps you on your feet.

The main character in this book is Jonas, he is a 11 year old soon to be 12. The community that Jonas lives in has no weather, everyone dresses the same, the people live in a strict society in which they control everything.Jonas is faced with many conflicts which he faces and overcomes. Louis Lowery keeps everything in the same state of mind, nothing changes from the conflicts to the setting. I think the way this book was well written and you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" is a very interesting book and I enjoyed it very much. It depicted a utopian community. The main character is named Jonas, a young male, who is picked to be the new receiver of memories. Each person in the community was assigned a role in the community when they were an eleven, such as a laborer, director of recreation, caretaker of the old, nurturer etc.. They train to be that role until they are finished and take up that job. The receiver of memories is a special job, because there is only one and they are the only person who knows about the real world. When someone is the receiver of memories he or she receives memories of the world before this utopia where there was color and love and fear and war and music. Jonas realizes that the community that he lives in is not the world he wants to be in, so he runs away and saves a baby who was going to be released (killed ), doing so releasing the memories of the real world. This book is very disturbing at parts. I recommend that children under the age of eight probably should not read it, but for preteens to adults this is a great book. Over all I think Lois Lowry did a terrific job on this book and I would recommend \\" The Giver\\" highly."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I rarely write a review, but I also rarely encounter a book with such magnitude and power. This is a great read and a quick page turner. The plot, which is a simple one, involves Jonas, a young eleven year old boy trying to find out what he will become when he grows up (that choice is never allowed in the community that demands total control). His is chosen to be a receiver and there is when the book becomes an utter page turner.So what is this book about? Its theme is choice and the consequences that we all face when making them. Do we want a world that is without choice, but is completely safe, or do we risk choice and the potential negative consequences. Clearly the ending offers a solution albeit it is a dark and poignant one and forces us to evaluate those ideas. That's what great literature is about. You are not slammed in the face with a neat solution but instead offered an ambiguous ending that asks the questions that need to be asked.Clearly the book offers dark themes that many parents don't want their children exposed too, but are they better with Grand Theft Auto, media bombardment, and R rated horror films? This book actually demands that you question and think about situations that will affect everyone in life. This is an extremely important piece of writing. Well done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very good book about life in Jonas' Community. I would recomend it to other people because I thought it was very good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a small book that takes you on a an incredible ride. It's not a new book, it was written in 1993. I think I was twelve or thirteen when I first read it, but it's an excellent book for adults to read as well.I can confidently say that this book is my favourite book. I don't think I've ever used my imagination as much as I have reading this book.I can tell you that it's science fiction related, but is mainly about sociology and the social order of humanity.The story revolves around an 11 year old boy as he gets \`assigned' his life's task turning twelve. As he learns the ways of this new task from The Giver; he slowly learns the horrible truth.I'm leaving it at that. It's only 193 pages, a real easy read; but one that will forever mark you.~Darleya~(if you liked my review, I review all sorts of things ranging from household products, board games, even beauty products; all honest and to-the-point reviews.

Though his Community is strictly ruled by a Committee of Elders and there is little choice in anything, Jonas is content with his life. When he turns 12, Jonas is singled out to receive memories from the past that keep Community life simple and safe, without it's people ever realizing it. As he journeys into life outside his world, Jonas realizes that there is much more to life than what he can see.I think Lowry does a great job of presenting sensitive issues from an innocent, unbiased boy's perspective. This book made me think, and ask myself deep questions. I would recommend it to any middle school student and higher."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a moderately easy read, yet it gives the reader a deeper grasp on life. Jonas's experience in a uniform society gives the reader a greater appreciation for love, family, and freedom. Lowry has an excellent use of description which places the reader in the same society as Jonas.Overall, the book is very well written, although written in a very basic manner that makes it more enjoyable for a younger age group.A four star novel! I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"ever since reading this book the first time, I enjoyed page after page a second and third time.

A friend recommended it, and though I enjoyed it overall, it left me wanting more. It would have been better if the characters had been developed more and if there was a stronger conclusion to the story- it flet like we were just left hanging at the end.

She describes the new world exactly and you can imagine everything. You get many information about Jonas, the main character of this book, and his life in that community, his problems etc. I dislike the beginning of this book, because it is boring but don't give up. later it becomes more and more exciting and you can't stop reading, until you reach the last page.

He is assigned to be the Receiver of Memory and gets to know a lot of things from the Giver, the old Receiver of Memory. At first the book is rather boring, but after the Ceremony of Twelve there is a turning point in the story and the book gets more exciting. In my opinion the book is written for people of all ages and I would advise you to read the book, because you'll be shocked when you realize that the things described in the book can come true in our own society. You will read the book and then you'll see all the things we take for granted in another way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! I'd give it more stars if I could!

It kept on the edge of your seat and was filled with suspense. Perfect book for a suspense thriller to read!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am going to put in my two cents, even though there are already 682 reviews. I thought this book was brilliant. I read about 10 pages before going to bed, and then I read the rest of the book the next day. It was very powerful! I am 32, and I read it, and it blew me away! It isn't just a young adult novel. Lowry creates a utopia, and then her viewpoint character is the misfit, the one set apart within that utopia. I won't sum up what happens, because others have already done this, but if I were to teach a Science Fiction class, and could choose only a few books for my students to read, this is one of the ones that I would choose. It reminded me of Robert Cormier's The Chocolate War, in some ways. I have read through a few of the reviews, and they say it was a good book until the ending, which they didn't like. I thought the ending was the most powerful, poetic part of the book. The ending was perfect. It was nebulous, and we aren't sure what will happen, but Jonus has won, whatever he finds at the end of the hill. Everything doesn't have to have the hollywood, or New York bestseller neat resolved ending. And this is the end of the book - there shouldn't be any kind of sequels, because that takes away power from Lowry's ending. Pick up this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a really great book. I would reccomend you read it several times to really understand it. It is kind of slow to start, but gets really suspenseful. I really liked this book. When I read it for the first time, it seemed scary and strange, but the second time I realized how much it mirrors our world. I would reccomend this book for anyone who really likes science fiction."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read The Giver to my son when he was in fifth grade. We both enjoyed it immensely. I was glad to read this book to my son at that time because I could explain things to him throughout the story. He is now in eighth grade and we still enjoy talking about Jonas and how he handled becoming The Giver. It is my all time favorite book.

Far better than the current dystopian fantasies, because it has soul."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain. Not only is the story epic and brief, making it perfect for younger or simply impatient readers; but it is beautifully crafted. As you move from one line to the next, you will find it hard to foresee whether the next feeling it stirs within you will be shock, awe, comfort, disgust, and so on. This is a daring little story, aimed at the big enemy we could prove to be for ourselves. Buy one for everyone you know who isn't afraid to face the darkness with both eyes open!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This story presents a world that is so wonderful it's terrifying. The book is well-written, short, easy to read and understand, but, in my opinion, that does not make it a kid's book. I think children lack the past-present-future perspective necessary to successfully experience this story. Even adults can get lost in its depth and miss the true meaning of the circumstances and choices made by the characters and the consequences of these choices. In any case, if you enjoy dystopian fiction, you should not miss this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Book contains no profanity. There are scenes of murder that a child might find disturbing because of who does it and how it is done. In this society people (and children) are killed but it is not considered murder. As far as sexual situations, Jonas describes stirrings for another girl, but I think it is quite tame. The book would be good for middle schoolers to adult.Like Gathering Blue in that Lois Lowry reveals things without making any comparison to present day reality. She takes us through typical days-in-the-life of her characters and we see how foreign this world is based upon the words and actions. (The old adage of show it don't tell it)Another thing I love is how the story starts and ends in the middle so to speak. Almost like a rolling start in auto racing, on page one the story is already in full swing and we are filled in on past details as we roll along. Some might find the ending disappointing that it also ends in like manner but I quite enjoy that. Although the ending in Gathering Blue leaves more to chance. In the Giver, for the most part, we can guess at what will happen to Jonas yet I still like that it is not spelled out and resolved for us."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read the giver in my seventh grade English class. I loved the book. Many kids in my class didn't like the book for the same reasons many reviews didn't. While the book itself didn't end in a great way The Messenger and Gathering Blue fill the void of anything that may be missing to some. If you feel something missing then I recommend you read the prior books mentioned."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is not for young children. The issues that this book addresses are deep and disturbing. Euthanasia, infanticide, drug dependence, depression, war, \\"brain washing\\", and deception are some of the issues this book addresses.I read this book knowing only the title and author. It was captivating but the images are too disturbing for young children or even young adolescents. I have my own children read this book when they are 16 or older and we definitely discuss it. Discussing the book helps alleviate any shock they may experience and also helps to clarify some of the vagueness in the book. It is science fiction.One of the reasons that this book is so controversial is that it is such an easy read while being about such heavy topics. This is a \\"childrens'\\" book about an evil evil society. No child should ever have to bear the burden which the author placed on Jonas. But in cultures and societies today many children face far worse.Admittedly the ending is vague, however, a reader can make very positive inferences about the time of year and appearance of the town at the end of the book. The book's message is one of hope. The value placed on life and freedom is clear."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"You know a book is worth reading when it sticks with you for nearly 20 years. I read this when it first came out...I was 10 years old. Through the years this story stuck with me, always in my mind and evoking a somewhat melancholy feeling. For years I searched for it, but could never remember its name or specific enough details to find it.After reading 'Brave New World', at a friend's suggestion, the similarities inspired me to search again and here it is! This story profoundly affected me as a child and comes back to me often in my international work.I highly recommend this book to adults and mature children alike."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have read, in quick succession, all three books in this series; The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger.I read them all in hopes of coming to a satisfying conclusion to the story - but in this I felt cheated! The books are wonderful, don't get me wrong. Exciting, fast paced, terrific stories and characters. But on the last page (I have the kindle edition) I found myself repeatedly trying to page forward, as in each book it felt as if it hadn't ended. Not simply because I wanted more - but because in each case, it felt unfinished....One more page, one more paragraph - anything except stranding me in the middle of a story. I thought this was simply to make me continue to read the sequel, but even the concluding book left me in a lurch. I do not think I will be reading Lowry again any time soon. Her lack of endings is just too frustrating for me!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to live in a perfect society? In The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas lives in the future in a perfect world without pain or grief. When he turns twelve, he is chosen as The Receiver, who obtains all the memories of the world's past from The Giver.The main characters are Jonas (The Receiver) and The Giver who gives Jonas the world's memories. Jonas changes from a nave child who knows nothing about life to an opinionated, emotional young adult who witnesses the society's citizens' inability to know, to feel, to think, to judge and to make their own decisions.I enjoyed this book tremendously. It shows the tragedy of an emotionless person living in a so-called perfect world. \\"\`They can't help it. They know nothing.'\\"(Page 153) These ignorant citizens don't know right from wrong and simply act at other's order.I recommend this book to people of all ages, though it is best suited for kids of 4th grade and higher who possess high-level vocabulary and comprehension skills. Get ready to step in Jonas's shoes in this science fiction masterpiece that emphasizes humans' rights and our capability to decide for ourselves."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is wonderful! As I turned the pages of this book, I learned new ideas, thought about stuff that I normally wouldn't have and enjoyed the wonderful story! I enjoyed the idea behind the book: living in a perfect world without pain or feelings...except for one person in the whole town. I think, that living in a world without feeling or pain is not very good. When we live we enjoy or not enjoy things because of how we feel about them. In the town in which the story takes place, it's difficult for me to imagine how people there can enjoy life if they have no feelings about anything. I'm glad that Jonas and the Giver knew about feelings, pain, color, and music.I read this book all in one day, the moment I picked it up I couldn't put it down! In some of the other reviews, people said they didn't like how Lois Lowry didn't write the ending. But I think that's a wonder of the book, you can make the ending however you want. I recommend this book to everyone older than ten."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry really took on very profound subject matter to write about, especially to make it YA fiction. I applaud her for it. This novel was rather good because it makes the young reader stop and self-examine. I will spare you a summary of the book. You can find that in many other reviews.I like that this novel's audience is supposed to be 8-14. I think that children at this age are capable of handling the difficult subject matter and should be exposed to books that can really challenge them. When it comes to the severity of the material (particularly chapter 19), it's just a drastic point to convey to the reader: If we live in a world without feeling nor true emotion and are bound by unquestioning rigidity, we are capable of doing ANYTHING without heart nor conscience. As a mother I can understand why a parent would be hesitant to expose a child to the material, but as a book lover, I wouldn't keep this book away from them.When it comes to the \\"sci-fi\\" realm of this novel, I found that there were alot of unanswered questions regarding the society and the world they live in (I often feel this way when I read sci-fi though) so I didn't find it a feasible community. She uses \\"genetic testing\\" alot to explain why things are the way they are, and I found that an easy excuse to not have to tie up loose ends or answer any questions . Not very creative. It's impossible to imagine a society could be created this way successfully.As for the subject of the whole novel, I felt that her point was rather, er, subjective. She says that a world without feeling isn't worth living at all. Now is it, really? Of course someone who has experienced joys (from the most simple to the most complex) in their life would agree. What about someone who's had a miserable life? I'm sure they would rather live in a bland, rigid, yet reliable world than deal with pain and misery. That's how Rosemary dealt with it. She'd rather not live than deal with pain and suffering; in fact, it trumped the joys she experienced. But if we're going to speak generally, of course the cliche \\"It's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\\" would fare well.As for the ambiguous ending, I do not enjoy these. I think it's a lazy way of coming off as profound."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a Science Fiction book written by Lois Lowry. It is set in a future society where you may not control any thing in your community; including your life. This society has no almost no pain and no emotions.When al the \\"11's\\" turn to \\"12's\\", they get their life assignment. They range from many things. The main character Jonas, 12, is given the job title receiver. Jonas receives memories from a man called The Giver. The Giver stores old memories from past times. He holds memories of pain, anger, and love. He holds these memories in case the Elders of the community need help in making decisions that they don't know how to handle.As Jonas receives these memories, he feels more and more pain. He sees how much his community has changed into a more diabolic place to live.

You really began to care about the few \\"real\\" people in the story. The people who know \\"anything\\" come alive and you feel the depth of the truly unique and horrible situation they are in.I applaud the perspective on the intrinsic value of human life. The horror felt by the taking of innocent life for the convenience of the community is a breath of fresh air in our society.I love the narration. I listen to quite a few books and quite a few narrators and Ron Rifkin did a first rate job here.The Bad:It seems that the most difficult part of a story to write is the ending. In this case the author simply chose not to write an ending, leaving the decision of what actually happened up to the reader. While on the surface this sounds like a clever intellectually compelling device in practice it just seems like a copout.The Giver"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Rifkin does an excellent job as the narrator of this book. his vocal tone and reading style match the story very well. the story itself has various logical problems that i found distracting. i cannot add much to what has already be written by over 3000 reviews. The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative.i would suggest looking at the Dr van der Linden's review (he rates the book 1 star) as well as the 5 star reviews, as he makes some valid points about the story and suggests other better constructed stories on the similar dystopic themesThe Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks),Between Planets,Citizen of the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open.

Written by Lois Lowry, it is filled with interesting ideas in every chapter. It's a pretty simple read but with a sci-fi feel. It's hard to know if it took place in the future or the past. When I read it, I was full of questions as was the main character Jonas. At the beginning, Jonas is an 11 year-old boy with unique qualities unlike any of his friends or family. When Jonas attends the annual assignment ceremony, he has no idea what job he will receive for the rest of his life, but he could never imagine the one that he is selected for. All in all, The Giver is a remarkable one of a kind book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois LowryScience FictionIf you like books about the future, you would like The Giver. It is a goodbook because it gets the reader caring for the characters. It also gives a feeling of adventure and action. The book is a very sad one because everyone is almost the same, and if they break the rules three times they have to die. This book has many feelings; it has love, anger, sadness, happiness, and pain. Lois Lowry did a good job of making you feel like you're in the story, but while you're in the story, you feel helpless. The story is about a boy named Jonas who gets a job as the new Receiver. The job of the Receiver is to keep memories for the community. While in training he learns about death, pain, and that his people are doing wrong things. So Jonas and a man called the Giver make a plan to secretly stop the community. It is hard for Jonas at first but, in the end ... sorry can't tell you that.

I found it in my elementary school library and the title intrigued me. Upon finishing it, I determined that it is inappropriate for anyone under the age of 14. Some of the imagery is too disturbing. However, I became engrossed in it's superior writing and interesting, though not original, premise. It is the unusual perspective that gives this book it's twist. No, it doesn't go into detail to describe HOW and WHY, Jonah's society is the way it is.

This book was interesting and at some parts it left you wanting to read more and more. But at the begining of this book the author seemed to not have any idea of what she was writing. The begining and the end i personaly thought were terrible. Not so much as the end but the last chapter. The parts that kept me reading were good but still the author might have been able to put more thought into what she was writing. The author had many things that did not fit and things that were badly placed because of the words that she had said before."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a dystopic world, flawed by its very perfection. It is a world where people put an exact label on feelings, lest one strays from the path of language precision. It is a world where the word \\"death\\" does not even exist in its language, its importance in life undermined by polite euphemisms.Behind this perfection is the one man who knows the true beauty and horror of life, and as the Giver, it is to him that the training of Jonas, the new Receiver, falls.Frankly, I'm a bit torn about rating this book. The prose, the originality, the \\"perfection\\" of the storytelling deserves all the praise and commendation that the book and its author has received. The plot, the construction of the world, and the concepts so effectively shown enthralls. I was interested, appalled, chilled, amazed, horrified and through it all, I sympathized with the main character, from the first to the last page.Unfortunately, no matter how thought provoking the \\"ending\\" is, however compelling the entire book is for discussion, I do prefer my book to have a more solid ending. The author claims that she wanted to make an open-ended story, meant to give every single reader the ending they want in their minds, but as a reader who has long finished highschool and college, I couldn't totally appreciate the author's intent.For all its merits, I think this book deserves a four. I'd sooner look for a book with an ending, though."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a well written book, I think, but I did not enjoy reading it.

I read it before my daughter, and man was I glad I did. This is an intersting, read, but for kids over 14.

There are many parts of the story that are wonderful and thought provoking, but it just goes too far for kids.

I wasn't very interested while reading this book because it was first upsetting, secondly the ending was not what I expected, and finally it is disgusting. It was upsetting because they had no feelings for little children. If you were a twin they would weigh you and if you weighed less you would be released. Also, the ending wasn't good at all because it just ends, when you want to know more. Some of the memories the Giver transferred were disgusting. For example, when Jonas was sledding and hit a tree and he saw his own flesh and was bleeding. A quote to support my answer is then ending of the book, \\" Behind him, across a vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.\\" The way the book ended was confusing because it seemed that there should be more too it, but there wasn't. As you can see, this text is not good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was not good literature because it wasn't full of feelings, there was not interesting details, and there was not a surprise ending. The Giver was not full of feelings because Johanas' community had no feelings. Also there was nothing to explain if there were no emotions. Another reason why The Giver was not good literature is because there were no interesting details. Nothing was really explained in The Giver. Also in the interesting parts the author didn't really go into detail. Lastly, The Giver was not good literature is because there was not a surprise ending. The ending of The Giver was horrible. The last words of the whole story were \\"But perhaps it was only an echo.\\" That is why The Giver was not good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A reader from Seaford: The Giver is a book that makes you appreciate the little things that you have in life.

I've never really liked reading books in class, though. We never get to read any really good books. But my class just finished reading &quot;The Giver,&quot; and I actually liked it! It was a really great book. Basically, it was about a perfectly organized community where people's choices were made for them, from simple decisions like what to wear to important choices like what career to choose. In the story the actions of a boy who is chosen to receive memories of the past, where colors and choices existed. The actions of this boy change everything for the Community. Part of the reason I liked it was because I've always liked imagining a community as perfect as the one in the story. It really makes you thankful for all the things you were lucky enough to have that didn't exist in the Community. It makes you realize that, hey, we're pretty lucky to have great things like color and families and the privilege to make our own decisions. Really, these are very important things.

I just feel compelled to attempt and add something to the other comments made about this book.The novel centers around the idea of choices and consequences. If we choose one thing we may loose the opportunity for something else. A choice made today has unimaginable consequences days and maybe years later. The fate of the whole \\"world\\" lies with Jonah and how he chooses to use his powers and gifts, and Jonah feels completely unprepared for this. He's forced into dealing before he is ready. This book is an excellant read for adolescents. They are faced with choices each day and are so often incapable of seeing the consequences.The ending is ambiguous. We are left wondering what really did happen. This book is the first in a loosely connected series, and the answers will not come to you until you have read Gathering Blue and The Messenger, both of which are equally excellant books.I must say my peace about these books again though. A fourth grader may be able to read these books based on the vocabulary and basic story line, but a fourth grader will not be able to appreciate these books for what they are truly worth. The theme of creating a utopia and the disposal of the elderly are ideas that I don't think are appropriate for younger students. Please reserve using these books for middle school or high school students."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, the main character, is born into a society that strives for perfection.

I first read the book when I was in Seventh Grade and had re-read it several times before recently reading it again as part of an upper-division college literature course. I have been fascinated by this seemingly simple novel for so many years-every time I come back to it, I find new ways in which I can apply it to my life. The Giver is laced with some of the most beautiful symbolism. In many ways it is alive, the book itself seems to change and adapt to an individuals needs and circumstances.When I read the book for the first time, I was about the same age as Jonas, the pre-pubescent boy who is to become the most respected leader of his community-The Receiver of Memory. I could relate to his feelings as he questioned the future and tried to find his place in life. I read it several times throughout junior high and high school and I became especially aware of the relationships which Jonas had with his friends and family. As he began to acquire knowledge (memories), he could see just how impersonal and rather meaningless his most cherished relationships were. This prompted me to develop stronger, more meaningful relationships with those whom I love.Now, as a college student, I relate to the book in much the same way I did when I was in seventh grade. I can more fully appreciate Jonas' apprehension about the future and his ability to actually make a difference in the world. He has powerful emotions, which if left unchecked could be disastrous; so do I. He has a passion for understanding the people and the world around him; so do I. He again questions whether or not he can actually make a difference in the world, but gradually begins to see that he can; I am beginning to see that also. These feelings and emotions are shared by all young men (and presumably young woman also) and Lowry does an amazing job of helping young people realize that they do have great potential to change the world for the better.Along with the symbolic nature of the book, Lowry does an outstanding job of creating a visual feast for the readers of her novel. As I read it, I become a part of it; I can see so clearly in my mind everything that she is talking about. One of the most striking examples of this is how she uses color-in a book?-to show how limited this society is. People in Jonas' community see only in black and white, but occasionally Jonas sees red-on an apple or in the flesh tones of people's skin. Over time, he begins to see more colors and with the colors come wisdom and understanding of the suppressed nature of his people.These are the some of the things that make this a powerful and moving book. The nature and content of the book appeal to so many because it addresses the basic needs of all people. To sum it all up-a book for all ages with timeless lessons to be learned from it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is probaly the best book I have ever read. Lois Lowry did a great job on this book. It is a story of a boy named Jonas who lives in a totalitarianism community, or a perfect community. They are given Assignments for their jobs and he becomes the reciever of memories when he is twelve. This is the most honored, important, and painful Assignment there is. Read more of The Giver to see how good this book really is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can it really be nine years since I first read The Giver? Even now this book still resounds with me. Some of it has to do with the very open-endedness that has so unnerved some revieweres. The reader begins with fascination at the perfectly-ordered community, which transforms into revulsion. This is a book that rather than simply presenting straightforward answers, is more an invitation to introspection and debate.Take one single scene, for instance--the one where Jonas' father \\"releases\\" the newborn twin. It is clear that he's bothered by that side of his job--he even makes somewhat of an effort to try and spare Gabriel that same fate, yet he does nothing to stop the release of the twin. Even when it is Gabriel's term, he relents to the will of the community. But in his society, would it even have been possible for him to develop a rebellious mindset, after having been controlled to a degree not even the Communists could accomplish? This makes one wonder--is Jonas' father a good man in spite of what his society has indoctrinated him to do? Aristotle suggested that a person who lived in an eternal coma (which the state of Sameness could be considered) could not be virtuous, because his or her virtue has never been tested. So can there even be a such thing as a good or evil person in a society where there is no true freedom of thought or choice?I must admit, I find one reviewer's dismissal of the book simply because certain scenes such as the release of the newborn twin \\"did not agree with [their] beliefs\\" rather narrowminded--if not a demonstration of the very attitude that created the hell of Sameness. Is that scene repugnant? Absolutely, and that is the intention. The whole point of that scene is to show the horrible price society and the individual pay for conformity. I do not think children should be shielded from this reality.Although it leaves more questions than answers--this is not a bad thing. For instance, it seems that clouding the history of how such a Sameness was accomplished adds to the \\"timeless\\" sense of the novel. And many of the philosophical questions are well worth the mind-expanding debate. All in all, this is an excellent book I would even recommend to adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've grown fond of children's books. We take better care of our children than we do ourselves. We encourage our children to eat their vegetables whether we do ourselves or not. We encourage them to play outside whether we exercise or not. We care about what they are allowed to read, while we read trash.We should be concerned about what our children read. Reading is an intimate experience. When we read, we let someone else come inside our brains, walk around, and leave things. Sticks and stones can break your bones, but books can change the way you think. We are right to care about the sorts of things our children invite into their minds, and this concern has led to a children's literature that's better in many respects than what is supposed to be \\"adult\\" literature.I was converted to children's books in stages, as my children started being interested in reading, but the final step-the icing on the cake-was a book entitled The Giver, by Lois Lowry. It can be read in a few hours, but that does not decrease its impact, which is something like that of a sledgehammer. It is the story of a boy named Jonas who lives in what seems to be an ideal world. There is no crime, no hunger, and no dissatisfaction. Everyone is in the profession that best suits his talents. It appears to be ideal. The Greeks had a word for a place like this, and that word was \\"Utopia\\". It shows the keen insight of those old Greeks that the word means \\"nowhere\\". Nowhere is perfect. Nowhere is without problems.While the Community in which Jonas lives is without strife, it also lacks a great many other things. On the way to achieving the \\"perfect\\" community, certain sacrifices have been made. Jonas discovers this when he turns twelve and is assigned his life profession, The Receiver of Memories. Part of the price paid for utopia is loss of connection to the past. The children of the Community are not raised by their biological parents, but by foster parents who are deemed suitable for the job of parenting. After the children of the community are grown, they lose connection with their foster parents, so even family history is lost. One might think about the impact this would have on the situation in the Middle East. There wouldn't be any fighting for the Promised Land. The Promise would all be a part of the forgotten past. For those of us who would like to see peace, this notion might be quite appealing.However, Lowry's insight is that a person without a past is a person without a future. While there is virtue to be had by living in the present in the metaphorical sense, living entirely in the present without connection to the Eternal is sterile.Jonas's role as Receiver of Memory is necessary for the Community because basic survival does require some knowledge of the human past, but this knowledge is a great burden, as human history is full of pain. The Receiver of Memory remembers these unpleasant things so others won't have to. The decision was made to remove this unpleasantness from the Community's conscience. In reading this, I was reminded that some people shudder at the bloody passages in the Old Testament and regret their inclusion in the Bible. Sometimes fiction is not far from the truth.But in forgetting pain, much that was pleasant has also been forgotten: Snow, sunny days, and the love of a family. Bad weather is inconvenient, and so the weather is controlled. Sexual yearnings cause problems, and so they are eliminated by taking a pill. Even love has been removed.This brings up another theme of the book, the use of language. Children are continually urged to use language precisely. Once Jonas asks his foster father if he loves him and is told that love is a meaningless word. His foster father says that he is very fond of Jonas, but that he couldn't possibly love him because there is no such thing.Yet we, the reader, know that there is such a thing, and in the course of gaining the memories of the community, Jonas discovers not on does love exists, but that he is capable of it in its deepest form.Though there is never an explicit reference to religion, one might almost see The Giver as sequel to the story of the Fall of Man in the book of Genesis. In eating from the Tree of Knowledge, Man is separated from nature and separated from God. Mans knowledge of the universe and how to manipulate it enables him to control. The world shown in The Community in The Giver is one that logically follows from that separation. The Community controls everything, the weather, and the sexual urges of the young. The separation from nature is complete, and perhaps so is the separation from God.The theologians have a name for the complete separation from God, and that name is \\"Hell.\\" Hell is not usually presented as being so clean as the Community, nor its people as being so polite, but somehow I do believe that, like the Community, Hell is made-to-order by man.The most frequent complaint that one sees about the book is about its ending. It would be an understatement of massive proportions to say that my twelve-year-old, the Middle-Child, found the ending to be very frustrating. However, it need not be if one takes it at face value, and that is all I am going to say.The next time you would like a good, short read, and if you are tired of being force-fed someone else's sexual fantasies, let me recommend The Giver. If nothing else, it will make you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry creates a perfect world in her novel, The Giver. With suspense, foreshadowing, and many other well-used techniques, Lowry paints a story of a young boy, Jonas, who is given the burden of becoming the next Receiver for his community. The Receiver is the person who has to nurture all the memories of the world, from the past and present, yet not be able to share his discoveries with anyone else. Jonas eventually becomes overwhelmed by this task, and persuades the Giver, the previous Receiver, to change the world, as they know it.Lowry&#65533;s illustration of this Utopia is wonderful. It forces the reader to think about the benefits and the problems of a perfect, uniform world. Lowry&#65533;s precise writing leaves the reader pondering these questions: Is peace worth losing all color and beauty in a world? Is unity worth losing all personal identity? Are all utopias mind-numbing and monotonous?Personally, I truly enjoyed The Giver. It was an easy read, yet so full of questions and morals. I thought the end was very abrupt, but it only added to the effectiveness of the book. It made me think even more about the messages Lowry was cleverly trying to portray."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found this book to be very good. It is about a boy named Jonas. He has a family unit that consists of a mother, 1 adopted daughter, 1 adopted son and 1 father. In this case, Jonas is the son. Jonas has just been \\"selected\\" to be the \\"Receiver\\" or the \\"Giver\\". Now that he has the memories of sled rides, sail boat rides and other great things, he can see colors but no one else understands him so he has to try to explain everything but it is too hard. He has the ability to ask whatever he wants. There are other things in the story, but you have to read this great book to find out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As in other fine, classic books that address the great questions of society, The Giver quickly establishes its necessary mood of impending doom. At bottom line is the question that the great and fatal experiment of Communism asked during the last century, the question asked by the myriad attempts at establishing utopian societies: Can human beings be trained/coerced/tricked/cajoled into behaving themselves? Every generation must face this question and usually discovers the answer only through the agony of trial and error, for the answer it seems, is always, resoundingly, no. Four stars rather than five? As with Nancy Farmer's The House of the Scorpion, I found the book wanted at least some small kind of humor to enliven and soften the heaviness of the plot. There is indeed a place for humor in writing that deals with profound issues as Mark Twain dealt with the questions of racism, freedom, and slavery in Huckleberry Finn. Therein, I think, lies the difference between great literature and simply very fine literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world with no poverty, no sickness, no criminal intensions, a utopia you could say a perfect world apart from today's violent society. There are no colours, and no love, the community itself is very strict and organized run by a counsel of elders, who decide everything from who will receive a certain role, and one ordinary boy has to bare the incredible burden of being the Receiver of Memories, the most honored and respected job in the community. Jonas is that boy he had to receive personal lessons from The Giver (the previous receiver of memories) learning the truth about the world, digging into the past and Jonas will change his fate and discovers a dark secret that may change his life forever. I thought that this book was just a must read once I started the book I just couldn't put it down. It's like the book catches you in a trance. But the only bad thing about the book was that I thought the book ended too soon, it just jumps from the most climatic part of the story to the end. Overall, it was amazing this book is a must read and out of 5 I would rate it a 4.5 ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverLouis LowryThe Giver is an exciting book. It is a very fun and interesting book but it also has good lessons in it. It is a good book for teens and up. I think that it is a very good book and everyone should read it at any age but if a young inexperienced child read it I don't think that they would learn very much from it. They also probably wouldn't get the whole point of the book.The story takes place in what Louis thought would be the Future. So it is somewhat a real place. Personally though I don't think that the \\"Future\\" would be like this. The world is to into its ways of living, such as Christmas. Christmas is a big part of our society. And so is pain as well.The story is mostly about a boy named Jonas and the Giver. Jonas is a boy who at the beginning of the story is 11 and later on turns 12 years old. He lives in a community of plain and orderly living. When he turns 12 he and all the rest of the \\"12's\\" get their permanent occupations. He was chosen to be the communities Receiver. His job was confidential and quite different from the other jobs in the community. The Receiver before him would give all the memories of both joy and pain from what would have been experienced today and before hand. All of these memories have been taken away from the community and should not be distributed out into the community ever again. Jonas struggled with it immensely. At the end of the book he finally leaves the community and goes \\"Elsewhere\\". The Giver is a very interesting character. He had kept many secrets from Jonas until near the end of the story. Secrets like who the Giver was before he became a Giver. Did he ever get married? Have children? Did he ever really have a true life in the community instead of being locked up with his memories in one room by himself? He is the one who helped Jonas escape to \\"Elsewhere\\".I think that Louis Lowry did a very good job with this book. She had many good points and goals with this book. Many people have written books about perfect worlds and utopias but to some people that may not be their perfect world. After Jonas had been given memories about how wonderful Christmas or even just color is, his community was no longer his perfect little world. One lesson I learned is how we take so many things for granted. Like color, love from and for our loved ones and many other wonderful things. Even as simple as a boat ride or running across a field of daisies.I like the way the author writes and I plan on reading more of her books sometime. During the time I was reading it I was so engrossed in the story that sometimes when I would get up from the book and I would be doing normal everyday things that Jonas's Community usually didn't do I would almost get afraid that someone would catch me doing it. It was like I was living in the book. It sounds weird but really it is wonderful. That is how I usually know that it is a good book. It is a very fascinating book and I feel bad for anyone who doesn't have a chance to read or who doesn't want to read it at all. I definitely recommend it to teens. It is a great book to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"On the surface, the giver is the story of a young man, Jonas, who is becoming an adult in a very strange world. There is no crime, every family unit is made up of exactly a mom, a dad, a brother, and a sister, no one gets ill, no pollution, every one gets exactly the career and job that they are perfect for . . . sounds perfect! But there's a downside, too. There is no color. Children, upon reaching puberty, are given pills that they must take everyday for the rest of their lives so that they will never have any sexual desire. And though the community is told that the old, the sick, and the disabled are \\"released\\" to another community, in reality, they are euthanized - many of them by Jonas' father. Meet the results of equality taken to an extreme. Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" contains elements of Plato's Republic, as well as Thomas More's \\"Utopia.\\" This book is an essential read for any intelligent child, and an intriguing read for any adult. It's been several years since I first read \\"The Giver\\", and though I've read a bit of Plato and of More, I am still entertained and enlightened by this fantastic utopian novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is amazing. Anyone who has questions about it and the ending of it is lacking an imagination. The book ends obscurely so the reader can create one to their own delight. For the person asking about family units and such, they didn't read the whole book. This was clearly stated in the book that the family units could not name themselves because the community decided to create \\"sameness.\\" Sameness also goes for the black and white images they all see. Anyone who can not understand this must not have read the whole book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Thank you Amazon for recommending this book as I never heard of it. I read it one sitting and wanted more at the end!The book is a combination of Brave New World and Logan's Run. People live in a community where everyone is happy and conditioned from birth. All life's professions are chosen by the community elders at the child's 12th birthday. All society misfits and extreme elderly are \\"released.\\"The story centers around Jonas, who is approaching his 12th birthday. At that time there is a ceremony where he will be told his life's profession and then begin the training for it. Jonas will begin a unique profession where he will learn the truth behind the community he lives in and all the things that mosts people are not permitted to ever know. Above all he will find out what happens to those who are \\"released.\\" What he learns will either make him an important advisor to the community elders or go on a journey to find what he is missing!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is based on a powerful and provacative novel, centered around the theme of Eutopia. The movie, Pleasantville comes to mind when I think of this book. In both stories, the characters arre placed in the same perfect setting. The characters live in a black and white world. Eventually color is discovered when they become aware of deep emotions. In The Giver, Lowry forces readers to bring own thoughts into play by her descriptive writing. I could see the world he wsa painting from the very beginning. &quot;They moistened a little. The warmth spread, extending across his shoulders, up his neck, onto the side of hos face. He could feel it through his clothed parts, too: a pleasant, all-over sensation; and when he licked his lips this time, the air was hot and heavy.&quot; The characters she created were adventurous and amazingly believable. The main character, Jonas, is a young boy who lives in a perfect set world wwith no pain suffering love or fear. Everone has their own assigned role. He is assigned a special role, The Giver, when he turns twelve. The Giver is very important role becuase he keeps the whole community intact by holding memories; extreme pain to eternal bliss. While I read this book I discoverd how important it is to experience suffering, grieving and complete happiness. The Giver is a book recommended that everybody should read. It gives an escape from reality that everybody should endure."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver is perhaps one of the most provocative children's books ever written. Ms. Lowry's book is undoubtedly destined to become a &quot;masterpiece&quot; of the speculative fiction and negative utopian genres. Her skill as a writer is evident in the novel's superb structure. She slowly reveals details of the society in a natural and subtle manner; yet she has concealed some of the details so successfully that they come as a complete surprise to the reader. Through this slow method of revelation, Ms. Lowry transforms an at-first-glance utopian society into a horrible and repressive negative utopia.Ms. Lowry's vision is extremely prophetic. The society she depicts is staggeringly realistic and hits close to home. Indeed, such a society could easily evolve from current trends for political correctness and oversensitivity. Thus, her society is almost frightening in its accuracy.Overall, The Giver is masterfully crafted, as evidenced by its Newberry Award. It is most certainly worth a read, even if you are not a young adult. In fact, an older person should be able to appreciate it just as much, although an older and more experienced eye should be able to pick out minor flaws in character and idea development. The only thing that detracts from the book is its sloppily constructed ending. Abrupt and unfulfilling, it leaves too many questions unanswered and certainly disappointed me. But give the book a try if you haven't already. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This beautifully written story kept me entranced and reading the book from cover to cover without a single stop, She has left medeep in thought and with a bitter sweet solace ."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The cover always kept me from reading this book.

I first read it in third grade(now I am in sixth grade)- after I read it I bought a copy and now read it at least twice a year. I think it is a beautiful book- the characters are wonderful, especially Jonas's &quot;parents&quot;. The plot made me think more about what our future will be like- will we try to eliminate all pain- all suffering- all differences- and live in a world as horrifyingly perfect as Jonas's?

I found the story to be very intriguing. It makes you think about the &quot;what ifs&quot; that could happen in our future. The author pulls you into Jonas's world by involving you in the memories that The Giver passes on to him. Children should be briefed on the story and its elements before reading this book. I think it would be appropriate for middle school children. A teacher from Michigan."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"After I read this book it became my favorite, and it still is and it's been a year since I've read it!!!

This book really kept my attention simply because of how odd it is. It's odd, but interestingly odd. Lois Lowry does a good job at keeping the mystery going.

I thought the story was well done and very rivoting, that is, until the ending. The story goes along fine until the last chapter and it seems like Lowry just got tired and wanted to finish it off without having to really develop it. It was quite abrupt and disappointing. I know that the author wants to leave the ending open, the reader comes up with their own conclusion. But I think she was wrong with leaving it so ambiguous. Even when she was given the Newbery award she refused to clarify the ending. This is not the kind of thought provoking ending I want to give middle school students. I believe they will find it disturbing and feel cheated (as I did) at leaving it unresolved. I read \\"Gathering Blue\\" and felt much better after having read that book.Lowry did state in and interview that she sees the ending (in The Giver)as optimistic ... I can't take ambiguity! I need closure!

It is haunting, compelling, hard to put down. A lot to think about. This book should make us question where we are going and also make us take a hard look at the past. This current weekend of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday was an excellent time to read this. As the book addresses much about memories, both painful and pleasurable, this is an opportune time to reflect on our beliefs, actions towards others, and what we want for our children.

It's a great book no matter your age because of the concept behind the plot. The fact that it's also set in a futuristic society makes it appealing to the imagination.

Also, this book end with two people ready to die? You end reaing it with a heavy heart."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an interesting book. At first the book was a little hard to follow. It was difficult adjusting to the way life was described. Imagining life without color is a stretch. Color is in everything we do, everything we see, and everything we feel. Why would anyone want to go to &quot;Sameness&quot;? Why would anyone want to live life with no color or choices? Sure life would probably be a lot less difficult, but it would be so plain. Not being able to really choose a career. Not being able to choose a spouse or children would be a horrible existence. That is one of the joys in life; choosing the one person that you would want to spend the rest of your life with, the one person you want to see every day and make so much a part of your life that you are willing to combine two separate lives to make a completely new one. Another joy in life is difference. The differences in landscapes and weather, food and music are vital additions to life. Depending on where someone lives effects their choices of activities, food, and culture. Without these everything and everyone is the same. In The Giver nothing was different. No one could choose who they were going to marry or what they &quot;are going to be when they grew up&quot;. A definition of life is &quot;the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual&quot;. Without differences there is no life and without life there is nothing. The people in The Giver weren't really living, they were just wandering around in a boring existence that would seem to go on forever and was controlled by beings that led no lives themselves. &quot;Every man dies, but not every man really lives.&quot;** Braveheart"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I was in elementary school, i had read many novels written by Lois Lowry. But this has got to be the best book she has ever written, i recommend this book to all people, it was great!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book, in my opinion. It is about a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a supposedly perfect world-no color, no feelings, no changes or decisions of any kind. Spouses and jobs are chosen by the commitee. Jonas is chosen to receive the memories of the past, of happiness and pain, of feelings and color. When he learns of the past, he finds he cannot live how he lives, with no emotions or feelings, so he decides to set off on a mission to free himself-and his community-from the world with no feelings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry, when will you come out with a sequel to this unable to be put down novel. My fifth graders agreed. They say Hollywood should make this story into a movie."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy named Jonas, who is chosen out of a group of kids to take on a role of the reciever. This book takes place in the future when climate is controlled and colors are no more, all of this to make living easier. So no one can make their own decisions or have their own ideas. Everytime a child is born their life is already assigned to them, their job and also their mate. The people are just born into this with no recalection of how the world really works. A guy who used to be called the reciever is now called the Giver. He teaches Jonas about colors and winter and everything before it was all controlled, and he cannot share this with anyone. I liked this book. I would recomend it to anyone who likes books that are about what the future might be like."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the story THE GIVER, the importance of folklore in a culture is shown. This story takes place in a futuristic time, though it's not like the people seem to be more advanced, just more controlled. No one can make any choices for themselves, though they don't want to because they could get it &quot;wrong&quot;. Animals are mythical creatures, the sun, colors, snow, hills, and everything that could be an inconvience to their society is gone. All are supposedly equal, though it doesn't seem that way. The Giver in this story is an Old man who has generations of memories from many other givers, and when his time comes to be &quot;released&quot;, he has to have passed on all of the memories to a chosen person. Neither the Giver nor the receiver can share any of their knowledge with anyone else, this is how the people want it to be, without pain, but without pleasure. No one knows their was a past, no one knows there will be a future, they just exist. Jonas is assigned to the job of Receiver of Memory, and his ignorant life has ended. As he learns more and more about the past, the different feelings and things that exist, he can't understand why the whole society doesn't want to know of these things. So he and the Giver devise a plan in which memories will be released back into the community, and they would learn what life should be like with memories, culture, and love. Folklore is important because of how it can teach and relay ideas to help improve a culture or a person. Without folklore, then our societies would be as boring as the next, nothing to set us apart from others. I think THE GIVER tells this in a very different way, and I hope that you will enjoy the book as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really found this book really interesting and eye-opening. The topic on controlled societies has been around for a long time. The idea of \`releasing' people who are not qualified for living in the community was also used by Plato. He also emphasized giving people a specific job they are responsible for in the community, just like the community in The Giver had done. In this book, there is a society that is totally controlled. What the people do, who they marry, their schedules for the day, etc. are all decided by the Elders. The members socialize with people in their groups; the children with their appropriate age groups, and the adults with whom they work among. The people know no real pain, pleasure, and memories. They do what they are told and expected of them, and no questions are asked; for them, life is perfect. In this community, there is a boy, Jonas, who is anticipating the Ceremony of the Twelves, where the eleven year old children are assigned the job they will be responsible for the rest of their lives. He is worried that he will be disappointed with the assignment he receives, but is semi-reassured by his parents who tell him the Elders know each child and what is best for each one. The ceremony finally takes place, and Jonas is skipped over. However, Jonas is called last in his group. He has not been assigned, he has been selected as the Receiver of Memory, the most important job in the community. This job will require pain, something the people in the community do not often experience, and when they do, only for a short amount of time. Up until the part where Jonas starts to receive his training, the extent of the controlled society is not fully explained. What Jonas learns and experiences from the current Receiver of Memory is unexplainable and not to be talked with to the other members of the community. They would not be able to handle it. The experience of seeing how someone is released causes Jonas to begin to think the controlled society is not right, and he can not just sit back and do nothing about it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an extremely good book. It portrayed a town that was controlled by their government of elders. The people didn't care that they were controlled because that's all they ever knew. In the book a boy, Jonas, gets chosen to recieve the memories of a time forgotten by most.That was a choice that the elders of the town made for him. They expected him to be strong and help the town by being the all knowing. Nobody could see color except Jonas and the reciever before him. Color, rain, snow, the sun, weather, the knowledge of happiness, pleasure, and pain was lost to this town. They had conformed to 'sameness',as they say in the book. The memories were lost and only passed on from one person to one other. This process that Jonas went through to recieve the memories was and example of &quot;shared remembrance&quot;. It is important to all people and none should be denied of that remembrance. It carries on culture, difference, and the power to chose. It gives people their own minds and although that might be dangerous it is not anyone's place to chose for them. Jonas agrees with this idea and runs away from the isolated town.This would be an appropriate book for folklore study because it shows that no matter how impossible the idea of something is, that if you believe in it then it may come true. It also shows that people can make up their own minds if they have the right knowledge. If you don't have the right knowledge then you become dependent on what others tell you. In the world of unexplained phenomenon you need to share knowledge of what you know and remember or you might make a decision under false pretences. Here comes another example of &quot;shared remembrance&quot;. Folklore is a difficult subject and this book sets an example for the people in the field of study for folklore. It sets an example by showing determination in what you believe. If you are determined then you can help make people understand you and your view on things."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Fantastic.

I really liked it and wanted to include it with other books by Lowry. But I really didn't think the kids would like it much (or understand it). Was I ever wrong!!

And I got a better understanding of the depth of a fifth grader's comprehension!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I totally reccomend this book. I had to read this book for my English class and at first I thought it would be really boring, boy, was I in for a suprise.

Accept people's unique traits, because that is what makes the world go round!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an exciting book! It tells what seems that Lois Lowry thinks might be the future! It is like when there is no color, no music, no wars/battles, you never get hurt...it is like a totally different world! You live in a dwelling with a mother who isn't your birthmother, a father that was assigned to you &quot;mother&quot; and a sibling of a different gender. It is so exciting! Jonas (a boy who is curious about OUR world) gets assigned to one of the hraddest and MOST important jobs in the whole community. The book is a huge adventure and has a wonderful ending! This book was probably the best book I have ever read and best I will ever read!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"No one can describe the magnitude and the power of this book in a review. Miss Lowry weaved together words, storylines and a philisophical world of the future unlike anyother being could do.

Everyone should read this book at some point, it is life changing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Recently, I've been reading thick and complicated books, and I was upset when I had to read The Giver in my 8th Grade reading class. Somehow, I willed myself to pick it up and read it. I was pleasantly surprised! This is the beginning book to all the great novels about alternative governments such as 1984, Animal Farm, and Brave New World. It all begins with a boy named Jonas who is the average, polite boy of his community. In this community, when a child turns 12 (often called a Twelve), he is given a life-long job that he must fulfill until he reaches the House of the Old (otherwise known as a nursing home, ha!) Jonas has been working at many different places so it is unclear of what his job should be. At ceremony, Jonas is shocked when he finds out that he has been elected as the Receiver of Memory. The Receiver of Memory is apprenticed by The Giver. What is This Giver? The Giver runs the community and keeps the people happy and long-working. Jonas is shocked when The Giver reveals secrets about the community and its people. this book compels Jonas to begin a long journey in search of the truth. The story and setting of this book are very well described. Suspense and excitement grew and I couldn't seem to put this book down! I would recommend the alternative books: 1984, Animal Farm, and Brave New World when you finish this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowery has written some good books in the past. But nothing that that she has written is half as wonderful as The Giver. Jonas, the main character, lives in a world of no pain. When Jonas is assigned a job in the community, he is picked out to receive memories of the past. The memories are of joy, pain, evil and everything in between. There is definitely no turning back. I liked The Giver because it has many different characters and made me ask questions about the meaning of life. Jonas the main character lives in a life so different from ours. However he relates to our world. He almost makes us hate it. He has many experiences with the characters in the book, such as his parents, close friends, and the Giver. I think that The Giver is a unique book because it attempts to portray the meaning of life in a way that is keeps in the story. Some people might disagree with my ideas. Others may think that this book is confusing. It is a little confusing, because it shows you what is important and doesn't tell you that. For people, that to try to that try to rush through books as fast as possible to the Human brain, it may be confusing. Now when you read this book, which I highly suggest you do, you will realize immediately that it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When Jonas and the rest of the Elevens (surmised to be eleven year olds) approaches December, they know that the upcoming \\"graduation\\" is a significant change. When they become Twelves, their jobs in the Community will be announced. The Elders have been observing them for their entire lives, and they will hold these positions for the remainder of their time. At the ceremony, Jonas is alarmed when the Elder in charge assigns him to the job of the Receiver. He had never heard of the job previously. For all of his life, he has been guided in acting uniformly with whomever was nearby. How was he supposed to do that now?Nothing in his environment has variances. Crimes have been banished. Hate was out-ruled. Love dissolved along with malevolence and bloodshed. As Jonas experiences the teachings of The Giver, he solitarily confronts life prior to his Community. Memories that The Giver must pass on to Jonas are both excruciating and intoxicating, yet they make him think. They force him to turn his mind on doubting conformers and apprehending change.Although the story can get a little sci-fi/freaky, the message it conveys superceeds all of its negatives. A definite must read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This Book is the greatest. It pulled me into it and aroused my curiosity. It made me feel what Jonas, the main character, was feeling. It was incredible how Lois Lowry depicted everything in this story. The way Jonas discovers color, feelings, and love is mind boggling. I can not get over how great this story was."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when I was 21 and more than a little hesitant to read what I deemed a &quot;children's book.&quot; I could not have been more wrong. This is an amazing book. A new 1984 aimed at young adults, but an unbelievably great read for persons of all ages. This is one of the only books I have ever been able to read more than once, and it has not yet ceased to amaze me. I highly reccomend this for readers of all ages, and see it as one of the best written and most original stories I have come across."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is an AWESOME book. I was assigned to read it for my Freshman Pre-AP English class. It was kinda slow in the beggining but after about 10 pages I couldn't put it down! This book really opened my eyes to how horrible it would be to not be able to chose anything and see absolutely no color! I even shhhed my mom a few times while I was reading. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10. It is a MUST READ! I know that it deserved every award it recives!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a futuristic community where sameness is the rule, decisions are made for its citizens,and everyone is safe and provided for. It was skillfully written to cause the reader to feel almost positively (at first) about the practices of the people in this community until he/she thinks twice about them. As the story unfolds, one realizes that a terrible mistake has been made in creating this society. Some have said that this book is not suitable for young people to read because it is likely to cause (or aggravate) depression. However, when I read the book I felt just the opposite feeling: gratitude. It made me realize that it is only because we experience pain that we can experience joy. Also, when reading this book, it is important to realize that our world is not like that in The Giver. It is better. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book that is about a child growing up in a place that is totally shut out to the rest of the world and because it is that means that all the people in this town have rules and regulations to follow but if you call that folklore than I have always had the wrong definition because I thought that folklore was a set of stories that people base their lives on. But in another aspect it is folklore because the way the people in the communtiy live is all based on the way things used to be so yes The Giver is an apppropriate book for the study of folklore it makes a person think real hard and wonder does this book fit the desciption of folklore and that has to me judged by the reader. I believe this is an excellent book to read if you want your mind to wander because I know mine sure did."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"THE GIVER gives the reader an insight on lifes possibilities and questions the power of authority. Lois Lowry uses her incredible creativity a whole new world in which her charecters live. The society has rules and regulations that everyone must live and abide by or they will be &quot;released&quot; from the community. This is a heart touching story of a young boy and his quest for truth and freedom from the harsh judgements of his life. I would recommend this book to every age because it includes creativity for the young ones and a strong and complex sense of understanding and wit for adults. This is one of my favorit books and I Promise it will be one of yours too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My 5th grade teacher read this book to our class, I soon bought it. It's soo great! I think people should read some of it. I couldn't get my hand off of it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In the tradition of &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;1984&quot;, Lois Lowry changes from her mood from a very funny book writer to make her one and only science fiction book - and her best.&quot;The Giver&quot; suggests the wonders and horrors of a Utopia. Jonas, the main character, when he becomes twelve, is assigned the absolutely most important role in his Community. It is to receive memories from an older man. No one else has memories. They look up to him for advice.At the end of the book, Jonas and the older man, The Giver, decide they need to share memories, and Jonas leaves the Community. When the Receiver leaves the Community, the whole Community begins to experience memories, and everyone goes crazy.Jonas's journey is to Elsewhere. No one in the Community knows what Elsewhere is, but Jonas finds out that Elsewhere is what we live in, not the dull, boring Utopian society Jonas is used to.Straight forward, &quot;The Giver&quot; is, by far, the most influential book I've ever read. From my point of view, it shows that if we don't change our ways to good, they'll be changed for us - for good. We also learn that a perfect life is definately not perfect by the standards of an un-perfect society, and that the only way everything will be perfect by both standards is when we are in Heaven. I encourage you to read this book. By the page number, you will think it's a children's book, but by the book, you will be influenced like you never thought possible by a book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a society where pain, fear, and emotion have been deleted, one person known as the Receiver holds the collective memories of mankind. Now Jonas, a happy twelve year old, has been chosen to take the position of the Receiver. As Jonas learns more about the way humanity used to be, he comes to the realization that no society, no matter how well ordered and efficient, can compete with true feeling. He sees the hypocrisy and coldness with which his world operates, and cannot stand it. Now, he must find a way to bring emotion back to the world. And he will do it, even if it means doing the unthinkable. Lois Lowry has created a world that is so well ordered that it runs with little trouble. Much like the society that Adulous Huxley created in Brave New World, these people have given up the freedom to feel in favor of order and control. The Giver's society is completely socialistic, and this helps create a feeling of familiarity with our world. Lowry's commentary on socialist society helps us address the question of how anybody could live without personal freedoms. The Giver makes it easy to see how one could atrophy in a society which produces ease, simply submitting in favor of a good job and easy life over uncertainty. Because of this, Lowry's book succeeds beyond the likes of 1984, because her society seems close enough to be frightening. After all, a society caused by a collective submission could occur much easier than one caused by the worldwide takeover of a government force."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver teaches society an important lesson that it most likely hasn't spent much time thinking about. That lesson is the importance of a culture knowing its history and heritage in order to savor the present. In the novel there exists a society that experiences no pain nor hunger, dilemmas nor uncertainties. Everything has its organized plan, as every person has his/her own pre-chosen fate. This strife-free society comes at a tremendous price, which only the title character, the Giver, and his protege, Jonas, realize. This price is the knowledge of themselves and their past. The people of the society have no concept of the generations before them. To them, there is nothing beyond the Community. They kill those that they claim to &quot;Release,&quot; due to old age or request to be released. In order to free the citizens from pain and burden, the memories of their past lie on one chosen member, named the Giver. It is the Giver's job to carry the weight of the past on his shoulders, and his alone. To the oblivious Community, this plan is ideal. They go about their simple lives, having to make no choices nor experience any suffering. What only the Giver, and his student, Jonas, realize is that they also miss out on the good memories, such as sunshine, color and music. There is no love in the Community. There is truly no real emotion beyond the shallow feelings that arise during the routine days. By freeing themselves from strife, the Community has unknowingly sacrificed any point to existance. They merely continue about their ways like robots. Jonas and the Giver resolve themselves to returning the memories to the Community. They, being the only ones to experience the joys of choice, realize how important it is for everyone to share that. Without a shared remembrance of the past, there is no way to savor the present, nor prepare for the future. One's heritage is his/her identity, and without an identity, there is no true living."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; would be a good read for a child. But lacks the literary greatness that I've come to expect in books. In my opinion, this was just a wrip off of Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; produced in a manner that is more up to date and understandable. By now, we are aware of comformity, and with the Soviet scare now longer at our backs, maybe the subject is dead?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's THE GIVER is an excellent novel with a meaningful message related to the importance of folklore. While the futuristic novel might seem as far from folklore as possible, upon further inspection it is evident that THE GIVER is closely related to folklore. Folklore often consists of historical stories passed from one generation to the next. THE GIVER concerns the passing of history from generation to generation, though not conventionally. In the world of THE GIVER, people have detached themselves from true emotion, vitality and spirit in order to gain control and simplicity. Rather than being shared with the entire Community through common mediums such as oral stories and books, the past is heaped upon one sacrificial person so that the Community can remain without pain or true emotion. This sacrificial person, called the Receiver, is forced to carry all memories from when the world was imperfect. The Committee of Elders, the major decision making body of the Community, calls upon the Receiver for the wisdom of the past when faced with a new and different situation which they do not know how to handle. With knowledge of past mistakes and successes, the Receiver is able to advise the Elders. THE GIVER demonstrates how the past is essential for any community to function because of the wisdom it provides. Everyone has both a right and a responsibility to know the tales about the past which provide this wisdom, as the novel illustrates. The Receiver experiences immense pain so that the rest of the community can remain free from distressing memories. When there were two people sharing the memories the pain was lessened, and by the end of the novel the reader realizes that the community should share the past together. Thus, THE GIVER shows the need to share memories of the past with everyone. THE GIVER not only shows the need for a past, is exhibits a need for the wisdom folklore provides. It also illustrates that learning about folklore cannot be a solitary process, but that everyone must participate in learning of their past. Through an intriguing story, Lowry conveys a powerful message. I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone, regardless of age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book.

I think that the cover will grab your attention because most of it is black and there is a little light. The Giver was created in the year 1993 by Lois Lowry I think that she made a really good book. This book is totally recommended to 5th graders and/or higher because you would know what you have in your life so far, that it's really good and because I read it in 5th grade.Well, The Giver is about a boy named Jonas gets assigned the most important job in the small town he lives in, it's gray to most people, they use bikes, they are scared of air planes, it's a futuristic society and there is no freedom or choice. He figures out hidden secrets that hurt him and change his point of living. He changes for the rest of his life. Well as assured there is always a theme and this books theme will for sure drive you in and read it, fight for your life and the ones you truly love, and make it the best you can make it where ever you are. Well of course you want to know everything in life like pain, cold , hotness, and other feelings about life and he feels good and bad , but I still don't know why there is only one giver but I'm not the author.My opinion about the book is that it is really , really good and sad enough to cry but with a really good but happy ending. It's sad because of the really bad things that happen like his dad does to a one of the poor little twins with no fault and the dad has no feelings of his job. The author made it sound so real because of the description. Like when a twin was born and one had to go, Janos's dad put a needle throw the poor little babies forehead and then the baby to shack, he gets thrown in a box and to the trash. It has a perfect ending because you can feel so happy yet you stay wanting more. It shows why you should appreciate what you have so far. Of course there is something I don't like about the book and what I don't like about the book is the killing that goes on to the poor little babies or kids but it makes it better, and there totally needs to be another book.For sure but I still rate it 4.5 out of 5 total stars. Until there is anther book I would rate it 4.90 out of 5 stars.

At first the reader believes he is in a perfect world, but gradually awareness comes that something is very wrong. The serious thematic elements like euthanasia and infanticide are handled in a non-gratuitous manner. I made my husband read it, and he has since recommended it to friends.

See if you can figure it out.)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a society of sameness. There is plenty of food and housing for everyone. Everyone in the community does their fair share to help and provide. Everyone looks out for each other to keep each other safe. They rarely experience pain, and they don't appreciate pleasure. Nobody hates, and nobody loves. They live in a garden of eden, and the old man who is \\"The Giver\\" is the tree of knowledge.This is a good book for anybody around 10 yrs and up. It makes you think about communism, socialism, and free will."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a world that strives for \\"sameness\\", Jonas literally begins to see things differently. War and pain have been eliminated, even people's jobs are chosen for them. To makes an interesting read, a book needs conflict. Jonas is that conflict. Just as pre-teen Jonas questions things, the book asks the target audience of young adults to do the same.The prospect of a world in which every human action becomes robotic has become a reality. Child rearing is a system controlled by the authoritarian rulers. Work is only interupted by occaional leisure. Action is taken without thought. Jonas witnesses a shocking act by his father that completely changes his peception of his world. Being trained that the Receiver of Memory, Jonas is given information beyond the average person. He trained as the keeper of knowledge most people will never know. What he sees haunts him. As the apprentice to the current receiver, Jonas finds an ally. He is not the only one uncomfortable with his world. Jonas seeks to make a change.Aspects of \\"The Giver\\" are well thought-out. The characters are developed nicely to fit in the scheme of the plot. The ending seemed to be rushed and fell short of expectations. Many readers may not understand the author's choice for an ending. In the big picture, \\"The Giver\\" is a well-developed read for young adults and adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I remember reading this book in school it was great then and its still great.

I never knew it was a 3 book series."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that The Giver is a very enjoyable book for young adults, and it is a great classroom tool because it covers so many important themes and ideas, such as growing up, questioning authority, making moral judgments, utopia, deceit, finding a sense of self, etc etc etc. The story of Jonas' identity crisis and his realization of the lies that have been told to him are very rateable. Young adults struggle with similar identity issues, and are coming to realize that their parents and teachers are not perfect or all-knowing. Further, this is a great novel for helping students develop a societal awareness, and question the choices that are made without their knowledge or consent, whether on a home, school, local, or national level. Basically, it's a great entryway to an exploration of many different themes.The reactions of the students in my placement last semester were mixed. While most of them enjoyed the story, they despised the open ending, wanting to know exactly what happened to Jonas and Gabe. They were also shocked to find out that a woman wrote the novel (for most of the month, I guess they thought 'Lois' was actually 'Louis')! Further, our central question was about utopia, and whether a perfect community could exist. This was a fun topic for them to debate and they were able to create their own utopias at the end of the unit. Overall, they had a positive experience with the novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The John Newberry Award winning children's novel, The Giver, was such a pleasure to read. I remember reading it as a child and feeling consumed into another time and place, and being so interested by the characters I was reading of, and years later I felt the same way. A great book to \\"get lost in\\" as it really forces you to think about the world we live in. The story follows a young boy who exists in a world of what they call, \\"sameness.\\" In this world everything is controlled leaving no chance of fear, anger, uncertainty, or any other unpleasant emotions. When Jonas, the young boy, turns 12, the path that is assigned to him will change his life forever, and this wonderful story takes you on the journey with him and his teacher (\\"the giver\\"). This is a story of hope, courage, human nature, love, passion, self-discovery, and so much more! A must read for all young adults and older!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read it in my 8th grade english class, which was a million years ago, but I remember it being the best book I've ever read in school, and everyone in my class loved it as well.

So, I thought it was high time to read it once more as an adult and teacher. I enjoyed it just as much as the first time. I think this was probably the first dystopian book I had ever read, and now I'm hooked and I think I have this book to thank for that. When reading it for the second time, I did notice some plot holes and some improbable events. But, it didn't ruin anything for me because I automatically suspended disbelief. After all, who knows what really is possible in such a future? Plus, what may be unrealistic to us may not be unrealistic in this world, as the people truly don't know any better. Really, if you like dystopians, this a classic book you have to read at least once. If you don't think you like dystopians, this would be a great segue into the genre. I will fondly look back on this book as one of the first YA dystopians and an excellent story.I listened to the audio book and I absolutely loved the narrator. He has such an amazing voice that is full of emotion. He truly brought the book to life. I also would love to use the audiobook in the classroom because kids could learn a lot about reading aloud from this narrator."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver ReviewThe book I read is called The Giver. The setting of the story is in a community. Jonas, the main character, is an 11 year old boy who attends a ceremony where he is turning 12. At the ceremony Jonas finds that his job will be the Receiver of Memories. Jonas gets his memories from the Giver. The Giver is the original Receiver of Memories. Jonas is lucky to be the Receiver of Memories.To be the Receiver of Memories the Giver has to give Jonas the memories by having Jonas lie on a bed and the Giver touches his back. Jonas has his eyes closed, he is relaxed and he receives the memories.The Giver has bad memories and good memories. One bad memory was war. A good memory was Christmas when he sees a family all gathered together around the Christmas tree and opening presents.Jonas wants to leave the community because he wants to make choices instead being forced to follow rules that he doesn't want to follow. He wants to see color and he wants the memories to be real. He also wants to share the memories with other people in the community.I liked this book and would recommend this book to ages 12 and up.

With the help of his elderly friend, Jonas uncovers the mysteries of the past and faces a terrible decision about the future.The Giver is a completely unique novel about love, beauty, the value of life, and the things that make us truly human.

I read the first half of this book with middle school students and what I found interesting was that they were stuck on the peculiarity of this society. We would go on in the story and the discussion would always go back to how different the society was. The story also made students think about how there are limitations in our own society, questions that no one is really answering. This is a wonderfully written story that makes you wonder why we view things the way we do. This book really made me think, making it entertaining and relevant for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Awesome utopian literature. Shows how you can not control every aspect of humanity. Awesome to take something everyone has and take it away to give it two only person."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Before theThe Hunger Games,The Giverdefined juvenile dystopian literature. It is the story of a highly controlled society, where residents are assigned jobs at age twelve. Sexuality, morality, ethics, language, and memories are regulated. The sole exception to this Orwellian nightmare is the Receiver of Memories, a highly prestigious post equivalent to an historian and political advisor.When Jonas is selected to be trained as the next Receiver, he is shocked. Training involves the Giver (Jonas' nickname for the Receiver), transmitting ancient memories from generations past. Color, climate, war, and love have faded from humanity. Jonas is freed by the loosened restrictions of his speech, but weighted by the burden of knowledge. He begins to question the idea of release--where infants and the elderly are euthanized. Jonas also wants to spread some of the memories around, rather than bear the burden of memories for all humanity.The ending is anticlimactic by contemporary standards. There is no big war, no active defiance of the state. Rather, a revelation leads the main character to make a choice. Is it better to face a reality with pain or a fiction with blunted tranquility? The motif is simple enough for mature elementary and middle school students, but with writing strong enough to suit adults readers.The Giveris worthy of its place as a children's classic."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am in grade seven and I loved this book. it is thoughful and flows beautifully from one scene to the next. lois lowry provides a stunning read for all ages, leaving the ending with endless possibilities. one thing that bothered me is that lowry could have elaborated much more near the ending of the book. the book would be a much more effective book and lengthened it as well. also ifeel lowry did a great job with the emotion of sadness and with the deeper message lying beneath the surface. overall i absolutely adore this book, with just one small drawback."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Mr. A's 8th grade LA class liked this book's themes and symbolism; however, the perceived slow pace turned some of us off, and the ambiguous ending was not appreciated by all.

Thought provoking imagery and mind bending situations. Read this with my children, they loved it. Caused a flood for the Author with us as we then ordered most of the other items she has written. Great story with a what are we doing mindset"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a fascinating story of a young man named Jonas who lives in an isolated community that has chosen to live meticulous societal laws that hinder freedom of choice and give the image of being a perfect place. Every member of the community is assigned a role and when Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he is personally taught by The Giver, who holds the secrets and memories of life before the community changed, or in essence, the truth.The book really took me into a mindset that I didn't expect. I imagined the difficulties I would have by experiencing things that none of my friends or family members could relate to. Imagining myself trying to explain what love feels like to someone who has never experienced it in any way, shape, or form was almost painful. I could almost feel the loneliness of having a vision that is beyond that of any of my associates or loved ones, yet not being able to express to them the real significance of our surroundings.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the psychological roller-coaster ride that the book took me on. I had to ask myself many times how I would respond to the situations that Jonas was in if it were me. Lowry wrote in simple context yet portrayed her message very well through examples and the memories Jonas receives."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an awesome story about the life of Jona.In it he is nevous about becoming a twelve and becomingan adult.

It often is on the curriculum for 5th and 6th grades. Many of the themes require more mature students to be able to discuss the difficult social issues. I highly recommend a parent read this book if his/her child is reading it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is every adolescent's frustrated view of the world given a fictional future reality. Pills keep you from enjoying sex, your parents are obsessive-compulsively normal, and only one person in the whole city knows what's going on and how things got that way. One very special boy decides to break the chain. So far so good: we're talking Huck Finn in the 22nd century. Unfortunately, our hero's end is so open-ended, it begins to feel like the clones back in squaresville had it right all along. In my world, that makes The Giver a moral tale in support of oppressive conformity hiding in the sheep's clothing of an anti-social fable. Gross. Sometimes being coy is just wrong."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was pretty good except for some disturbing parts. Lois Lowry did an excellent job describing all of the memories that the main charater Jonas was given in his job that was chosen for him at the age of tweleve. His job is to recieve memories from this man called the Giver. In Jonas's &quot;perfect society&quot; there is no color, choices, music, or feelings. When I say feelings I mean nothing. They do not feel love, pain, sadness, or memories like war, death, animals,(yes they don't have animals or know what they are)weather, cars, airplanes, or holidays. That isn't even all of the things they don't have or know about. They also chose you husband/wife. You do not get any say in who it is. There is no choice in this community. That isn't the most disturbing of all. In the community when you become &quot;useless&quot; or old you are moved to the house of the old. After a while when they think you become really &quot;useless&quot; you are killed by being injected with a clear liquid. If you think that is disturbing they do the same thing with babies too! Only 50 babies are born a year by the birthmothers (a job you can get) if twins are born or a baby isn't OK to be given to a family (yes they are given children they do not have them) they kill them with the same liquid as the old people except it is injected into their forehead!This book utterly disturbed me. If you do not like to read about gruesome death I strongly advise you not to read this."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Young Jonas, eleven and turning twelve, lives in a community of the future where everyone is happy and everyone is the same - to the point that sunshine has been 'edited out' and citizens don't see colors. The young lad is selected to be a keeper of memory, which means that the previous Keeper will give him his memories (by laying hands on him, Vulcan style). These are collective memories, of war, famine, biological families, snow, colors and sunshine (all eliminated from this 'utopian society'). Jonas feels colors and snow, decides they are good, snatches a little baby that was about to be euthanized and heads for the hills, with the blessing of his Keeper. The idea is that as soon as he's gone, the painful memories he had inside would spread out into the community and society would be transformed.The writing is good, and the ideas sound interesting at first. The intent is fairly clear: this utopia of the future is collectivized, a sort of communism pushed to the extreme. The fact that the book was written during the Cold War tells you all you need to know about the intent and context. But the book ultimately fails because the ideas are not explored, they're just thrown out there, with the vaguest hint as to how this came to be. The inhabitants seem so thoroughly brainwashed that they are just lines on a page: they lack plausibility or any third dimension of thought and genuine feeling. The 'way out' is, again, simplistic; it seems a sleight of hand, an easy way out of the plot. If you want to read a far better description of an alternative reality, try The Left Hand of Darkness, or The House of the Scorpion (though the latter suffers from the same structural flaw of a rushed, easy ending)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was not required reading for me in school, and I would have missed The Giver all togeather were it not for a friend who insisted that I should read it.I just finished the book last night and I have to say I was floored. though I admit I probably woudn't have gotten so much out of it, had I read it as a child. to me the genius to The Giver is the the way that Lowry slowly builds the world of The Community, so that the reader does not fully realize the disurbing emptiness of Jonas's reality until quite late in the story. Perhaps even more suprising is that until that point there is a twisted kind of logic to the society in which Jonas lives, this certainly does make you question yourself. I was fancinated by The Giver himself, though the character of the wise old man can be found in coutless other novels, I find somthing unique and endearing about him. I have a have a habit of reading aloud when I'm alone and especially taken with a book, but the seen in which Jonas's father \\"releses\\" the smaller twin made me wish i hadn't actually said the words. I won't be getting over that scene in a hurry.

The book is about a society in which each child's profession is chosen for him. Only one child at a time is trained as The Receiver, the only one who knows emotions. He receives that information from The Giver. The book contains visions of murder and suicide that I do not believe are appropriate for children this age. (It also gave me nightmares.) In particular, I object to a murder that is committed by a respected parent. I think that a child could and would think that parents cannot be trusted after reading this book. I also disagree with the book's depiction of child suicide and murder of the elderly.I think that so many children like the book because their teachers present the book in a positive way. Children expect that they will be assigned to read good books, not lousy books, and the teachers support that expectation. Speaking as a former teacher, I would never have assigned this book to my class. Speaking as a parent, I would never have encouraged my child to read this book. It is sick."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Newberry Awards are most useful for telling a reader which books to avoid.

At one point the book was banned in many schools and I can see why. Do you really want your children to read about babies being murdered by their own parents and tossed down a garbage chute? That's only one example of this warped tale. The book is so dark that I think it can disturb children and possibly adults as well. The points made in the book can be made without the intense darkness and fear pervading the story.I don't think any 7th grader is emotionally mature enough to read The Giver. When I was in middle school we read a short story by Ray Bradbury that made all of the same points (in a SHORT story no less)without the horror.

Some of the main characters are Jonas,the Giver,Jonas's parents, and Gabriel. The setting of this book is in a private community. Some of the main conflicts are that Jonas gets. To the age where he gets assigned his jobs. Something specail is when they get there jobs. The place they're at is a dystopia. I liked the book at first, but then it got boring.

The plotting was thin, the characterization was uneven, the characters themselves were described as smart but acted like idiots, the writing was juvenile. I had to go look and see if a teenager wrote this - no, it's an experienced writer. She's got no excuse. The book is a hack, in the original sense of the word. It takes pieces of other stories, hacks them to pieces, and reassembles them - badly.The first part starts out decently written - if you haven't watched TV or read any science fiction for the past 50 years you won't see what's coming, but if you have you'll smirk at the rather transparent \\"hidden\\" aspects of the society. The trouble is when these things are revealed it's supposed to be shocking, and it's not. I can only assume the award committee would never lower themselves to consume popular lowbrow media because everything in this book has been done, over and over, ad infinitum, since the 60's. Soylent Green, Star Trek, Twilight Zone, Asimov, etc - all did it first and honestly, did it far better.Haven't been this disappointed in a book in ages. This is what kids are expected to read in school across the country? This is supposed to make them think? Why is this particular book so popular with the adults who educate kids?It's getting made into a movie - and for once I can see this fact improving a book. This was *made* for the movies; what seems terribly shallow on the page might seem deep and meaningful on screen. Although I can only hope they dispense with the \\"Blue Eyes Soooo Special!\\" bit, because that bit just makes me sick."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't recommend the book the Giver to most people.

Everything was decided for them. Their jobs, marriages, even children. These people didn't see colour, they didn't have real feelings about life. Every year when you turn 12 you would be assigned a role in the community. But this time Jonas was selected. He was to become the next Receiver of Memory. He would receive the memories of the past, which no one else would understand. These memories are painful and scary yet some are beautiful and mysterious.

When Jonas begins his training with The Giver, he is exposed to pain, colour, love and sadness. Jonas is not allowed to talk about his training to anyone so he must bare all of these feelings for himself. He learns the real truth about his community. Jonas can't stand to live in his community any longer and he and the Giver devise a plan. This plan could lead Jonas to his death, or lead Jonas to a life of love, colour, and possibly even pain.Steph K. 7R C.C.P.S"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"a story that is set in a futeristic world where there is no problens or pain. This book was decent. It was exciting but was very open ended and confusing at times. Despite those reasons i still loved this book because it kept me on the edge of my seat and it was very discriptive especially at the end when he had new experiances that were previously unheard of. All in all i would recomend this book to any reader of science fiction and/or fantasy"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an amazing book, I thought. Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. This book is about a boy, named Jonas, who is entering the community as a new adult. This boy is running into many problems, such as pain or release. The pain is horrible, so can he take it? I think if more people in our society read this book we would cherish our world, and all the colours within it. If there was a sequel to The Giver I would definitely read it!Elsa 7R"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book has generally been described as a book about a utopia, while we ignore the pressing issue: this book is a dystopia. Much more that a miscategorization, this book is generally poorly written. With little to no figurative language, how can we expect our children to learn to write while reading just the basics of language. Metaphors and irony make political commentaries good.There are also logical errors in her book. It does not follow that death and leaving the bounds of the community would have the same consequence, yet in The Giver, they do. There are much better books that offer much the same message of The Giver while using better language and better logic like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Anthem, and 1984. If we are looking to educate on a dystopia, any of those books would provide much more substance."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ok this book really stinks! The place where the main character, Jonas lives has really weird rules. Ok to the point. One point in the book people are seperated from animals! Think what you would be like with out your cat or any pet to keep you company at night or morning or the afternoon. It is so sad. That is not the worst part. One part in the book they talk about that twins are not allowed in this place. If a mom has twins guess what happens? They weigh the twins and which one is lighter they get rid of. The other one they make nice and comfortable. Here is what happens in deeper detail. They weighed the twins. One is lighter so they put in a garbage shoot and let it get crushed. Meanwhile the &quot;lucky&quot; baby who weighed more is nice and comfortable and is smiling at his or her lost twin. Why they do this? I don't know! I took the book and threw it and cried and never read it again. My friends told me that the book NEVER recovers after this part. I do not recomond this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"this was such a boring book! I had to read it for school, and i kept falling asleep! it is confusing and has a very wierd plot. An old man passing on memories by touching someone? give me a break! dont read this book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; is a novel which deals with the problems boy named Jonas who lives in a totalitarian system.I this system,the habitants are genetically manipulated so that they are not able to feel.Only the &quot;Receiver of Memories&quot; has feelings and Jonas is chosen to be the next one. In his assignement he is able to get to know the whole truth about their society which reveals enormous cruelties.The author employs the third- person-point of view but she stays close to the protagonist's perspective,so that the reader is able to identify with Jonas.The novel is easy to read and to understand because she often uses hypotaxes.In regard to the content and the action, the text is diaphonous and the characters do not have uncommon personalities.I think,the novel is approciated for younger people from about 10 to 14 years because the plot is often flat and ordinary. So in my opinion,the text does not belong to high-quality-literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is widely used in English class by middle schools in Southwestern Pennsylvania.I have heard many complaints from parents about the violent subject matter contained in this story.After reading the book, I find that the most offensive incident was the murder of a newborn twin via lethal injection. As newborns have no visible veins, the infant was injected in the forehead.Now if you think that this is appropriate subject matter for your 7th and 8th grade children, buy it. If you choose not to buy it, please beware that they may still read it in school.As an adult and father of four, I'm left with the impression that an adolescent would be less likely to trust their parents after reading this book.Save you money and buy a classic."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This boring novel is filled with sci-fi. Only few parts in the book are exciting. Even though strange, it has earned many awards. The author that wrote this book is very talented. It is filled with sadness. The best part in the book is when Jonas (main character) learns what the word released means. Released is when a person is killed that is not reacting good in the community that they live in. In his community there are no automobiles, alcohol, money and many other different things. Instead of driving cars they drive bicycles. There are also no jobs. Instead of money people get things free. Goods are supplied to all households. Over all I don't reccomend this book unless you are boring."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book wasn't so insteresting, because in the begining the reality that Jonas was in didn't seem the same as the reality that I'm in. It wasn't easy to understand that Jonas's community doesn't have what in my reality does. Like Jonas's community doesn't have feelings of love, hurt, pain,sadness, or even happiness. People in his community don't want nobdy to suffer, that they want to have a perfect community. Something in this reality can't be."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My son's 6th grade teacher read The Giver to his class a few months ago. I am into children's literature of all types and I as his mother like to read what he is assigned in his class. I was very disappointed with The Giver. Number The Stars was absolutely 5 star fabulous. But, The Giver--- too adult for one. I especially didn't like the way Ms. Lowry degrades womanhood and motherhood in this book. To be called as a 'birthmother' in this book is to have a dishonored scum life. I already see enough in our society of the degradation of motherhood--- I don't want to read it in a book--- much less have my son exposed to such obsurdity. Also, the part in the book where all boys had to take a pill once the pubescent stirrings begin was a very 'out to lunch' kind of notion. I realize this is a fictional book. But, how about keeping books perfectly clean in all aspects? Number The Stars was clean and uplifting in all regards. Charles Dickens Great Expectations is about the best book I have ever read. Ms. Lowry has such a gift of writing. I'd like to see her keep to clean, uplifting, inspiring content. Good books are my escape of societal ills. The Giver reminded me of too much of our own social problems."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Ok, here is a story about a town who doesn't have to worry about pain or change. You are assigned jobs and you have to apply for spouses and children but there are only 2 children, one boy and one girl, per household. And they have The Ceremonies, where at certain ages you get certain privliges. Anyways when this one kid named Jonas turns 12 he is \\"selected\\" as the Reciever of Memory and he meets the Giver where he gets all these memories. He expiriences stuff the rest of the town has no clue about.Anyways I had to read this book for school and I didn't like it too much. It wasn't hard to understand - everything was explained clearly. But I mean come on, this book is so strange in a bad way. And when Jonas learned what being released was it made me want to put the book down and never touch it again. I can handle a lot of things but this book makes me sick! And I would not read this to younger children or those with a weak stomach. So to anyone who is thinking of buying this book, don't unless you have to for work/school."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book was ghastly. This book is based in a utopia where the government is perfect and everyone lives in harmony. A boy named Jonas has become the receiver of memory, his journey is filled with joy and pain. But the only pain there is s having to read it. If you have a choice don't. The author did an awful job writing it, there was almost no action and it had a linear plot. So do yourself a favour and don't read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I couldn't finish this book, but I got far enough through it to know that I didn't like it. It is sort of a gated community slash perfect world type setting, where nothing really interesting ever happens. Duh!!!Trevor"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"BAD. I hate this book, im currently being made to read it along with my other classmates in Reading clas. I do not like it, and i dont understand how you other people can. But hey, each to his own. The only way i would reccomend this to someone is if you paid me a million dollars, and even then i would take the money, then write the reccomendation on a sticky note, and put it on the fridge. Only read this if you dont have ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.*You know you love me*PS- Sorry if some of you feel like I bashed a favorite book of yours. But hey......... i have a right to free speech."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It is amazing to read some of the other reviews. If a book contains anything metaphorical or symbolic people can't seem to handle it.This was definitely one of the top five books I have ever read. Rarely does a book make me change the way I behave, but this one did. I can't say I know you'll enjoy it, but if you understand the symbols, your life will change for the better.However, one caution, it likely will not be understood by the average reader under age 12 (the AVERAGE reader that is!)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a fantastic book that shows how if a common culture is forbidden thier history the are also forbidden to choose. They do not pick spouses, jobs, children, food, clothing, shelter, anything! everything is provided for them, no fuss no muss. But by the middle of the book you start asking yourself if thid idilic society is all it seems to be. Follow the main character Jonas through his coming of age and discover who the mysterious Giver really is."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"View one: This book was very freaky for one thing.People aren't supposed to remember things, as hinted in the book, but they remember one thing. This book is stupid. 1 star View two: The Giver was definately the most touching and dramatic book I have read this year.I will remember it for a long time and will always wonder what happened after the ending when Jonas finally heard music.

In this completely controlled world, a 12-year old boy named Jonas has been chosen to become the communities most honored citizen. He has been chosen to be the Reciever of Memories. Under the teachings of the elder known as the Giver, he learns the dark truth about his perfect community. Battling against the pain and joy ofthe memories he seeks &quot;Elsewhere&quot; so that the community can also experience all of these feelings. In this story, Lowry examines the paranormal as well as a persons' freedom of choice. Soon Jonas lears the price of a perfect world and he decides that he is not the only one that needs to pay this price."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"although simply written, the giver has the makings of a classic. jonas's world is eerily believable and forces the reader to reflect on his/her present life. lowry has noted all the things we sometimes take for granted--the ability to see colour or feel love,for instance--and has created a land that seems a utopia at first, but is ultimately something frightening. the giver is truly thought-provoking, and its lessons will remain with you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a very eye-opening book. It shows readers what the world would be like if everything was decided for them. It gets people thinking about how, even though life may have its problems and disasters, they are pretty lucky to be able to handle those things as they feel appropriate. It made me glad to have as much freedom as I do because I can express myself and be different. It makes you realize that we, as a society, take things for granted and we should appreciate all we have, all we have the ability to experience, including the pain and the suffering. The Giver teaches that we should appreciate these things because WE have the right to choose what we do and we can take any pain and suffering and use it to learn from, something that people in The Giver could not do. It makes you think about what you would do if you couldn't do that, if someone decided that a society should be uniform and not have any instability at all. In fact, something that people don't realize, that I did when I read this book, is that instability is what makes our society great. It's the spontaneity, unpredictability, and differences that make life worth living. The Giver is a great book that gets people thinking about their lives and how truly grateful they ought to be."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas was the main character! In this book we learned that its not always the best to let other people pick things out for you. Everyone was the same, no one could really make fun of others. The Giver was a really giving was a really giving man. What he gives to Jonas you will have to read the book, to find out."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a great book. I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenging read and likes books that are thought provoking. I highly suggest keeping a dictionary at your side while reading this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Though this seemingly shory story dragged at times and seemed rather long-all in all, it was an incredible story. It was so interesting to step aside from normal life and see how fortunate we have it. I like how the author brings up new ideas and thoughts never felt before. After finishing the story, I almost felt a feeling of victory for Jonas (the main character) whom you grow to love (a new concept for him) so much throughout the course of the story! N.D. :)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver starts out a bit confusing. But as you get more and more into the book it makes a lot more sense. This book potrays a young boy who is born into and ideal &quot;community.&quot; Jonas, (the boy) reaches twelve years old he is told that he will be the community's new Reciver of Memory. This is a fabulous book because it shows Jonas' emotions of the pain caused in his new job, and the pain of seeing beyond."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this novel for an on line class that deals with Myths, Magic, and Folklore. This novel, to me, is an excellent read. It's about a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect community. In this particular town, everyone is given a role that is vital to the welfare of the community, be that doctors or lawyers. This boy, Jonas, is given the assignment to be the Receiver of memories from the Giver. The Giver is an old, but very bright man who seems to be wary with his old age and the things he's had to remember. Jonas and the Giver share a special relationship due to the fact that they're the only two people in their community who know about the past. In the end, Jonas must run away from the town when he finds out that the doctors of the town have been practicing euthanasia on some of it's \\"unworthy\\" citizens. The fate of the boy is left unclear, and the ending to the story depends on the readers' concept of the book.The reason why my classmates were asked to read this novel is because of its' message that the Oral Tradition is very important on any culture. The only way that the Giver can share his memories with Jonas is by hand, not by reading anything to him. The boy and the Giver also share a very special bond, and this shows how strong a connection can be when the Oral Tradition method is used.I gave this novel four out of five stars because I thought it was a little too short for its' subject matter. Overall, it's a very interesting novel and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction or controversial literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is an insightful novel that gives us the perspective--what would happen if there were no feelings? What if there was no pain? What if there was no happiness or passion? The world would live in a utopia, but would it really be worth it? The novel follows a boy named Jonas who discovers feelings, but everyone around him remains neutral. He wants to show them pain, happiness, warfare, fear, passion. But, such things could ruin the utopia. The novel really gives you a grateful feeling that you can experience feelings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a solid good book. Not great and not terrible, just good. It's a Utopian story like 1984, but for a younger audience. Both books warn us about utopias and teach that an 'imperfect' society is better than a 'perfect one. Without freedom and choice, life's not worth living.This book also manages to be very original in its ideas. I find the idea of one person carrying memories of the old world amazing. Middle schoolers will like this too, which I guess is prbably why they assign this in middle schools.Basically, it's a good book with neet ideas and exellent morals."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is fabulous. It really brings out the importance of individuality and feelings that are taken for granted in today's society. When the truth about the community is learned the emotion and great need for change is almost overwhelming for the main character, Jonas. The book could have been a bit more descriptive in some areas, but over all it was a really good read.Noelle M., Northside High, Jacksonville, NC"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" was a fabulous book that brought to light how important having memories, feelings, and individuality is. Once the truth is learned about the community, the emotions and desperation shown for change is remarkable. The storyline is unique and unforgettable.

This part made me want to keep reading to see what happened. He had skipped Jonas. After the very last number Jonas was called back up. He was assigned the job of the Receiver.In the book The Giver by Louis Lowry a 12 year old boy was assigned the most important job in the town. When he started this glorious job the Giver gave him happy and colorful memories. Then he started receiving the painful memories. I really enjoyed how the painful memories mad Jonas realize that the town he lived in was not as perfect as he thought it was and that things could be different. After so much the Giver and Jonas decided enough was enough. I think they were right they should not be the only one to hold these abominable memories. I could not believe what these 2 brilliant people they decided to do next. What will they do next? If you want to find out read the suspenseful book The Giver by Louis Lowry."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"For me; the Giver was truly a thought provoking experience. It made me take another look at how we live our lives and would sameness be bearable if one never knew any other way. Things that make u go hmmmmm"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a good piece of literature because it's full of feelings shares important messages, and has a surprising ending. The Giver is basically about feelings. Jonas experiences them in many ways; he has mixed thoughts on those feelings but accepts them. Jonas gets these new feelings form these memories he giver gives him, he major feeling expressed happiness, sorrow, and pain. Jonas felt happy when \\" Jonas found himself upon it, began to move through the snowfall, and now he understood instantly that now he was going down hill\\" Jonas felt happiness form this memory. Jonas had felt being sad and pain when he had \\" Restlessly he moved one am, bending it felt a sharp pain in he crease of his inner arm at the elbow. He wasn't too sad but he was, and he also felt pain. Pain usually brings sorrow with it. Sharing important messages is basically moral, there are many morals but one is my favorite. When Jonas receives the memory of Christmas, he feels warmth and happiness, than he began to see you need love and a family to help you. \\"Warmth, Jonas replied and happiness, And - let's me think of family.\\" This shows that Jonas knows what family is. I enjoyed the ending it shows how a you can think, You can make up the ending because the ending doesn't really tell you what happens, so It was surprising and enjoyable. So over all, this is a good book many things occur to it and you can compare life situations to it, you experience new feelings, learn morals, and ends aren't always how you want them to be."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an example of good literature. It is good literature because it has lots of discription, lots of details, and it shares an important message. There is so much elaborate description.

This books details depict the images of the book so perfectly.\\" He lay sprawled, his gray uniform glistening with wet fresh blood\\"(p#119). It shares a co0mmon message. The message that the story betrays is that sameness leads to interdependence with could possibly lead to disaster. In turn to be your own person. As you can see this is why The giver is an example of good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is good literature for it is full of adventure and action, lots of descriptions, and a lot of interesting details. The Giver is full of adventure and action because it is about this young boy named Jonas who has to go through so many painful things to be the new Reciever. There is adventure, a lot of it is towards the end when Jonas and Gabriel escape from the community and have to survive in the cold. There are so many vivid descriptions in this book. They talk about the community and how it is so plain. They talk about the many difficulties in which the community faces every single day. Finally, The Giver provides a lot of interesting details. They talk about how when two identical twins, they take the one that weighs the most and the other one and give them a needle in the forehead and goes into the vein. And once they are dead they take the body and put them in a box.''Once they are dead it is bye-bye for them.'' The Giver is good literature because it has adventure and action, descriptions, and interesting details. I recommend this book to all children of all ages."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is the most heartbreakinbg and soul searching book I have ever read.While reading this book you have to think what would you do in this situation. Would you have the courage and strength to endure what Jonas went through. I would have to admit that I don't think I would be that strong in a world like that. This book really moved me and caused me to be thankful for the simple little things that we have in life(like color) and not to take anything for granted."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"the book was very good though the ending could have been better. i suggest that anyone should read ut uf they are looking for a good story"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an awesome novel that sends you to another world for the temporary time of reading the book; a world were everyone is the Same or gets the same.

As a twelve, Jonas is ready to be assigned an adult task. While his friend Asher, always a bit goofy, is assigned as Assistant Director of Recreation, and Fiona, a thougthful, warm girl, as Caretaker of the Old, Jonas is assigned as Receiver of Memories, a crucial, if lonely, assignment. He is taught by a man called the Giver and soon Jonas realizes that there was a very expensive price to pay for Sameness.Lowry's prose is sparse and elegant, deceptive in its simplicity. She tackles hefty issues, such as the need for individuality and choices, which weigh so heavily in the minds of young adults. She doesn't condescend or talk down but confronts these issues head on, through a surprising twist in the story that startles and pains. The ending is clever and leads to further thought rather than a foregone conclusion or happy ending.Lowry's contribution to American Literature for Children earned her a John Newberry Medal. The Giver sustains this contribution. The Giver is a must for every searching young adult."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a great book.

If you know a child who enjoys science fiction or one who just enjoys a facinating reading experience, The Giver would be an excellent choice."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a teenage kid living in the far future in a manufactured &quot;community&quot;. Everybody's day is entirely planned out. The kid is chosen to be the next &quot;receiver of memories&quot;, which is the person who holds all the memories of the past. I highly recomend this book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, the twelve-year old boy lives in the future.It is a world without pain, neediness and risk.Jonas gets the new &quot;Receiver of Memory. He gets memories from the old Receiver and he sees the world with another view. As Jonas is not able to live in this world any more without changing the society he and his stepbrother Gabriel run out of the community.The author makes dear that the perfect world the people think they live in is a well-organized &quot;dictorship&quot; as there is no freedom of choice which suddenly becomes so precious that the reader is forced to recognize that something which seeems to be the most natural thing in the world is eszential for our lives. In addition opportunity to have own memories to make mistakes and to experience a life in which fate, catastrophes and powers we cannot control rule suddenly has to be regarded as a present we never really realized. The book is very interesting and easy to read.It is very interesting to look in such a world so far in the future.The language is the most time easy. The structure is easy and so the reader can the actions follow.It was one of the best books I ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The beginning was hard to get into. It was hard to undertand why everything that happened in the community had to happen as a group; for instance, the way they did their age groups. Every age group that was in the communtiy had their birthday on one specific day and they called it a ceremony. It was also hard to undertsand why on every birthday they had each child received a specific thing; for examlpe, each eight year old got a button up-the-front jacket to symbolize their growing up. The bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually out into the community, away from the protective family unit."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved The Giver-it was an amazing read. To really better understand the book and its ideas you need to read it a few times. But even after just reading it once it leaves a big impression and makes you think about your life and how different it could be. Another great part of the book is that you could get a great idea of it and its points at any age. I know this is a book that I'll keep and read periodicly throughout my entire life. It totally deserved its Newberry Honor and I would recommend that any parent buy it for their child-and also read it themselves!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It isn't very often these days that we can read a book that appeals to EVERY age group. It combines the young child's idea of a good story with an adults search for philosophy. I read this book three years ago in 3rd grade and it was just a good story. I read it last year and I started discussing it with my family. The ending was our main topic. Did Jonas really find Elsewhere? Or did he find that spot in our imaginations that keeps us alive on the most boring days? Or did he simply die? From Kindergarten to Philosophy major, this story deserves every recognition it is qualified for."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, The Giver, is written by the well known author Lois Lowry. She is a very talented author and has won many awards for this book. This book takes place in a &quot;perfect&quot; community. It is run by commity of elders. They make all the decisions for the community because they think that they will make the wrong decisions in life. When you become a nine, which is your age, you receive a bike. When you becaome a twelve you will receive an assignment which is just like yoiur job. Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories which is a very honorable job. The giver must give the receiver the memories. Jonas gets all the feelings that he has never felt before. He desperately wants to see the real world. Overall this book was not to good. It was very hard to keep reading it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Wow. Where do I begin describing a story as gripping and well written as Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot;? As you already know, this is my favorite book. I just read it a few months ago and finished it in three days flat. I would have finished it sooner, but unfortunately, I didn't have every free moment to read. I dont't care what anyone says about the ending...it was great. Besides, with all this praise, I expect Lowry will write a sequel. I hope. I also reccomended this book to my mother, and she found it as enjoyable as I did. Please buy this book. Even though some classify it as sci-fi, I classify it as a novel reaching into a human soul, and pulling out real emotions in a world oblivious to feelings. Don't let this book pass you by."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The begining of this book was good. It is a good idea for a book but it seems incompleat. I had to read this book in 6th grade 2 years later i bought it so i could see why i hated it. It's because at the end he is just at the top of the hill looking down. It needs to tell what hapens next. Some books that i read are like that except the endings are writen so that you can imagin what happens. The Giver just stops. I think the book should be rewritten with a better end. Maybe I will write a sequal."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't recommend this book because it was boring! I thought it made no sense. It was very weird that his world had no color, and so many rules! In the book I felt that it put down pregnant woman. It had no choice to it, meaning that the people of this community had no say in who they were going to marry, their jobs and they didn't even have their own children! BUT alot of people also enjoyed the book, but I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a book which made me think. It was a great descriptive book. You knew what was going on and why it was going on at all times. It was kind of sad though. I couldn't imagine being in a society where nothing changes, no choices are made, and everyone looks basically the same. A world without color? Without music? Without holidays? It portrayed our life, real life, as a fable, a mere legend. Like The Matrix, it makes you think. We're lucky to have what we have in life...especially choices."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowery was certainly one the best books I have ever read. It is hard to imagine a world without color, pain, and music. The relationship that the people had with one another were really strange. The thought of having your career choosen for you was really different. It is hard to imagine a world like the one described in this book. This book was excellent."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought it was an excellent book on a possible futuristic society. It's sad the way that they do not feel or truly live for fear or being different from society. I hope that our society is never forced to endure such an existance.It shows what a society without individualism would be like and the result of forgetting our past. It is definatly a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Giver. It really does a great job of conveying the importance of &quot;sharing&quot; memories. It's just not fair to the human mind to deprive it of such wonderful things. But, the flip side is with all happy things come sad things. With Christmas and love, also come war and hate. All in all a great book. I would recommend it strongly to any reader with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a thrilling book about a young boy who finds about what life is really like. Jonas, the main character, is choosen to be the Receiver of the community. Jonas, the main character finds out what life is really like. Jonas learns that his father is a killer and his friends is soon to be one. Jonas learns the true value of life. Jonas doesn't like the way they run the comunity. I think that this book is intresting becasue it has a lot to do with sience fiction. In this book, Jonas receives memorys from his The Giver. I think that this book is cool because he uses the powers that he is given. I also think that it is intresting becasue it has to do with the future. It is a wonderful suspense because Jonas the main character plans a daring excape. This book was thrillng, funny, and fantastic, that is why I like this book a lot. I think that this book should be read by all ages and in all libaries."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is very well done! The author does an excellent job of not revealing what exactly is going on. In this way she holds your interest until the very end of the story. The characters have depth and emotion and Jonas really draws you into the story. This book will make you question everything you beleive about life. An excellent work!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was a pretty good book but it is very simular to brave new world and i think that book was a lot better.

It explained what a community might be like in the futur or it waas in thepast. I have read this book over and over because it was so good. I would give you wat it was about but you should read it yourself and most probably enjoy it. You have a blast reading it. Go have a blast. If you had to do a book report or something like that you should trake this book so instead of sad because its homework don't be sad because it is the best book you can ever read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was an excellent book until about chapter 20, whenyoubasically don't get or care about the characters anymore. At theend, I was very dissapointed, at the lack of information. I wanted to know what happened to Giver, and Jonas, and Gabe. And, what happened to the community after he left? This book is very open ended, but otherwise a superb peice of writing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In my opinion, this book was a exciting journey through the future. Although the ending was in my opinion, a waste of my time, the rest of the book was beutiffully written. Thge ending came to a hault as if she had got tired of writing and she stopped. The idea for the ending was wounderful, except she did not tell it all. The book was a wouderfully written book, and it seemed as though I was part of it. The wording made it feel like it was happening. And the many ways Louise gave clues about surprises that if you went back and read it again, you would be suprised you missed it due to the fact that you were so engrossed in the book. The characters and the setting help give the book it's character. The book should be read by millions."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world with no poverty, pain, feelings, memories, or happiness. This is that book. The Giver is an amazing and wonderful book to read. Lois Lowry makes you think in this book about the characters, the plot, and the strangeness of the way that the community lives. There are many suprises in this book that will amuse and amaze you. Lois Lowry tries to influence many morals in her book. In my opinion, this book was very amazing and made me think all the time. If you like to think and like a sense of mystery and amusement, then I totally recommend reading Lois Lowry's work of The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was ok, but I absolutley despised the ending. It's about a perfect community, where a 12 year old boy Jonas lives. But, this community knows nothing of color, rain, sun, snow, pain, animals, and shockingly, family. They all have their birthday on the same day, even if they weren't born that day. Certain things come with age, like a jacket with buttons in the front when their eight, and a bike when they are nine. They apply for a spouse, and then apply for one son, and one daughter. But in that community lives a man, who goes by The Giver. He himself holds the memories this community has forgotten. Then, when Jonas turns 12, and is assigned his life job, HE is to replace The Giver, and learn about the real world. But as the story unfolds, more problems spring forth to the reader. The ending is completely twisted, but otherwise Lois Lowry wrote a good book!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. It is about a boy named Jonas and his adventures with The Giver. When Jonas recieves his speecial assignment, he must learn to face his fears. This book is a very suspenseful cliffhanger. I definetly recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver is written by Lois Lowry. There are several characters in the book. Jonas is the main character. Lilly is his little sister. The Giveris someone very special. Jonas eventually meets someonewho will change his life. It all takes place in \\"The Community\\" in the future world of the book. The problem is that Jonas really does'nt like the community. If you read the book you can decide if it is a utopia(perfect world) or a dystopia(nightmare world). I think it is both. But I think the book is a good book. Maybe other people would enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver wasn't a very self explanatory story. You would have to read the book to get it. The main characters are Jonas, the giver, and Jonas's family unit. The story is located in a place called the community the conlict in the story is that jonas doesn't want to bbe there and he wants the community to change. The person who wrote this story is Lois loweryand she is a good author. The society in thee book has cermonies and reward shows. Also they have they have naming of the babies and the 12 year olds get assigned an assignments when they are 12 The book is ok ; it doesn't really satisfy me I read the book in the fourth grade and now im reading it now which i am a freshman at P-Ville high school."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I could never imagine living in a world like the one Lois Lowry wrote in THE GIVER. I don't know what I would do if I in Jonas's shoes or the Givers. I wouldn't want to live in a world that is all the same. Lois Lowry was probably writing this to tell usb how our world would be like in the future. What this book is mainly about is that Jonas finds out that his so called utopia world is not really so utpia. He finds out that it nis a distopia and tries to get away from it. This book won a Newbarry Medal in 1994. I really liked this book I just would never want to live there. I couldnn't imagine living in a world with no love, color, reace, real happiness, a real family, realationships, and animals. I think this is one of the best books I ever read in the past few years."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you imagine living in a town were everything is perfect? well if you dont like that try reading a book called The Giver. It is wrote by Lois lowery. The main characters in the book are the Giver and a boy named Jonas. The setting is the community that is in the book. The main conflict of the book is Jonas doesnt like the community. A special issues is the community is a dystopia. My opinion about the book was I didnt like it because of the fact that the community was trying to be perfect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a book that i would say is at it's finest. It has many faces all of which are good. The story really takes place in a time of sameness. There are no colors, music or individualities. It is amazing to see how all the memories of now are all stored in one person. It really opened my eyes to the joys and pains of this world and i am sure will do the same to you. If you haven't read this book before and lloking for a new adventure, please find access to A.S.A.P. because it is enough to make your minmd boggle."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is personally one of my all time favorite books. I'd suggest it for anybody who has a lot of patients and dosn't mind reading something you don't understand over and over until you do, or somebody who is an advanced reader. The book makes me appreciate our world, even with it's flaws, like war. In the book there is a perfect community without war, but when they took that out, they also took out color, music, weather, and even love. It also makes me appreciate my right to choose. Somewhere between the middle and the end of the book, my heart got crushed. It's truly a beautiful book for almost anybody to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"A very good book. Jonas's world gives you a lot to think about what your world could be like. It a good read that I would definetly recommend to someone, but when he gets to Elsewhere it could be a bit more descriptive."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a novel study book for my 6th grader son. I enjoyed the book very much as I had to read it and discuss it with my son, as he had so many questions about the society and it's inhabitants. My son is now grateful to live in a place where he actually can choose and decide for himself, make mistakes and learn from them. I applaud Jonas for having had the courage to take baby Gabriel away before he got\\"released\\". What a brave Jonas! I also enjoyed Gathering Blue and Messenger. I am now reading Son. I recommend parents to read this awesome book. ( will there someday be a movie based on the Giver, Lowrey?)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Compelling post-apocalyptic novel. An interesting take on the burden of memories. Is innocence better than awareness? The characters were compelling, the plot and setting fascinating, and the writing tight and beautiful."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in my reading class my 8th grade year and fell in love with it. I am always questioning why things are and how they work. This book starts by explaining the community and how everything is the same, in black and white, no emotions or feelings, and nothing to ever question. Jonas an 11 year old about to turn 12 is about to get his assignment of being the receiver. The Giver the most important character in the story is an older man with knowledge of the past. A past before the community and before everything was the same. When Jonas started to find out about all of these freedoms and choices people use to have he could no longer be happy in his community. He could not continue with the shallow lives that the people in the community were living. He made a decision to leave the community and with him he took a baby boy named Gabriel. Together they fled the community in hot pursuit. They traveled for a long period of time until he reached a house with bright lights all around it and music playing. It was winter when he made his escape and the only thing to keep him warm was the thought of a very hot day and the sun, and laughter. The book ended before telling us if he reached the house, or if he knocked on the door and humans came out to greet him. This was an excellent read, there was a lot of detail that painted a perfect picture in my mind and the way the author left the ending open for us the reader to interpret what actually happened to Jonas and the baby Gabriel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just wish this book was longer! It was different, but in a good way. Really makes you wonder about the future."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Pretty good book. Nice plot, excellent description, I totally recommend it. Would have been nice to know a little more about the book before getting it, though through a bit of work on the internet, it's definitely possible to find out more on The Giver. Attached is a link in case anyone is wondering where to learn more:[...]However, the link is extremely informative so for anyone who doesn't want to know to much, don't go to this link.Pretty much, exciting, though sometimes a little bland, but for readers who want a nice bit of reading."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a wonderful book for young and old alike. It really got my 11 year old thinking and talking, not always an easy job."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"great book for an eigh grader..my students love this book...i recomend it to any literature teacher my students are asking to do another novel in this genre."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"It's the choosing that's important, isn't it?\\"Jonas lives in a world of \\"Sameness\\" with his Mother, his Father, and his younger sister, Lily. It's a world governed by rules, by rigid structure, by conformity. Jonas enjoys his life--until he is selected to be The Receiver. His job? To receive the memories from The Giver of the past. And what the past unveils shows a drastically different world than Jonas lives in.This week is Banned Books Week, and in honor, I selected this from the ALA Banned Book List. Some of the reasons included euthanasia, sexual awakening, and infantcide.Another reason I chose this book is I love dystopias, and with the modern crop of iffy dystopias for Young Adults, I thought I would return to the roots, to see one of the first (if not the first) Young Adult Dystopia novels.In short, this book is brilliant. The dystopia works, the characters are great, the writing is excellent, and I was genuinely moved.A lot of recent dystopias seem to have their world-building constructed like a house of cards: one little sneeze, and the entire thing falls in your lap. With the exception of the giving and receiving of memories (Is Jonas genetically modified to be able to give and receive? Is this science? Magic? How does this happen?), the world building is consistent, realistic, and understandable. People have been stripped of choices; they live in a sanitized \\"safe\\" world where no conflict exists. Families are created based on strict algorithms; people are assigned their jobs, their spouses, their children. The only books are those based on the rules of the society. People must be precise in their language; you don't just toss around the word \\"love\\" anymore.What I thought was most amazing was how polite everyone was. To eradicate conflict, everyone was trained to immediately apologize for sins and to accept apologies. Debate, discord, arguments--all of these never occurred because there was no outlet. I felt sad about this, particularly because my hobby is reviewing, and if there is one thing I've learned while reviewing, it's that everyone has a different opinion about everything. But in this society, such things as a difference of opinion would never have been cultivated or encouraged; we would never have debate; we would never argue and learn to be social. Instead, we would be silenced.The characters were great. I really got close to Jonas, and there were at least twice when I was nearly moved to tears after something happened to him. I was astonished at how quickly and easily I great attached to him; it's truly a gifted author who can write her protagonist so well that the reader is so close to him after so short a time. Other characters, such as The Giver, Mother, Father, Lily, Asher, Fiona, may not have been the highlight, but they were well-established. Asher's clumsiness with words, Lily's impetuousness, Father's nurturing (very interesting, as it is so often the woman is pigeon-holed into this role!), Mother's rationality--they hint at each being an individual, straining to be free in a Same society.The writing is obviously for a younger reader, probably about middle grade. While I don't typically read middle grade books, I felt I was still able to enjoy it, that it wasn't too \\"dumbed down\\".As for why it is banned....poppycock! I think this is a perfect book for a middle-schooler/early high school student. While I might agree that a parent should be on standby for some scenes (just in case questions or discussion topics arise), I think this book is a great gateway into a better understanding of our world and the things we hold important. What better way to show a burgeoning young man or woman how valuable choice and love and the beauty of nature around us than to show a world that doesn't have any of that. What a better way to show kids to be engaged in everything around us, that life is precious, that emotions, good and bad, are important and healthy.\\"The Giver\\" may not be the first dystopian novel nor the last, but it's still an important work that can teach everyone something new. If things like loving your family, the horrors of killing someone because they aren't \\"useful\\", and the gift of choice and the beauty of nature are things we don't want in our society, then sure, this book should remain banned. Personally, I WANT to love, I WANT choice, I WANT to see beauty. I think the banning of this book is the highest form of irony; I know if I ever have kids, that I won't be banning it from them.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Some sensitive issues are covered, opening up opportunities for dialog and discussion about euthanasia, socialism, etc. If you have a reluctant reader in your family, this book may be worth looking at. My son is a reluctant reader, even with a higher than average reading level for his age. This was one of the few books he has read without a lot of nagging. However, the topics contained in this book would not make it suitable for a kid under the age of about 10 or 12."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is sad and somewhat disturbing, but very well conceived and written. It is not light fun reading, but it's worth the effort to get through it. Lois Lowry's words and descriptions made her alternate future world come alive.A common complaint was that the ending leaves readers hanging. While it's good to make readers think, it's also nice to have a complete story.

He provokes change throughout the story and challenges the way of life.\\"Jonas, Jonas, Jonas.\\" The chant comes alive as we learn that he will be the next Receiver of Memory. This appointment requires him to enter the room of the Giver. Here is where the adventure commences.Training to take over for the Giver, Jonas learns what everyone has forgotten. Truths are revealed, memories set free, and morals put to the test. Should Jonas leave life as it is or make the decision to change it for everyone?Lowry closes with much to interpret. Stated as her reason for this, \\" People bring to it their own complicated beliefs . . . So, I don't want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds.\\""},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Arguably, today's society has many flaws. Imagine a society where everything is the same. There is no colour, no distinction, and above all, everyone has a place chosen by what is best-suited for them and theircommunity. Everyone follows the rules and if they don't they leave. As children grow in this community, they are taught to be exactly the same as everyone else while at the same time maintaining their personalindependence. Welcome to the world of the Giver. Jonas has lived this way all his life, and as such he is almost mortified when he is singled out to hold a job amongst the highest ranking of elders, receiver ofmemory. When you leave behind a world of pain to create a utopian society, you must remember what you left behind so that you don't revert back. At the age of 12, Jonas is selected to be the one who remembers what his society left behind and is forced to endure pain so others don't. The question is, will he fight what he thinks is so unfair when he is unable to leave?This is a very good book that never gets dull. Something is always happening so it will keep you on your toes until the end of the book. Another plus is that the book is short so it doesn't take too long to add another book to your \\"read\\" collection. It is a good book for a wide range of ages and is worth reading a second time, or third..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is based in this fictional society where everyone is provided for and everything is the same. Differences are frowned upon and being the same as everyone else is encouraged. The laws are strict and no one dares to disobey them. Lowry depicted a certain kind of \\"utopia\\" in this novel. A \\"utopia\\" that might not be that far off in the future. This book portrayed what could possibly happen if we give the government too much authority. This book was a real eye opener and really makes you think about the possibilities of tomorrow.

It's riveting throughout and especially touching at the end.4 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"For a young adult title, this book was quite intriguing.

The book introduces the reader to a new world where there are family units and someone to remember everything from the past and the present.

There is no burning of the books here--they are just hidden. There is no forced mating--children are birthed, then given to a set of parents--who didn't have the ability to have the children, or even chose their spouse. Without giving too much away, this book is a look at a future in which people do not have past memories, do not think for themselves, and live in \\"Communities\\" in which every aspect of their lives are regulated."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a well crafted and intriguing story set in a seemingly idyllic setting. The setting of the novel is what essentially arouses the main themes of the novel. Themes include conformity, a communistic style of living, and loss of innocence. The main character Jonas struggles with his identity as a member of his community. This struggle is won by his loss of innocence. As the Receiver his newly found high status comes with a price. His price is his naivety of the situation he lives in. The book is a man vs. himself conflict. Jonas can either live in ignorance, or understand and be in pain. This novel is poignant, and goes much farther beyond being a children's novel."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"These books really drew me into the stories rapidly.

I don't understand why the author didn't complete the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is not a bad introduction to dystopian literature. It's certainly more suited to younger readers. There are plenty of themes in the book that are never fully developed. The concepts are interesting and thought provoking, but the resolutions in the story are unsatisfying."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I first read this book when I was in the sixth grade and have never been able to forget it. Easily one of my favorite novels. I have probably read this book five times."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Good storyline, a bit slow starting, but storyline develops well. Looking forward to next book. Hoping it continues to develop the characters."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a terrific read for anyone, but it's perfect for middle school students because it is so thought provoking. It is the story of a controlled society in which there are no choices or conflict. When Jonas turns twelve, he must train with The Giver and prepare to receive all the memories of love, happiness, war and pain. During his training, Jonas learns the hard truth about his community and its rules and knows he must act decisively to bring about change.The best part about this book is that every word counts. Lois Lowry is great at describing her characters and their community. She includes meaningful foreshadowing that leads the reader through a gradual understanding of what might initially seem like an acceptable way to live. She accomplishes this by revealing just enough details and we realize the facts just as Jonas does.The Giver ends just as you want to learn more. And thankfully, there is more to the story in Messenger, Gathering Blue and Lowry's newest, Son."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lowry is an exciting book for teenagers, that we read in the school. It is a very imagination story and I like how Lois Lowry describes the memories that The Giver transmitts to Jonas, the protagonist of the book. The characters are described in great detail and also the community. It is also a very funny book where all the rules are important for childs. I could image the landscape very well. Some chapters are a bit boring, because they were a bit to detailed. I recommend this book for all how like imaginative stories."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is one of the best books I've read this year. I not even done with it but it's awesome. I recommend it to anyone that likes a good book. Some reasons I like it was because I can relate to the memories that the Giver gives to Jonas such a wrecking a sled. I find it amusing that everything is perfect and organized."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for the summer of 8th grade, and I loved it. This book may be hard to understand at first, but reading it twice can really help. Jonas, the main charater, is a inspirering boy who lives in a perfect world with his mother, father, and sister Lily. When he gets the job to be the Giver his whole life changes (read to find out how). This book will bring you through the good memories he had and the painful memories he experienced. I would highly recommed this book to any reader who loves to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas is a young boy living in a society where there is no pain,no feelings, no color, and no past. Everything is the same, everyone is happy. All choices are made by the Elders, the overseers of the society.People Live in peace and harmony, they know nothing else.The year of Jonas's twelfth birthday he is given his life's profession. He is the one chosen to be the receiver of memories.The Giver is the one person who holds all the memories for the community. He now gives these memories to Jonas. With these memories comes the truth about the society he lives in. As Jonas receives the memories of the Giver, he becomes frustrated with the community for living a life of sameness. He wants the people to feel love and make their own choices.Lois Lowry's characterization of Jonas compels the reader to evaluate choices that have to be made in life. Jonas shows tremendous courage when he makes the decision to change his world. He gives up all that he has ever known to give his people a more fulfilling life. Jonas's monumental decision was not an easy one, but he knew he had to do it. Young readers can relate to Jonas's dilemma and appreciate the freedom we have to make choices.This is a rewarding book for young and adult readers. It prompts thought provoking insights into what makes a perfect world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has many wonderful books and her writing creates a vivid picture in the mind of the reader, but in none such as The Giver. In his utopian society Jonas is completely happy. Everyday his routine is the same, each family has a mother and a father and two children. Several things happen that disrupt Jonas' perfect existance. Gabriel, a baby who cannot sleep through the night comes to live with them temporarily. Also Jonas looks forward to the annual ceremony in which he, as a twelve will be given his job assignment in which he will immediately begin his internship. When he is chosen as The Receiver of Memories, Jonas is baffled by everyones response. When he meets the old man who is The Giver of Memories, he is introduced initially to only good memories, but soon those of war and horror eventually follow. As the story continues Jonas comes to realize the price that has been paid for his utopian society to exist. He and The Giver must make a decision that will have serious consequences. Jonas also knows that he must act in order to save his baby brother Gabriel.There are many ah-hah experiences throughout this novel in which Lowry reveals/explains something new. There are also a few shocking experiences that surprise the reader. There are many intricate details to the story, and young adults and even adult readers will be able to draw out so much meaning from this story. I recommend it for ages 12 and above. If you liked this book, you will also enjoy Lowry's Gathering Blue."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My adult reading group selected The Giver for one of our discussions this summer, otherwise I would never have read it.

It was full of adventures to read and it makes you think a lot! I could relate the differences from the real world and inthe book. Live in that book was not fun.

Once I started reading it I could not put it down. It is about a boy named Jonas. He is turning 12. When you reach this age you are assigned a job. When they are calling out names they skip him. That is where the book gets exciting. He later finds out that he is going to be trained by The Giver. The Giver has memories that know one else has. They are filled with pain,love,sadness,fear,hate,lonleness,and color. In Jonas's world everything is grey and plain. I loved this book because the ending is something that you decided. The only reason i was disapointed was because there isnt a 2nd book. I would reccomend this book to everyone. It is a great book that everyone should own!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you imagine living in a world where there is no poverty, everyone is kind and polite. There is no illness, or disease, no real pain. Sounds wonderful, right?Lois Lowry show us such a world in The Giver. She also explores what we would have to give up to have this 'sameness'Jonas is happy with his life. He has his 'family unit', mother, father and one sister, just like all the other families. He enjoys playing with his friends and riding his bike. He is apprehensive however about the upcoming \\"Ceremony of 12\\". At 12 yrs old each child is given their assignment or their career.

Once you finish a page you just want to keep on going. This book would probably be one of the best books I have ever read. Too bad Lois Lowry didn't write a sequel to The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in one day, but it wasn't really that great, in my opinion. It seemed just like all the other utopian/distopian books I've read.

Jonas lives in such a world. At the significant age of 12, Jonas' life is decided for him. He is to be the Giver. He will live apart from his family, with only the guidance of the Old Giver to help him. Nothing in his childhood has prepared him for the things he is about to experience. You will cry in pain with him; you will leap in ecstasy with him.This book is a can't-put-it-down thrill ride!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"'The Giver' by Lois Lowry concerns a teenage boy growing upin a society where all emotions are repressed, births arestrictly controlled and those who don't fit in are&quot;released&quot;.I won't say too much about it, because there are acouple of plot features which I could spoil.What I will say is that it is brilliantly written - thereader can instantly emphasise with the central character -incredibly moving and altogether beleivable.(N.B. This is a young adults title, but don't let that putany adult readers off)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Take a close look. This encompasses the central theme of the book. At some point, people realized that all kinds of sin and strife sprang from differences and envy. And so they removed color. The book never explains quite how- it's not pure science fiction but more of a mix with fantasy. But there are two in the society that can always see in color. And they are the ones who remember pain, for without pain you can not truly make wise decisions.Now that cuts to the wick. You don't expect something so deep in a children's novel that puts the novel into a category of not only readable for adults, but one adults *should* read. Lowry very realistically describes the process of emerging color-sight, describing what it is like for the first time to truly see after all your life living in a society of black and white. In the process she reveals, if it is our differences which cause the strife between us, perhaps the removal of those differences is too great a price to pay. And perhaps pain itself is too great a thing to lose if it means a life of mediocrity and forgetfulness. For with much pain also comes much Joy.I wrote this review before there was a hint of two sequels, and hence was forced o give it the low rating. Without the sequels, it is incomplete. The Giver will stick with you; you will remember it's myth. But embrace it as an unfinished story until you've read the sequels."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is about a boy named Jonas who is living in a futuristic society where color and emotions are non-existent and jobs are assigned to people when they turn 12 years old. Jonas is assigned the job of \\"The Receiver\\". This means he holds all the memories of the past.This is by far the most amazing book I've ever read. I'd never read a book more than once before this one, and I'd also never read a book in one day before this one. I read this book two years ago when I was in the 8th grade. My friend had suggested that I read it. I had previously attempted to read this book in the 6th grade, but I just couldn't get interested in it. I was not assigned to read this book, but after trying to pressure my other friends into reading it, they explained to me that they had already tried to when they were younger. I don't believe that this book is appropriate for children under the age of 13. It's too advanced, and I don't believe that they would understand or really take in the point of the book.The best part about this book is that at the end, you get to choose what happens. It's left to the reader to decide Jonas's and Gabe's fate.I highly recommend this book! Lois Lowry is amazing, and I can't wait to check out other books she's written!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I did not like this book at all. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I like books THAT MAKE SENSE! The Giver had nothing to do with reality and did not make much sense at all. For example- where did it take place? I had to write a report on it with a paragraph of the setting...and I had to say 'a community'. I'm sorry but I don't really understand where everyone is getting the idea that this book is 'perfect' and all. I mean I can KINDA see where your coming from if you were to say that the book makes you think or is intresting. Because I'm not going to lie The Giver was OK and intresting to read and get away from it all...but it's a LITTLE over the top.I was giving MY opinion,-Megan V.-"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't understand what's the big deal about this book. Having read tons of scifi, I expected more from a Newberry winner. What I got was a rehash of The Lottery, with the typical utopian society so immersed in its own sickness it can't see straight. This book is all right for younger audiences, but I like more complexity and originality in my books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine that you live in a world where everything operates in an orderly fashion and pain, anguish, crime, poverty, hunger, prejudice, racism, sexism and other societal ills have been eliminated.

Jonas is bestowed a great honor when he is selected as the next Receiver of Memory.Jonas' world quickly turns upside down as he learns that his society, which has totally eliminated individuality and personal choice, is not as perfect as he once thought.This is a wonderful book and the ending is quite poetic."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"it was good, i read it in 4th grade, but i thought it was really sad and it made me want to cry, happy ending though, if i remember anyways read this side of paradise if you like this; similar book"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that this was a good book.

It made you think of all the sacrifices to humanity that would be made to make a &quot;Utopia&quot; reality. In a since it reminded me of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. It did this because it involved the subjugation or control of natural human urges. Hey, close to a thousand people have reviewed this book. Why not buy it and draw your own conclusions?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book about a very boring place, but it starts to get exciting at the end. If you read this book, you should see Pleasantville."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think The Giver was an excellent book. I would recommend that book to everyone. Lois Lowry did a great job in describing the details and keeping the readers attention. I don't think I lost interest once; it was hard to put the book down for one second. I disagree with what other readers had to say. People say that the society Jonas lived in was perfect? After thinking about it, I don't see a perfect society in my mind. I didn't like the fact that everyone had bikes instead of cars. What's the reason for that? Everyday was the same weather. I know some people like different weather than others, but a little variety wouldn't hurt. Also, another reason for its imperfect existence is the purpose of release. I find that cruel the way that they do that to people; I don't find that perfect at all. I'm an active person and I don't like how everyone in the story was lazy. It seemed as if they were all slaves and they had no freedom. The characters had no feelings about life. In today's society you have to work hard to achieve a perfect family, house, and lifestyle, but there isn't anyone who has a perfect life. Everyone has some problems or difficulties in life, but in The Giver, everything was good. I know today's society is out of control, but I think the community in the story is torture. Life is an adventure, but not in The Giver. Everything we go through in life serves a purpose, so think about if the town is perfect or not. The Giver is an excellent book and I recommend you read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a perfect society. No pain, no color, and nolove. Jonas has to worry about turning twelve.

The Giver, the previous Receiver of Memory, has to pass on the memories of the whole world to Jonas.The Giver has enlightened me. Lois Lowry has taken true life and has molded it with fiction, to create the greatest story about utopia that I have ever read. She used descriptive characters and a great story line. This story will most likely stay with me for long time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book about a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas. In Jonas's community receiving the assignment of The Receiver honored him. In this society there is no pain, color, not even real feelings. These people in Jonas's community in a sense were brainwashed. From the beginning of their lives they were trained to speak common phases such as \\"I apologize for my inconvenience,\\" and \\"I accept your apology.\\" In the community, it is common practice to share each other's feelings of the day at dinner with family units. However, these people can not explain their feelings properly. Once, during dinner Lilly, Jonas's sister, told how she met with kids from neighboring community and became angry at how they broke the rules. However, she did not realize that they didn't know or didn't have the same rules. I believe the book is mainly about humanity. I find it very hard that a utopian society could ever exist. I believe that human beings need emotions such as fear, danger, love, and even hate. Without these emotions people would never be human; they would simply be mindless robots willing to obey. In reading this book I have learned that having imperfections is only part of being a human being."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverThis is another excellent selection by Lowry. Herdetailed description and vivid writing guide the story along verywell. The Giver is a quick book because once you start it, you can'tput it down. Personally, this book was well worth my time and I reccomend that all of you consider reading it.It's about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community in the far away furture. The world he lives in is perfect. No one has a choice about anything from whom their spouce should be to what job they should choose. They don't even make their own children! A person is selected to do this job. Every one is the same and every one develops the same. Children even have their birthdays on the same day. The rules are very complicated because they don't want the world to go back to the same state as it was long before their time.When Jonas turns twelve, he gets the highly honored job of keeping all of the memories, the painful and wonderful feelings of the past. He recieves the memories from the Giver who recieved the same memories from another giver generations ago. They are passed down in a continuous cycle from one Giver to the next. It is important that only the Giver recieves the memories so that the community isn't overwhelmed by all of the feelings which they never knew existed. If the memories were to excape the Givers, whether it be through death or release, the community would go back to its wretched ways of long ago. Some of the memories are painful but some are also joyful memories of things such as colors, birthday parties and love. This is a great book that I think deserved the John Newbury Medal, which it was awarded.The people in this world do not see the colors, they don't have love, and they don't know of war and death. If there were such a world, I would fear that it would be too fragile if anything abnormal occurred. I would much rather have a more prepared and experienced community like we have today than to sacrifice the pleasures of life for a delicate world of sameness. When reading this inspiring story, it makes you think, &quot;What has the world come to?&quot; Although, I do believe that it is a rather critical point of view for such a real-life topic, it still makes you think. It is almost immpossible to imagine a world without violence or crime. An infalible world of sameness."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read.

I could not put this one down. Each chapter left me wanting more. The maturing of Jonus in his understanding of his society is rivetting. I felt his sorrow as his understanding grew that he could not return to the perfect society he once knew. A gem of a book and a strong recommondation."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; makes a great addition to the already growing dystopia library. Many of you may be wondering what Negative Utopia and Dystopia are- no, they aren't commonly used terms, are they? Well, let's start early on...Many readers may have heard of books like &quot;1984&quot; (by George Orwell) and &quot;Brave New World&quot; (by Aldous Huxley). These great novels are perfect examples of modern dystopias. Dystopias, or Negative Utopias, as they are also known, are the opposite of a Utopia, or perfect society (making these words describe greatly flawed and problematic societies). The use of Negative Utopias usually revolves around human rights- in &quot;1984&quot;, human rights are taken away, and &quot;big brother&quot; is always watching. In &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the use of post-modern science is used to illustrate a dark world of the future, where people are genetically engineered and separated into classes. This type of writing is sometimes simply called paranoid, but I thoroughly believe that the warnings expressed in some of these books are important to consider- while I doubt that thought-police are going to take over our country tomorrow, sometimes our society seems to be heading that way.&quot;The Giver&quot; uses many of the same ideas (classes, regulated societies) to illustrate another dark world of the future, where marriages are formed by the government, and all children are adopted. It adds its own flavorful twist, though- a man called &quot;the Giver&quot; is designated to hold all of the dark thoughts that the rest of society has forgotten, memories that are passed on from generation to generation. This addition is very ingenious, and makes the entire plot a little more eerie. The book also succeeds in suspense- I couldn't stop reading until I got to the end.I was debating between 4 and 5 stars on this book, but in the end I decided on 5 stars. While there are some things that could have been developed or added, the book succeeds in doing the job it was meant to do: introducing the entire idea of Dystopias, or futuristic but flawed worlds, to students and young people."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Dear friends,I know that you like reading books. We (9d) read this book (The Giver written by Lois Lowry) which deals with rules in a community seperated from the whole world. At the beginning it is hard to understand and you will expect that it is a boring book. But after this part there is a turning - point in thrilling. After this point the story gets much more interesting, although it is still confusing. While you are reading the story lots of questions come to your mind. Some are answered later on but other answers you can only assume. All in all it is a very nice and interesting book because the author presents the advantages and problems of this perfect world seen through the community's eyes very well. That's why I can recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. I have read it twice because the first time I read it I was little and i didnt understand it.

I am in 7th grade now. Some people think that this book would scare little kids. It never scared me. I just loved it. I do think that it is a super good book for more mature kids. I have read this book so many times that I cant count any more. I just want to say that the Giver is the best fiction book that I have ever read. I recommend it to all mature readers. This book has so much depth in it. The first time I read it I cried, it was so good. I never cry while reading (except for when I read Gone With The Wind at the end). After I read it, i later rocommended it to my friends. They all read it and said that it was the best book that they had ever read.

There is no pain, confusion, war, poverty, sickness, orsadness in this society. At age twelve, everyone is assigned a job by the community Elders. Spouses and children are chosen by the elders as well. At teh ceremony of twelve, Jonas is assigned the job of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is given memories of the past from the Giver. The memory of every stron emotion or sensation, every tradgdy, every song, all that has been purged from the community, is held by the Receiver. It is the Receiver's job to be the one entrusted with retaining these things for the sake of the community. Jonas receives memories of pain, war sadness, love, joy, anger, fear, and death. Jonas realizes that the people who formed his utopian community had to give up feelings, choice, colors: anything that would make one person different from his fellows. Difference leads to strife. By eliminating differences, the community can exsist without any problems that plauge society. As he learns of the past, Jonas comes to feel that his society is not a utopia at all. Having experienced emotion, Jonas realizes that he cannot continue to live in the community, and runs away. The story is told in the third person, from Jonas's point of view. The message of the book is that sometimes the cure is worese than the disease. In attempting to form a utopian society, those who created Jonas's community robbed its citizens of thier humanity, For example, if a baby is born in this society that is at all &quot;imperfect&quot;, it is killed. I really enjoyed The Giver because it is so well written that it makes me feel as if I am there with Jonas. I would give this book four stars because I do not understand what happens to Jonas at the end. The book ends with Jonas sledding down a hill that leads him, perhaps, into an imperfect community, like ours, where colors, choice, music, and feelings exsist. The ending is not clear to me because I don't know if Jonas dies, or if he really comes to a community with colors, choice, music, and feelings."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is five times better than I thouht it would be. Usually, school books are not very much fun to read. They try too hard to teach you something. Well, sinceI read the Giver, I've changed my mind; it was GREAT. It's the best school book I've ever read. This great book is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian world. Jonas is the receiver of memories in his community because no one else in the town has any memories. He finds this out by seeing several memories of the real world. He finds out that his world is just a colorless, emotionless pleace where no one has any enjoyment using the senses. Jonas can't believe this! He is discouraged ans appalled when he finds this out. He runs away looking for the real world. I loved this book because it has an excellent plot, and I loved the ending because you make up the last part yourself. I thought the ending was extremely suspenseful. The setting of The Giver is in a small village. The main charecters in The Giver are Jonas, the receiver of the town; the Giver, the man who gives Jonas the memories; Asher, Jonas' best friend; and Fiona, the girl whom Jonas likes. Th econflict in the book is when Jonas realizes that his world is all the same and that people are not given the choices to experience or feel and to be free and live in a real world. Thsi makes Jonas feel differently about everybody in his life and makes him want to run away. You will be surprised by the way he resolves this conflict. I thought the idea of having a person who actually receives memories was intriguing. A utopia which takes away personal freedom is not worth having! I highly recomend this book. It is fun to read and it will make you think."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This novel, The Giver, written by Lois Lowry is an exciting, breath-taking book. It is well written, and it keeps you interested with the exciting things that are happening. It is about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who discovers the true meaning of life. You see, he lives in a community where there is no color or pain. Nobody is left hungry, and everybody is equal. You might think it is a utopia, but the people have to give up a lot. They have no love, no marriage, no originality, and no one can be the slightest bit different. Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory, who receives the memories of the past before the community went to Sameness, and he alone can experience the pleasure and pain of life. His father is a nurturer who takes care of babies, or so Jonas thinks. Actually, Jonas sees his father kill a baby on video screen! His mother works as a person who enforces laws. Jonas realizes that he lives in no utopia and that he lives in a totally separated society. His society is separated from practically the whole outside world. He realizes that his community is separated from the outside world from the memories he has been receiving from The Giver. He decides he cannot live without colors, pain, or basically a regular world with real love, so he leaves the community and goes &quot;Elsewhere&quot; to live in the pleasure of colors and weather. That is an extremely daring move. You see, in his community, nobody is allowed to leave their homes after dark. Also, he steals food. That is dangerous because the night crew is right there watching him take it! If I were Jonas, I would do the exact same thing he did. I could not imagine living in a society like that one. The Giver is a truly excellent book because the plot is interesting, and the book kept feeding me with more and more information. I recommend it to children ten and over because younger ones might not get or understand the true meaning of the book. I give it 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book about a boy named Jonas who lives inan almost perfect community with no future, no choices, and nopain. When Jonas is chosen to be the new receiver of memories, his whole life changes. The community in which Jonas lives is plain and flat, with no hills, and the weather is always the same, with no rain or snow. All the houses are the same. The food and the furnishings are the same. Even the people are the same. Jonas has a father who is a nurturer, one who cares for babies; a mother who is a lawyer, and an eight-year-old sister named Lily, a sometimes-annoying girl, who goes to school. Jonas has two friends: Asher, a mischievous and funny boy, and Fiona, a nice girl whom Jonas likes. There is Gabriel, a little baby boy who has been sleeping at Jonas' house to try and become a part of the community. Last but not least, there is the Giver, the former receiver, whose job is to hold onto the community's memories. He changes Jonas' view of the world, and becomes Jonas' best friend. The Giver teaches Jonas a lot. He helps him to get feelings through memories in order to become the new receiver. He also helps Jonas learn more about the rules and history of the community. One night, the Giver shows Jonas one of the rules of the community called &quot;Releasing.&quot; The only thing Jonas knows about releasing is that it is part of his father's job. The Giver has Jonas observe his father perform the procedure on the Giver's television screen. Jonas gets extremely mad when he learns that releasing is basically murder. He is shocked when he sees his father inject a deadly liquid into an infant. After that incident, Jonas is certain that his community is not perfect. He thinks about how no one is allowed to have feelings and make choices. The Giver and Jonas make a plan for Jonas to go to another community so that he and the rest of their community could have a better and different life by having the freedom of choices and feelings. I think this was a really good book because it shows me a new view of the world. For example, it tells me that you shouldn't try to make a perfect world because you will have to give up important things like emotions and being a unique individual. I give this book five stars as a rating because it was well written and very informative and detailed. This book was very exciting, interesting, and fun to read. I recommend it to anyone from ten to adult because I promise you, the book will be a part of you, and you won't be able to put it down once you take a peek behind the cover! Have fun!

Then the speaker went on and the voice said for the people to go into the nearest house and stay there. That was how the story began.Then, Jonas and Asher were throwing an apple and Jonas saw the apple change. Jonas got his job as the Receiver of Memories and his first memory was snow.In the end, Jonas finds out what &quot;release&quot; really means and he makes a plan to leave and go elsewhere.I thought the book was cool but the ending was weird. I liked the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The community was excited when they heard the plane go by. Jonas was worried about what his Assignment would be. Jonas starts to see-beyond. At his Ceremony of Twelve he is afraid they've forgotten him. He finds he is given a very special assignment at the end of the ceremony. He is surprised by his new rules and finds them different from anybody else's rules in the community. He begins his special training. Jonas finds out what being &quot;Released&quot; is. He decides he doesn't agreee with the community. The Giver helps him make a plan to escape. He is forced to leave early and finally makes it to Elsewhere... or does he?I would recommend this book to anyone. It's fun for people of all ages to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lowry's The Giver, is quite possibly one of the best pices of literature I have ever read. It stands out from any other book. Never before has a book captivated readers with a strange world that is similar, but yet different from our own. Some of the things characters go through are mind blowing. Jonas, the main character, suffers these things with the rest of the community, however, Jonas begins to learn about things such as color and temperature that other members in the community do not know about. He goes through so much pain and discomfort and learns about death and killing and war. When you read these vividly described scenes, your jaw will be unhinged and you will know that you are completely obsessed with this book. It might be 2:00 in the morning but once your into this book you'll be stuck in Lowery's world. You won't want out, you won't answer the phone or talk to family or friends until you finish The Giver. This book is that good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My class was assigned two books to read for the summer (ThePearl and the Giver) I read the Pearl first because it was shorter Iheld off reading the giver until I had little time to read it. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to finish it before school started so I started reading as fast as possible. I loved it. I read it in about a week because I wanted to see what would happen next. The Giver is about a young boy, Jonas, who lives in a colorless world who is singled out to recieve special training from the Giver. Everyone in his town has their choices made for them. Their jobs, spouses, etc. There is no war, pain, poverty, or anything else having to do with that. But Jonas learns of the memories of the past such as snow, sledding, colors, rainbows, and painful stuff like guns and sunburns.

There is no violence. There is no hatred. But can the people of this utopian society then understand beauty, peace, and love?When Jonas comes of age, he is appointed to recieve the burden of all the memories of the Community. He alone is to understand for all of them , so they may live life freely, in ignorance. He alone is to be truly human, to suffer, but he is also to love. As he lives the world through its memories, he sets himself apart from the rest in the Community. It is as though he has vision while they are blind. He sees their efficient acts of cruelty, their legal murder, their naive helplessness. They are under perfect control, they are sheltered, they are channeled and programmed. They think that they are happy without knowing happiness in its true form. Children play war without understanding death or anger or cruelty. Women and men apply for a spouse and are matched via the government, assigned to a house and allowed one male and one female child for their family unit, but they do not have the intellectual capacity to love. Suddenly he is compelled to open their eyes to the sunlight, their ears to music...One musical piece that truly fits this book is Chopin's Mazurka in A minor, Op.67, No.4."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an unusual science fiction story, about the perfect society. Jonas is the main character, and the oldest child in his family unit. In this perfect society, each family unit can have one male and one female child. This community has a committee, who chooses your spouse, and after a few years you can apply to have children. Each child has to stay with its age group. There are ones and twos, threes and fours, until the age of 12. There is a ceremony of the twelve year olds, and they are each given their assignment/job. At the ceremony of the twelve year olds, Jonas was skipped.This was very unusual, but he was skipped for a very good reason. He was to be the new giver, the holder of all memories. I thought that the book was wonderful. It made me stop and think that our lives and lifestyles aren't that bad. It also made me think that we take little things for granted; things like color, music, making dinner, and the freedom to love. Those are things you don't notice until they are gone. I would recommend this book to someone that is looking for another world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is truly awesome! Before my reading class started to read this, we were asked to write an essay of what our perfect &quot;utopia&quot; would look or be like. The beginning is sort of confusing, but after chapters 7 and 8 you wanna really get into it! Jonas lives in a perfect world, where everything is the same. No one sees color, there is no pain or hunger, and mostly everything is controlled. But then, when Jonas is told what his job is to be, it is something he never expected. He is to be the Reciever Of Memory, the one who recieves ALL the memories of the past, even before people went to, as Ms. Lowry calls it, Sameness. Jonas learns the true pain that people felt before Sameness. He can ask any question and recieve an answer, because of his high honer.

It was ... different. However, the ending wasn\`t very clear. You could not tell what happened to the main character at the end, so it did not work well for me.Original, but not for me."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i read the book a while ago and it had good parts and bad parts but overall it was kinda chessey, i woundnt give it to any of my friends"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"According to the back cover, The Giver is a Boston-Globe-Horn Book Honor Book, an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults, an American Library Association Notable Book for Children, a winner of the Regina Medal, a Booklist Editors Choice, a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and it won the John Newbery Award. With all of that, do you really need me to tell you that The Giver is a really good book? Probably not, but I'm going to anyway. The Giver is a really good book and one of my all time favorites. If you haven't read it, stop what you're doing and read it now.The focus of The Giver is the people living in The Community, a perfect society. There are echoes of Brave New World and 1984, but The Giver is only a dystopian novel depending on how you look at it. The Community is a utopia. It's perhaps a little rough around the edges, true, but it's a mostly perfect place and it has to be, or the main thesis of the novel would fall short. I'm getting a bit ahead of myself, but just remember that for this book to work, life in The Community has to be a life worth considering or there is no dilemma for our characters or the reader.Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people sharing all the world... You may say Lois Lowry is a dreamer, but this is the world of The Community. There is almost no pain, no sickness, no poverty, no religion, no racism, no one is left wanting for anything (and what they might want, they've never known), and almost no one is ever lonely. I know what you're thinking, Esteemed reader: What's the catch? Well there is one and we'll get to it, but first consider life in The Community.The people of The Community are healthy because for the first year of their life they are in the care of nurturers, who ensure every baby is the perfect weight and well taken care of by experienced professionals. There are no unwanted children in The Community and that right there is something to consider. Every child growing up in The Community is given everything they'll ever need and cared for all the way into their old age.True, the members of The Community do have to give up some things, but that's not all bad either. At twelve years of age, a committee decides a person's occupation and they go into training and there they'll work for the rest of their lives, so job stability is never an issue. If a person requests one, a mate will be assigned to them. A mate carefully chosen by committee to ensure they are a perfect match for their spouse and later the couple can apply for two children, a girl and a boy. When the children have grown, they'll live with their friends, Mom and Dad will live with their friends, and no one is lonely or rejected.Again, I know what you're thinking: how could anyone live with all of their decisions made by others and no freedom? Well, if I may play devil's advocate, I might ask \\"what's so great about freedom?\\" And temporarily suspend your patriotic programming as an American and really consider it. I'm fortunate that God put the perfect woman on earth just for me and I found her and married her, but Lord knows I found a few who weren't her beforehand. There were others I could have married that might just have wrecked my life and made wretched my destiny. There was no committee to help me out and I might just have made the wrong choice. Anybody reading ever know anyone who made the wrong choice in a mate?And what about career choice? Sure, I've found the perfect job for me and I couldn't be happier now, but I spent a lot of years in wrong jobs I chose. And what about the folks we all know who just plain make the wrong choices all around? Their wrong choices don't affect just them, we all suffer. A person making the choice to lose themselves in drugs or other indulgences may claim it's only themselves they are hurting, but this is a lie as transparent as Charlie Sheen's recent claim that he is only going to smoke crack socially (a funnier line than anything on his show).My favorite thing about The Community is how they treat their old. When folks in The Community get old, they are moved to The House for the Old where they are cared for like the children. They never experience dementia or other horrifying sickness. No one is kept in a hospital bed for years suffering alone. When it's time, the old person is surrounded by their friends and their life is celebrated. They tell the story of the person's life and then he or she says one last goodbye and is \\"released into Elseworld.\\" Is that a euphemism that means what you think it means? There are no spoilers on this blog, but even if it does mean that, is that really so bad? I can think of much worse ways to go.So what's the catch, already? I know it's our anniversary and all, but this review is running a little long. The catch is that The Community has no memory, no passion, and no sense of its past. They have no hate, but they also have no love. There's a wonderful freedom in this as well, but is it worth it? I'm not going to tell you and one of my most favorite things about The Giver is that Lois Lowry doesn't tell you either. The best books provoke the reader's imagination and leave readers to ponder these questions for themselves and draw their own conclusions. Lowry implies some things, perhaps, but for the most part she is simply asking the question.Nor is there a lot of explanation about the scientific workings that make The Community possible. Lowry wrote two sequels and I recommend them both and you can check them out if you want more details, but the details are sort of beside the point. There probably isn't a one hundred percent plausible explanation for everything, but so what? Lowry wisely leaves much of these details to the imagination. For example, genetic engineering is never mentioned, but it's certainly implied. And whether The Community is achieved through science, recovered UFO technology, or the wave of a wand, it makes little difference and a lesser writer going on and on about the explanation would be a waste of our time. We know The Community isn't possible, but Lowry need only provide a few details to provoke us to consider the implications of such a world if it were possible. And The Community is very real for the characters in this story, which is was ultimately matters.Instead, Lowry focuses on the story. When our hero, Jonas, turns twelve he is selected for the most unusual occupation of Receiver. Only one is picked every so many generations and no one really knows what he or she does, only that they need the Receiver and that it is the most important position in The Community. As Receiver, Jonas is separated from the rest of The Community. He is allowed to lie, something no one else is allowed to do, although how can he really know? He is also allowed to ask anyone anything and he is the only person who will know all that there is to know about The Community.Jonas is sent to the old Receiver, who becomes The Giver, and what he's giving are memories. I've said that The Community has no memory or sense of past. This is because the Receiver holds the memories for them in his head and when he grows old he transmits them to the new Receiver. The Giver transmits memories such as snow and sunburn to Jonas, which he has never experienced living in the climate controlled world of The Community. The Giver also transmits memories of war, poverty, suffering, disease, and all the rest of it to Jonas. But also colors and love, neither of which the people of The Community have ever known because they're colorblind (literally).In order to achieve Utopia, these people have given up everything that might create passion in their lives, even music and, gasp, choke, books. What the heck would I blog about in such a world? This is the most weighty of concerns, I know:) I wondered if the people of The Community ever engaged in, ahem, adult relationships. As this is a book for younger readers, I didn't think Lowry would cover it, but she does. After Jonas has an inappropriate dream about his sister and a bath (not his biological sister), his mother tells him he must take a pill each day to remove such \\"stirrings\\".I guess I sort of read over that part as a kid and didn't catch it until now. But in our world we have Viagra, and in Lowry's world there are pills that do the exact opposite. I won't spend a lot of time on this, but I would imagine you adult readers enjoy the capacity to have such relationships. On the other hand, that same capacity has brought about plenty of suffering, so I ask again: Is The Community really that bad?True, there is no color, no music, no art, no... um, kissing, no passion of any kind, and no books. We who love books might balk at the prospect, but that's because we know about them. The people in The Community have never had these things and don't know what they're missing. Most of them don't even know about death, and just think how much stress would be relieved if you didn't know you were going to die one day (spoiler, I know).But now Jonas does know and the question is what's he going to do now that he knows? Could it be that something traumatic has happened to The Giver that will make this giving and receiving of memories different than any such giving and receiving that has come in generations past? Of course it could, or this novel will be episodic and there would be no story worth telling that makes this time in The Community's history more notable than any of the others Lowry could have chosen. But I have promised no spoilers and even though a few probably slipped through, here we'll leave it.I haven't touched much on craft and I'm afraid I'm not going to this week. Lowry does everything right from start to finish. Like a work of Mozart, the misplacing of a single note could mean diminishment, but Lowry absolutely nails every aspect of craft and delivers what may just be a perfect book. Her prose is clear and crisp and never a distraction. In fact, I was so completely drawn into the story upon reading this book, I forgot to take that many notes even though I already knew the ending. The Giver sucks its reader in and I read the whole thing in a single sitting because it became physically impossible for me to put the book down.Fair warning: there are some extremely disturbing scenes in the later part of the book that would make Stephen King say, \\"Dude, that's messed up!\\" I'm not going to spoil them either. Still, sensitive readers should be aware that you may be most unpleasantly shocked. But remember, it's good to be shocked every so often.Be sure to be here on Thursday when none other than Lois Lowry will be here to face the 7 Questions and check back on Saturday as God willing, we'll have a literary agent here on Saturday as well. By the way, I mentioned God several times in this review, but I also listed \\"no religion\\" as a quality of utopia. That is sort of perplexing, isn't it? I never do quite reveal my full thoughts on religion or even most political issues do I? Thanks for a great year of giving and receiving on this blog everybody:)And now, because I see I have not included a single passage from the text in this entire longwinded review, I'll leave you with some of my favorite bits from The Giver:It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. (a great opening line if I ever read one--MGN)But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear.\\"There's administrative work, and the dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience--did you know that they use a discipline wand on the Old, the same as for small children?\\"\\"Definitely not safe,\\" Jonas said with certainty. \\"What if they were allowed to choose their own mate? And chose wrong?\\"Or what if,\\" he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, \\"they chose their own jobs?\\"Frightening, isn't it?\\" The Giver said.Jonas chuckled. \\"Very frightening. I can't even imagine it. We really have to protect people from wrong choices.\\"\\"It's bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,\\" Father had said, in his sweet, sing-song voice. (really only effective if read in context, but if you've read the book, you know the impact of this line -MGN)After countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish. Methodically, Jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and fed the raw shreds to himself and to... (spoiler -- MGN)."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in high school and it influenced the rest of my life. It was very eye-opening =)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Rather unremarkable dystopian fiction, only this time geared for young adults. It's a serviceable book for middle schoolers to read, if for no other reason the books from which it is derived (1984, We, Brave New World, etc.) are at a much higher reading level.Although it's readable (and engaging, as soon as you get to the \\"You may lie\\" line), the thing that prevents it from being any greater is that the core metaphor, the core premise of the book, is wobbly. It'd be one thing if the Giver had been teaching him about the lost art of reading. But that's been done, in \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Or maybe teaching him about the lost art of science? But that's been done, in \\"Anthem.\\" Or teaching him about history? Only that's been done too: in \\"1984.\\"So what remains for Lowry? To teach him to reconnect with memories. Which can be transfered, though when they are they cannot be retained? What? And the way to transfer them is to put your hands on the recipient's back?

(It also reminded me of why I have not bothered with fiction for so many years.)Problems:1. We don't have any explanation of how this situation came to be. At least in \\"Animal Farm,\\" there is something to explain how the events came to be. Nor do we clearly understand the ending of the book. It had one of those bailout endings. (Imagine the author thinking \\"How do I end this thing? Oh, I don't know. Let's just give it an ending.\\")2. We don't know where are these people with respect to everyone else in the world. Did everyone else just mysteriously vanish leaving these people to live this life?3. There were a few too many elements borrowed from other dystopian novels. So, we did notice that Lowry showed characters who made up compound words to describe things that would have been distasteful to them. (\\"Release\\"=death; \\"newchild\\"=baby, etc.)4. These topics are way too heavy for this to be a children's book. I understand what Lowry was getting at in most instances (\\"What is pleasure without pain?\\" or \\"If you never have to struggle to survive, how do you appreciate surviving?\\"), but one comes away with the impression that this was just overall poorly done. She could have chosen one SIMPLE theme and stuck with it-- so as to make the book suitable for children. (How many childrens' books need Cliffs' notes for goodness sake?)5. Can people really be modified this much? The point of human beings is to make more DNA (and not the other way around). Can people so easily be trained to abandon their sexual feelings or their babies? People see colors before they can describe them in words. How do you train someone to not understand that? Perhaps it is good that this book *was* written for kids, because at this point in time, the feats that would have been necessary to make these people could not have been believed by any reasonable adult (that had sat through Bio 101).I would pay, at most, $1 for this book-- but not for my children.

Buy Buy Buy Buy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This has been a powerful book for me ever since I first read it in the sixth grade. Something resonated from then and I return to it over and over. In fact, I credit it with developing my love of dystopian fiction in general. And while this book has its flaws, it's so much a part of my love of books that I simply don't care.Jonas is an eleven year old living in his community. He has an assigned family unit and the coming December marks his transition to a twelve year old. This is the year that his job assignment happen and he learns his role in the community. However, the unexpected happens when he is chosen to be the new Receiver for his community, a role that is only granted to one person and the previous Receiver is growing old. It isn't until his training though that Jonas learns what this job actually entails. He is the receiver of memory, good and bad, and the only holder of true feelings besides his mentor the Giver, in a world that has chosen sameness over choice and life.Jonas is pretty compliant. He was designed to be that way from his birth to his training at home. But his experiences with the Giver make him grow and he slowly drifts away from obedience to wanting something better for a community that doesn't want the same thing. The Giver too is a wise but pitiable figure as he has all this knowledge and wisdom and can't really share it with anyone. He has to suffer alone. The other characters are two-dimensional, as they are supposed to be. They have so long been brainwashed and chemically controlled that they are arguably not true humans, but more like robots. And their reactions to each other are so superficial that it's painful to read.The theme is definitely dystopian. So much so because Jonas does live in the perfect world. No war, no bullies, everyone is polite; but there is no true life. There is no art or music or all the wonderful things that we take for granted in this world. That the quest for perfection and easiness has a high price to pay, and people shouldn't get complacent. And the ending, without giving too much away I do want to comment on it. It gives you a choice, and it's interesting too what people think of the ending and why. I tend to choose the more tragic route. The only thing I could really want more from this book is detail about Jonah's society. There is so much about its past and its everyday workings that I would have loved to understand.This is definitely a book that will make you think. It will always remain on my shelf and is one that I take with me on long travels. There's a plethora of feelings that come from reading it.The GiverCopyright 1993180 pagesReview by M.

So when I heard so many good things about this 'new classic', I thought, 'why not?'. I was a bit apprehensive to choose a 'classic', because they always sound like very boring difficult readings, but not this one. Not at ALL. Well, this IS a children's book... but the issues dealt within are very adult. That's for sure.The Giver is a short, sweet, creepy and enticing book. There are no more than 179 pages, but the story is so well-written, the characters are so well developed, and the plot is so easy to get lost into, that you can barely believe that so much has fit into such a small number of pages! And, of course, it leaves you wanting more. Much more. I loved it, but I would have been even more content if the book was just a tad bit longer, showing what happened to the village and what really came to happen at the end. I don't like 'open endings' like this one had, but I hear the other books will explain a couple of things, so I'll just have to look for them. :)So, the big deal here was: I have read a LOT of dystopians, and I have always thought of how creative they were... well, as it turns out, (in my opinion, at least), most of them must have been somehow inspired by Lois Lowry's world, because the similarities with some titles are uncanny. I won't list them here, because, really, who am I to accuse others? What I mean to say is: once you've read this one... you'll know what I mean."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is an amazing book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

I have already purchased another in the series. I did find the book a bit troublling though so be prepared to have to think a little."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry's The Giver has been enjoyed by generations of young adults, and older ones as well. It is a very good book with superficial and deeper meanings, and is a great study in contrasts and how our society might one day turn out. It just seems basic, written in a simplistic style. It is easy to follow, easy to understand, and fun to analyze. Deeper messages abound, and it has a few morals and interesting lessons about family, friends, and relationships tossed in as well. It also deals with the idea of being different in a world where everything feels the same. It has good development, and I highly recommend it to middle school students and anyone who hasn't read it. An old classic for modern times in a future world, it is truly generation-spanning. Having read The Giver multiple times, I still am not enthralled by it. However, I prefer elaborate stories, so don't be put off it. I myself did not love it, but it's worth being read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is an interesting work of dark fiction. It is about a planned society set in the very far future. Kind of a young reader's version of Brave New World or WE. The main character of Jonas lives in a world where everybody is assigned a job at the age of twelve after years of very careful education and training on how to behave, work and play within the community. Those who do not fit in are Released.Jonas has been selected to be the Receiver of Memory. He will be filled with memories of generations past, like a jug is filled with water, to be used as a source of information by the leaders. He learns about pain and love and starvation. In doing so he can no longer live within the community, with people he has come to distrust and even hate."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas, the main character of The Giver, is a 12 year old boy living in a society that has decided to rid itself of imperfections. The weather, for example, has been erased, leaving every day a bland day without sun, rain, wind or snow. Color has been erased. Animals no longer exist. Perfectly proper language must be used at all times - if a child mistakenly says just before lunch, \\"I'm starving,\\" that is cause to be beaten, because, although he may be hungry, he is not actually \\"starving.\\" Love has been erased, presumably because it is often messy or painful. And choice has been erased. A committee of elders from this society decides, when you are twelve, what occupation you will begin training for, and eventually they decide to whom you will be married and if you are fit to raise children. You do not HAVE children in this society, however. One of the occupations for females who are slightly less intelligent and hard working is 'birth mother.' Birth mothers live amongst themselves, and give birth to up to three children who are in turn given to suitable parents. (There is no mention of how these children are fathered - the only loose end in the story but one my middle school language arts students found unsatisfactory.) There is, then, no need for sex nor sexual desire; when that little problem comes up among adolescents, they are told by their parents that they must start taking a pill daily that erases these urges.The novel begins just before the main character, Jonas, turns twelve. At the Ceremony of Twelves he learns that he has been chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory, a position of prestige but one that is very painful, for Jonas learns that every other person in his town, with the exception of The Giver, has had their memories of the past erased. He must be given these memories - memories of love, of extended family, of war, of pain, of snow, of animals, of everything that has been erased - and he discovers the richness of the world that has been extinguished, its good and bad, the absurdities, joys, tragedies, everything that makes us at times sad but also, at times, euphoric. Jonas realizes how colorless, literally and figuratively, this new world he lives in really is, and he is overwhelmed with the knowledge. The reader is treated to a captivating story, one that is difficult to put down. When I read it along with my students, as a group, out loud, and I say, \\"OK, now we'll stop and read again tomorrow,\\" there will be a collective protest because they do not want to wait until tomorrow; every chapter they read must be followed immediately by the next. This incredibly well written novel is at times almost unbearably sad, though, and if sharing it with students or your own children, it is best to read it first so that you can ascertain if it is age-appropriate. When it is age-appropriate, is is one of the best novels to share with young people, a story that they will remember long after they have finished it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a world that is alternate from our world. He lives in a world where everythingis uniform, in a world where there is no color, no life choices, no wars, and no mental pain.Everyone is assigned a career that they will live with for the rest of their life beginning at agetwevle. In this alternate universe, a single \\"family\\" unit consists of an adoptive mother andfather and two siblings: one boy and one girl. Each family is expected to cooperate as a whole,and are expected to deal with the cope of maturing and leaving the family, and being\\"released\\" after becoming an elderly person. Jonas is a young boy of about eleven and a halfyears old who lives in this type of state and is about to reach the age of adulthood, and he willbe assigned to his role in the communtiy, while is sister, Tilly, will begin to mature in thecommunity as well, but in another way. His father, who is a caretaker of infants for the town,brings home an unusual baby named Gabriel that he decides should be nurtured under hiscare. If the baby doesn't give normal health readings, within one year, he will be releasedMeanwhile, Jonas attends the ceremony in which he finally becomes an adult and isassigned to his future life-long career. But when he expects to be called up next for his\\"Assignment\\", he is skipped over. Jonas then learns that he is to become the officialReceiver of memories of everything that happened before the world of the same things andno color, from none other than the previous Receiver, now known as The \\"Giver\\". Whenhe receives his instructions on what to do for his classes, he is told several things, but themost important thing that he is instructed to do is to lie. When he arrives, The Giver tellsJonas that he transfers his memories to Jonas, but loses the ones he transfers in the process.Jonas receives memories of wars, holidays such as Christmas, and begins to see colors,instead of black-and-white. Then, Jonas actualy sees the release of an infant, which isbasically similar to a lethal injection. When Jonas's father prepares to release Gabriel,Jonas seeks more memories about snow, water, and sunlight, along with other substancesthat are unknown to people who live in this controlled community. Jonas runs away withGabriel into the unknown until he comes across a town with colors, music, and other thingsthat do not exist in Jonas's world. The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an amazing Newberry Medalwinning novel for young adults that should be read due to its suspense, its spectacular fantasy, and for its great depiction of the characters in the novel.The Giver, by Lois Lowry, contains a great quanity of suspense. Throughout the novel, thereis enough suspense to cause the reader to read into it more and more with enthusiasm andwill not want to stop reading until they are finished with it completely. An example of this iswhen Jonas is running away with the infant named Gabriel. As he keeps riding along on thebycycle he stole from his father (this was the main mode of transportation for the community),when the search planes flew overhead. This is just one of the many types of suspense foundin The Giver that would certainly encourage anyone to read the novel.The Giver was also an excellent fantasy novel to read. Lois Lowry, the author who wrote thenovel, created an excellent alternate world in which everything that we on Earth areaccustomed to is alien to the people on Jonas's world. Everything is different, and choicesare made for the people themselves. In some ways, this is a go od thing, for there are no warsand there is little crime, but there are many consequences for living in this world as well.The alternate world created in this novel makes it even more appealing to read.The Giver, by Lois Lowry, does an excellent job of character and area description.Throughout the pages of the book, the description of the memories given from The Giverto Jonas is in such great detail that any person will have the ability to create an image ofof what is going on in the plot. Thus, the reader will have a better understanding of what isgoing on, causing them read more and more.The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent novel because of its superb traits, including itsmassive quanities of thrills and suspense, its awsome fantasy, and for its unique descriptionoverall. This novel is about a boy who lives in a world of dullness and in a place with nochoices until he meets The Giver. It is at this point that Jonas learns the true meaning oflife, love, pain, war, and happiness. I rate this novel a total of five stars out of five.A. Chappell"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is one of those books that you don't ever want to put down. The reader will get easily engrossed in the story, wanting to know what is going to happen next. This novel teaches people to be more appreciative of everything they have in their world. There are so many every day things that no one even pays attention to and take for granted. But after reading The Giver, your mind is opened up to how terrible life could be if the simplest things were taken away. For example our free will and our differences; without them we'd live in \\"Sameness\\" as the community in The Giver does. This book has been one of my favorites for the past 4 years, and every time I read it it's like I'm reading it for the first time again. It is a truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Can you imagine a place where the people that live there have no memories of the past, no emotions, no colors, and none of earth's wonders? The Giver by Lois Lowry takes place in this kind of a community. Jonas is an 11-year-old boy that is about to turn twelve. He is soon to receive a job assignment because at that age one is considered an adult. At the birthday ceremony Jonas is chosen to be the only holder of memories in the community. Once Jonas receives a few, he realizes that his community isn't doing anything regularly. What will Jonas do to help his community see the error of its ways?The Giver is a truly unique book because it tells about a different kind of lifestyle in a strange community. The author has characters who mention and follow rules such as the ones that say only one group of people can chose the job assignments for young adults, and that is quite different from our government, so that makes it interesting. You should read this book because it is very realistic and it has true emotions attached to the characters. When Jonas sees the way his community is living, his emotions of sadness, anger, and regret are extremely vivid. This book might appeal to you because it is an intriguing story that tells about a turning point in a young man's life. In the story Jonas is turning twelve and experiencing \\"stirrings.\\" Also he becomes an adult in this book, and he has an extra responsibility.

I would recommend it to anyone 11 or above because there are some things in it that may be a little too emotionally taxing for younger readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent work of literature. It presents a stunning example of a futuristic, dystopian society where all facets of life are controlled by various rules and regulations in an easily readable format. Jonas, the novel's protagonist, is chosen by the council to become the successor to the Giver, a man whose job is to mentally store the collective memories of society. The book focuses on situations such as a society without individuality, the importance of choice, and how people react to finding out that the accepted truths of their world were at one point not the case. Ms. Lowry uses chilling imagery, such as the lack of color, the inability of most people to love, and the unemotional \\"release\\" of those who don't fit into the government's carefully laid out plans for a perfect society to establish a mood that, while somewhat bleak, is not entirely without hope. The story picks up as it progresses, shifting to a more tense, but still equally atmospheric, form. This tension is skillfully maintained until the story's conclusion. I would heartily recommend this story to all those who enjoy fictional works that focus on either individualism vs. society or potential visions of the future.- Benton Wilson (a member of the Mythology and Folklore VHS class)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought the book was very interesting.

There were concrete attributes which he could not abide after he had not take drugs (pills against pain) like everybody else there.We liked the story \`The Giver' by Lois Lowry.To tell the truth we have to confess that on some parts of the story, the content was a bit boring. But all in all the entire book was imaginative. The mixture of science fiction and fantasy was new to us. With all that fantasy you could reconstruct it. You could imagine that the society today could develop to the society in the book. The book is maybe a alert the people in our world. The people want to have everything perfect today and you can see what might happen if everything seems to be perfect. The main character Jonas was the only one who saw the problem of the community in which he lived, and wanted to have a world in which nothing is perfect but a society with feelings like love.

Jonas is chosen to get a job as the 'Receiver', who keeps all the memoriesof the past and those, which are withhold from the people of the community. When Jonas begins to receive the memories from the \`Giver' he sees that this \`perfect' world has its seamy side. People aren't allowed to have any feelings, any individualism, own thinking and fun.

So I liked the topic, but I didn't like how the author wrote it, because there are too many questions, that were not answered.

His friends don't understand why he acts out against them when playing a game of war. They're curious about what is happening to him and his odd behavior. When it is just too much for the Giver and him to take, they devise a plan. Will Jonas make it out of the sameness community? Or will they track him down and have him punished?The Giver is probably a science fiction combination futuristic novel. This book has a very good sense of creativity and suspense. The only weakness is the ending. It does not imply much about what is to happen next. Lois Lowry's writing style is phenomenal because of the excellent detailing work and all around eagerness. I would recommend this novel to ages 12+ only because of the vocabulary and understanding of it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a book that is colorfully written by Lois Lowry. This is a science fiction book that has a lot of ambition of what a perfect community would be like. I think that this one of the best books that I have read in a long time.This science fiction book is focus around the main character (Jonas). Jonas a t Age 12 gets the privilege of the receiver of Memory. His teacher is an elderly man by the name of The Giver. The Giver is the Receiver of Memory before him. During his training he is given the memories of the past world. He alone knows what is to feel pain, fear, hunger, and many other emotions. When he se's his father do some thing of complete horror to him he decides that he can't stay in the community much longer. So he runs away with the help of The Giver.This book is one book that you could read over and over again. It is even easy enough for a 10 year old to read. But in the end this is a good book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Life-long care. A highly structured, advanced society where everyone has a role and no one has a need to rebel. That is the environs into which Jonas is born. Every year of his life, in the life of any inhabitant of this unnamed city, there is an assigned role with accompanying tasks, an obligatory training to prepare for the twelfth year in which a person receives her or his life's profession.In such an idyllic location it is interesting to note that those who are assigned to give birth are looked down upon; after two years of giving life to babes who will be subsequently assigned to parents who are allowed only one boy and one girl, the woman is assigned to various other chores. She is a lifegiving machine who maintains the population of the community but her ensuing role is that of some type of common laborer. No rewards for this profession!There are those who do the cooking and deliver meals to all of the inhabitants, those who clean up after the food has been ingested and trays left outside the home, those who are teachers, those who are nurturers, those who are caregivers to the elderly and those who are assigned legal tasks. The penalty for non-compliance, or non-conformity, is \\"release\\". By itself the word is innocuous enough. What it actually means, is hazy. Finally, at some point in time the elderly must be released and the decision is made for them.Big Brother is always watching and reminders are issued via an intercom. Faults and mis-steps seem to be gently dealt with but \\"release\\" is the ultimate verdict once a certain amount of opportunities for correction have elapsed. Dreams are processed each day as are feelings of anger, hostility, frustration. Reasons for behaviour are evaluated and the reason appears to be that if feelings can be processed a homeostasis will always return. Lying is strictly forbidden...until....When the twelfth year finally arrives, a bizarre occurrence takes place. Jonas and all his contemporaries who are about to turn 12, are called to an auditorium at which time they revert to the numbers they were originally assigned, prior to the \\"name giving\\" that occurred when they were officially presented to their selected parents. Jonas is not called to the stage when his number is called. He is shocked as are all the members of the town who are present for this important occasion.The reason for the slight becomes apparent when Jonas receives the highest honor possible, he will become \\"The Receiver\\". His studies with the present Receiver reveal a far-from-perfect society and it is each subsequent Receiver who must be the recipient of the painful memories of the past. This takes its toll on each honoree as s/he literally bears the weight of the world in order to alleviate the town's folk from having to do so.Jonas gradually rebels and takes dramatic steps to escape what is not at all idyllic. Let the reader discover this moral tale. The novel is well done and can easily appeal to adults and adolescents alike. The fortunate adolescents will have adults with whom to review this book as it has many painful, ethical, moral issues to be discussed!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The main character in this book is a 12-year-old boy named Jonas. He lives in a community that knows no feelings, color, illness, poverty...in other words, they all live in a perfect community! In this community, everything is chosen for everyone. The indivuals cannot even choose their own destination! Jonas' destination of Receiver of Memories is chosen for him on his 12th birthday. There is only one Receiver of Memory in the community. His job as Receiver of Memory is to retain memories. You'll understand what is meant by that once you have read the book. This is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I just finished reading The Giver. It is definitely an interesting book. I agree with some of the previous comments mentioned before on the subject of weither or not this story should be told to younger children. It is in strong detail that may be somewhat traumatizing to younger readers, if they understand it at all. However, definitely this book is for an age group of 12 and up. Under that is questionable. To give you a basic idea about the book without ruining anything: The name of the main character is Jonas. And he lives in somewhat of a futuristic setting. Everything in his life is perfect and colorless. Yes, literally. His day consists of waking up, getting ready for school, eating breakfast with his &quot;family unit&quot; and going to school. Upon his arrival back home, he does his homework and then eats dinner with his family and shares and dreams that they had the night before. Rules are many, and there is no emotion and basically empty. However, no one knows of better life. When you turn 12 you are assigned a job and start your training. Jonas is chosen to be The Giver... He then receives a new set of rules and his life is changed forever. For better or worse? This story is very dramatic and will capture your attention immediately. Definitely a classic!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book. It started off a bit slow at first but after awhile the pace started to pick up. It was usetting and sad though to see how terrible and boring it would be to live in a world without choices, differences, and love. I didn't completely understand the ending but if I was in Jonas's place I would have done the same thing that he did in the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really admire Lois Lowry's writing style in this novel. She does an excellent job giving the reader a full and detailed picture of Jonas' life in the community, and the restrictions that they placed on the citizens. This is an example of the ultimate controlled environment in which no infraction or unpredictable element is tolerated. This book has a lot of potential, but I think it falls far short in the plot. Much of the story seemed to be collections of situations in the life of Jonas, and only at the end did he actually execute a plan to give the memories back to the people. Even this was not thoroughly explored. I enjoyed reading this book, but I think it could have been a lot longer and more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book, the Giver, is an amazing book. It's a story of a child brought up in a world that's completely regulated and controlled by the rulers. They control climate, color, looks, birth, jobs, choices and even feelings. They don't allow memory of the past or new ideas for the future. Everyone is considered equal. Now, Jonas sees his community safe enough until he recieves the respectful job of the giver. In his learnings he begins to understand that if anything did happen to his commuity no one would be able to help themselves because they don't know anything about the past or feel actual pain or suffering. It is up to Jonas to save his community and himself from whatever comes their way. I rated this book 5 stars because it's extremely original and creative. The details about life with no feeling or memory are vivid. I recommend this book to people for all ages because it makes you think of how lucky you are to live in a world with freedoms."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought that the book &quot;the Giver&quot; was well written and although the store line was very loose. Lois Lowery wrote some good dialog between characters, but I thought that the word choice could have been better. The storie was unorignal and it conterdicts it self alot. I had to read the book for summer school so we watched movies from the 70's that were almost the exact same thing as the Giver only 20 years earlier."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a very good book. I read it and I didn't think it wouldhave been this good. I recommend this book for young adults andabove. I really enjoyed reading this book and so will you! This is the story of a boy who is chosen to be The Receiver of Memory. There is way too much to summarize in this little review. Anyways, go and buy this book! You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The way Lois Lowry wrote this book is great. It is pretty confusing at first, but it clears up. It is weard how they think of our world and we think of theirs. This book should be a must for readers."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book for all ages. It is very interesting and makes you read straight through to the end. The story is about a twelve year old boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a futuristic society that is &quot;perfect.&quot; The community is controlled by sameness and everyone is exactly alike. The people have no recellection of their past and have no feelings. They have never experienced love or hate. Though it may sound ideal, as you read, Jonas discovers through his highly respected and important job that perhaps things could be better. In his job he must keep the memories of the past so that the rest of the community does not have to experience them. Despite his memories of death, war, hunger, and such, he begins to realize that the good memories overpower the bad ones. In his desperation from loneliness and frustration Jonas makes a drastic decision, that will change the lives of the community forever. I really enjoyed this book, as I have read it more than once. The only downside that I found to it was the ending. I have never liked endings that leave you hanging, as this one does, and I wish that there was a sequal. But, in general, I recommend this book to people of all ages. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a pretty good book. Our class of 7SR just finished it. i think Lois Lowry should write a sequel, because the ending is like so NOT clear to me and probably isn't for a lot of other people who read this book. Did anybody else in the world, besides my class, find like 1,000 sameness's for this book and &quot;I Am David&quot; by Anne Holm? well our class (of 7SR) would like to know if Lois Lowry borrowed any i deas from that book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Our grade 6 class had to read the giver. I liked it, but the end didn't make sence. Jonas lives in a world that is perfect. They can't see colors, and they get assigned a job when they are 12. Each family has a mother, a father, a girl and a boy. This book was ok, but I would reccomend this book to 12 year olds and up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver was an excellently writen book. The content is more adult natured but it is a good class room read. it opens the minds of younger children to the horrors of life that is all around them. to the things that they have become acostomed and desensitised to. maybe if everyone read the giver and was taught how horrible and yet natural a thing death is than things like colombine high school shootings would never take place. a good read, i belevie this book could change some people in some way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I found The Giver to be a shockingly realistic portrayal of what a conformist future may be like. Everything and everyone is the same, and variation is rare if it exists at all. It is here we find Jonas, a 11 year old boy about to turn 12.When a person comes of age at 12, they are assigned a job to do for the rest of their life. Because of this, I thought that the book may have had communist undertones. More in the sense of a Utopian communism than a communism in reality. Everyone is the same, and has the same things. The world is ideal. There is no pain, suffering, war, or grief.I feel that The Giver flawlessly depicts the struggle of an individual in a society that is unwilling to change. Jonas is forced to deal with how he feels, and the knowledge he is different from everyone else. I found the plainess of the other characters to be an excellent foil for Jonas's differences.The book leads to a stunning conclusion I found to be a perfect ending to the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In Lowry's book you are transported to a place devoid of emotion; a place where there are no past mistakes to look back and learn from. That is unless you are \\"The Reciever of Memory.\\" In the socieyt where our main character, Jonas, lives there is only one person who carries all of the memories for the entire society. This method is used to shelter the society from uneccessary problems such as bad weather, love, and pain. The idea works except one person must hold the burden for everyone.In her book Lowry's provides detailed descriptions of such complicated emotions as anger, grief, and true happiness so that you can experience them yourself. The book is not purely for entertainment value, it definitely will evoke some serious thinking. By the end of this novel it is guaranteed you will feel everything Jonas has been through."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"a unique and amazing read! designed to keep you reading and thinking. lowery's definitive vision of this world causes the mind to twist and turn while telling an emotional story about a world that lives by rules and rules alone. a heartwarming cast of individual characters that you are bound to send youre heart out to!CT - SMHS"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"The Giver\\", this is a very well written book. I like it because it makes you think about your own society. It made me think about many things, that's why it is a good book. There were many details about everything that happened. The people of that community were so immersed in there society that they didn't know what they were missing, a lot of the things we as a society take for granite. For example the color they didn't see that. Then again that's what we as a society are trying to do overlook people's differences so that everyone is treated equal, but we try and take into consideration people's differences. In conclusion this book has great feeling that most of the characters of this great book did not have.Good job, Mr. Lowry"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book. It allows a person to stretch their imagination, and step into a futuristic world. This is a great book for everyone to read! I read this book when I was 13, and I just read it again at the age of 18, and I enjoyed as much the second time as I did the first!Reading this book will make you feel fortunate to live in a free, liberal, open society.

Later it became more and more interesting. It was interesting to see in which way people can be controlled. I would like to know how the story really ends, because there is an open end.If you are interested in Science Fiction, then you should read this novel!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think The Giver is a very interesting novel. It shows what advantages and disadvantages such a Community Of Sameness has. Initially you wouldn't think that it is very interesting to read because the whole community is explained and the new words for this novel are menaged, but it gets more and more exciting if you read further. You will feel with Jonas, when he realized how boring the community he lives in is and when he leaves the community. The book has an open ending so it isn't clear what happens at the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Reading the book was quite interesting because the reader experiences a world completely different compared to our world. It\`s a world without love, feelings, feelings of pain and war, climate, without making own decisions and that\`s why this book is so interesting!

The story causes you to think about the meaning of human emotions, life, and society.To add to the mesmerizing atmosphere, the situations, plot, and characters are very well developed and attract your attention.The situations are carefully planned and the plot is descriptive, imaginative, and vivid. The characters are unique and have distinct personalities that different people can relate to.It's a exceptionally challenging read, in terms of the way it is written and the vocabulary that is used. At times, it can be difficult to understand the message unless you truly search and think about it.Once you set your eyes on this story, you won't be able to stop reading. The end will definitely leave you wanting more!~KS~"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I agree with this review because Dev Patel (the reviewer) says The Giver is a good book to read for adults and young adults. She says the book makes you think and it points out the problems in a utopian society. The government is always watching and the people are at one constant emotional level. The book helps people understand what is to live in a &iexcl;perfect&iexcl; society, and why we don&iexcl;t. In the community the people feel no pain or emotion, and when they do they have to take pills to stop them. The Giver is a book for people who enjoy reading books that give you a new perspective. I give the book afour out of five."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First of all, I am sorry about my poor English and writing skills.Jonas who will become 12 years old is in a community. In there, everything is under control and everything is decided by rule. However, nobody has doubt on the rule. Every person is accepted a rule in community. For example, people cannot choose their spouse by themselves. Every family units have 4 member, such as father, mother, son, and daughter. There is a not cleavage in community between rich and poor.When children become 12 years old, every child will receive assignment (occupation) from the elders. So, every child must follow the assignment. While Jonas received special assignment,and became the Receiver who receices memories from Giver. Jonas received a lot of memories which relates with happiness and also sadnessd from Giver. However, the Giver and the Receiver are prohibit to tell something about their duties to the other people. Jonas (Receiver) who is a only 12 years old boy realized that how is the community abnormal. Only giver and Receiver are understanding each other with pain. The doleful Giver and Receiver's decision are more doleful. And, finally, there is a just doleful ending.This is a good book, recomend to read this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First, when I read this book, I thought it is very hard even if it is for 6, 8, 10 grade students. Actually I don't know when it is written. But I am sure it criticizes the communism. Who knew communism's last as USSR or eastern European countries. But the auther understood the societies of communism. Their closed society and equal lives, but generation and generation, they can not know the origin community. Why should they work? communism's dream is very ideally. But it prevents diversity and creation of the people. Although human is social animals, communism ignores human's big principal. I don't like such a book because its background and result are very gloomy. But it express the communism very well. It should be ok that you read once or twice."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the interesting novels that I have read. I recommend this book not only 12 years old boys but adults also. This story brings thinking about life and society. The author gives ideas about sameness and difference of society. In Jona&iexcl;s society, every person has same experience and doesn&iexcl;t have to worry about basic needs. Also, the society doesn&iexcl;t have a social gab. It is like a utopian society; however, The Committee of Elder decides person&iexcl;s entire life. At age of 12, every person is received an assignment by the Committee. Jona, a main character, receives an assignment of the Receiver of Memory. He receives memories of everything, that prohibit other people in Jona&iexcl;s society, from The Giver. Jona recognizes secrets of the society, and his adventure starts."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"At the first time I read this book, I was very confused because their society is very different from reality and my stereotype. They have special rules own such as assignment. When they are 12 years old, they will be able to assignment each other, and Jonas received the Receiver. When he got the instruction of assignment, it can break the whole thing from community rule, even though he can lie. When Jonas trained by the Giver, he was surprised because of new experiences; for instance, colors, sunshine, pain,Anyway, I would like to say it is really wrong idea the rule of Jonas&iexcl;s community. There is not any release like my society, and somebody can kill other people because they couldn&iexcl;t do anything in the society. And they are learning something when they are young and they do that job until they are old. Then if they couldn&iexcl;t do that job anymore, they removed. I think the community is necessary to working the society. However, this is really wrong idea. So, I don&iexcl;t agree the plot of the story about society rules; however the book is so fantastic for me, and wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas community is different from our common society. They stress the conformity and sameness. They will receive the assignment at 12 age, and they should follow the assignment which was arranged each other. They don't know common thing like color, snow, pain, war and so on, because the community is very specially. Jonas would be able to receive the Receiver from the ceremony at 12 age, and he trained by the Giver. At the end of the story, Jonas leaves to the community with his brother who has same color eyes with Jonas. I hate the rule in the story because it interfere their freedom and choice for the future. In addition, they don't care death; moreover, they think the death is the real release So, I opposite to the side of the story. However, it might be right the community is perfect society. There are not any difference between people like poverty and rich, idiot and genius. If they don't know another society, they will be live very perfectly. I impress the part of training about Christmas. Jonas considered the family and love at there. It is one of the emotions, but in the community, their family is not real, and it is also already decided by community. They have a birth mother separately. The book is very differently other fiction, and I think about the common our society again, and I can remind the material who settled in the present because of the story."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this magnificent piece of art in grade 8 and its just such a beautiful and splendid book.

There are some propositions in the book for to show perfect world. Firstly, everything is under control such as, there is no war or fear or pain even if, no feeling. Secondly, every person is assigned a role in the community when the person turns twelve. Jonas who is the protagonist in the book is assigned a role which is the giver. The giver is the only person who can feel the fear, pain, and so on. There are some reasons why I like this book. For example, the author&iexcl;s imagination that there is no feeling in the perfect is very interesting and funny. Moreover, the author describes the perfect world very specific with detail.

They take a pill to make them act like robots. The community gives them a job and a spouse and a family. They get their jobs at the 12th year. There is peace, but they don't have almost any feelings! Jonas is choosed to be the Receiver. He will have all the memories of The Giver. He will have all the memories of the old times (colors, love, pain, loneliness, hapiness...), so he can be the wiseman of the community, he will make the best decisions for the peace of the community.

People always tokd me it was good, but for some reason I never actaully read it until this year. I'm glad I did read it because it's fascinating. It was written for young adult readers (my sister read it in her 8th grade class), but I suggest it for people of all ages because it is entertaining and thought provoking. The book is set in a community where everyone goes through the same routines, and feels no emotions. The main character is a young, teenage boy. The boy is chosen to be the next Giver (you'll have to read the book to find out what that means) which is when the reader becomes more aware of the restrictive communtity that the boy lives in. The book has a fast paced plot, but is not a thriller. It isn't a mystery either, but the reader is given information bit by bit until they realize the dull, restrictive the boy used to lead. I think the book has an underlying commentary about the importance of history in a societym and the dangers of extreme comformity. It's an interesting, quick read for adults, and fast paced and entertaining enough for younger children. I think anyone who hasn't read this yet should definitely give it a try."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry is one of those unique authors who has won the John Newbery Medal for children's literature twice. Once for the first book in this trilogy and once for a book about the Holocaust called Number the Stars. (Just as an aside only one other author has ever done that Madeleine L'Engle who I would also recommend highly.) I would begin by recommending any of her books; they are all worth the time and the effort. This trilogy is set in a post apocalyptic world.

Lowry seems to be trying to show, in an extremely artistic way, that in order for an emotion to truly exist, there must be a balancing antithesis. For there to be love, there must be war. To truly experience beauty, you must also know repulsion. Jonas realizes that his family and friends have never truly felt pain or saddness or anger, and that makes him feel extremely alone. This &quot;painfree life&quot; is really nothing but a long gray death.'The Giver' is a challenge to you and to me, to the whole world, to never forget the memories. They are our responsibility to bear, and to share.I am 16 years old, an avid reader. I have forgotten more plots than I remember. I pray I will never forget this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect&quot; world where war, disease, and suffering have all been eradicated. Everything is in order; everything is under control. The people have no worries or cares. The Community strives for &quot;sameness,&quot; in which everyone and everything are the same and equal. To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society. When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new &quot;Receiver of Memories.&quot; Only the &quot;Giver&quot; knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas.The Giver is a wonderful book. Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story. She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this &quot;perfect world.&quot; The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia. To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people. In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse. Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life. For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings. The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love. One of the goals of the Community is to achieve &quot;sameness&quot; so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different. However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image. Finally, to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past, the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world (also known as &quot;Elsewhere) and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society: the &quot;Receiver.&quot; Therefore, the Community lives only in the present, and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life. They are naive; they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories. While receiving the memories, Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing. He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community.Although it is a Newbery Award Winner, The Giver is a controversial book that has been challenged and even banned. After parents complained that the violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children, the Bonita Unified School District in California temporarily banned the novel from classes. The Giver has been challenged in other school districts around the country for its &quot;mature themes&quot; of euthanasia, infanticide, and suicide. I do not agree with banning and challenging of this novel. It is a great book, and part of what makes it so great is the incorporation of these controversial issues. They force readers to wrestle with their own thoughts and figure out their stance on the issues. Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time. I love this book, and I encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very suspensful book. It is a great book forall ages. I would reccommend The Giver to be put on a requiredreading list. It will intrigue you from the very first page to thevery last. The author did a great job keeping the reader interested throughout the whole book. The Giver is about a boy named Joanes. He lives in an ideal world. There is no pain, no worries, and no memories. Each person is assigned a certain role and that role is carefully chosen and well thoughtout . Each member in the community has to work in that job until they enter the house of the dead. When Joanes is twelve years old he is assigned the most important role in the community. This role requires power, strength, and courage. This job also requires pain, and emotional feelings Joanes may not be ready for. When Joanes receives his training the world in his eyes is now seen in a different perspective. His world is no longer a perfect world. Joanes now realizes all the things and choices he is misssing out on. This explores human's desire to live life to the fullest whether there are good things like pleasure and happiness or bad memories like war, hate and death. Joanes realizes he is no longer happy and decides to do something very drastic. This decision could deeply impact the society Joanes lives in. After reading this book it made me think in an entirely different way. I realized that even though I do not get to do whatever I want, I still have the freedom to make choices, and ultimately I can choose my own path. It helped me appreciate my world for what it is, and realize that in order to feel true happiness, sometimes it is necessary, as happened with Joanes, to feel pain, sadness, worry, and uncertainty. This book is the first book I have read that touched me to this extent. I hope many other people read this and get to experience what I have experienced."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Set in a world completely different from ours, The Giver is an exceptional novel about everyday life in a community with no feelings, color, war, or pain. Everyone has a role, specially designed to help the society function precisely. The same activities are carried out from day to day. Everything seems perfect. Then all that changes for Jonas when he turns twelve and is selected to receive all the memories that the society has never known, memories that will change his life forever. As a result of brilliant craftsmanship and talent, the author used the strong elements of the story's setting, writing style, and a carefully planned out plot to attract any reader.The world that Jonas lives is unlike any place on our Earth. Everything is under control and perfectly planned out. Nothing surprising or unexpected happens in the community. Feelings have been eliminated, since they can lead to problems and would upset the perfect balance of their world. This futuristic place is interesting to read about because it is so unlike the places that truly exist. The author created a completely unique and fascinating world and amazingly brought it to life. From characters to daily activities, I was very interested in the entire setting.In addition to her imaginative ability, Lois Lowry is an especially gifted author and has a very appealing writing style. The book uses wonderful descriptions, which definitely draw the reader in. Her rare imagination sets this book apart from all others. She writes at a slow pace, not rushing anything, expanding on details to let everything soak into the reader's mind. The story unravels slowly, but proves to be very thoughtful, not boring in the least. She truly succeeded at producing an insightful masterpiece based on a world we know nothing about.All the events in this story were woven together to create a very unpredictable plot. Since the world the characters live in is so different from ours, its impossible to foretell what will happen next, so the story definitely held my attention from beginning to end. First the story opens by telling of everyday life in the community, but changes drastically when Jonas turns twelve. Once he starts to receive memories from the Giver, he goes through happiness, pain, fear, and emotions he has never felt before. The worst part is that he is not able to share them with anyone. He must endure all of the pain in a world where no one but the Giver understands or has felt what he feels. Jonas knows he has to make them understand and that there is no way he can stay in this world. However, Jonas does not have the liberty to tell them and the only way to accomplish his desire is to break the rules. It is a risky endeavor, but he will do whatever it takes to escape from this world of no feelings, in a place where no one will understand unless they experience the memories for themselves. Not only does he want to escape, but has to in order to make his world right; the way things used to be.With great imaginative ability, the unique setting, writing style, and thoughtful plot of this remarkable book clearly show the fine talents of the author. The John Newberry Medal, along with the many other awards The Giver has received, proves that Lois Lowry has indeed created a literary masterpiece. I strongly recommend this book to readers of all ages. It will not only prove to be enjoyable, but also give you a new perspective on the world that you live in.

This is a very good book for young people who are ready to start wrestling with stories that pose ethical dilemas. This is not a fairy tale, though, thank Ja, it is fiction. We got a copy when our eldest daughter was graduating into chapter books. Since then, each of our children has chosen to read this book on their own. And, even better, talked with us about the issues it presents to them - issues of free will, responsibility, self sacrifice, choice, determinism. It allowed us to discuss difficult, sometimes painful choices while holding them at arm's length as you can with fiction. Still, it is a somewhat dark, disturbing tale. Not in the almost prurient RL Stine (Stein?) Fear Street way. More the way a brooding storm slowly, inexonerably moves up on you. Younger readers may find it too dark.

There, the Giver awakens Jonas to the possibility that everything does not have to be the same. Colors, music, emotions, and pain do in fact exist and are very real. I liked this book, simply because it was a quick read (Only about 180 pages)and presented the theme that sameness is not ideal. There is no such thing as the perfect society. You cannot feel satisfied as a human being by living without love or pain or anger or truth. The Giver was an excellent novel about trust, awakening, and love. This book reminded me quite a bit of Aldus Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\" much in the way that everything in Jonas's community is regulated and controlled with a fear of difference.

The book describes very well and very creatively what would happen if we descnsitized every body in the world and basically turneds them into drones.

It was set in a time of peace and health ware the society that a boy named Jonas lived in was perfect. Jonas who was a who was a young boy was given at the age of 12 just like every other child at 12 an ability to get him by in his life kind of like a job. Jonas was given the gift of memories and he was able to feel unlike any other child in his society. The fact that the society was perfect in the book was probably the most interesting to me. That is not of the norm that it grabbed me right away it took me in to the book and made me imagine a society totally and completely different form are own it kind of in a way made me wish that that was how are world worked also because it was so well written. When Jonas was given the gift to use memories and was able to feel like all of the humans in are world feel every day it was kind of like some sort of culture shock to me that every on but him could not dream or feel. It was vary sci fi also and I enjoy books that have to do with the abnormal the interest me the most. It was kind of like reading what another alien type society might be like on another planet. I felt that this book was vary well written any book that can catch a persons attention who normally dose not read that much like it caught mine disserves a great book review. I felt that it was vary exciting from the begging to the end and I never stopped paying good attention to the reading. I enjoyed it a lot and I realized that this book was not like any other of Lowis Lowry&#65533;s books and was written a lot different it kind of unique in a way I enjoyed it a lot and I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a fascinating book and something which all children/young adults should read. The story is one which warns against blind conformity and group thought. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Although few pages, it touches down on so many aspects of life that are taken for granted, while creating a world that can be politically & religiously deciphered as well. It is a book that I vaguely remember reading when I was younger, yet now, reading it at the age of 23 I have such a deeper appreciation of the complexity that is this piece.In response to the critics before me, I believe the ending to be exactly what it should be... simple and somewhat open-ended. Unlike so many books.... the emphasis is what we should all have more appreciation for... the journey."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book is very interesting.

Very good book, and infomativ"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a very intelligent and yet easy-to-understand read. It vaguely reminds me of Orwell's 1984, since they are both about a terrifying future with extreme government control. They veer away from each other, however, in that The Giver is hopeful and even in some ways joyful about the human condition, while Orwell is anything but. In my opinion, The Giver tries to illustrate humankind's greatest strengths (love, forgiveness, compassion, empathy, courage, strength, the list goes on) as well as its faults, which makes it unique. When I first read it, I was about 10, and I took its ending at face value. Now that I am quite a bit older, I am inclined to (forgive the pun) read more deeply into its meaning, whether or not that was what the author intended, and have come to my own conclusions. I am sure you will find your own as well. Overall, I highly recommend this as an excellent, thought-inspiring book especially for preteens who may not quite be ready for Orwell (Blair, of course) or Czeslaw Milosz, but meaningful for all."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel shows the dramatic events that take place when a young boy is forced to accept what he does not beleive in. The boy then with the help of his mentor escapes the world in which he had lived for all his life to a life he has never experienced before. The novel grasps the imagination of the reader through the detailed imagery of the \\"ideal\\" society portrayed in the novel. The relationship between the characters especially the boy, Jonas and the Giver also make the story captivating and interesting.The author Lowry does an amazing job in describing the community in which Jonas lives. It is important for the reader to Understand the type of society in which Jonas lives because it is completely different from the normal society of today. The description of the society helps to explain Jonas' disagreement with the society and hence his decision to escape.The author does a good job in showing the relationships between the characters. The author shows a weaker relationship between Jonas and his family members because of the way the society is maintained while there is a strong bond between Jonas and his mentor. The relationships between the characters help the reader to understand how the society works even better. The relationship between the characters thickens the plot of the story especially when the giver reveals the secrets of the society to Jonas and the way Jonas reacts towards the new found truth."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Who would have thought that a totalitarian society-based novel could be written for kids? It is written in such a way that everything seems so real and feasible, even if it is set many years in the future. This allows a lot of the complex concepts presented in the book to be grasped and understood by children. The story is so riveting. There are so many twists, turns, and surprises that keep a reader turning the pages. It really does pull a child's mind \\"out of the box\\" to look at a life through a different set of eyes. There are so many things to talk about! It allows children an opportunity to compare this fictional society with their own and make evaluations as to what works and what doesn't in both. Also, it is a great way to introduce symbolism to a class. It also provides a great way to motivate students to explore social change and to not be afraid to criticize rules and values of their own society. Recommended for use with grades 5-9, but many teens and adults should enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is awesome! I really loved reading it and discussing it in class. The themes were interesting and I could really relate to the main character, Jonas. It held your attention and you just wanted to keep reading!Every kid should read it at some point-whenever the're ready.The only negative about the book is that the end just leaves you hanging. I don't know about you, but I hate ambiguous endings! I'd rather read what happens to them than wonder for another week or two what happened.

No one in this place has feelings or memories of the past, but after Jonas becomes the new Receiver of Memories, everything changes for him. He receives feelings and memories that makes him realize the sad state his community is in. Therefore he makes a plan to escape...The Giver is a story about a fictional society in the future. The reader can realize how important feelings and emotions are for our lives, especially if compared to the unemotional lives of the members of the community. At the beginning the book is not very exciting until Jonas becomes twelve and is assigned his job. From this moment the pace of the plot increases and the story gets more interesting.Besides you will understand how important it is to make your own choices and to be allowed to have real feelings. Sometimes the book is even a bit shocking, because a few events are very extreme.In our opinion there are two important messages:1 You should better make your own decisions and you shouldn't believe and trust everything that you are told.2 Problems are necessary in our life. If you never had any difficulties like hunger and suffering, you can't enjoy the very good things and feelingsRead this book! But we can only recommend the book to people who are prepared to think about it intensively and to deal with the topic or to those who are interested in futuristic stories.

Every family has one girl and one boy. Also everyone's birthday is in December. They have one big ceremony in December, and you get a specific gift or job depending on what age you were. The weather in the community is always sunny and never changes. On Jonas's 12th birthday he was assigned the job as Receiver of Memory. He has to go to the Giver, who was the old Receiver of Memory, and learn about the past and remember other memories. It is a very important job, and Jonas was glad to do it. One day Jonas's father, who works as a Nurturer, brought home a child named Gaberial who was having difficulty sleeping through the night. Jonas's family tried very hard to get him to sleep through the night, but he could never do it unless Jonas passed memories to him. One day at dinner, Jonas's father told the family that Gabe was going to be released. Jonas knew that it meant he would die. He didn't want that to happen to Gabe so he decides to take him and leave the community. They leave at night time. They encounter many different things on the outside they called Elsewhere. Some things are good and others are bad, like loneliness, hunger, and changes in the weather. In the end Jonas and Gabe didn't realize what would happen to them, but at least they were together.

The last couple of chapters did not seem like the charactor would do something like that at all. Then the last page did not make any sense to me. The end was a little dissapointing but it is diffinitly worth reading!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas lives in a Community. In this odd world, there is no pain, because as soon as someone is hurt, they are given pills that make the pain disappear. There is no fear, because there is nothing to fear. There is also nothing to choose. Everything anyone does is chosen for them. In this Community, there is no love, simply 'family units.' Two people who work together well are married, and can apply for children. Children are then assigned to them if they qualify. Jonas is now twelve years old, and nearing his \\"Assignment,\\" which is actually his career for the rest of his life. However, Jonas' Assignment is different from the others' Assignments in his class. Through his special Assignment, he begins to discover why his Community is the way it is, and the vast world that is being kept from him and the rest of the citizens of the Community.I've always been a fan of Lois Lowry's works, and this book is no exception. The Giver portrays a chilling 'what if' story of how it would be in a 'perfect' society. There is no pain in this Community, only the shallowest of feelings, and an oblivious populace. The whole Community is intriguing and a little on the scary side. Jonas embarks on his journey with determination and is a likeable character from the start. He has the willpower to discover the secrets of the Community, and the courage to do something about it. The ending is a little too ambiguous for my liking, but all-in-all this is a fantastic book everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The narrator did a great job on this book. It was read very well and i was surprised at how good it was. I liked it a lot. The book \\"The Giver\\" is written for adults and children. It starts off very suave and almost irritating but then the plot thickens. Lois Lowry is an extremely educated writer and he knows his vocab, that's for sure. This book deserves more than it got. It had a smaller following than i would have thought.If you were interested in Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings than you shouldn't expect the same thrills as those books. This book is a fantasy but not like those at all. It involves a community where nothing goes wrong and everything is so perfect. The way the children talk to eachother is the most interesting thing."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Science fiction is the mythology of the present, giving us intuitions about current conditions in an age of continual change. Lowry's book as not about the future, but about society today.In Lowry's society, suffering is illegal and must be eliminated -- if it can't be, the response is euthanasia. Jonas hurts his finger - an ambulance is called, and he must be given an anesthetic that totally relieves the pain. A jet pilot mistakenly overflies Jonas' small, self-contained community; the pilot is liable to undergo an intolerable level of embarrassment, and must therefore be \\"separated\\" from his community -- a euphemism for euthanasia. Children who aren't judged to have sufficiently bonded with family units, and elders who reach an age which is judged to have \\"life unworthy of life\\", are euthanized.Our response to people who are undergoing suffering which makes us uncomfortable, is not to become truly \\"compassionate\\" (suffering-with), but, really driven by a sense of our own intolerable discomfort, our response is to eliminate suffering at its root, by eliminating the sufferer. Pope John-Paul II speaks of the fact that in \\"...a social and cultural context which makes it more difficult to face and accept suffering, the temptation becomes all the greater to resolve the problem of suffering by eliminating it at the root, by hastening death so that it occurs at the moment considered most suitable.\\"Various considerations usually contribute to such a decision, all of which converge in the same terrible outcome. In the sick person the sense of anguish, of severe discomfort, and even of desperation brought on by intense and prolonged suffering can be a decisive factor. Such a situation can threaten the already fragile equilibrium of an individual's personal and family life, with the result that, on the one hand, the sick person, despite the help of increasingly effective medical and social assistance, risks feeling overwhelmed by his or her own frailty; and on the other hand, those close to the sick person can be moved by an understandable even if misplaced compassion. All this is aggravated by a cultural climate which fails to perceive any meaning or value in suffering, but rather considers suffering the epitome of evil, to be eliminated at all costs. This is especially the case in the absence of a religious outlook which could help to provide a positive understanding of the mystery of suffering.\\"On a more general level, there exists in contemporary culture a certain Promethean attitude which leads people to think that they can control life and death by taking the decisions about them into their own hands. What really happens in this case is that the individual is overcome and crushed by a death deprived of any prospect of meaning or hope. We see a tragic expression of all this in the spread of euthanasia -- disguised and surreptitious, or practised openly and even legally. As well as for reasons of a misguided pity at the sight of the patient's suffering, euthanasia is sometimes justified by the utilitarian motive of avoiding costs which bring no return and which weigh heavily on society. Thus it is proposed to eliminate malformed babies, the severely handicapped, the disabled, the elderly, especially when they are not self-sufficient, and the terminally ill.\\"Palliative medical care has become so sophisticated that in reality no sick person need undergo an intolerable level of pain. But those who refuse to engage in real, personal relationships with suffering people can't expect to understand, either the ill person's need for palliative care or for counseling to deal with depression. Those who are uncomfortable with other people's condition should deal with their own discomfort, not try to eliminate the discomfort by eliminating the suffering person."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Great book that opens our minds to new ideas and thoughts about how our world could be without conflict, pain or suffering.

It shows a futuristic society and a young boy's plight within it. He is chosen to be a special kind of savior for the society, and the book chronicles how he deals with that responsibility/burden. The boy lives in a utopia, but of course utopia is not possible and he is the only one who sees the shortcomings in his society. It is a struggle for him to be the only one who understands these things. This is the kind of book that you cannot put down; every time I have read it has been in one sitting. It's short enough so that you can do that, but such a powerful story is packed within it. When people ask me my favorite book ever, this one invariably comes to mind first. If you haven't read it, you are missing out on a lot."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I loved this book in the begining and in the middle.

The people in the community live in a black and white world and never have to feel real physical pain. They must also follow a strict set of rules which guide their way of living. At the age of 12, Jonas and the other children in the community are assigned to do certain duties. Jonas is singled out to do a special job as the new receiver. During Jonas's training he will have to endure physical pain and learn of memories from the Giver(the old receiver). One year since Jonas's training; he can see colors instead of black and white and knows of both memories of love and war. Jonas also learns the fat of the other receiver in training 10 years ago. He also learns of the lies and deceptions his community has hidden from the public. Now, Jonas is trying to save the life of a newbourn that will be released from the community but still protect him and the memories he owns.Over all, I liked \\"The Giver\\" but some parts of the story did leave me asking questions. Lois Lowry never really explains what happens to Jonas at the end of the book. However Jonas is briefly mentioned in \\"Gathering Blue\\" also by Lois Lowry. I think \\"The Giver\\" by is a good book for almost all ages to read and sicuss. It would probably take at least less than a week if not more to finish it. I conisider it a good read!!!=^__^="},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jonas started off as being an eleven year old boy in a community where there are no colours, feelings or thoughts about sexuality. Jonas is nervous about the Ceremony, where he will become a Twelve, and, consequently, be assigned the role he will play in his community. Jonas does not know what he will be chosen to do. Will the Chief Elder make him become a Recreation Director or maybe a Nurturer, like his father? However, he is suddenly assigned the role of Receiver of Memory. The present Receiver of Memory, called The Giver, is getting old and it is his duty to transmit all of his memories of the past to the new Receiver before The Giver is released.Through the lessons of The Giver, Jonas learns about warmth, tranquility, serenity and love. However, The Giver must also give Jonas memories of hunger, loneliness, war and death. After a startling discovery about what happens to the old and sickly newborns, Jonas prepares a plan with The Giver. But when Jonas's plan suddenly burns to ashes, he spontaneously decides to take matters into his own hands. What he does and his journey after his decision will surely startle readers' tremondously. The incertain future of Jonas will make readers' like me wonder whether there will actually be a light at the end of the tunnel for Jonas and whether Jonas's community will finally change and let people have their own feelings.The Giver is a beautiful story filled with morals that will make humans understand that pain is sometimes necessary in order for us to enjoy the happiness that comes afterwards."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The books that Lois Lowry writes and amazing.

People can't feel pain and teens are watched from birth then assigned a job when they turn 12.Jonas is just like everyone else. He plays with his friends. He eats three times a day. He goes home and goes to bed, when he is supposed to. He never did anything wrong, and he never did anything incredibly good either. So why should he be singled out to apprentice The Giver when he turned 12?The Giver holds all the memories of pain and war and beauty and color that Jonas's world doesn't know exists. But the Giver is getting old. He needs to transfer those memories to someone.The first memory Jonas experiences is snow. He lies on a bed and the Giver transfers his memory of sledding down a hill in the snow to Jonas's mind. So you might think this would be a pleasnt experience, finding out all the things you never knew about.But not really. Because a memory means you have already experienced it, and you can remember and feel every detail. So when Jonas is transfered pain and war and death and blood, he feels it. And it isn't all that pleasnt.Through these memories, Jonas sees and feels the world differently. He knows that he can see color, and he is the only person that can. He feels pain, and he cringes when his friends play war. Because these things are real. And he is about to find out more about his not-so-perfect-world.This book is a huge turning point in understanding feeling and the image of perfect."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was read in our English class, and I fully enjoyed it. Lois Lowry is an amazing author, and her story of The Giver, kept all our attention. The way she wrote of the future is unbelievable. Jonas' world was perfect until he became The Receiver. Then he learned of pain and war. Although many people are not sure what happened to Jonas at the end and have some \\"unanswered questions\\" I believe that Jonas and Gabriel died. When they are on the sled they talk about Elsewhere and they become warm and joyful. This is a wondeful book, though, that EVERYONE should read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry has done an extraordinary job with the book, The Giver. It is well written and full of exciting plots. I really liked how she introduces and showed the true meaning of Release. My favorite part of the story was when Jonas ran out of the community because it was thrilling. How she describe was great. The part I disliked was the ending. It left too many unanswered questions like what exactly happen to him? Or what happen at the community after Jonas left? Another reason I didn't like was that she makes to many mistakes in her book. An example would be like she said that the people in the community didn't know what were animals, yet they knew what was salmon. Other then that the book was great. I really recommend this book to kids about 10 years old and higher because if younger kids read it, they would understand it that well. Hope you will get a copy of The Giver after reading my review!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a suspensful book that keeps you guessing on what Lois Lowry is trying to get to. Then when you find out what she was trying to get to and you will say \\"ohh. I get it.\\" It is interesting because the book is almost opposite from the way we live here.The only downfall is the ending because you have so many answers to choose from of how the book ends. I wasn't a big fan of the ending but you might so find out by getting The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am an eighth grade student and this was one of two books that I was required to read this year (see also my review for The Call of the Wild). This book is about Jonah, a young teen who lives in a community where everything and everybody is the same. There are no colors, and a board of superiors controls the community. It is censorship at its worst. The board also selects jobs for the teens. Jonah receives the job of Giver, which is very rare. The current Giver, in Jonah's job training, passes on memories such as color, pain, war, and love to Jonah.This book is more for teens than for children due to some content.This novel mainly discusses the use of censorship and how protected people are in some aspects of their lives. It talks about how people must experience things themselves in order to mature.This book was good half the time. Some of the memories and lessons Jonah learns are memorable, and wonderful to read about. This book was also bad half the time. Some of the memories, thoughts, ideas, and rituals of the community are too much."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Living in a world like the one Lois Lowery discribes in The Giver may sound cool, but when you relize later on in the book that babies are killed if they aren't just right makes you wonder: is that a perfect world? It would be nice to live in a world without crime, but would you want your job chosen by someone else? I wouldn't. The elderly are put to sleep since there's no need for them, and nobody knows this except for the people in charge of the community, and The Giver. The Giver is a book that shows a world that seems perfect, but underneath, it has just as much death as this world, except it's disgused. When Jonas ran away with the little toddler his family was caring for because he was to be put to sleep, I admired that, and I hope that he arrived in a nicer community then the one he lived in. This is another book I'd like in my library. It shows how evil can disguse itself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book had me drawn in from start to finish.

In this book, Lois Lowry eloquently describes Jonas in the search for truth within a seemingly utopian community. Everything in this amazing book means something. The name Jonas comes from the name Jonah, meaning peace. But why would Lois Lowry have a character search for peace in utopia? Lois Lowry's epic about the dystopia within a utopia will leave you shivering, yet wondering."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"As every Newbery Medal winner, The Giver is a very well written children's book. Its deceptively simplistic language reveals a rather horrifying dystopian world. This is a world where people are not given freedom to decide anything for themselves - their spouses, children, careers, future, even clothes or haircuts are all pre-planned and pre-selected for them. They are not allowed to even own their feelings and dreams. Their sexuality is suppressed. Of course, it is done for common good - to preserve peace and serenity, to avoid any disturbance, be that war, hunger, over-population, or simply personal discomfort of pain. Only two people in this community are able to understand what people miss out on. The main character Jonas is one of these people.The Giver is a good book, but:- it is too young; experiences of a 12-year old are too simplistic and lack edge for my liking;- in terms of dystopian setting I found a couple of Lowry's aspects of the Community hard to accept. I believe that no matter how restrictive and oppressive a society is, feelings of love and attachment to one's children or parents remain intact, unlike in this book where family connections are very easily severed and forgotten. Secondly, this story claims that people do not experience a feeling of love, for instance, because they don't have a memory of what it is. IMO, feelings are not something we learn or recollect, this is something that we experience involuntarily.In spite of my complaints, I am interested in reading the sequels."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Great book!

Quick read too, I guess partially because it's written for young adults.Quick synopsis: Jonah, the main character, lives in a world of Sameness. Everyone is the same, eats the same, talks the same and dresses the same. Everything is regulated so that no one is different and feels bad because of their differences. When he becomes a Twelve (his age - everyone changes ages at the same time, on the same day) he gets assigned the job of The Receiver of Memories. This is a very prestigious job on the outside, but comes with much responsibility.Lowry does a wonderful job making this an easy and enjoyable read. She also only introduces the reader to pieces and parts of the utopia little bits at a time, where, at first, the reader may think that this world Jonas lives in sounds like a great plan; no pain, no sorrow. However, as you read on and discover the other things they don't have in their world; weather, hills, mountains, you see that it's not as wonderful as you may have initially thought."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I've just finished reading this book in an intermediate English as a Second language class, and it was wonderful. Deceptively simple, \\"The Giver\\" is the story of a Utopian society that has chosen Sameness over uniqueness, given up freedom for a life free from pain and suffering. Jonas is 12 years old when he is chosen as the one to \\"hold\\" all the memories of the past, good and bad, to protect the society's tranquility from being disturbed. Jonas slowly discovers the price that has been paid by leaders in the past in return for the Community's safe existence in the present. Lowry slowly reveals what the truth is, as Jonas learns it. This is a great book to teach and think about--I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book written for middle school students, but as a 20 year old college student, I enjoyed it as much now as I did in the 7th grade. The writing, first of all, captures you and sucks you into this world in which Jonas and his family and friends live. The concept of the book is so intriguing also that it makes it easy to WANT to read it. Jonas' relationship with The Giver is heartbreaking in good and bad ways. I think that every student should read this as a middle schooler, but I think that everyone should read this book because it is a well written, easy to read book that also makes you think. I enjoyed this book and plan on reading it again and again!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"First, I want to thank Gretchen Rubin, whose The Happiness Project led me to The Giver. It was on a list of children's books she loved. I think it should be on any thoughtful adult's list as well. Jonas is chosen to hold all the memories in a world where everything is ordered and organized in such a way that no one needs to make decisions. Hunger, want, violence, chaos do not exist in this well-ordered society and its members are spared as well the pain of imperfect children and frail elders. No one questions anything - except Jonas. And as he is given all the memories that exist, he increasingly questions how society is organized and whether or not people would be better remembering for themselves.This is a though-provoking book for anyone who has wrestled with the thorny issues around societal control and information flow. Who owns our memories? How much information should be shared? It may be that this is essential reading for anyone who is trying to figure out social media and anyone who has ever reflected on the appropriate boundaries for government. It certainly broadened my perspective."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Kelsey CosentinoBasking Ridge, NJVirtual High SchoolThe Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy living in what seems to be a perfect world with no flaws or anything that could ever hinder the sanctity of the community. The protagonist, Jonas, is about to turn twelve and receive his predetermined career, as everyone else in the community has everything chosen and decided for them. Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory, which is to be transferred to him by the Giver. It is then that Jonas begins to understand the truth about the world outside of his \\"perfect\\" circle. It is also then that he learns that there is something terribly wrong going on in his community and it is up to him to make the biggest change of all of their lives.I am a high school senior and I have read this story twice in my career as a student. It's a very quick read, although a truly excellent one. The story is strange and completely original. The plot is constructed well from beginning to end, which I especially enjoyed because it was extremely thought-provoking. The end can be interpreted in several different ways, which is something that I personally look for in novels. I prefer stories that will keep me thinking about them long after I have finished them and The Giver was a great novel for just that, as my mother and I still debate over what ultimately became of the protagonist. However, because it is written for young adults, the actual writing and grammar can be a little weak at times for older students or avid readers. But as I said, what The Giver lacks in grammar it makes up for in content, as Lowry combines a common scene with a very uncommon situation, to create an air of folklore that is not to be matched for what could be a very long time."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver takes place in what is supposed to be a utopian society. Everything about a person's life is decided for them by a committee of Elders. Their lives are regulated by a strict set of rules, where breaking one results in an automatic apology, and breaking three results in a release from the Community. The book centers around twelve-year-old Jonas, who discovers that he is the new Receiver of Memory. Being given this job his entire way of life changes, and he discovers that there may be more to the world than just the Community. Having read this book for the first time at age seventeen, I feel I can safely say that the book will interest a wide range of readers. While reading the book, many people told me that they read it in fourth or fifth grade. However, I would not recommend this book for that age. The book deals with some very mature themes including death, emotional and physical pain, and one scene of nudity. I found the book to be fascinating and I had a hard time putting it down. For me the book provided the opportunity to reflect on some of the things that might need to be changed in society today so that the world never needs to create a community like the one in The Giver."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book for all ages. When I read it for the first time in middle school, I thought the book was interesting because it provided a new and exciting way of life to me that I hadn't thought of before. A way of life where you had a strict set of rules telling you what to do, where you were assigned a career at the age of 12, where you were assigned a spouse and assigned two children: one male and one female. I thought it was interesting idea back then and I thought that it must have involved a lot of in depth thinking and planning and work. However, I didn't necessarily like the idea because I thought to myself that I want to be able to choose what I want to do for the rest of my life and I want to be able to express myself in any way I feel like. I don't want to be forced into marrying someone or told who my kids are going to be and have to raise them even though they aren't my own kids.When I read it just recently (I am now 18 years old) I realized that this is a simulated socialist society. It is a socialist society that is actually functional as well. People seem to be mildly content at all times. This functional society seems to raise the question: Why can't the world create the society? The answer lies within the stirring pills. Not only does this pill hold back a person's sexual urge, but it also suppresses a person's emotion, natural instinct, etc. These pills is what holds back the dentist or the doctor from demanding more compensation or money for his/her work than the construction worker. These pills suppress natural human emotions that cause problems but also good things to happen. When humans feel love they may do foolish things; but no human being would ever want to live in a world without love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a very interesting book and I enjoyed it very much. The setting and world were very different, but it added to the storyline. It was a little confusing at first, but I figured it out toward the end of the reading. The details in the characters and the back story given to each one really helped me understand it more."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I LOVE this book. I have probably read it between 10-15 times. It has a subtle & simplistic darkness about it. It's about a too-perfect futuristic world that's devoid of pain, emotion, choice & even memories. No one ever knows what happened in the world before them or what happens when they leave it. History is completely lost to all but one man; the giver. The Giver's job is to hold & endure those memories & then a successor is chosen; Jonas. Jonas slowly learns the truth about the underlying horrors of the 'perfect' world he used to be apart of. He gets to finally feel for the 1st time in his life, emotions like happiness & love, but also has to experience all the tragedies of the 'old' world firsthand including emotional & physical pain. It gives you a new appreciation for the freedoms that we take for granted. It helps you to look at things a little differently. The journey that Jonas embarks on is fascinating w/ so many thought-provoking moments along the way. It's touching, humorous at times, & even shocking. All in all, a great book thats worth reading again & again!Pick up this book & get ready to 'think'."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book describes a really sad society, where everything is controlled and the people are like robots. They do not know colors or music, they have climate control and they must always use the correct words when speaking. It reminded me of the movie Pleasantville. The ending was ambiguous as you're not sure if what the boy is experiencing is a memory or if it is real. The novel forms a loose trilogy with Gathering Blue (2000) and Messenger (2004), two other books set in the same future era."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy, one the most influence personalities of the sixties, wanted to dictate what the public's memories of her husband were going to be. To do this she had to deviate from the truth. In an interview with Life magazine, Mrs. Kennedy used the term \\"Camelot\\" to describe her husband's Presidency. She did not want society to remember the true turmoil of his presidency, their relationships or the uncertainty of everyday life. She wanted to protect society from the untold pains, frustrations and disappointments they had experienced. She wanted President Kennedy to be remembered as a great leader over this utopian type of society. Maybe this is where LBJ coined his ideas of the \\"Great Society\\" but I will leave that for another paper. My point of this paper is to present the lies, oppression, and the unattainable and fictitious ideas of a perfect society. Lois Lowery's The Giver is an example of a Camelot-like society, an abstraction. Society based on ideas, that disregards and suppresses the natural events, truth.We wash the dirt, germs other things that are associated with an infection away, we do our best to isolate ourselves from receiving an infection. We associate infection with pain and disease. To prevent this pain and disease we do our best to sterilize our surroundings. This is what Lois Lowey has done with the setting in her story The Giver. She created a community that did not suffer the pains or diseases of daily life; the residents of this community did not experience hunger, sickness or desire. She had created a sterile society, free from pain, well almost free of pain. The only time pain occurred was when one fell from their bicycle. While there were other pains that were identified in the story, they were covered up, those pains were denied, they where not to be seen or discussed. This is evident when Lowery gives the reader a vivid description of the release process of an undesirable defenseless baby. They just washed the baby from their memory, they dispose of the perceived infection, the potential pain it could present if they chose to let the baby survive.What separates us from the other animals on this planet is our ability to reason, to think in the abstract. In this community that Lowery has depicted the population as having lost, or rather been prevented from, exercising their ability to think critically and analytically. The characters in the story show no emotion; they have planned ceremonies, instead of celebrations. These ceremonies are theatrically planned right down to when members of the community are supposed to clap. Nothing is emotional or spontaneous; every aspect of this community is scripted and staged. There was one group of people who were different, the ones who saw color. They were selected to be the holders of memories, the people who could reference the past and experience emotion, make decisions and be spontaneous. We see this several times throughout the story. The character Rosemary shows the reader that there were members who do not follow the expectation of society. She was selected and expected to become the holder of memories however she decided that it was not for her and she exited the community. She actually committed suicide over the memories the Giver was training her with. This caused great turmoil in the community and the community was said to have suffered when she left, but there was no description of how it suffered or how anyone reacted. I would venture to say they experienced sadness, disappointment and felt betrayed. Since this was a sterile community that was not exposed to pain, suffering or even deviation from the proscribed path they were directed to take. When Rosemary left, everyone knew she killed herself, and the teachings she had been given were released into the society. It's not clear what that means, if the thoughts were telepathically rained down into the collective minds of the population but I think it means that they were then exposed to something unexpected. And since they had no emotions to show, were not taught to experience thought, they did not know how to even processes or have the coping tools to deal with these feelings. They were incapable of thinking for themselves and had to seek the Giver's advice to deal with turmoil.In most societies that maintain complete control over their population, deciding what is best for society usually end being the most repressive of societies. The ideas set forth by Karl Marx and Fredrick Ingles were meant to eliminate the oppressiveness of those who controlled society. In a theoretical sense these planned societies are often thought of to eliminate pain and suffering from the population. But in reality, in practice, societies are not what cause these tragedies, the people in them do. The utopian societies that people tried to create end up in destruction and chaos, with the ruling class that inevitably takes advantage of the control of the masses. The Giver is not a new theme, its basis has been told for generations, from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to George Orwell's Fahrenheit 451, from Bladerunner to the Star Trek episode \\"The Colossus of Rhodey\\". All these stories end up telling the same moral, that the idea of utopia cannot exist because it denies individuality, freedom and humanity.Camelot. The name was simple and given the time, when the musical was at the height of it's popularity, was the perfect name to use to give the people a name for a time period. The musical, a love story, portrays a perfect yet slightly flawed and tragic time. Given Jacqueline Kennedy's background and education, she undoubtedly was keenly aware of the truth she was telling in using the phrase. Camelot, in the story that is not in the musical, is a place where wars were ended and peace reigned, where knights and nobleman sat together without fear. But the true story, one she would have studied, that was not in the popular conscience, was that the peace of Camelot was destructive and lead to death, debauchery, pain and suffering beyond compare. The trained knights were stuck at home with nothing to do. The infrastructure of the city nearly collapsed with having to support so many \\"happy\\" people. In the end, an adventure had to be created to give people something to do, something to look forward to; the people needed a goal, a dream to work towards, because without such a thing there is no hope and no reason to work hard and strive to be better. There's no reason to exist. The story of the legend of King Arthur's Camelot gives the knights the purpose in the search for the Holy Grail. They are then free to leave on their quest, freed from their life of perfect existence. Mrs. Kennedy's husband, and I'd argue her whole family, was given freedom from the pain, suffering and debauchery upon his death. Jonas was also able to leave, to find his peace and freedom, only by leaving Utopia."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i remember reading this book in 7th grade and loving it - 13 years later, i feel the same. excellent, easy, entertaining, and thought provoking - i hope they continue to make this mandatory reading in schools for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I love this book, it is such a short read but soo great. I love the story, love the way it unfolds, and love the ending (though I pretend that they actually died on the journey though we find out this is untrue in the messenger)I really like Lois Lowry as an author. Her stories are so original and she tells them so well. Most of the books that I read resemble dictionaries so it is nice to go back to this, or of mice and men and remember that a really amazing story can be told, and have a profound effect on you, in fewer pages than you might think necessary."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver starts out with an eleven year old boy named Jonas, the main character, who lives in a perfect world--a world free from war, pain, suffering, hate, and hunger. The flip side to this \\"perfect world\\" is that there isn't any true happiness, pleasure, or love either. There is no choice in the community. Everyone is assigned to a job to do when they turn twelve. When Jonas turns twelve, he is singled out among his peers to receive special instruction from the most important and respected man in the community--The Giver. The Giver holds in his mind all the memories from the beginning of mankind. Only he knows the true feelings of love and hate, pleasure and pain, health and sickness, calmness and anger. Jonas has been chosen to be his successor.This is a great book. It has an engaging plot and kept me interested until the very last page. The author did a great job of creating a sense of excitement in the book. It also made me think about and appreciate the wonderful gift of choice that we all have. Jonas didn't like experiencing the memories of pain, but he realized later on that without those, he could never have known the sweetness of pleasure and happiness. It made me realize that I wouldn't want to live in a world like Jonas'. Sure we encounter pain and suffering in this life, but how could we know the sweet, if we don't know the bitter? That is a great message for everyone.One of the things that I didn't like about the book was the ending. It seemed to proceed too fast and it ended very abruptly. I would have liked it more if it went into more detail in wrapping up the story and letting us know what happened to Jonas and the community in the end. I also would have enjoyed knowing about how their community came about; when and why did they decide to go to the \\"Sameness\\" type of living? But other than those few things, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I decided to read this book because several people compared The Hunger Games to this. I can see why people would think that Suzanne Collins had been inspired with the story of The Hunger Games from this but it's not the SAME story as some have said. Both books are Young Adult but are still great stories no matter what a person's age.I do like this book and it's scary to think of a future like what is portrayed here. I hope that our society never turns into something as horrifying as this. Even though it's not a \\"slap ya in the face\\" kind of scary, it is frightening if you really think about how it could be.

The story is quite confusing though. It took me a couple of chapters to realize that Jonas calling himself an Eleven, or a Twelve, wasn't a typo, and they really say, \\"Congrats, Sally, on becoming an Eight.\\"The book also made me thankful for what I have. In the book, no one besides the Giver, who is the Reciver of Memories, and Jonas, a boy in training to become the Reciever of Memories, knows about all the joyous, and sad, and colorful things in the past. Like playing games with your grandparents, sledding through snow, or lying out on a beach on a sunny day. In this \\"perfect\\" world, there is no color. There is black and white, no red or blue, or purple. Everything is perfect.Towards the end of the book the Giver and Jonas device a plan to escape. I still don't know exactly what this plan is. I thought the entire time Jonas was escaping the village, riding through the trees on his bike, and sleeping under bushes, that he was going to jump in a river and drown himself. I thought that because the Giver and Jonas had talked about it a few times.As I said, it's confusing, but it's a good read. It makes you think about what your life would be like if you lived in the town with Jonas, in a world where everything is decided for you."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Great book for young adults.

Although a somewhat interesting general plot, I never felt the urge to \\"find out what happened next.\\" I don't know why this book is hailed as one of the greatest books ever written, a modern classic. The characters seemed dull and one-dimesional. The plot, although unique in some ways, just seemed mashed together from several different stories written before. I do understand this is a children's book, though I do not see what everybody sees in this below average exploration in dystopias and human nature.For books about dystopias and human nature, I suggest reading more interesting novels such as 1984, Brave New World, A Clockwork Orange, the Dune Chronicles, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Bonfire of the Vanities, Mother Night, etc. For some good short stories, read Harrison Bergeron, Those Who Walk Away From Omelas, The Veldt, and others.Rating - 2 stars - You can pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The GiverBy: Lois LowryOnce you pick up The Giver you can&#65533;t put it down.

The most ungodly ending i have ever read ruined a piece of literal art. It almost seemed as if Lowry just got to a point in the book where she just got bored with the book and looked to end it. It was like ending Romeo and Juliet with the families reconciling and the two living happily ever after.

Lois Lowry's The Giver was published in the early 1990s. Shortly after, the novel found itself in the classrooms of English teachers. This relatively modern novel has been widely praised by students who have been assigned to focus their attention for the span of the assignment. It is my belief this should be the case and it should also be widely used by Social Studies teachers. As someone with a B.A. in History and an Integrated Social Studies license, this is a very effective way to teach students the characteristics of utopian societies. It can also be used as a method to study factory or company towns, such as the Pullman Town of late 19th century Illinois, which is a subject of study in United States History classes. If students have read The Giver before studying Pullman case and the strike that occurred as a result of the town's traits and how it applies to business of the era, lessons would almost certainly be more effective. Students of the class may find the objectives easier to understand. There are many novels where English and Social Studies teachers of all age levels (though it may be most effective at the middle and high school level) should combine forces to teach content. The Giver is a prime example of a great, compelling novel that should be used in English and Social Studies classrooms. Students may also enjoy that it is a quick and easy read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Louis Lowry's The Giver is an award-winning Young Adult fictional novel found on the shelves of many Language Arts teachers and libraries. Many have summarized it as a coming of age book that is about a 12-year-old boy, Jonas, who lives in a perfect society. Lowry writes on the back cover, \\"Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community\\".When Jonas receives his life assignment to be the Receiver of Memories, he discovers secrets about the past, and the terrible choices that make this world possible. The previous Receiver, now called the Giver, trains him.The author continues, \\"The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now it's time for Jonas to receive the truth.\\" Gradually Jonas comes to understand, and resent, the choices that had to be made to create his world, and the terrible secrets behind its perfection. Together he and the Giver concoct a plan to change the way his world works, but before they can carry it out Jonas is forced to make a decision that may destroy them all.For me as a student teacher and a parent of five adolescents/young adults, I found The Giver:* To be thought- and conversation provoking. I found the best part of reading The Giver is the many conversations it inspires -- from life and death, love and pain, and more.* To be anything but controlling for the reader. For a novel that is about control, I loved how Lowry left Jonas and Gabriel's fate up to the interpretation of the reader. The last moments of the novel were told in such as way that it allowed the reader wonder if Jonas and Gabriel's lives had ended (or released).* To be disturbing at times. I am concerned about age-inappropriate content for middle school students, including occultist themes and violence, sexually explicit material and the ideas of drug use, suicide and euthanasia. I found several passages unsettling:* Jonas' father punctures a newborn in the top of the forehead with a syringe full of lethal fluid. He talks to the crying baby, gently saying he knows it hurts. Then he nonchalantly wraps up the dead child and puts him in a trash bin.* Jonas and other young volunteers bathe the elderly in the House of the Old. People are forbidden to look at others naked, but this rule doesn't apply with infants or the elderly.* When Rosemary, the failed Receiver of Memory before Jonas, seeks release, she asks to inject the needle into herself.While it may be commonplace for images as such to be on television and in the movies, I would want to make sure my students had plenty of opportunities to discuss, write, and or illustrate their thoughts and feelings.For me, the positives far outweigh the negatives of reading The Giver. This classic is a must read for all students who seek to broaden their understanding of life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"So you want to live in a perfect world without poverty, crime, disagreement and worry? What does it take to create such a utopia? The Giver by Lois Lowry is a chilling example of how one such world is structured. Such a perfect society may not be what it is thought out to be. Freedom, individualism, and emotions are sacrificed in order to create this utopian world.Lowry leads her readers on a journey through the highly structured life of twelve-year-old Jonas. Given a special role in his community, Jonas slowly begins to learn how his world differs from what it used to be. He sees events and experiences feelings he has never encountered before. Jonas is left wondering if the freedom to experience these emotions, good or bad, is really worth it. Is freedom to experience pain, love, happiness and sorrow better than structure in a sterile environment?I highly recommend The Giver as it will influence the reader to ponder the structure of society as well as the freedoms our society allows. This book may be considered a book for younger readers, but it would greatly benefit any adult reader as well. Lowry creates a piece of literature that evokes thoughts and emotions comparable to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. The Giver is a book that should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is great for adults and youth. It really takes just a night to read...at least...I couldn't put it down, but a lifetime to ponder. Whenever people talk about what \\"paradise\\" or the afterlife looks like they speak of perfection, but what does that really look like? This book gives an eerie picture that sticks.Lowry walks his audience through the life one boy, who is chosen to learn the secrets of a life his ancestors, chose to leave behind. At first, the world sounded like a place I wish I could live in--children were always provided for, everyone gets along and does their duty or...(this is where Lowry does the psychological shift)...is disposed of. Then the reader is left to ponder how a world so beautiful could be tainted by ritual murders of infants, teens, and adults alike. Then the expos&eacute; begins to occur. There is also no love-making, love, or joy because those come with pain and sorrow which the society was created to destroy.In the end, the reader is left wondering whether one should try to escape such a perfect world or try to fit in to avoid the tragic ending...or was it tragic? It is left up to the reader to decide. Which is more tragic--life where sin exists but also joy or life without either?Which would you choose?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver offered a world some people long for and others will fear. The people in the book believe they live a perfect society. No one wants for basic needs like food and shelter. Everyone has an assigned job, and knows what events they should experience with each stage of their life. Everyone is essentially the same. Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver. As Jonas gains knowledge and memories from the Giver, he begins to worry about all that the community gives up in order to acheive the sameness they live in. Is the lack of fear about war and poverty worth the loss of color and love?This book will make you think about the changes in our own society, and what they might bring. A great way for kids to learn about different social issues as well. I recommend reading it as a family."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was an amazing book! The story is like nothing I've ever read before. The writing makes you feel like you are literally right there. I didn't want it to end! I'm on Amazon right now ordering more books from Lois Lowry. I don't know how I'd lived this long and never heard of this author before."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I checked this book out from the Library by chance and LOVED it! I normally hate Science Fiction but this book, taking place in a science fiction world, was very good and you could easily visulise what was going on. The book makes you appricate the little things in life. I immedately recomend this to anyone who asks, and to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for school. What I expected was a dull and boring book but, what I got is much different. I've never read a book like this before. When you start reading it the author slowlys starts to draw a picture of what this place is like and made me wonder is this what could happpen in the future? It isn't such a bad idea in someways. But, I not saying I would want this to happen. After reading this book is still making me think. I think if your taking this much to read these reviews you should read the book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read this book for a book report, and my teacher didn't like it, but I thought I'd give it a try. I loved it!!!!! I read it threee times before I had to give my book report. I thought it was wonderful!!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really think this book is one of the finest Lois Lowery has written. She is an unbelieveable author who really puts it all into her work....you can tell. This book was read to me in 5th grade by my teacher and I have fallen in love with it. And no, my teenage mind is not corrupt from &quot; An adult book disguised as a children's book&quot; ( as in a previous review) I could handle the subjects in this book when I was 10, and I think this book has made me realize how lucky we all are, and what we have that makes this world so special. True, it's a little boring at the beginng (I'll admit to that- I would fall asleep with my head on the desk), but believe me, the reward of a good book you can't stand to put down is worth waiting for."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read the book the Giver in third grade and read it over and over again. This book makes me appriciate the little things in life , such as colors and snow. This book is complicated, but if you reread it the end refers back and means so much more the second time around. The book is touching and amazingly written."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book. I must have read it a million times since I was in sixth grade and we had to read i for school. I also read it faor a book club. Most of the kids in the group liked it too. The very begining is a little confusing because there were a lot of terms I hadn't heared before. You just have to be patient and lok for details and its easy to figure out. I was eally surprised about the color. I should have guessed though. Why else would he have been talking about the shade of things and not the color. I was a little surprised about the release but I new it couldn't be too great. Why else woud they make so big a deal about it. Some people might find some parts offensive, but I dont. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book may start off slow but if you like those &quot;Brave New World&quot; type books this one is a keeper. The story centers on a &quot;perfect&quot; society where there is no pain, hunger, unemployment, or love, and emotions. If a Group of Elders sees anything as obsolete, getting in the way, they get rid of it. A twelve year old boy is given the job as &quot;Reciever of Memories&quot; and is supposed to keep the knowledge of the world to himself so no one will ever question the way things are. But when he finds out the truth he and the Giver, the one who gives him the memories, form a plan to release the memories back to the population. While I won't give away major plot points to this story, I will say that I found some of the images disturbing. &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;1984&quot; are better books but this one is the best Utopian/distopian books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really really liked this book. There has been only a few books that have touched me in a way that this book did. I thought that the author has a wonderful creative imagination and I would have never thought of it in a million years."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; was an interesting, well written book. It portrays the life of an ordinary boy growing up in an seclusive town refered to as the &quot;Community&quot;. The main character Jonas grows up in the community until he's a &quot;12&quot; which is the beginning of your adult life. When Jonas is given his &quot;assignment&quot; which is like his lifetime job. He is given &quot;reciever of memory&quot;. He then learns of everything that the town is secluded from. When Jonas learns about the outside it scares him to know what's on the outside. He also learns what people are really like and it scares him to a point where he feels he needs to leave the community all together. This book is portrayed excellently of how a perfect town can easily become twisted around to someplace scary."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I had to read &quot;The Giver&quot; for high school English, and I was surprised at how something like this actually made it into high school reading lists. It was actually intresting at first, but then tapered off to where I thought I was reading of life in my high school, not the fictional community. Think about it after you read it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry, The Giver (Laurel-Leaf, 1993)There are a few books released every year that gain both wide-ranging critical acclaim and deep popular support. They are few and far between, and fewer still when the book in questions stirs up as much controversy as has The Giver. Personally, I don't see what all the controversy is about; everything in here that could possibly be seen as questionable is an echo of a canonized piece of science fiction (the two books that most come to mind are Logan's Run and Brave New World). Yet, as soon as you try to boil down Nolan or Huxley for the kidlit crowd, hackles get raised. I just don't get it.A distillation this may be, but it is in the same way that Things Fall Apart is a distillation of Greek tragedy; there's enough there for the author to have worn her heart on her sleeve, but the themes are places within a different framework of characters well-enough drawn that no one's ever going to be accusing Lois Lowry of plagiarism (one hopes). The story centers on Jonas, on the brink of turning twelve at the beginning of the novel, in a utopian society where there's no crime, no poverty, etc. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory for the colony; he's something of an uber-consultant, the person to whom the ruling council turns when they come across something they have no way to understand. For Jonas, and those Receivers before him, store the collective memories of those things which their society has managed to forget over the time they've been apart from the rest of the world (never actually stated, but by the way the characters talk about the world previously, it's been hundreds, if not thousands, of years). Lowry sets things up exceptionally, and there's a wonderful revelation about halfway through the book that alone is worth the price of admission (when Jonas figures out what seeing-beyond really is-Lowry has managed throughout the beginning of the book to lull the reader into such a state that the reader hasn't even realized what it is that's missing). While that's the only real surprise here, the predictability of much of what comes after is forgivable enough. Lowry sets up a number of easy endings, none of which she takes, and the predictable pieces to the puzzle are all part of that setup. Just because the end result could have been done better doesn't mean it's not good as it stands. Highly recommended. ****"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My college Comp. II teacher describes this book as \\"no longer just for children.\\" It is now making it's way on to campuses across the US. It's \\"young adult\\" reading level doesn't compromise it's message. You should give it a try, no matter what age you are.I read The Giver in Elementary School, and remember liking it very much. I didn't understand it at the level I do now, but I did get the main concept. Contrary to popular belief, it will not ruin your child. Parents shielding their children from excellent literature like this only worsens the current lack of maturity I see coming out of elementary school students. Do you think it is a coincidence that the children or our society are taking on all responsibilities 5 years later than the average person of a century ago? Some parents' groups are trying to ban The Giver from their local school districts. It should be required reading. Books don't hurt anybody. Censorship, however, does deprive them of character building material, to which they should have the right to read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was the best book that i have ever read. I really liked the fictional idea of the community, and how the people in it were very well described. The only part that i did not like was the last line where it says, \\"But Perhaps it(the music jonas heard) was only an echo.\\" I though this line really ruinged the end of the book, and it weakened the boldness of it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this books for the first time when I was ten years old, and I loved it. It was one of my very favorite books. In the seven years since then, I've read Brave New World, 1984, and especially Ayn Rand's Anthem and discovered that The Giver is extremely, extremely unoriginal. Virtually plagiarized. The Giver has some pretty heavy ideas in it that I didnt really understand at ten years old, so I think it's be better for kids to skip it altogether and then read BNW, 1984, and Anthem when they're a few years older. If you're even into that sort of thing. As a liberal, I tend to get annoyed at the idea that any minor attempts at some level of equality will lead to a society of faceless drones - that's a really black-and-white way to see the world (no pun intended, to those who have read the book). I'm kind of bummed that Lowry, one of my favorite authors as a child, is apparently being so extreme, and I can only hope that she isn't really another Rand, as I'm not really a fan of hers. Politics aside, I commend this book for its storytelling and for the fact that it at leats has some intelligent ideas in it, unlike lots of the stupid, trashy books out there that kids read. However, like I said earlier, some scenes are too depressing and intense for your average kid, and plus it's completely lacking in originality. My vote for a favorite dystopian novel goes to Orwell's 1984."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This fantasy book by Lois Lowry was one of the best book I've ever read. The book takes place in a weird world totally parallel to ours. In that world, there is no hate violence or wrong-doing and nothing extraordinary happens. The Giver gives Jonas the memories and feelings, good and bad, from our world, that don't exist in his world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a favorite of mine. I know that it doesn't appeal to everyone. I am not a Science Fiction reader. This book is more than Science Fiction. I am an elementary school teacher and have used this book in my classroom for years. I have colleagues that frowned about the book because they think that is suggest certain things that children shouldn't think about. A book can suggest whatever the reader wants to read into it. I personally have found it to be a excellent book to open up discussions about important issues. I try to read it around the time for black history month. It is excellent to discuss how people different from ourselves are treated my us. We discuss self-centeredness and how we want everything to be like us or our way. Critical thinking is a wonderful skill to teach using this book. Some have criticized the ending. I love the open ending that is left for the reader to decide what happens. Life is open for us to determine our ending based on the way that the issues in this book are addressed in our own lifes. The book can be used as lightly or as deep as one would like. Regardless it will leave you thinking. This is one book that my students and parents talk about for years."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"...it is such a good book, when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I didn't have dinner,or lunch, when i started reading, my mom had to take the book away from me, to stop me! it made me cry in the middle, and at the end, I love this book, it's really good, so before you jus turn the page, and say, nah, that doesn't look like a good book, well YOUR WROUNG! I would buy this book, if your like 8-50, even adults can read it. so when your out of good books to read, just get THE GIVER."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I am 12 years old and simply love &quot;The Giver&quot;. I began reading the book as a leasure activity before my amazing teacher decided to do a unit on the book by reading it aloud to the class. I admit, it was even better the 2nd time around! [if possible] I began my book report on the book with the simple scentance: &quot;Jonas lived in a world without choices. A celestial community, a utopian society.&quot; My report went on including the basic plot about how after the ceremony of 12, Jonas discovers that he is different from the others in his community and how he began his training with the Giver. Anyways, I won't go on because there is soooo much in this book that I cannot fit into 1,000 words. So all in all, I am simply agog by the content of &quot;The Giver&quot; and thuroughly congratulate Ms. Lowry's fine work."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I cried,laughed,and felt the joy that was flowing in this book.I could not put it down because it was so different.I think anyone could read this book it is very unique and perfect for any reader!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book THE GIVER by Lois Lowry is the story of a young boy Jonas who lives in a society protected from the rest of the world. In this era, Jonas's culture has chosen to forgoe choice and emotion in order to produce efficiency and to eliminate pain. For example, there is no love in this culture; rather, these feeling entitled &quot;stirrings&quot; are controlled by medication. Marriage is controlled, and children are assigned to each &quot;married&quot; couple, to be raised, but not loved. Jonas, however, is selected to be the one person responsible for emotion: he receives the memories from the history of the world before climate control, before the end of war, and before the true end of happiness.THE GIVER is not only a fascinating children's book, but entertains a philosophical and psychological content which can be read on many different levels. I read the book first when I was a young child, and as I marveled at the story and was shocked as each child lost its identity, stiving to achieve &quot;sameness.&quot; Trust me, growing up in a liberal household in the busy city of New York (which is one of the culture centers of the earth), the idea of not living for happiness and choice was hard to understand.This is the book I chose for my Philosophy in Literature analysis last semester at college. It is an incredibly deep book- Ms. Lowry makes remarkable insights into the tendancies of the human character. I am not familiar with her life and could not tell you whether THE GIVER was written to be so deep or if Ms. Lowry is simply a phoenomenal author and a sensitive, perceptive observer of the human character. However, I can tell you that this is truly one of my favorite books and I recommend from the bottom of my heart that you lose yourself Jonas's world today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book when a controversy arose about it at my son's school.

My son and daughter both said they'd rather live with some troubles as long as they had freedom.

Every spare minute I had, I read the book. When I finished, I couldn't sleep that night very much. I kept thinking of the book, and I couldn't stop. So I read it again. I suggest this book to anyone, everyone. And once you have read it don't stop reading, keep going. Jonas, age 12, is a very brave young man, no one could ever replace him. He goes through love, death, starvation, pain, color, and even more that no one in this book has ever experienced.

The community of Lois Lowry's book The Giver has so little confidence in itself or in its citizenry that books are prohibited, with the exception of a dictionary and a sort of Yellow Pages directory to stores and businesses. Except that they don't seem to have telephones. Or TVs. Or radios. Or music. It's a very stifling way to live, as protagonist Jonas discovers, once a glimpse into history opens his eyes to alternative living arrangements. Reading this book made me think about where my thoughts and ideas come from, how I am influenced by books, television, the music I listen to. What would I think about all day if it weren't for these media? What kind of person would I be? Censorship, in a real sense, colors my world gray."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The novel The Giver, by Lois Lowry, made me see the differences that are contributed to each society. This book showed how a young boy grows up in a society where there was no crime, hate, or violence. At certain ages, children were given gifts that represented how old they were. Some received bikes while others received ribbons for their hair. No one was jealous of one another. Everyone was equal. As time passed on, the young boy, Jonas, was given the job of the Giver. He could see and feel things that no one else in his society could acquire. Colors, textures, pain and happiness were among the many items Jonas gained throughout his session with the original Giver. As I read this book, my thoughts allowed me to see how different my society is compared to Jonas's. Living in a society where everyone is equal affected my understanding of how differently people live. This book should be read with the idea that everyone has different ways of surviving in the world. Personally, I would like to witness less crime and hate towards people in my society. The Giver will show the reader the many differences societies have in the world."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"If anyone ever needed proof that the society we live in is not as bad as it seems they should read The Giver. The problems we have to deal with such as crime, starvation, and war are insignificant to the problems that face the utopian society of The Giver. In this so-called perfect society everyone is the same they all have the same homes and the same amount of belongings but, they don't have memories and they all do what the leaders of their society tell them to. The people within in this community act like robots they do what they are told and they never question why things are they way they are. How could anyone exist without the basic human rights that we take for granted? It is so true that you don't know what you have until it's gone because after reading The Giver I came to realize all that I do have that I take for granted. For example, can you imagine a life without color or going through your life without a memory? I know that our society does have some serious problems but, The Giver shows you that things could definitely be a lot worse."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver would be a great book to read if you wanted to get a sense of what it would be like to live in a perfect society and compare it to how our society is today. Jonas, the main character of the story, lives in a community where everyone is presumed to be perfect and no freedom of expression was allowed. These people had no understanding of how it would be to feel love, pain, or happiness. This community was controlled and assigned by a group of elders. This has reflected on our society today since now we have the media and politicians trying to govern our lives. We have laws to obey, and yes we may decide to act on illegal actions,yet there are always consequences that we have to face. We might not realize this but this has reflected and exists in our society today."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about a world that has based there living on utopian ideals. While reading the book many things caught my interest and have continued to intrigued me. One thing is how the author Lois Lowry used the approach of having all the inhabitants in the society believe that they are happy. Lowry started the book as if the citizens were preprogrammed to believe that they were perfectly happy, which is a common approach to many books based the so called &quot;perfect world&quot;. The difference between The Giver and other books based on a utopian world such as 1984, and A Brave New World is that Lowry used a mediocre view of the law system that other authors did not show in there books. The laws in The Giver could almost be compared to most of the laws shown in the other books. I thought the book The Giver was a intriguing book, because Lowry used a style of writing that most people have not seen before in a book based on a utopian society. \`"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an interesting book. It shows what is lost and gained by living in a world without differences. People in the community of The Giver make no important choices, they are told everything from who to marry to what career path to follow to what to eat. As children they are told how to wear there hair, when to start ridding bikes, and share one birthday with all other children. People in this community are safe, they think that they are happy and never call attention to the subtle differences that still exist just enough to make them seperate people. They can't see colors and never question the orders that are given to them via a PA system that exists everywhere in the community. In this story, the people of 'long ago' who were unique like we are today chose sameness because the wanted safety. Letting people make their own choices was too risky, not worth the freedom it brings because it is too easy for poeple to mke the wrong choice. Also, in a controled world with neither too much hot nor cold, with no decicions to be made, there is no pain, physical nor mental. But there is also no pleasure, no happiness, no love. These people aren't really living because they have no real feelings. They only think that they are happy because they don't know what they have lost, they don't know what happiness is. But in this story, as in life, pain, pleasure, wisdom and all types of things can be passed down by storytellers. Here this storyteller is The Giver, but he only shares his memories of real living with one person, who will in time share those saame stories with another single person, so as to have record of the outside world without disrupting the sameness. Jonas, the chosen Reciever of the memories, realises the price for safety is too high, and sacrifices himself to force his memories on the people. In the book, Jonas hs to leave the community and never return in order to share his memories, and after wandering for many days, he thinks that his has found Elsewhere (the place outside the Community of sameness)But we never really know if his found his destination or if he died on the way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book. Lois Lowry really expressed herself in this book. It makes me value life. I loved the ending. It was the best book I ever read. She used many expressive words that really made the book great."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My sister recommended this book to me, and I thought it would be an ordinary book. But I was extremely wrong. This is one of the best books I've ever read. It take place in a town where everything is assigned, there are hardly any choices. Also, the residents have no memories. Jonah, the new &quot;Giver&quot;, is the only one who experiences memories. This book helps you appreciate life,every memory you have, and all the opportunities we have today. The fact you CAN have these memories and opportunities is wonderful. My great grandmother died and, to use a quote, &quot;Memories are stars in the dark night of sorrow.&quot; Without them, I don't know how I would have gotten through it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver's a great book relating to folklore. This book, written by Lois Lowry, is about everyone being the same, with one man remembering all the things since... well, they don't say, but you get the impression of a very long time ago. Jonas helps this man out, to release these stored memories and return them to the people, so they'd &quot;remember&quot; such things as colors and originality. The idea was sort of taken to an extreme, but memories and passing them down is an important part of all cultures. This is where folklore comes in. Folklore consists of tales passed down from earlier generations. Stories that are fun to hear. Stories that scare the pants off you. Stories that grip you and don't ever let you go, or let you forget. And they're made to be so. Why would anyone bother sharing such tales, only for them to be forgotten the next day? They'd be useless. So they have worked these tales into their culture, wrapped their grain of truth up in layers of comedy, horror, or whatever best suits it, and fed it to their children, so that they might further pass it on. This book shows this all, and what would happen if it didn't exist. Yes, it's sort of extremist, but it's a goood read. Definitly something that'll make you thankful for your own culture's tales and folklore. And remember, just because it's folklore, doesn't mean it was never real.~Mike Mawhinney~"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was a wonderful experience. It made me enjoy living and enjoy or appreciate the fact that I have the power to chose and the gift of feeling and seeing color. In this book a boy named Jonas is chosen by his government of elders to be the all knowing reciever. It will be his life long duty to know all pain and suffering that has happened but also know all happiness,love and joy that the world can offer. He recieves the memories from the previous reciever, now the giver, and together they portray shared remembrence. Through them they keep the memories of the past alive and that is very important to all people and things. His new found knowledge forces him to lose his innocence that the town he grew up in offered. The town protected everyone in the town from all pain,hunger, and fear. But at the same time they did not enjoy love, happiness, and could not see color. Towards the end he leaves the town with a little baby named Gabriel because he knew too much and couldn't stay in the town of sameness. He also did not want them to kill the baby which they were going to do. So The giver stayed to help the town and Jonas and Gabriel went off on their own with another family. This book opens your eyes to the world and makes you value all you have."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very good book. It gives a different way of living and looking at the world. You will love Jonah and the Giver. I read this book in 3 grade and still love it in 7 grade. I encourage all of you to read it and keep an open mind."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My class was assigned to read this book over the summer. Its about a boy, Jonas, who lives in a world of no feelings, colors, or any of the common happiness people take for granted everyday of their lives. I think that this story really helps people to realize and learn to value all the small things around you. It also made me aware of my rite to choose. Now, I am going into the 7th grade, and as I said, i was assigned to read this book for school, but i had also read it in the fourth grade. I did understand it, and I did enjoy it, but I do feel that I certainly enjoyed it more now that i am older. And I feel that it is more intended for older children, not a Fourth or Fifth grade student. But its your choice! It was, though, one of the best books I have ever read! And if you like the author, Lois Lowry, you should also try &quot;Number the Stars&quot; , especially if you are looking for another outstanding story for a younger reader!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is one of the BEST children's books I have ever read for exposing the sick reality of what a socialistic society would be (the &quot;ideal&quot;, could it actually be reached). I recommend it HIGHLY."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is amazing. It has the most intriguing plot of most any book i have ever read. It deals with a young boy who lives in the &quot;perfect world&quot;--no sickness, pain, hunger, divorce, or any of the troubles in our world. But when it is time for his job to be chosen Jonas is selected to be his community's(more like an isolated city) Reciever of Memories. Suddenly the horrible truth is revealed to Jonas- the truth of his utopia type world. This is his revelations about the world before this, and his reactions and decisions because of this. It is a book that I read every year, as I have for the past 7, because of its wonderful plot, and captivating ideas. A must have."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Los Lowry was a very clever way to say nothing can be perfect. The book is about Jonas, aboy who lives in a society where there are no choices, color, or feelings. Almost everything is done for them: their jobs are picked by a committee or elders, and their food is delivered by dilvery men, but when Jonas is assigned to be the receiver of memory, a job where you are given memories of love, he runs away to a community with all the things he has been living with out. I enjoyed the book a lot because of its messafe: everything has a flaw. The book taught ne that nothing can be perfect and that I don't want to be perfect. I enjoyed the book to the very end because I enjoyed learning about Jonas' society. I think the most interesting charecteristic of the novel was the ending. The author left you to decide what was going to happen to Jonas. This ending was unusual, so at first, I did not like it because I really wanted to learn what happend to Jonas, but then, i realized what she was doing, and I started to like the ending due to its peculiarity. That is why I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was the best book I ever read it was odd and weardbut I caught on to it the book has good grammer it also hasdetail. The main character is Jonas, the Giver is the character that has feeling's and the other people that live in the community. The author then talk's about how perfect they are in the community, but Jonas find's something what happens even though nothing seem's wrong in the perfect community because they have no feeling's. In this book it tell's you everything that it need's to tell well thats pretty much how it goes."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really liked this book but it kinda wierded me out. It was definately different from any other book i have ever read. I think it should have explained certain things better though. I've read it twice. First in 5th grade and then in 8th. My 5th grade teacher refused to read it outloud because it dealt with some issues that may be not be suitable for 5th graders and i agree with him. Now as a freshman i think i understand the book alot more. I think it also makes you realise how much we take things for granted, like color or real families. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a different view of life."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is an excellent book for people of all ages.

Lowry had created a whole new world for her readers; the world &quot;Sameness&quot;; a world where no one can be hurted--except for the Receiver. The Receiver has to hold onto all of the memories from the past: all the wars + all the bloodshed. But the Receiver also holds onto all the joys which the community gave up for &quot;Sameness&quot;. When Jonas is chosen to be the next Receiver, his &quot;normal&quot; world is turned up side down. When Jonas leaves the community with Gabriel, he makes a hard decision. In this wonderful book, Lois Lowry creates a world where everything is safe.

Which makes no sense to me. Well it makes you think. What if life was really this way?? What if THESE things really did happen?

It is a little confusing but it's good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I remember the way I felt after I had seen &quot;The Day After&quot; (that made-for-TV movie from 1983), and I honestly feel that this book has the same power to make you think about what might be AND then appreciate how wonderful and beautiful our world is--despite its many flaws.I'm currently getting my MLS in order to be a children's librarian, and I read THE GIVER to familiarize myself with some of Lowry's work. This book blew me away. I wish that the younger readers who gave this title only one or two stars could be part of a discussion with other readers who got more out of the book, because everyone should understand what the author is trying to say here...about the dangers of a homogeneous society where everyone thinks the same thing and there is no diversity and no imagination.Believe me, this is a book that will stay with you long after you finish reading the final page... With its 390 customer reviews, I think this could well be the most highly &quot;customer reviewed&quot; children's book at Amazon.com and that says A LOT about how this book has that rare ability to evoke a visceral response...Unfortunately there are too few books are like that--books that really strike a chord and make us THINK."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about an un-beleivable subject, but Lois Lowry makes it beleivable.

When I read this book I wanted to know how the author got the ideas to write. The society in the story is perfectly controlled. It is somthing we do not have in the real world. This story takes place in the future. That is also interesting to think about.I liked this book. I would like to read it again some day and think about what happened at the end of the story. It might change my opinion about the ending.

I can't wait until my brother is old enough to read it because I loved it so much. Lowry creates an really interesting world that leaves the reader wanting to read more and more. It doesn't matter what age you are, 12 or 40, its a great book for all ages. It definately deserved the award that it received."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry is an exceptional writer. Many of her books, including The Giver carry a deeper meaning than the actual story presents. I found The Giver to be a book that really explains what a society would be like without the capability to feel emotion, or change. This book is an EXCELLENT book for a book report, (contrary to another review) because it gives the child a chance to think and really get the deeper meaning of the book.

A young boy finds out the truth about his so-called \\"Perfect\\" community. It helps you truly enjoy the luxury of our lives. You start to connect with the characters, but when it's over, it devestates you because you don't ever want it to end. Lois Lowery once again, impressed me beyond beliefs. It is a wonderful book indeed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is an excellent book. It contains thrilling events, suspense, and leaves the reader curious of what is soon to be discovered. The Giver flows with details describing every motion or breath taken by a charater. I like this book, The Giver, for several reasons. For instance, the book always comes up with something new. At the end of each chapter, there is some suspense. Furthermore, the book makes me think of how good our life is and how perfection is an error. Finally, the detail is helpful when attempting to virtually picture the image. As you can see, The Giver is a splendid book, and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is very good and well-written. It is very descriptive and when I read it, I felt like I was the main character. In this book, there is a community that has no fear, no pain, no memory striving for perfection. But there is one character willing to risk his life to change others. Throughout this book, the main character, Jonas, discovers many lies. I would recommend this book to anyoune age 10 and up. And if you like this book, you should read \\"Number The Stars\\", also by Lois Lowry, and you should read \\"The City Of Ember\\", and \\"The people of Sparks\\" all by Jeanne DePru."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\"He killed it! My father killed it!\\" This is a quote said by the main character, Jonas, and is one of the many quotes that keep you hooked on this book.I liked this book for many reasons. It made me realize how great my daily life is compared to those in the book. Wouldn't that be hard to live in a place and you know nothing about it? I found it a little strange that they had no individuality and at Ceremony, each child got the smae thing to resemble their age. Everyone is sort of trapped in this little Community they call home.

In my opinion, it starts out kind of boring, and has a cliff hanger ending (the kind you just love and hate). I think over all though, this book is really well-written and interesting! Lois Lowry did a wonderful job writing it. Jonas's society exists without problems because everyone is arrogant and doesn't know what's going on.

The community is stuctured under the idea of \\"sameness\\". There is no deviation from the normal values and regualtions, there is not even a change in elevation. Despite the foriegn setting, the messages about free will and problems in changing the status quo of society remain familiar.I feel this book is extremely original and thought-provoking. While it contains controversial issues, it is a story. It is something that will bring up issues, but no one will be enraged at the story, only captivated with the ideas. I rated a 4 out of 5 because it is sort of simply written, even though it is mature for its size and what would be expected from the simple writing style. The writing doesn't talk in circles or flourishes, it lets the story speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was an excellent book that could be appreciated by anyone over the age of about eight. The setting is a community that is secluded from all other parts of the world. The environment in which these people live is quite unlike society today and the people are deprived of memories, feelings, sexual desires, and having true bonds with others. Each person in the novel is given an assignment, not unlike assignments that are given in communist societies. The main character, Jonas, is given the daunting task of being The Receiver. In doing his job, he must receive all of the memories of the world in order to shelter the other members of the community from the pain they are associated with. Jonas has a difficult time accepting some of the ways of the community, and the character vs. society conflict occurs throughout the entire plot.The most interesting part of this novel is the fact that it can be directly connected to our lives in society today. Ways that people think and react to each other are portrayed quite accurately throughout the novel, whether it be one's unwillingness to listen or the general acceptance of the way things have been done in the past. It is also easy to see how people today take what they have for granted such as love or even relationships. This novel is an eye opener and I would undoubtedly recommend it to any person of any age."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book as a class asignment and it is one of the best books I have ever read!

At the &quot;serimony of twelve&quot; everything changes for him. He learns about the world from the Giver. One of my favorite parts in the book was when Jonas askes his parents if they loved him. They said no and that they appreciate his company instead of love. these eople even take pills to control their emotions. It is kind of a sad book, but I still loved it I gave it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"When I finished reading this book at first, my first thought was that it was a little weird.

The quality conversations about the importance of independence, appreciation of humans, enjoyment of ordinary life experiences, and quality of life abounded between student and teacher - and between students even at Snack Time! I convinced my Book Club to read it, and the conversation was as good as one we've had with many adult books.

Although most of the over 530 reviews before mine were written by young adults or children, several were also written by adults (including teachers). I find it strange that nobody mentioned the Jungian connection until now. Carl Jung's concepts of synchronicity, the collective unconscious (\\"Elsewhere\\" and \\"Memories of the Whole World\\"), Archtypes of the Unconscious, our \\"twin\\" shadow figures (see Lily's ramblings on pg. 137) which teach us through our dreams, the Self (\\"this IS my life... the memories\\" pg. 103)... it's all there hidden in the text. The term \\"Elsewhere\\" is ambiguous and equivocal; it has different meanings. Those who are \\"released\\" (killed) or \\"lost\\" (natural death) go \\"Elsewhere.\\" But \\"Elsewhere\\" also implies somewhere outside of the community where there are hills, snow, animals, and, it is implied (although made improbable - e.g., airplanes), a civilization like the readers of the book, but I don't believe Lowry intended that OUR civilization co-exist on the same planet as Jonas's, and the Elsewhere that he and Gabe found at the end of the novel was the \\"final destination\\" that \\"held their future and their past\\" (pg. 179) as well as that of every person: DEATH, which, paradoxically, does not necessarily mean non-existence but entrance into an afterlife. But, given Jung's (and Lowry's) philosophy, the afterlife or Elsewhere that Jonas and Gabe experience is the Collective Unconscious or Memory of the entire human race! Remember, \\"memories are forever\\" (pg. 104) and we ARE our memories (pgs. 103-104). The end of the last chapter is vague precisely because entrance into the Jungian Elsewhere via \\"received\\" memories (of Christmas, the sled, etc.) and imagination (that \\"special knowledge that was deep inside him,\\" pg. 179, before he died) is vague as a philosophical idea.Aside from the Jungian philosophy, there are obviously many great things about this book that make it a classic for both young and old. Read the other reviews! Personally, I enjoyed the book and consider it essential reading in the dystopian genre. Thanks Tammy for recommending it to me! - Brad Clark"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is my favorite book. I liked how the author told thestory from Jonas's point of view and you found out things like colorwhen he did. The way it was written with phrases like &quot;precision of language&quot; and how everyone was &quot;a&quot; nine or &quot;a&quot; twelve that helped me understand the precise but dull way that things were done in their community.When we read this book in the sixth grade our teacher asked us what Jonas meant in the end of the book when he was going on that last sled ride and and the book said &quot;I remember this place Gabe.&quot; and it was true. But it was not a thin and burdensome reccolection: this was different. This was something he could keep it was a memory of his own. We decided that it was refering to the dream that Jonas had just after he got that first memory of the sled ride and that he was traveling to the place that he could not get to in the dream. Many people said that they didn't like the endind. I did. It leaves room for your imagination that place where he was travellin to and had worked so hard to get to was there and welcoming them. It doesn't matter what that place was, only that he had made it there and that he would be o.k. and that maybe just maybe there was also music comeing from the community. Maybey just maybe the community had come to terms with themselves and were singing and maybe just maybe it was only an echo.We also had to write sequals to the book for English. Many said that Jonas had died and gone to heaven. Others wrote about the place that he had travelled to. Some wrote about what it was like back in the community when they had to come to terms with themselves.In one story which I remember very well, the entere community went completly mad and a few went as far as to blame the Giver and they in their utter madness killed him. After that the community just destroyed itself. The ending brings many posibilities and would not be so bad if you just thought about it.I would not reccomend this book for anyone under 6th grade. Not because they couldn't understand it but because they wouldn't get as much out of it and because for some it could be overwhelming. Anyone who reads it will want to discussit later.The Giver is a book that requires you to think. Requires you to use your imagination. You also have to feel whats going on.I think that it deserves the Newberry medal that it got."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Though I'm only 8, this has been the best book ever. The two possibilities at the end were one of the most interesting things to me. The characters were very well put together and it was very nice to listen to the dialogue.

The text had a surprising ending because in the text I was ready for a great ending and then it said something about echoes.

The book shares an important message that people should be able to make their own choices. Jonas' community doesn't make their own choices and that is what they author is trying to convey.As you can see The Giver is a good example of good literature."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a good piece of literature because it's full of adventure and action. It also has lots of description and it shares an important message.

The author describes the scenes so well that I could easily \\"draw a picture\\" in my head of what she (the author) is describing. Last, it shares an important message because it tells you that diversity, independence, and freedom is what makes life interesting and exciting. It's also makes life worth living because without freedom, diversity, and independence, life is boring and it's not worth living. The Giver makes you think, \\"What if there wasn't any diversity, freedom, or independence, how would life be?\\" So, The Giver is good literature because it's full of adventure and action, it has lots of description, and it shares an important message to everyone who reads this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Stephen Gambardella 2/5/07THE GIVERThe Giver is good literature because there is lots of description, lots of interesting details, and full of adventure and action.

There were lots of interesting details because an apple changed in the air and of where the released people go. The article states, \\"His father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and gave it a shove.\\" It was full of adventure and action because a lot of planes were looking for Jonas.

Well, I always was a fairly advanced reader, so I was probably in Elementary School when I tackled this one, which was probably a little young to successfully grasp the whole meaning. From reading the kids' reviews for this book, it seems to me that others are having the same trouble. While this is indeed meant for kids, it has some adult-level ideas in it that may be difficult for some children to understand in their entirety (although in all fairness, I'm not sure I truly understood the true importance of The Giver and the Keeper of Memories until I became a History Major).Overall, though, I would recommend this book to anyone, Adults and children alike (though I would probably aim it at 6th/7th grade and up to ensure comprehension). Do not miss this book. It is a quick read, but worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a well written book! Although it is a tad bit confusing...your child or even an adult will be given a messege of hope, humanity, and graciousness. But it will also give them the sometimes sad truth we humans must endure. I found this book interesting and a MUST READ!!! This book has a few unexpected twists but leaves you with a sense of happiness in the end... I would reccomend this book whole-heartedly (100%) to my fellow people. BUY THIS BOOK...you won't be disipointed...I wasan't (But reading some of the other reveiws I felt as if maybe this book is either a ABSOLUTE DO or Don't) But still I think this book was One of the best books I've ever read (and I've read many trust me!) five thumbs up!- your fellow 6th grader P.S - (Would not get for a child in the grade below 5th)"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book i did my report on was the Giver. It was written by Lois Lowry. It is a science fiction book. I think it is more for freshman and sophomores that are guys. It is about a boy in a sttrange world in the future who realizes that the government kills innocent people while also having the duties of the reciever, which is a very important position in his community. He tries to stop the killing and runs away at the end."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a great book that is similar to the series of Hardy Boys books, by Franklin W. Dixon. One similarity is that both books are mysteries and full of adventure. Both authors use similar types and styles of writing. If you like the Hardy Boys series of books, odds are you will also enjoy the book The Giver.In The Giver, the main character, Jonas, goes on an adventure to solve a mystery. In the Hardy Boys series, the main characters, Frank and Joe, also go on adventures to solve mysteries. Another similarity is that both of the main characters are young and follow in the footsteps of somebody older than them. Jonas is only 12 years old, and he follows in The Giver's footsteps. Frank and Joe are a bit older, but are still very young. Frank and Joe are 17 and 18 years old, and they follow in their Dad's footsteps. The Giver and Frank and Joe's father are both very famous within their community, and play an important role in the books.Another similarity between these two books is the author's style of writing. Both Franklin W. Dixon and Lois Lowry use a lot of detail in their writing. An example of detail in Lowry's writing is when Jonas first experiences sledding. \\"Comprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: The speed, the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace. Then, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound- the hill- flattened, nearing the bottom, the sled's forward motion slowed. The snow was piled now around it, and he pushed with his body, moving it forward, not wanting the exhilaration ride to end.\\" Page 82. In this section, Lois Lowry is using a lot of detail to describe the hill, the speed, and the snow.In the Hardy Boys series, Franklin W. Dixon also uses a descriptive, suspenseful and detailed style of writing. One example of this is seen in The Tower Treasure, when Franklin W. Dixon starts out his book by writing, \\"Frank and Joe Hardy clutched the grips of their motorcycles and started in horror at the oncoming car. It was careening from side to side on the narrow road. \`He'll hit us! We'd better climb this hillside- and fast!' Frank exclaimed, as the boys brought their motorcycles to a screeching halt and leaped off. \`On the double!' Joe cried out as they started up the steep embankment. To their amazement, the reckless driver suddenly pulled his car hard to the right and turned into a side rode on two wheels. The boys expected the car to turn over, but it held the dusty ground and sped off out of sight.\\" Page 1 of The Tower Treasure.Although these two books have many similarities, they also have significant differences. The Hardy Boys series does not have a deep philosophical meaning. The Hardy Boys series is a much lower level of reading. The Giver, is written on a higher level with greater philosophical meaning, leaving you with concepts to think about.The two books, The Giver, and the Hardy Boys series of books are similar in many ways. The author's of these books use lots of description and detail in their writing. These writers also use a very similar style. The characters are similar, and the plots are similar. If you like the Hardy Boy series of books, odds are you will like The Giver, and odds are that if you like The Giver, you will enjoy the Hardy Boys series books."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver: UtopiaThe faultless society, is there such thing? Lois Lowery, the author of The Giver wrote a work of fiction with the scheme of Utopia wrapped around it. In The Giver, young male named Jonas is living life the same way as everyone else is. Eat, work, learn, eat sleep; no feelings, no worries, no stress. It is noticed to be \\"perfect\\". The opinions that could be spoken about the layers upon layers in this novel are endless. The \\"hue-less shades\\" and everything that they do on a day-to-day basis is somewhat of a work of art. But should it in reality be called perfect?Sameness, equivalence, and egalitarianism, some of the topics articulated throughout the novel are a disaster waiting to happen. The understanding came to Jonas that the way they live really isn't fair. It isn't fair that the people cannot sense, distinguish color, and, just be happy. Everyone is to be the same, do the same thing, and look the same. All age groups have the same hair ribbon; all males wear the same tunic. Everyone is to use the same proper manners. Break the rules three times and you are considered nothing so they release you; they kill you. But if you are normal, but look the same as someone else, they want to kill you as well. Perfect, huh? But, I guess they are right, how awkward would that be, right? How hard would life be to have that superfluous person that looks the same as some other guy? However, they practice sameness. So, is sameness really what everyone wants, or will it just drive people mad?The slightly confusing yet powerful novel was greatly thought out. Every flip of the page sends excitement up my spine with a new juicy detail. Though the people in the community may be boring, this book is constantly active. The topic of Utopia is just one of the many in the book. It is a must read for anyone who would like a good interesting novel to past time by."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The book The Giver, written by Lois Lowry is very interesting and great. I think that it is good for all middle school students. It has a pretty high vocabulary so younger kids might not get it unless there parents read it to them. It is a very strange book but that is what it makes it different and better. If you like strange books that you can't put down this one is for you, you never are going to want to put it down. It is about a boy this is about twelve years old that a middle school could relate to, the only difference is that he lives in a society that is totally the same, everything is the same so there is no judging. That makes it so you don't have to impress anybody. The book started off a little slow but if you keep reading it gets better and better. The ending could be better but it lets you make it up so it is kinda fun because you get to pick what the ending is. So, if you like strange interesting books the book The Giver because it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a great book for ages 8 and up. It's a book about never giving up and doing what you belive. In the society that Jonas lives in everything is the same. No one can see color and they have many rules that they have to live by. It is very interesting the way that these people live compared to the way that we live today. This is the one book that I have read and enjoyed. Once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The setting is in a furturistic society where color, love, and feeling have all been taken away.

Jonas is honored with this posistion. Jonas starts to recieve the memories from the reciever who is now called &quot;The Giver&quot;.

It shows you that nothing is perfect no matter how hard you want it to be there will always be flaws. It also states that you should be grateful with what you have. I think that everyone should read this book so everyone will be a little more grateful."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really enjoyed reading this facinating book by Lois Lowry. She is one of my favorite authors. I could not stay with the class so I had to read ahead. This book was very hard to put down. The first time I read it I did not understand some of the things that they were talking about. After the second time, everything was much eaiser to understand.

I kept reading it, hoping it would get good, but it just got worse. And the worst part about it was that at the end, I seriously felt like the book had somehow taken something from me. And I don't mean just my time. Now I'm just trying to get it out of my head. It had the potential to be really interesting, but I just don't think it quite got there. Someone said it was rushed at the end. I agree. It felt like the author just kind of gave up. I was hoping that the novel would redeem itself somehow, but no such luck. I would be horrified if my child were required to read this in school. I don't believe in censorship, but it shouldn't be required reading.

It is very boring and really doesn't have a storyline and it seems too fake to think that it is anything close to the real world that we live in. The characters are always perfect and always become the same people in the inside. The people in this book can not choose their future, which is not fair. The book gets very boring after like the first chapter. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The giver is a thrilling story by Lois Lowery. It tells about a boy named Jonas who lives in a society focused on everyone being the same. Behavior is controlled by drugs, emotions are non-existent and messing up is simply not allowed. Also the citizens have their spouses, children and careers chosen for them.Jonas is given the career of giver. A mysterious job very few know about. When he arrives at his place of work he discovers that the giver is the one person who remembers the outside world. Jonas experiences memories such as color, and snow that make him happy. But he also experiences terrible painful memories like war. He begins to have emotions and wants others to have them too. But will Jonas make it in a world where individuality is literally a crime?This is a thrilling story is not necessarily mystery but more anticipation. It is definately a page turner. Lowery does a great job in bringing the story to life and making the reader want to know more about jonas and his friends. I think this book would be best for twelve and over."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Imagine a world with no poverty, no sickness, no criminal intensions, a utopia you could say a perfect world apart from today's violent society. There are no colours, and no love, the community itself is very strict and organized run by a counsel of elders, who decide everything from who will receive a certain role, and one ordinary boy has to bare the incredible burden of being the Receiver of Memories, the most honored and respected job in the community. Jonas is that boy he had to receive personal lessons from The Giver (the previous receiver of memories) learning the truth about the world, digging into the past and Jonas will change his fate and discovers a dark secret that may change his life forever. I thought that this book was just a must read once I started the book I just couldn't put it down. It's like the book catches you in a trance. But the only bad thing about the book was that I thought the book ended too soon, it just jumps from the most climatic part of the story to the end. Overall, it was amazing this book is a must read and out of 5 I would rate it a 4.5 . Jonathan"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Simply put, this was one of the best futuristic novels I've read. A great story illustrating the value of free thought, free will...freedom in general.Although some of the material and themes may be deep for the pre-teen age group, they can easily grasp the material...especially, (i know this sounds corny) if their parents also read and discuss these themes.In this day, we need more books like the Giver to teach the youth of our country these important libertarian values."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"\\" Jonas... you will be trained to be our next Receiver of Memory. We thank you for your childhood.\\" \\" Jonas\\" it was a whisper at first... Then louder, faster. \\"Jonas, Jonas, Jonas\\".The Giver written by Lois Lowry is set in the future in a place where there is no snow and no sunshine. Life is bland. People have forgotten how to see color. Life is perfect with no sorrow, hunger or war. Unlike our world today in Jonas's world there are no choices. Your role in life is assigned to you. The main character in this book is Jonas who at the age of twelve is assigned the task of becoming the next Receiver of Memory. Unlike the others Jonas is different. He begins to see color and understand the true meaning of pain. Jonas has two friends whose names are Asher and Fiona. Asher puts a bit of laughter into The Giver. \\" I want my smack!\\" he once said instead of snack.The theme of the book is about ignorance. How Jonas's community does not want to look back and instead they place the burden on The Receiver of Memory. The Giver is about Jonas who at his assignment ceremony is given the task of the Receiver of Memory. He is trained by The Giver to receive memories. Even though this book's world is so different and unimaginable to compare to ours it warns you of the dangers that could happen.Although I could go on and on about how The Giver is such a great book I would recommend you read it yourself!P.

It has a fantastic plot line and characters that the reader loves. Not only does this book bring up several things that are problems in society, but it also make you think about your world and what life would be like with or without certain things or things. Jonas and Gabriel are two of the most lovable characters and every reader is sure to fall in love with them. This book is one of those books that can be read over and over again and each time the reader can get something new and different out of it. Lastly, The Giver is also a book that can be read at almost any age and if you read it more than once at different ages you will view the book differently.K.M.GHS"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a wonderful book to read to children and people of all ages. I found it interesting and very mysterious in a way.The book starts off with a boy named Jonas. He lives in a sort of controlled and robotically initialized world.

I believed that they were brain washed, but that is just me.Now Jonas had turned 13 and for some strange reason he was chosen by the \\"Giver\\" himself to have a gift and that gift is to see his past.

Jonas and Giver, the past reciever, have a plan so everyone gets the memories.I enjoyed reading this book a lot. I mostly like the suspense.

All the adults have an assigned job, the kids have assigned playtime, there are no cars and there are no memories of the past. To me, I feel that they live a very boring life.

Although I pictured mostly the cheesy outfits of the \\"Logan's Run\\" movie. The \\"precision of speech\\" and the absolute droning manner of the dialogue continued to wear me down. Things like \\"comfort object\\" \\"requisition of ...\\" \\"bicycle port\\" after being said a few times I tuned them out completely.I could predict what the next words were going to be throughout the story - so consistent was the dialogue.

I read it before my son's 6th grade class completed the book due to a newspaper article I had read 3 years ago.My son has had nightmares ever since.

I bet it would have been a good book if I had had time to realy sit down and read it but I nerver had time to do that so it wasn't able to get to understand..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The title of this book is The Giver by Lois Lowry. I think that this book was written for younger kids because I'm 15 years old and I did not like it at all.This book is about a kid that lives in some society that is made up. The kid is waiting to turn 12 for this special meeting, to go see the giver. So he sees the giver and runs away.I do not read many books unless I am forced to read them for school. And this book is different then the other 2 books I remember reading because, it is a whole different type of book.I did not like this book at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone even if it is there grade level because it puts false thoughts in people's heads. This is what I think and nothing is going to change that."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a very appropriate book for the study of folklore because it shows a fictional way people live their lives. The community is an excellent example on how fictional this story really is. If the reader reads this story they might think this could be a real community somewhere on earth. The book does not have families that live in houses. They have family units that live in dwellings. To me dwellings are considered where animals live. Another thing that is fictional is people asking for release. This day and age you can't just say I want to apply for release because I am too old or I can't handle this job. Also, you can't just kill a twin baby because it is smaller and it might produce problems with the family. In this day and age you have to deal with things as they come to you. The community that Lois Lowry created for the reader is very fascinating and creative. She has an excellent imagination. There were a couple of questions I kept asking myself as I was reading the story. Who would want to become a birthmother and give the baby away after she was producing her own children? Why would they have ceremonies for kids becoming a 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and not a regular birthday? Why would you want a child that has already been named for you? Wouldn't the family units want to name it themselves? Maybe the community has it's reasons for these types of crazy laws they have but if they knew the way the world worked today I am almost sure they would want to live their life a whole different way."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is horrible. I read it in reading class at school. It is not thrilling, to me it is boring, and the plot is just plain shot. It is about a boy named Jonas who was picked at the age of twelve to be the new Giver. Come on now, who's society picks your job at the tender age of twelve? Don't waste your money on this book, but if you're curious about it because of my review, I advise that you check this piece of crap out from the library."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think that this book is SO boring!

CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS' FATHER KILLED A BABY. THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TRASH AND THEN WE GIVE THIS BOOK TO OUR KIDS TO READ FOR A GRADE!

This topic is absolutely inappropriate. Secondly, the author is very proud of her nonconclusive ending.

It is very touching in the fact that it opens your eyes to a community that shows equality for all. On the other hand, it is a rare calling to be the receiver of knowing everything, but it can also be harsh and emotional. It is something to live among others that are blinded to the hueful side of things. This is a wonderful book for people of all ages. I loved it completely."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I like the Giver because it was interesting with the community compared to ours.

The theme makes us realize how lucky we realy are to live in such a nice place. Although I liked it there are some things I wish Lois Lowry had done better. The beginning of the book was kind of boring so it took me 2 times until I read the whole book and the end is too incomplete. I could understand if she gave us atleast a little hint of what happened but nothing was said so I have no idea what happened. The end was kind of disappointing but the book is still really good."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"i think the giver is one of the best books i ever read. i was only 11 when i read it so there were some parts i did not quite understand. i read it again when i was 12 and it made much more sense to me. i think this book is great for young adults and i'm sure i'm going to keep reading it again and again."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"&quot;The Giver&quot; was a very enjoyable book because it has good lessons on how families should spend time together and how children should be taught to be resopsiable. The ceremonies were important events in the Giver. Children one though twelves are recognized at annaual celebrations. At the age of eight children receive a new jacket with small buttons and the first pocket . This teaches children to keep up with their belongons. they also receive volunteer hours. They must be responsiable in order to do volunteer. I think it is a good idea to teach children responsibility."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read a book called The Giver this summer! I think personally that it is an adventurous yet strange and if you like to read I would recommend you reading this book. The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who became the receiver of memory, his community, and the people in it. Jonas meets The Giver and learns some amazing things that he never knew. He learned that there is a such thing as color and everything is not the same color. In the book, at the ceremony he became the new receiver of memory. Every time they turned a year older up until they were twelve they had to go to a ceremony to receive something new. For instance, Lily received her bicycle at a ceremony. He has a sister Lily, and she became a nine at the ceremony. She was so happy! Jonas's dad works at the Nurturing Center. All of the members in the community had to use appropriate languaage all the time. It is good use correct language. In conclusion, the book is great and I think you should read it sometime. Well thats all I have to say for now, Bye-Bye!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was one of those books that made you think. It made me wonder what life would be like for me personally if i lived in Jonas' world. This book is much more than a coming of age story. it is a question about the things that we want. Would they really make us happy, or would we forfeit more important things in their place?"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book in the 5th grade, nearly 10 years ago, and I still remember everything from the book.

You will absolutley enjoy this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Read this book in English class when I was in 7th grade and I really liked it but was deeply disturbed at the same time while reading it.The Giver is about a utopian society that practices \\"sameness\\" and is really dull. It has no color, no diversity, no feelings, no weather, nothing whatsoever out of the ordinary. People who aren't perfect, people who break the law and the old are \\"released\\" from the community to go on someplace else.The main character is selected as \\"The Reciever of Memory\\" and thus starts his difficult journey as \\"The Giver\\".The author of this book, Lois Lowry put a huge amount of thought and philosphy into this book and also won an award for it. I would highly recomend reading this book, and it is part of my Permenant Collection."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I always heard all my friends talking about how amazing this book was, but I had to see for myself. They were right! The Giver was a great book that showed what love and pain are really about. It also shows how scary a world of perfection can be.The Giver is basically about a young Twelve named Jonas who lived in a community of perfection. No one is poor and no one argues, and there is no color. Everyoen gets everything at the exact same time. Whether its a bike at Seven, or a job at Twelve. Everyone has different jobs that are assigned to them. Jonas is assigned to the most important job in his community. He is the new Receiver of Memory. Jonas must deal with all of the things the community has chosen not to live with. Such as: love, pain, color, sunshine, or snow.Jonas must be put through physical and emotional pain to receive all of these horrible things like poverty and illness that their cmmunity does not want.

If pain or fear are felt, it is only very briefly, there is always something to alleviate them.Had he not been chosen as his community's \\"Receiver\\" the main character might have gone on living forever unaware of the sacrifices his people have made in order to gain this painless world. How he comes to terms with what he has been \\"missing\\" and journeys toward a deeper understanding, is the main plot of this book.The ending will make you feel as if you've been dropped off a cliff, but the next two books in this trilogy will tell you what becomes of this character."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"In a near perfect community where color is not seen, pain is not felt, and everyone lives to be the same age; Jonas a Twelve is cosen to be the Receiver of Memory.

First it was a little bit difficult to understand, but later we really enjoyed reading it.

Rather than a 'no thought to it' book, it actually talks about serious issues and topics: you have to stop sometimes for it to actually consume and sink into the harshness of it. The misery is deep and compelling, dragging you deeper and further in the book so you can't let go of it. It was deep and emotional."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"We are German students and we read the book in our English lessons.

Jonas lives in a place unlike any you will find today. Where he lives is a town constructed completely around the idea of similitude. Spouses, friends, children, and careers are chosen for you. Emotions and feelings are controlled by drugs and freedom is not in the vocabulary. But to Jonas and the rest of the town nothing is strange. They go on day by day the way they always have. Until it comes time for Jonas to receive a career.He is chosen to have a very mysterious job. A job few have ever even heard of, the Giver. Jonas comes to discover soon after the giver is the one who holds memories of what the outside world is like. He is taught by a wise man , he receives wonderful memories like snow and color, but he also receives memories like pain, and heartache. But now that Jonas has been exposed to emotion will he be able to make it in a place where individuality is literally a crime?Though this book starts out a little slow it quickly becomes a thriller. Ever page brings an unexpected story twist. Lois lowery masterfully weaves the tale of a confused city and an even more confused teenage boy. I would say this book is best for those eleven and older. This book would be great for anyone who likes mystery and thrill because this book is a mellowed combination of the two.Alyssa Pendleton"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"My teacher assigned us to read The Giver, and I started to Grown.

For those of you out there who haven't read The Giver, run out and buy it. Lois Lowery has strayed from her usual course of writing books for teenage girls, The Anastasia Series is a flicker in the past compared to The Giver. This book tackles a subject that most of us have never consider or read about before, a utopian society or &quot;sameness&quot;. The Giver is about Jonas, one of the few &quot;different&quot; people in his community. In the book a special day is designated for all of the children in the community to have a sort of birthday party. Children who become a Nine will receive a bicycle and Twelve children, like Jonas, will have a job chosen for them. Jonas has been selected as a receiver, a very special assignment in the community. On his first day of training, Jonas receives something from The Giver that few in the society have ever gotten. A memory of a sled ride. At the end of every training session Jonas receives a happy memory, a rainbow, Christmas or a birthday, in addition to all the painful memories he may receive during training, like war, or a broken bone. Jonas and The Giver have been talking about how the conversion to sameness doesn't seem right anymore. They began to plot and this is where the story really begins. In my opinion this book is undoubtedly a good read, but is wanting in the adventure department. I love the new concept of &quot;sameness&quot;, but it reminds me somewhat of Communism, everyone supposedly being of equal respect and opportunity. Although in reality no one can ever be the same. I enjoyed reading about Jonas and discovering what life in his community is like, but the book lacked something. Not until Jonas's escape did I get really into the book and even that wasn't too exciting. I enjoyed it, but definitely thought it could have been better. I hope that other people can get more out of it."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a world that is dark and gray where everyone is prescribed a job in life, and there is no sound, no color, and no music. Jonas, a twelve year old boy, has been chosen to do an important job. He is to become the receiver of memories.The Giver, the man in the community who has received all the memories, is to be his teacher. There were different jobs, such as the caretaker, and the assistant directer of recreation. People receive their job at the annual cemermony. Jonas has been chosen to be the receiver, the most impotant job. In my opinion it's quite great in the middle of the book. The author uses good desciptions.This is one of those science fictions or fantasy books, that I would recommend to readers that are in sixth grade to people that are sixty. I rated the book four stars because of the way the author is saying what she's saying. That is that this world we live in shouldn't ever be like this."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"ok all you guys who look at these reviews: this book is one I truly enjoyed, but that might not be the same case for others. If you like fiction and you have a great imagination, this book should grow on you. It did for me. Jonas's world reflects the world we all want, at least way in the depths of our minds. We all want everyone to be equal, but Lois Lowry shows us what happens (or doesn't happen) because of this sameness. Jonas has friends, parents, teachers, and siblings just like we all do. The book follows Jonas through one of the hardest periods of his life, basically when his real or full and complete life begins. He will make his stand in the world of his people, and grows up by making extremely difficult choices all of us are required to make. Reading this book should be based on what the reader wants, not based on what this or other reviews say. I, like others, just want to make my point known to all of you. Thank you for reading this. Do what you want, don't be pressured or swayed by people other than yourself. Have fun readers!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I have had the opportunity to read this book in the school for class reading matter. At the beginning it was a little boring but then the story becomes very exciting. It describes a imaginary life where there are rules that are never possible in our world.

I'm in my 70's now and this book has been one I've passed down to my children and grandchildren as a must read."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a different variety of dystopian fiction, not action packed and full of violence like much of the current crop. Instead, it's a thoughtful, beautifully written story , almost lyrical.It begins with Jonas and his anticipation of the annual December ceremony, where every birthday for the year is celebrated, another way of assuring \\"sameness\\". But this year is special. As a Twelve, this is the year when, after a childhood of evaluation, he will be assigned his role in life by the community elders.The community is not evil or power mad or abusive of its people. Instead, it provides for all of their needs. Everyone is polite and respectful of each other. But something is missing. We follow Jonas as he gradually discovers the flaws in his world and, along with his mentor, The Giver, realizes the need for change.There'll be a tendency to label this YA only or even middle grade, because the main character is twelve. But I think this is a book for all ages. The story is at times touching, tragic, and melancholy, but always told with an understated simplicity that makes what's happening even more moving.The Giver is an emerging classic. I'm surprised I've missed it until now. For lovers of this genre. It won't be the wild ride of The Hunger Games, but it will stay with your long after you're done."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book was great.

I read the in sixth grade it opened my eyes to a new way to look at the world. This book to me shows that there is no perfect world that something is always missing and we should never let go of our emotions good and bad ones. They are what make us human. This book often comes to my mind when my life is going the way I want it to. It reminds me that that we as humans aren't perfect and we must be careful and grateful for live we live.

Once i read it, i wanted more! this is the best book ever!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The story takes place in a perfect community, but what the main character, Jonas, came to find out was that it wasn't perfect at all. The community wasn't allowed the memories that I would consider so common that I wouldn't even give them a second thought, memories like the distinction between colors and what snow is. I think the story makes you think about what a perfect world could possibly be like, without pain and suffering, but some of the things the people in the community were denied I couldn't imagine living without."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is pretty good, but not one of Lowry's best. It's about Jonas, a boy who lived in a futuristic community and was becoming an adult member of it. As an apprentice to the Receiver of memories, he learned about the individuality, color, and variety of the past. That's when the boy and old man knew that things needed to be changed. It was cool to learn about another world, how Jonas received memories of sunshine and snow. It was sweet how he cared so much for the baby Gabe that his Nurturer father brought home. A blessing and a curse is that the book is so easy to understand. Like some sci-fi novels, it doesn't confuse, but it could have more depth. Why doesn't Jonas reflect more on his new discoveries and feelings? Maybe he and the Giver(as he calls his mentor)could've done more to open the community's eyes, but their decision was a start. The book does serve as a caveat about what any society in the world could mutate into. This is a young adult book, so you wouldn't expect it to compare to Isaac Asimov. At least the story does have a happy ending. It would be interesting if there could be a series about young Jonas' adventures and what happens to him in the future, but speculating is also fun. Definitely read some of Lois Lowry's other works like &quot;A Summer to Die&quot;, but this one is worth checking out too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I think after reading this book I had a whole new look on things. I really liked this book. A person can feel like an outcast all there life but in the end God or a higher power has a plan for you to fallow."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is a MUST read for all young adult readers. It is thought provoking and stimulates conversations. It always amazes me how different people percieve this book and the realization that some events actually happen or could happen in our current society."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Having read &quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry for the first time I liked the book because it was quite easy to understand. But this advantage of the book is also a big fault big fault because there is absolutely no profundity. The only protagonist, named Jonas, who lives in a community of &quot;Sameness&quot; realizes the mistakes of this collective life without any space for individuality and tries to break out from it. This is the material for a short story of 3 pages. But Lowry made a book of 150 pages out of it. That's why the story abounds with repetitions and the longer you read the more boring the book gets. But this is not the biggest failure. The most important weak point is the end. All is said there and when you put the book away there is nothing to think over. Good boks let space to think for your own but in &quot;The Giver&quot; there is nothing at all. So on the whole I would say that &quot;The Giver&quot; is not the right book for people older than 15 years because it's simply to light."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This was the best book i have ever read!

The plot is well written and the characters are well developed."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The special young boy named Jonas lives in a utopian society. Nothing is wrong there, no color, no pain, no joy or happiness, and no sorrow. Nobody does anything wrong, and if they do they are released. I liked the book because it keeps you reading on. It's an attention grabber. I also liked this book because of the rule with the children, the one where, if they say a word wrong or they come in tardy to class they have to apologize. I think that should be put into schools today. I also like how the families share their thoughts and feelings at dinner. They also share their dreams, like the one where Jonas was in the bathing room at the House of the Old, along with Fiona. They were standing by the tub, and Jonas was trying to convince Fiona to get into the tub of water. Saying to his mom, &quot;I wanted her to take off her cloths and get into the tub, I wanted to bath her. I had the sponge in my hand. But she wouldn't. She kept laughing and saying no.&quot; I haven't read too many books but I'm glad I read this one. The Giver is one of those books you just can't put down. I have read The Giver twice and I learned something new about it both times, and if I have a chance and the time to read it again, I would."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I don't totally understand how I feel about this book. Ibelieve that on the outside The Giver is about utopia, the ideal placeto be. On the inside, however, their community is cruel. I do likethe fact that everyone is equal but what about individuality? I mean how can everyone stand to be alike? I guess it's because they don't know any better but only knowing their one way of life isn't fair. They need to be more educated with life and the outside world. This book kind of reminds me of a cult with their rules, and the way they dress, and getting jobs appointed to them without their consent. I guess if I think about it, the book had to be a good one because I actually read it. I never read books EVER but I did enjoy reading this one; it just aggravated me. I can't stand to be like everyone else, well it's not that I can't stand to be like others, I'm just not your average teenage girl. I just don't totally understand how people couldn't realize that they weren't themselves. They were almost as one person. I keep complaining about the book but I did like how the Giver gave Jonas memories and how Jonas could give them to Gabe. I also liked the Ceremonies for the children. However, I didn't like what they referred to as \\"release\\" and I didn't like how their lives were just planned for them. They had no choice in anything. I couldn't live like that! END"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"Lois Lowry does not give us the perfect society, she gives us a society of everyday people who have become morally lazy because they live in a comfort zone. I read this book in junior high and loved it. It's a novel about sacraficing emotions, art, and morality for the comfortable life. The characteristics and crimes of this supposed eutopia are intregueing. Lowry has an impressive imagination and vivid writing style. Her original take on the eutopia topic will be well appreciated by everyone from age 11 upwards."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book is my favorite of any I have ever read. It iscaptivating, sad, happy and descripitive all in one. This is a mustread for everyone. I can compare it to favorites like the Harry Potter series, and &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; by Susanna Kaysen. This book is amazing and something everyone should experience. END"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is a book about a boy named Jonas who lives in an utopian community without pain, crimes, colers and where everything's the same. What I liked most was the relationship between Jonas and the Giver. They helped each other to cope with the memories of wars or pain and joined the memories of snow, sun and happiness. I would like to know what happened to the community after Jonas escaped from it to show the people in it the reality. Our reality. It's interestingt to think about it..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I really think this book was great because it made me thinkthat maybe very far away that there might just be a utopia somewhere.When I was reading the book I could see pictures in my head that what Jonas might look like or what father and mother might of looked like to. The author really explains things like what emotions are felt and even the objects that are held he explains them to the fullest. Like I said that it made me think alote about life without any memories of love hate or even felling of family to me I think that would be really hard to live without. What I really would hat is not picking what kind of job you would have also not having feelings for other people. I really liked the ending but lucky for you your just going to read it yourself. Oh and one more thing have fun."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"It was avery sound book about a utopia and how it would be like. It was mostly in suspence but at times I found it dull and contrary. It semmed to repeate some aspects. It told about the comunity and how it was like. Jonas reiceived all the sads memories that were prior on the burden of the Giver. He was the one that got the job to have all the memories, happy, sad, etc. If you like science fiction you will absolutly love this book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This book was amazing, It really gets u thinking, about the way we live in this world. And if there really is a perfect world. The end of the book is confusing, but u'll understand it. in your own way. I'd recomendthis book for anybody!"},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"just in case anyone is woneringabout the ending, allow me to enligten you to a few things. It is not dumb or stupid. It has been very well thought out. If you are wondering about the sled that Jonas rides on in the end, It is &quot;a memory of his own&quot; because the night of Jonas' first sled ride he dreamed of riding a sled and stopping right before he reached his destination. At the end, he did reach his destination, the only catch is that you don't know wha the destination is. YOu need to use you IMAGINATION. there is such a thing. yOur not supposed to know what it is, the author did not intend for you to know, your supposed to IMAGINE it. But for those of you who don't have any imagination, please feel free to read one of my many theories. when the community was established, it was only done with a few people, they were given a limited amount of space, hence the need for population control. Jonas just left that space and found the real world. Also it might interest you that there are colored lights and singing, and Jonas left right before December, It could very well be Christmas. I would like the think that Jonas will go to expirience the memory that was the givers favorite, the one that taught Jonas about love."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The other reviews here will tell you all that needs to be said about this book. What still needs to be said, however, is that when this book was introduced to me in classroom in 5th grade, most of the concepts were foreign, unclear, and the writing style made it very difficult to understand for the average 10-11 year old. Read it maybe a year or two later to get the full effect, or better yet: read it multiple times.Not to discredit anyone who IS 10-11 years old, or even younger, who appreciates and comprehends the issues and dynamics of this book, but it seems to me that the average 5th grader is more concerned with R.L. Stine these days..."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"This is a classic. Powerful, compelling, original. If you're like me, and love to read, you'll love it. If you're not like me, and hate read, you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"What a great book! I had a very hard time at the first of the book. I did not know how in the world I was going to get through the first four chapters when it is setting everything up. As soon as I hit the fifth chapter I could not put the book down. It was so entriguing. It was all I could do to keep reading to find out what happened to each character. I really feel like everyone that has a chance to read should start today. I have recommended it to many people so far. She is a very intelligent writer."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I thought the book was pretty good it was unique and veryinteresting.The plot was good to because it was perfect for thestory.The characters were so interesting and so not like the people of today.The whole story to me was the making you feel thankful for what you have and if things were always perfect it doesn't mean it would be a good thing.Over all it was an amazingly interestibg book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver is about Jonas, a boy who lives in a seemingly perfect world - with no illness, no crime, and no individuality. When Jonas turns twelve he is assigned a job as the Receiver of Memories for the community.Through his assigned profession he learns there is more to life than sameness. He discovers colors, feel, pain, love, war, and much more. Soon Jonas becomes discontent with his simple life in his simple community and goes on a quest looking for a world that can provide more.The Giver captures the pricelessness of individuality and the cost that some societies have to pay to be different. This is one of the few remarkable Newberies that EVERYONE should read. I strongly recommend this incredible book."},{"Title":"The Giver","review":"I read &quot;The Giver&quot; with my class in English lessons. The book handels about a young boy who lives in a community in which no color and no feelings exist. Although this was my first English book, I've ever read, I've had some difficulties at the beginning, but in the end, I've understood almost everything. A big complimente to the author for her open ending. So everybody can imagine his or her own ending and Jonas'life in future. That's the very interesting thing of the book."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:J},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],L={key:0},W={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,a){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",j,[(e(!0),t(w,null,f(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-487abe3a"]]),M=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/38.md","filePath":"library/38.md"}'),E={name:"library/38.md"},C=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{M as __pageData,C as default};
