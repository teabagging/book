He takes it in, not suspecting the dramatic consequences of this decision. What does one do with a troll in the city? As the troll s presence influences Angel s life in ways he could never have predicted, it becomes clear that the creature is the familiar of man s most forbidden feelings. A novel of sparkling originality, Troll is a wry, beguiling story of nature and man s relationship to wild things, and of the dark power of the wildness in ourselves.

They have come to witness the Communion host that suddenly manifested a dark stain of blood during a Mass in this very room. Most of all, they have come to be near Audrey, the teenage girl who lies in a bedroom at the other end of the house. Unable to move or speak after a near-drowning accident when she was three years old, Audrey is believed by many to be the source of the miracles in her home. Her family reports that she suffers the stigmata- the bloody suffering of Christ-- every Lenten season. Pilgrims to the Santo home and to Audrey's annual public \\"outings\\" claim to have been healed of cancer and other diseases. Lying in her little room, she is surrounded by medical equipment, including a respirator that keeps her alive, round-the-clock care-- and the prayers of her family and countless thousands who believe she has been touched by God. Audrey Santo, the silent soul at the center of one of America's most famous religious pilgrimage sites, touches the hearts of everyone who hears her story. The doctors who treat her are bewildered by her survival. And her mother, a devout Catholic who has never given up hope that Audrey will fully awaken one day, believes Audrey is \\"a statement of life in our culture of death.\\" Is Audrey a messenger of God, part of a divine plan to strengthen people's faith? Or is she a severely disabled girl whose devout, loving family has drawn a miraculous circle of belief around her? What are the nonreligious explanations for the strange phenomena occurring in the Santo home? What is the Catholic Church's view, as announced in the first official report of its ongoing investigation? Is Audrey a \\"victim soul,\\" taking on the illness and suffering of others? Did she receive this sacred call from Mary when her mother took her to the apparition room at Medjugorje? These questions and more are explored in Antonia Felix's Silent Soul, a thoughtful, fascinating journey into one of the world's most compelling modern mysteries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rHqNElsUX8IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Gun Salute (Aubrey-Maturin)","description":"\\"In length the series is unique; in quality and there is not a weak link in the chain it cannot but be ranked with the best of twentieth century historical novels.\\" T.

The groups undertake income-generating activities [...]. These activities are performed on a part-time basis. The women worrk in their small enterprise activities during \\"chisi\\", the day of the week when one traditionally is not allowed to work in the fields. The primary source of income for all the women is semi-subistence farming. [...] Since most of the harvest is retained to feed the familly, only a small surplus is left to sell. [...] Research showed, however, that often women were contributing more mone to their small businesses than they were earning from them. In the light of these meagre results, the project \\"Action to Assist Rural Women\\" was designed [...]. Its developmenal objectives are : [1] to improve the organizational, managerial and economic performance of women's groups in the rural areas ; and [2] to increase the participation of women in the socio-economic development process. To fulfil these objectives, the project staff developed a two-pronged approach : training for both the women's groups and the extension workers ; and the implementation of a credit scheme with a local bank. Why this manual ? [The authors] would like to share [their] experiences of the extensino worker training programme with others in the small enterprise development field because [they] found [their] approach useful and effective.

However, during the course of the conflict, the embryonic Air Force, dedicated to the creation of reconnaissance and bombing missions, evolved like wildfire to the point that by the Armistice of 11 November 1918, French military aviation had become one of the world's most powerful as a result of the construction of 10,000 aircraft spread throughout nearly 300 squadrons. Having became the first nation equipped with an air force, the French aviation industry in its infancy before the war, had been able to produce in four years 50,000 aircraft, may of which would go on to support a number of her allies, including Britain, Russia and especially the United States.

This theory states that ethnic groups resemble large families whose members are prone to cooperate due to 'kin altruism'. Recent empirical findings in economics and political science offer confirmatory evidence.

In this book, Yakov Pesin introduces a new area of research that has recently appeared in the interface between dimension theory and the theory of dynamical systems. Focusing on invariant fractals and their influence on stochastic properties of systems, Pesin provides a comprehensive and systematic treatment of modern dimension theory in dynamical systems, summarizes the current state of research, and describes the most important accomplishments of this field.

The Britons had resisted the amphibious invasion from the moment his forces landed, but he was able to push forward. In a large winter battle, the Britons' large army attacked the invaders but was eventually routed, and the conqueror was able to set up a new kingdom. Over 1,100 years before William the Conqueror became the King of England after the Battle of Hastings, Julius Caesar came, saw, and conquered part of \\"Britannia,\\" setting up a Roman province with a puppet king in 54 BCE. In the new province, the Romans eventually constructed a military outpost overlooking a bridge across the River Thames. The new outpost was named Londinium, and it covered just over two dozen acres. For most of the past 1,000 years, London has been the most dominant city in the world, ruling over so much land that it was said the Sun never set on the British Empire. With the possible exception of Rome, no city has ever been more important or influential than London in human history. Thus, it was only fitting that it was the Romans who established London as a prominent city. Londinium was initially little more than a small military outpost near the northern boundary of the Roman province of Britannia, but its access to the River Thames and the North Sea made it a valuable location for a port. During the middle of the 1st century CE, the Romans conducted another invasion of the British Isles, after which Londinium began to grow rapidly. As the Romans stationed legions there to defend against the Britons, Londinium became a thriving international port, allowing trade with Rome and other cities across the empire. By the 2nd century CE, Londinium was a large Roman city, with tens of thousands of inhabitants using villas, palaces, a forum, temples, and baths. The Roman governor ruled from the city in a basilica that served as the seat of government. What was once a 30 acre outpost now spanned 300 acres and was home to nearly 15,000 people, including Roman soldiers, officials and foreign merchants. The Romans also built heavy defenses for the city, constructing several forts and the massive London Wall, parts of which are still scattered across the city today. Ancient Roman remains continue to dot London's landscape today, reminding everyone that almost a millennium before it became the home of royalty, London was already a center of power. The Romans were master builders, and much of what they built has stood the test of time. Throughout their vast empire they have left grand structures, from the Forum and Pantheon in Rome to the theatres and hippodromes of North Africa and the triumphal gates in Anatolia and France. Wherever they went, the Romans built imposing structures to show their power and ability, and one of their most impressive constructions was built on the northernmost fringe of the empire. Shortly after the emperor Hadrian came to power in the early 2nd century CE, he decided to seal off Scotland from Roman Britain with an ambitious wall stretching from sea to sea. To accomplish this, the wall had to be built from the mouth of the River Tyne - where Newcastle stands today - 80 Roman miles (76 miles or 122 kilometers) west to Bowness-on-Solway. The sheer scale of the job still impresses people today, and Hadrian's Wall has the advantage of being systematically studied and partially restored.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6tCcswEACAAJ&dq=Roman+Britain:+Outpost+of+the+Empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Blueprints for Gains in Stocks & Grains and One-Way Formula for Trading in Stocks & Commodities (Traders' Masterclass)","description":"Easy to use, and adopted by many successful traders over the years, William Dunnigan's One-Way Formula for Trading in Stocks and Commodities is a robust and reliable mechanical approach to buy/sell decision-making in speculative markets.

Stock market crashes, bread lines, bank runs, and wild currency speculation were worldwide phenomena--all occurring with war looming in the background. This period has provided economists with a marvelous laboratory for studying the links between economic policies and institutions and economic performance. Here, Ben Bernanke has gathered together his essays on why the Great Depression was so devastating. This broad view shows us that while the Great Depression was an unparalleled disaster, some economies pulled up faster than others, and some made an opportunity out of it. By comparing and contrasting the economic strategies and statistics of the world's nations as they struggled to survive economically, the fundamental lessons of macroeconomics stand out in bold relief against a background of immense human suffering. The essays in this volume present a uniquely coherent view of the economic causes and worldwide propagation of the depression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tGiktQc6yWMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion in the News: Faith and Journalism in American Public Discourse","description":"Stewart M Hoover offers a cultural-historical analysis of the rise of religious stories in the media - the Islamic Revolution in Iran, televangelism and its scandals, the political agenda of the Evangelical New Right, to name but a few.

By and large, black candidates have rarely been successful in statewide or national elections. This has been attributed to several factors: limited resources available to African American candidates, or identifi cation with a black liberationist ideological thrust. Other factors have been a relatively small and spatially concentrated primary support base of black voters, and the persistent resistance of many white voters to support black candidates. For these reasons, the possibility of black candidates winning elections to national offi ce was presumably just a dream. Conventional wisdom conceded a virtual cap on both the possible number of black elected officials and the level of elective offi ce to which they could ascend. But objective political analysis has not always made sufficient allowances for the more universal phenomenon of individual political ambitions. Th e contributors to this volume explore the ways ambitious individuals identifi ed and seized upon strategies that are expanding the boundaries of African American electoral politics. This volume is anchored by a symposium that focuses on new possibiities in African American politics. Both the electoral contests of 2006 and the Barack Obama presidential campaign represent an emergent dynamic in American electoral politics. Analysts are beginning to agree that the contours of social change now make the electoral successes of black candidates who are perceived as ideologically and culturally mainstream increasingly likely. The debate captured in this volume will likely inspire further scholarly inquiry into the changing nature and dimensions of the larger dynamic of race in American politics and the subsequent changing political fortunes of African American candidates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4GRQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Architectural Engineering, Single","description":"A where-would-you-be-without-it handbook covering every single important step in building design and construction, now updated to include key changes in design and construction practices.

You need not live with a dark or dank cabin, insufficient space for stowage or chartwork, or sheet winches, halyards, and reefing arrangements so inconvenient that you often find yourself motoring when you'd rather be sailing. Somewhere beneath your boat's crazed gelcoat, untamed rig, patchwork electrical system, and stubborn steering lies the boat of your dreams. This book will enable you to envision that boat in detail--how its deck hardware is laid out, what the rig looks like, where its hull and decks are reinforced, and how its cabin arrangements are altered to fit your needs. And the book will help you translate that vision into reality by showing you what work should be done and in what order, which projects you can do yourself and which you should probably hire out, and how much time or money might be involved. Along the way, Dan Spurr gives step-by-step instructions, supported by Bruce Bingham's beautifully clear drawings, for many useful projects any do-it-yourselfer can tackle, including autopilot installation, deck hardware modifications, and electrical system upgrades. The gear, equipment, design, and construction standards cited in this book--often in very specific detail with brand-name recommendations--are as useful for evaluating a new boat as they are for buying a used boat or improving the boat you already own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jR5DPwAACAAJ&dq=Upgrading+the+Cruising+Sailboat+:+Spurr%27s+Boatbook,+2nd+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of shiatsu: Fundamental applications in acupressure massage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I6nCtAEACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+shiatsu:+Fundamental+applications+in+acupressure+massage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love's Tender Fury","description":"This classic New York Timesbestselling historical romance tells the enthralling, passionate story of a young English woman who is wrongly convicted of a crime and auctioned off to the highest bidder in the American colonies Born out of wedlock to a London barmaid, Marietta Danver yearns to live life to its fullest despite her humble origins.

In the American Grain is, as William Carlos Williams said,  a study to try to find out for myself what the land of my more or less accidental birth might signify.  Although Williams wrote poetry and prose and was a doctor he was not a historian. In this book, he applies a fresh, lyrical perspective to moments in America s past. Beginning with the bloody Erik the Red, discoverer of Greenland and father of Leif Erikson, Williams revisits episodes from history like the destruction of Tenochtitlan, the Mayflower ship s journey to America, and the founding of Quebec, as well as the expeditions of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, Juan Ponce de Le n, Hernando de Soto, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Samuel de Champlain. He then moves along to events like the Salem witch trials, Daniel Boone s discovery of Kentucky, and Aaron Burr s romance with Jacataqua. He also discusses important figures such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Edgar Allan Poe, and Abraham Lincoln. By deconstructing America s history and rebuilding it with a poet s voice, Williams created  a fundamental book, essential if one proposes to come to terms with American literature  (The Times Literary Supplement).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S68REAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farms Trees and Farmers: Responses to Agricultural Intensification","description":"This title aims to provide introductory and concluding surveys of the subject of farms, trees and farmers.

It features literary phenomena with influence and themes so great that, after their publication, they changed literature forever. From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the striking personal narrative of Harriet Jacobs in Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our history through the words of the exceptional few. Jack London s The Call of the Wild and White Fang are both adventure stories featuring animal protagonists a sled dog named Buck and the appropriately named White Fang. Partially told from the perspective of the dogs, these stories gave London the opportunity to explore and predict how animals perceive our world. Buck was Judge Miller s pet and lived happily in Santa Clara Valley, California. Until one day, when he s kidnapped by the gardener s assistant and sold to traders. Eventually he ends up in the Klondike region of Canada, where he is trained to become a sled dog. After he witnesses a fellow sled dog killed by a pack of huskies, Buck starts to shed his domesticated habits and embrace his primordial instincts in order to survive. White Fang, in a similar vein, tells the tale of another canine a young gray wolf cub who is the strongest of his litter. As he grows, White Fang begins to understand the nature of the wilderness that it is survival of the fittest:  The aim of life was meat. Life itself was meat. Life lived on life. There were the eaters and the eaten. The law was: EAT OR BE EATEN.  After wandering into an Indian camp, losing his mother, being severely beaten, and being forced into dog-fighting, his life is forever changed as he struggles to find his place in the animal kingdom. In these classic novels, London explores the remarkable relationship between man and beast.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boundaries in Dating Leader's Guide","description":"All the immense value of the book is available in this participant's guide for groups of any size.

Not only can superheroes assist in clinical work with children, but Rubin demonstrates how they can facilitate growth and change with teen and adults. Early childhood memories of how we felt pretending to have the power to save the world or our families in the face of impending danger still resonate in our adult lives, making the use of superheroes attractive as well, to the creative counselor. In presenting case studies and wisdom gleaned from practicing therapists' experience, Lawrence Rubin shows how it is possible to uncover children's secret identities, assist treatment of adolescents with sexual behavior problems, and inspire the journey of individuation for gay and lesbian clients, all by paying attention to our intrinsic social need for superhero fantasy and play.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZNlDGwGfJYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lowlight Photography (Better Picture Guides)","description":"Starting with a technical discussion and then tackling a wide range of themes and lighting situations, this book presents specific guidelines for shooting low-light landscapes, portraits, buildings, carnivals, and more. 200 color, 80 b&w illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KhTCxT2cjhAC&dq=Lowlight+Photography+(Better+Picture+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowing Your Trees.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tKh_zQEACAAJ&dq=Knowing+Your+Trees.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"25 Natural Ways To Lower Blood Pressure","description":"Lower blood pressure--without drugs Your high blood pressure can lead to stroke, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and kidney failure.

X-Urbanism raises questions about the form of the city by examining various configurations of urban space, analyzing them in ways that blur the traditional opposition between figure and ground. This title serves as a visual lexicon of the formal properties of American urbanism-fabric, void, grid, wall-that reveal the hidden structure of the cities New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, New Haven, Des Moines, and Atlantic City. In the process, X-Urbanism confounds our expectations: it shows us the subtle order of chaotic Los Angeles, and the disruptions of New York's rigorous grid. X-Urbanism carefully reproduces Gandelsonas's drawings, which range from crisp, elegant pen-and-ink to colorful computer renderings and are as beautiful as they are instructive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-k3qRVZIKAC&dq=X-Urbanism:+Architecture+and+the+American+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nobody listens to Andrew (A Follett beginning-to-read book)","description":"When his family and neighbor finally get around to listening to Andrew, they find he really does have something important to say.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sUjhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nobody+listens+to+Andrew+(A+Follett+beginning-to-read+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outsourcing: How to Make Vendors Work for Your Shareholders","description":"Outsourcing promises tantalizing benefits: cost savings, improved responsibilities & fewer distractions.

You'll get VERY good at this. After all, we've been teaching people just like you for over 20 years. \\"How to Draw Manga: Basics and Beyond!\\" is the latest in Manga University's lineup of best-selling instructional books. The book features more than 1,000 illustrations drawn by Japanese manga artists whose work has appeared in leading publications, including Shonen Sunday and Young Jump. You will learn how to draw like a professional because your teachers are professionals. We've divided the book into four easy-to-follow chapters that will have you drawing original characters from head to toe in no time at all: Heads First! We begin at the top, with a chapter on how to draw heads. After all, heads are the first thing most people notice, in both art and out in the real world. And in art, just like in the real world, you want to make sure your characters make a vivid first impression ... whether they're completely human, or totally out-of-this-world. Let's Make Faces! The expression the eyes are the window to the soul is particularly true when it comes to manga. You can tell a lot about a character's personality by peering into their eyes. In this chapter, we explain the basics of drawing eyes. But we don't stop there. We also cover noses, mouths, ears, and hair. All About Bodies! Once we've covered faces, we move on to teaching you how to draw bodies. We go over the differences between male and female body proportions, count heads to determine the heights of our characters, and learn how to draw hands, arms, feet, and legs. Strike a Pose! Our book's final chapter is all about making a physical statement. We show characters standing tall, sitting down, throwing punches, giving hugs, and more. Because even beautifully drawn characters look boring if they're frozen stiff. The book also includes a section on manga tools. Plus, you'll get to know the artists who contributed to the book through exclusive interviews in which they talk about their favorite manga and anime series, hobbies, how they work, and more!\\"--Amazon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nTE0zgEACAAJ&dq=How+To+Draw+Manga&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychological Development of Children (Psychology)","description":"Piaget's influence on psychology has been profound.

The final chapter of Buridan's Sophismata deals with problems about self-reference, and in particular with the semantic paradoxes. He offers his own distinctive solution to the well-known 'Liar Paradox' and introduces a number of other paradoxes that will be unfamiliar to most logicians. Buridan also moves on from these problems to more general questions about the nature of propositions, the criteria of their truth and falsity and the concepts of validity and knowledge. This edition of that chapter is intended to make Buridan's ideas and arguments accessible to a wider range of readers. The volume should interest many philosophers, linguists and logicians, who are increasingly finding in medieval work striking anticipations of their own concerns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rxemQAAACAAJ&dq=John+Buridan+on+Self-Reference:+Chapter+Eight+of+Buridan%27s+%27Sophismata%27,+with+a+Translation,+an+Introduction,+and+a+Philosophical+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan Medical USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills (Kaplan USMLE)","description":"Master the challenging cases.

A marvel of her time, Reliance's mast towered 196 feet above the water, with sails stretching 202 feet from the bowsprit to the boom's end. Many said Reliance, carrying more sail than any boat before or since, was simply too dangerous to sail, but the stakes were awesome: The America's Cup in 1903 was more than a gentleman's game; it was an all-or-nothing contest between two great rivals, rivals, Britain and America, with all the intensity of the later race into space. Behind Reliance was a gallery of American greats. There was Nathaniel Herreshoff, perhaps our greatest yacht designer, also known as the Wizard of Bristol. And there were the robber barons who made America, men like J. P. Morgan and John Rockefeller. Such men spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to win the America's Cup. On the other side of the Atlantic, Thomas Lipton, scrappy founder of the Lipton tea and grocery empire, put his personal fortune behind the construction of an equally bold challenger, his Shamrock. From conception to construction, through hair-raising sea trials--two men died in separate incidents testing the yachts--to the grand finale of a race like no other, author Christopher Pastore brings to life this most beautiful and dangerous vessel, as well as the hearts it won and the hearts it broke. It is simply one of the most exciting sea tales ever told.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8CNAvgAACAAJ&dq=Temple+to+the+Wind:+The+Story+of+America%27s+Greatest+Naval+Architect+and+His+Masterpiece,+Reliance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Earth Science","description":"For all introductory Earth Science courses.

There are a large range of other applications under development or being proposed. The - derlying architectures share features such as decentralizaton, sharing of end system resources, autonomy, virtualization, and self-organization. These features constitute the P2P paradigm. This handbook broadly addresses a large cross-section of c- rent research and state-of-the-art reports on the nature of this paradigm from a large number of experts in the ?eld. Several trends in information and network technology such as increased perf- mance and deployment of broadband networking, wireless networking, and mobile devices are synergistic with and reinforcing the capabilities of the P2P paradigm. There is general expectation in the technical community that P2P networking will continue to be an important tool for networked applications and impact the evo- tion of the Internet. A large amount of research activity has resulted in a relatively short time, and a growing community of researchers has developed. The Handbook of Peer-to-Peer Networking is dedicated to discussions on P2P networks and their applications. This is a comprehensive book on P2P computing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nXk_AAAAQBAJ&dq=Peer-To-Peer+Computing+(P2P+2001)+1st+International+Conference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Laugh's on Me","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NRdjewAACAAJ&dq=The+Laugh%27s+on+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Banjo-Tooie: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_vZeAgAACAAJ&dq=Banjo-Tooie:+Prima%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daddy's Apprentice: Incest, Corruption, and Betrayal: A Survivor's Story","description":"Incest. Abandonment. Crime. Betrayal . . . the integral elements of Sandy Wilson's life. Born of incest to a brother and sister, then abandoned to the care of her grandparents, Sandy learned to forage in dumpsters for food, to dupe government caregivers, and to defraud insurance companies. When she was six-years-old, her father returned from prison. Within hours, he had molested her and reestablished himself as the head of the family. Sandy became his criminal accomplice and his sexual partner. She accompanied him on countless burglaries throughout the Pacific Northwest. Through the years, she knew that her father ducked FBI raids, murdered two teen-age hitchhikers, sweet-talked prostitutes into his bed while molesting their daughters, and committed crimes with other accomplices. Somehow, he avoided capture or prosecution. After a decade of his brutal enslavement and her grandmother's silent complicity, Sandy emancipated in the only way she knew - with cunning and violence. Determination. Hope. Self-preservation . . . the enduring elements of Sandy Wilson's survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pOv0FS3DRlsC&dq=Daddy%27s+Apprentice:+Incest,+Corruption,+and+Betrayal:+A+Survivor%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men of Music","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pqTzmgEACAAJ&dq=Men+of+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Future of the Disabled in Liberal Society: An Ethical Analysis (Revisions)","description":"The Future of the Disabled in Liberal Society questions developments in human genetic research from the perspective of persons with mental disabilities and their families. Hans S. Reinders argues that when we use terms such as \\"disease\\" and \\"defect\\" to describe conditions that genetic engineering might well eliminate, we may also be assuming that disabled lives are deplorable and horrific. Reinders points out that the possibility of preventing disabled lives is at odds with our commitment to the full inclusion of disabled citizens in society. The tension between these different perspectives is of concern to all of us as genetic testing procedures proliferate. Reinders warns that preventative uses of human genetics might even become a threat to the social security and welfare benefits that help support disabled persons and their families. Reinders also argues that this conflict cannot be resolved or controlled on the level of public morality. Because a liberal society makes a commitment to individual freedom and choice, its members can consider the diagnostic and therapeutic uses of human genetics as options available to individual citizens. A liberal society will defend reproductive freedom as a matter of principle. Citizens may select their offspring in accord with their own personal values. Reinders concludes that the future of the mentally disabled in liberal society will depend on the strength of our moral convictions about the value of human life, rather than on the protective force of liberal morality. One of the most important aspects of this book is Reinder's attention to parents who have come to see the task of raising a disabled child as an enriching experience. These are people who change their conceptions of success and control and, therefore, their conceptions of themselves. They come to value their disabled children for what they have to give. Even though disabled children and disabled adults present parents and society with real challenges, the rewards are just as real. This powerful critique of contemporary bioethics is sure to become required reading for those interested in human development, special education, ethics, philosophy, and theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YgRXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Future+of+the+Disabled+in+Liberal+Society:+An+Ethical+Analysis+(Revisions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"University of South Florida: Off the Record (College Prowler)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OcMMczL3OJQC&dq=University+of+South+Florida:+Off+the+Record+(College+Prowler)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If All the World Were a Blackbird: Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JKSxAAAAIAAJ&dq=If+All+the+World+Were+a+Blackbird:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slow Death (High Risk Books)","description":"A gang of socially ambitious skinheads runs riot through the London art world, plotting the rebirth and violent demise of an elusive avant-garde art movement.

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy Behind the Door","description":"Eclectic and impassioned, a collection that affirms the power of the written word.'

It s one of the great disadvantages of diversity. One such  warfare  has been hidden from all of us despite the fact that we had to face it almost daily in our formative years. The battleground for this most common cultural conflict is where we all spent at least 40% of our school-years, preparing not just for unforeseen pandemics, such as we re caught up in now, nor also for dealing with the economic, ecological, and political divisions that currently confront all arenas of American society. Surprisingly it s our educational system, and especially the classroom, where the frontlines of cultural  warfare  may have kept us constantly struggling for so long. Unwittingly and unwillingly drafted into these social and cultural battles, we ve been trained to continue this perennial struggle between academic and popular sub-cultures in our schools. The Trojan Horse in the Tribal Classroom reveals the situational factors and functions that have caused education to become an  embattled institution and teaching an embattled profession.  Most importantly it proposes social and cultural solutions to these problems that promise real institution-wide improvement and a completely reconstructed, truly academic classroom culture. One reading of this book will totally revise one s vision of American education and our memories of thousands of hours of classroom life. -- Dr. Regina Peter, Executive Director NEWMARK Education","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MxxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Karl Jaspers: Philosophy As Faith","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9GEOAAAAIAAJ&dq=Karl+Jaspers:+Philosophy+As+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching Maggie: Letters on Life, Writing, and the Virtues of Solid Food","description":"A collection of letters written for the author's goddaughter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2OShC1-gqfsC&dq=Teaching+Maggie:+Letters+on+Life,+Writing,+and+the+Virtues+of+Solid+Food&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thylacine Conspiracy","description":"The Dutchman turned his mind to his mission--find a rare tiger in the wilds of Thailand.

During the early evening of June 15, a battalion of hardened North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong -- outnumbering the Americans 25-to-1 -- threw everything they had at the sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen for the rest of that terror-filled night.

H. Spurgeon is still remembered as being the most popular preacher of the Victorian era, it has generally been forgotten that the influence he exercised on fellow ministers and theological students was possibly an even greater factor in his life than his own personal ministry. That he organized a college, supervised the training of some 845 students, presided at an annual conference of ministers, and regarded all this as his 'life's labour and delight' are facts that are little known today. Spurgeon's Lectures to my Students, contain the substance of Spurgeon's regular Friday afternoon addresses to the college students. This new complete and unabridged Banner edition, which has been newly typeset, contains all the lectures in the original first and second series, including The Minister's Self-Watch, The Preacher's Private Prayer, The Minister's Fainting Fits, The Holy Spirit in Connection with our Ministry, The Need of Decision for the Truth, and On Conversion as our Aim. Also included is a third series of lectures, originally published as The Art of Illustration, which focuses on the nature, use, and sources of illustrations and anecdotes in preaching. To make this new edition as complete as possible, the publishers have also included Spurgeon's Commenting & Commentaries, which contains two further lectures and a fascinating and often humorously annotated catalogue of commentaries. This catalogue, compiled by Spurgeon after a review of some three to four thousand volumes, is anything but dull: calculated to produce enthusiasts for books, it also opens up a new world by its well-placed signposts to the riches of the past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RfdsRAAACAAJ&dq=Lectures+to+my+students&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recording and Producing in the Home Studio: A Complete Guide","description":"(Berklee Methods).

But courting a woman like Claudia will not be an easy undertaking for a handsome cynic who has always believed true love is not for him -- especially after they succumb to an indiscretion that could lead two hearts to ruin ... of a most delicious variety.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mC3gcvubi8gC&dq=Courting+Claudia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spielman's Original Scroll Saw Patterns","description":"Shows how to use a scroll saw, and provides hundreds of patterns, including designs for puzzles, mobiles, fretted objects and Christmas ornaments","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2wnmOAAACAAJ&dq=Spielman%27s+Original+Scroll+Saw+Patterns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Wolverine: v. 1","description":"This work provides an extensive guide for students, fans, and collectors of Marvel Comics.

As pugilism was an illegal activity, brawling workers from the iron ore docks surreptitiously met on \\"Whiskey Island\\" to settle disputes. They would be followed by crowds of spectators who cheered them on and often ended up fleeing from the sheriff. Boxing grew in popularity and soon became a legitimate sport that brought packed houses to such local venues as Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the Cleveland Arena, and the Public Auditorium. Thousands of fans from across the country would come to Cleveland to attend the marquee bouts of many of the city and the nation's most celebrated fighters. Cleveland's Greatest Fighters of All Time follows the amazing careers of the city's most popular and successful boxers, highlighted by more than 100 rarely-seen images. From the speedy and resilient Johnny Kilbane, Cleveland's first great champion, to the heroic Jimmy Bivins, a true champion in and out of the ring, these stories of triumph and heartbreak are to be enjoyed by boxing fans of all eras. Much of the action inside is described in such a way as to bring the reader ringside.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oXRneQFchV0C&dq=Cleveland%27s+greatest+fighters+of+all+time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For the First Time","description":"Explores the Gospel of Mark with emphasis on why Mark tells the story the way he does.

Darren Phillips is a presidential aide, a Harvard graduate, a decorated Desert Storm veteran, and now a husband. Kate North, his new wife, is a world-class adventure racer whom he met on an Eco-Challenge endurance team. When an out-of-bounds kayaking excursion on the couple's honeymoon in Mexico lands them on the private beach of a violent drug dealer, their exotic getaway suddenly turns deadly. And Darren and Kate are, staggeringly, fugitives. They escape to the local police station -- only to enter into a bullet-ridden confrontation with the dealer's federale brother. Broadcasting the carnage and devastation left in the couples' wake, the Mexican government declares them sex-crazed drug couriers and assassins, and the State Department, to avoid an international incident, tags them as murder suspects. But even as they flee, Darren manages to pass a message to his former roommate, teammate, and disgraced Marine corpsman, Gavin Kelly (hero of Sharkman Six, West's critically acclaimed first novel). The couple's only hope for survival hinges on Kelly's ability to interpret their message and to rendezvous with them in Veracruz. The couple flees desperately on foot across the badlands of the Sierra Madre, unwittingly carrying a piece of the drug cartel's encrypted communication code with them. As they race toward Veracruz, they are pursued by corrupt Mexican police, federales, and bloodhounds. More terrifying, they are pursued by a man known as El Monstruo Carnicero -- \\"The Monster Butcher\\" -- a serial killer dispatched from the bloody desert of Juarez by the leader of the Mexican drug cartel. In all their military training, in all their endurance challenges, Darren and Kate have never before been tested as they are now, running for their lives across the wild belly of Mexico.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUBY-WC0D1MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry St. John, gentleman: Of \\"Flower of Hundreds,\\" in the county of Prince George, Virginia.

France was the source of works on notation, choreography, and repertoire that dominated European dance practice until the 1780s. While these French inventions were welcomed and used in Germany, German dance writers responded by producing an important body of work on dance theory. This book examines consequences in Germany of this asymmetrical confrontation of dance perspectives. Between 1703 and 1717 in Germany, a coherent theory of dance was postulated that called itself dance theory, comprehended why it was a theory, and clearly, rationally distinguished itself from practice. This flowering of dance-theoretical writing was contemporaneous with the appearance of Beauchamps-Feuillet notation in the Chor graphie of Raoul Auger Feuillet (Paris, 1700, 1701). Beauchamps-Feuillet notation was the ideal written representation of the dance style known as la belle danse and practiced in both the ballroom and the theater. Its publication enabled the spread of belle danse to the French provinces and internationally. This spread encouraged the publication of new practical works (manuals, choreographies, recueils) on how to make steps and how to dance current dances, as well as of new dance treatises, in different languages. The Rechtschaffener Tantzmeister, by Gottfried Taubert (Leipzig, 1717), includes a translated edition of Feuillet s Chor graphie. Theory and Practice in Eighteenth-Century Dance addresses how Taubert and his contemporary German authors of dance treatises (Samuel Rudolph Behr, Johann Pasch, Louis Bonin) became familiar with Beauchamps-Feuillet notation and acknowledged the Chor graphie in their own work, and how Taubert s translation of the Chor graphie spread its influence northward and eastward in Europe. This book also examines the personal and literary interrelationships between the German writers on dance between 1703 and 1717 and their invention of a theoria of dance as a counterbalance to dance praxis, comparing their dance-theoretical ideas with those of John Weaver in England, and assimilating them all in a cohesive and inclusive description of dance theory in Europe by 1721.

In this first volume, Nick Jenkins is introduced to the ebbs and flows of life at boarding school in the 1920s, spent in the company of his friends: Peter Templer, Charles Stringham, and Kenneth Widmerpool. Though their days are filled with visits from relatives and boyish pranks, usually at the expense of their housemaster Le Bas, a disastrous trip in Templer s car threatens their new friendship. As the school year comes to a close, the young men are faced with the prospects of adulthood, and with finding their place in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BLbdMAhVVpoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes from Hampstead: The Writer's Notes: 1954-1971","description":"Notes from Hampstead is a map of the late Nobel laureate's thinking, a triumphant compendium of aphoristic, enigmatic, and expository writings covering a characteristically diverse range of subjects. \\"Canetti is a meticulous writer, and in reading his notes, one can easily see him hovering over a just formed sentence, pencil in hand, wondering whether to cut or to add or to leave well enough alone.\\" - Publishers Weekly","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xEdOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology and Folk Culture","description":"This dictionary makes available for the first time a broad range of knowledge unknown or little-known to the western world, and indeed much information that is now lost to present-day Albanians.

The study proposes a new model of comparatism within the field of visual studies, mirroring and complementing Spero's dialogic manner of working. Basing her analyses on extensive research and multiple face-to-face interviews with the artist, Joanna Walker examines how a selection of the artists and art forms Spero cited offer significant points of comparison with her work. Walker presents Spero's encounters with the art of Ana Mendieta; with the poetry of the American poet H.D.; with the dance of Isadora Duncan; and, turning the lens back on Spero as subject, with the portraits of the artist by Abe Frajndlich. Also included are transcripts of Walker's interviews with the artist, and a listing of the books contained in Spero's personal library which informed her practice. Not only does this book cast well-deserved light on an artist who spent most of her career on the margins of the mainstream - it reverses genealogies and revises the traditional remit of the art historical monograph through both its structure and content.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dCYxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Women+Artists+at+the+Millennium+(October+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Suffering: Woman As Victim","description":"Describes the symptoms of masochism, explains why its victims are predominantly women, and gives advice on leading a more assertive and fulfilling life","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k6844Ih7QXoC&dq=Sweet+Suffering:+Woman+As+Victim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mercycle","description":"A discreet advertisement brings a group of apparently disparate individuals together to a bizarre rendezvous  on the ocean floor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5okpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oppositions Reader: Selected Readings from a Journal for Ideas and Criticism in Architecture 1973-1984","description":"In its eleven-year history, Oppositions, the journal of the New York-based Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (IAUS), had an impact far beyond what its modest cover might suggest. Indeed, Oppositions set the agenda, introduced the key players, and published the seminal pieces in the theorization of architecture in the last twenty years. It is a testament to the enduring importance of the journal that its issues are still highly sought after today, prized (and priced) as collector's items, and found behind the desk at virtually every architectural library. Oppositions Reader collects the most important essays from 26 issues of Oppositions. Essays from the editors of the series-Peter Eisenman, Kenneth Frampton, Mario Gandelsonas, Anthony Vidler, and Kurt Forster-are included, along with texts by such noted architects, theorists, and historians as Aldo Rossi, Alan Colquhoun, Leon Krier, Denise Scott Brown, Bernard Tschumi, Rem Koolhaas, Mary McLeod, Georgio Ciucci, and Rafael Moneo. The page design, by Massimo Vignelli, has been faithfully reproduced. Harvard Professor K. Michael Hays has selected the writings for inclusion.

First, this volume is an extended account of the eleventh Seminar of 1989. Second, and more importantly, it is the culmination of the tradition of the preceding ten Seminars. The purpose of the Linz Seminar, since its inception, was and is to foster the development of the mathematical aspects of fuzzy sets. In the earlier years, this was accomplished by bringing together for a week small grou ps of mathematicians in various fields in an intimate, focused environment which promoted much informal, critical discussion in addition to formal presentations. Beginning with the tenth Seminar, the intimate setting was retained, but each Seminar narrowed in theme; and participation was broadened to include both younger scholars within, and established mathematicians outside, the mathematical mainstream of fuzzy sets theory. Most of the material of this book was developed over the years in close association with the Seminar or influenced by what transpired at Linz. For much of the content, it played a crucial role in either stimulating this material or in providing feedback and the necessary screening of ideas. Thus we may fairly say that the book, and the eleventh Seminar to which it is directly related, are in many respects a culmination of the previous Seminars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o2juCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"COGNITIVE THERAPY IN ACTION","description":"Cognitive therapy is the established method of helping people to overcome states of depression, anxiety or other emotional conditions.

Such fields--hydrodynamic, electric, and magnetic--are commonly encountered in both academic and industrial research, and can produce profound changes in the microscale properties of liquids comprised of polymers, colloids, liquid crystals, or surfactants. Starting with the basic Maxwell field equations, this book discusses the polarization properties of light, including Jones and Mueller calculus, and then covers the transmission, reflection, and scattering of light in anisotropic materials. Spectroscopic interactions with oriented systems such as absorptive dichroism, small wide angle light scattering, and Raman scattering are discussed. Applications of these methods to a wide range of problems in complex fluid dynamics and structure are presented, along with selected case studies chosen to elucidate the range of techniques and materials that can be studied. As the only book of its kind to present a self-contained description of optical methods used for the full range of complex fluids, this work will be special interest to a wide range of readers, including chemical engineers, physical chemists, physicists, polymer and colloid scientists, along with graduate and post-graduate researchers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iLpkzvyuyXcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Sea; an Autobiography","description":"Introduction by Arnold Rampersad.

The Divine Comedy serves as the physical (scientific), political, and spiritual guidebook of Dante's Fourteenth Century universe. The poem's imaginative and allegorical vision of the afterlife is a culmination of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church. It helped establish the Tuscan dialect, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. On the surface, the poem describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven; but at a deeper level, it represents allegorically the soul's journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy and the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called \\"the Summa in verse\\". Dante Alighieri (1265  1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called Comed a (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U05ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mesmer","description":"Rick's girlfriend from years ago was dead.

Virginia Nazarea now makes a case for preserving cultural memory along with biodiversity. By exploring how indigenous people farm sweet potatoes in Bukidnon, Philippines, she discovers specific ways in which the conservation of genetic resources and the conservation of culture can support each other. Interweaving a wealth of ecological and cognitive data with oral history, Nazarea details a \\"memory banking\\" protocol for collecting and conserving cultural information to complement the genetic, agronomic, and biochemical characterization of important crops. She shows that memory banking offers significant benefits for local populations?not only the preservation of traditional knowledge but also the maintenance of alternatives to large-scale agricultural development and commercialization. She also compares alternative forms of germplasm conservation conducted by a male-dominated hierarchy with those of an informal network of migrant women. Cultural Memory and Biodiversity establishes valuable guidelines for people who aspire to support community-based in situ conservation of local varieties. Perhaps more important, it shows that the traditional methods of local farmers are often as important as the \\"advanced\\" methods encouraged by advocates of modernization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7zWyyLENCzQC&dq=Cultural+Memory+and+Biodiversity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?","description":"Analyzes circumstances of the Kennedy assassination, arguing the existence of a conspiracy and disputing information given by U.S. sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5Fp3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Oswald:+Assassin+or+Fall+Guy%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Hanson: Our First President","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wLpEAAAAIAAJ&dq=John+Hanson:+Our+First+President&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Costume in detail: Women's dress, 1730-1930","description":"Detailed line drawings and photographs provide a comprehensive guide to the construction of women's garments","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y6cSAQAAIAAJ&dq=Costume+in+detail:+Women%27s+dress,+1730-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The relevance of preaching","description":"Because he believed in the importance of preaching in our age, the author wrote this book  to be read by every Protestant desirous of deepening his acquaintance with the goal, power, and relevance of preaching; to permit him to profit as much as possible from this preaching; to help him, layman or preacher, become conscious of his own personal responsibility in the preaching as a means of grace and the content, relevance, and characteristics of good preaching.

This history is made up of long periods of ignorance and confusion, punctuated once an age by a brilliant thinker who puts it all together. These few tower over the ordinary mass of people, and in the traditional account, it is to them that we owe science in its entirety. This belief is wrong. A People's History of Science shows how ordinary people participate in creating science and have done so throughout history. It documents how the development of science has affected ordinary people, and how ordinary people perceived that development. It would be wrong to claim that the formulation of quantum theory or the structure of DNA can be credited directly to artisans or peasants, but if modern science is likened to a skyscraper, then those twentieth-century triumphs are the sophisticated filigrees at its pinnacle that are supported by the massive foundation created by the rest of us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EAo4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Freedom From the Shame of the Past: Scriptural principles to help us understand our true value","description":"Freedom From the Shame of the Past is applicable to anyone who is trying to escape from the past. For even the Christian, there is a strange value system that keeps us bound in chains. We value ourselves in a way that is based on what we've done or what's been done to us. Mike Fehlauer shares insight from his own struggle with sin, sharing scriptural principles to help us understand our true value. The author found himself testing the waters and venturing into the world of sexual sin and pornography. Time and again leading the double life took its toll. His sexual addiction, shame, and feelings of disgust and self-loathing plagued him. One night his personal darkness took him to the pit of despair. With the cold steel of his gun barrel pressed against his skull, Mike felt alone and without hope. Discover how God literally worked a miracle in the lives of Mike and his family and helped him break the bondage of that horrible stronghold and begin his life anew. Readers will come to realize that nothing they could do will ever outstrip the power and finality of the cross.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=D-EHAAAACAAJ&dq=Finding+Freedom+From+the+Shame+of+the+Past:+Scriptural+principles+to+help+us+understand+our+true+value&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles F.

In his most ambitious novel to date, Terry C. Johnston combines all the drama and gut-wrenching tragedy to tell the story of the Nez Perce War as a whole cloth, a complex tapestry of deeply wrought emotions and bitter betrayal. Johnston breathes life into little-known characters from this terrifying conflict that will leap out of the past with compelling urgency-page after page, everyone you will meet were real people at the most crucial point of their lives. This is a story of individuals, knitted together in a compelling mosaic of emotions that will sweep you up and carry you along at a gallop. Despite one bloody skirmish after another, the Non-Treaty bands of Nez Perce still believe they can leave all the turmoil and killing behind in Idaho, fleeing General O.O. Howard's army across the Lolo Trail into Montana Territory. Looking Glass and the fighting chiefs lead their people to the \\"Place of the Ground Squirrels\\"-there to rest a few days while the women cut new lodgepoles, the children play for the first time in many weeks, and everyone celebrates leaving the war behind, rejoicing that they are on their way to the buffalo country. But there in the Big Hole of southwestern Montana, a chill, misty dawn covered the advance of Colonel John Gibbon's Seventh U.S. Infantry as they stole down upon the sleeping, unsuspecting village...unleashing the bloodiest onslaught of the Nez Perce War!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EBoENCF5E20C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second To None: The History of the NASCAR Busch Series","description":"NASCAR's Busch Series has always been about racing hard and having fun doing it. In the two decades since it grew out of the long-running Late Model Sportsman Series, the Busch circuit has become famous as a training ground for future Winston Cup stars like Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Bobby Labonte, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. But the Busch Series has also established its own tradition of ultra-competitive racing and colorful drivers. The series has fostered some legendary rivalries, starting with Sam Ard and Jack Ingram in its earliest years and continuing with more recent grudge matches between Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth. And despite the fierce competition on the track, the Busch Series has also earned a reputation as a friendlier, less corporate circuit than the Winston tour, one in which the community of drivers, teams and fans still resembles an extended -- though often fractious -- family. When someone in that community unexpectedly misses a race, competitors will often call their home or shop to see that everything is OK. Until now, no single source has told the full story of the Busch Series from its origins to the present day. Second to None traces the beginnings of the series in the Sportsman class and reviews every season from 1982-2000.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0_EMAAAACAAJ&dq=Second+To+None:+The+History+of+the+NASCAR+Busch+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peacock and the Pearl","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w_2rNwAACAAJ&dq=Peacock+and+the+Pearl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crepe Cookbook: The Easy Way to Elegant Crepes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9UkkHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Crepe+Cookbook:+The+Easy+Way+to+Elegant+Crepes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campay: New Paintings","description":"Atlanta magazine s editorial mission is to engage our community through provocative writing, authoritative reporting, and superlative design that illuminate the people, the issues, the trends, and the events that define our city.

Beginning with the legacies of Greek and Roman life and thought, Rommen traces the natural law tradition to its displacement by legal positivism and concludes with what the author calls 'the reappearance' of natural law thought in more recent times. In the seven chapters Rommen explores 'The History of the Idea of Natural Law' and 'The Philosophy and Content of the Natural Law'.

No less important was his need to prevent a European intervention that would have facilitated the South's move for independence.

When \\"Ender's Game\\" was first published as a novella twenty-five years ago few would have predicted that it would become one of the most successful ventures in publishing history. Expanded into a novel in 1985, Ender's Game won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best Novel. Never out of print and translated into dozens of languages, it is the rare work of fiction that can truly be said to have transcended a genre. Ender's Game and its sequels have won dozens of prestigious awards and are as popular today among teens and young readers as adults. First Meetings is a collection of three novellas-plus the original \\"Ender's Game\\"-that journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. \\"The Polish Boy\\" begins in the wake between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wiggin-the future father of Ender -they believe they may have found their man. Or boy. In \\"Teacher's Pest\\"-a novella written especially for this collection-a brilliant but insufferably arrogant John Paul Wiggin, now an American university student, matches wits with an equally brilliant graduate student named Theresa Brown. It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in \\"The Investment Counselor.\\" Ender's reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, twenty-year-old Andrew Wiggin wanders incognito from planet to planet as a fugitive. Until a blackmailing tax inspector compromises his identity and threatens to expose Ender the Xenocide. Also reprinted here is the original landmark novella, \\"Ender's Game,\\" which first appeared in 1977. Fully illustrated, First Meetings is Orson Scott Card writing at the height of his considerable power about his most compelling character.

Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.

In Pigeon Pie, set at the outbreak of World War II, Lady Sophia Garfield dreams of becoming a beautiful spy but manages not to notice a nest of German agents right under her nose, until the murder of her maid and kidnapping of her beloved bulldog force them on her attention, with heroic results.

Founded in 1789 and chartered by Congress in 1815, Georgetown experienced many of the same trials faced by the United States, and like the country, triumphed to enjoy extended prestige and prosperity. Georgetown University is a photographic journey through the school's first 200 years and celebrates the heritage of one of today's premier universities. More than 200 vintage images illuminate the historic campus, early classes, annual events, and prolific leaders. The story begins with the school's founder, Archbishop John Carroll, who first envisioned Georgetown as an academy for training young clergy for the new Catholic Church in America. Twice during the 1800s, the school's enrollment dropped so low that consideration was given to relocating the school or closing it completely. The Civil War turned students into soldiers and classrooms into hospitals; school colors of blue and grey remind us even today of North and South reunited after the war. Rev. Patrick Healy, S.J., known as the school's second founder, obtained university status for Georgetown and transformed the physical campus by constructing the massive Romanesque building that now bears his name. The 20th century brought about further development to the campus, curriculum, and cultural programs, while faculty, staff, and supporters from all backgrounds and races joined the Georgetown experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=peQeOeO39JMC&dq=Georgetown+University+(DC)+(College+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer 5th Edition with IHT2.0/FEHT with Users Guides","description":"Noted for its crystal clear presentation and easy-to-follow problem solving methodology, this bestselling book in the field provides a complete introduction to the physical origins of heat and mass transfer.

Yet, we live in a world where religion has become a tool people can use to their advantage rather than a means of growing closer to God. In this revised edition of \\"In Search of Belief, \\" Sister Joan Chittister challenges readers to reflect upon whether they truly live what they say they believe or whether they have created their own images of God to suit whatever is convenient for their personal and/or social situations. With a new foreword by Tom Roberts (National Catholic Reporter) and a new Introduction by the author, this fresh edition examines the Apostles' Creed phrase-by-phrase, offering challenging interpretations of its familiar themes and a provocative way of understanding--and expressing--its tenets. \\"Paperback\\" Testimonials \\"Chittister's meditations on the mysteries that her belief affirms in the Creed are rich. She cautions that disbelief in God inevitably leads to a myopic affirmation of one's own divinity, and she repeats the ancient caveats against creating God in our own image, or believing that a human being is able to grasp God intellectually...Her characterization of heaven is both refreshing and challenging...Her reflections on the annunciation and incarnation soar with hope as she affirms the reality of miracles, the active presence of God who fills human flesh 'with an insatiable capacity for the divine.'\\" --\\"America Magazine\\" \\"A refreshing and contemporary analysis of the true meaning of the Creed. Honest and thought provoking, \\"In Search of Belief\\" calls us to a spiritual adulthood...Not for the spiritually faint-hearted.\\" --\\"Edwina Gately\\" Each age has those who understand more deeply than most the essence of belief and the need to liberate religion from itself -- and God from the constrictions of religion. Joan Chittister brings a religious vision, one deeply considered and richly experienced, to the task. In doing so, she offers us the way to new eyes and new hearts when we pray, \\"I believe.\\" --\\"Tom Roberts, \\" National Catholic Reporter ..\\".\\"In Search of Belief\\" raises several questions about the Creed.... The book is an invitation to examine the extent to which we have made the Creed a personal statement of what we truly believe....The life of faith is a perilous journey because it involves placing one's trust in God and in transcendent reality. What makes the book so refreshing is that the Creed is made relevant to the modern age. There is absolutely no chance of anyone being bored \\" --\\"Trefoil, Southern African Catholic Quarterly\\" \\"In this stirring testament to the resiliency of the Christian faith, Joan Chittister ...spells out the meaning of the apostles Creed, phrase by phrase. For her, this testament is not an index of dogmas, but a \\"catalog of choices, an inventory of possibilities, a roster of visions...She breathes new life into these familiar phrases...This is a path-breaking resource for Christian educators to study and use in parishes.\\" --\\"Spirituality & Health\\" \\"This book is dangerous. Once you have read it, you can never again mumble the Creed complacently, without thought. --\\"Joan Chittister\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RHl3AAAACAAJ&dq=In+Search+of+Belief&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the feet of the master","description":"The privilege is given to me, as an elder, to pen a word of introduction to this little book, the first written by a younger Brother, young in body verily, but not in Soul. The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips. If the example be followed as well as the precept, then for the reader, as for the writer, shall the great Portal swing open, and his feet be set on the Path.

Connie Glaser and Barbara Steinberg Smalley found something remarkable--Esther's tale contains the ingredients every woman needs to succeed in the business world today. From Esther's start as a contestant in the ancient world's largest beauty pageant to her triumph over the evil Haman, the authors use her example as a strategist, a risk-taker, and a persuasive speaker to provide a new archetype for contemporary women's success in business. Along the way, they answer questions such as: - Do I really need a mentor, and if so, how do I find one? - What can I do to be taken more seriously? - How can I get the credit and recognition I deserve--without seeming pushy or aggressive? - How important is risk-taking to my career success? Smart, savvy, and strategic, Queen Esther provides an impressive role model for women today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wWsAAAAACAAJ&dq=What+Queen+Esther+Knew:+Business+Stategies+from+a+Biblical+Sage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Builders of the Bay Colony","description":"Contient biographies de Richard Hakluyt, John Smith, Thomas Morton, John White, John Winthrop, Thomas Shepard, John Hull, Henry Dunster, Nathaniel Ward, Robert Child, John Winthrop, Jr., John Eliot et Anne Bradstreet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KowMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Builders+of+the+Bay+Colony&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Monument: Art and Vulgarity in Saddam Hussein's Iraq","description":"Explores the connection between art and totalitarianism, using Saddam Hussein's \\"Victory Arch\\" in Baghdad as a starting point for a discussion on how dictators use art to legitimize their regimes","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tJFvsX2ZFjcC&dq=The+Monument:+Art+and+Vulgarity+in+Saddam+Hussein%27s+Iraq&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Rod Milestones: America's Coolest Coupes, Roadsters & Racers","description":"Every pastime has its greats, and hot rodding is no exception. Once in a while, a hot rodder puts together a car that's so right and so well done that it becomes an instant icon in the rodding world. These cars represent a clear vision that sets the standard for others to follow. They have been imitated, coveted, and revered; today, many have been painstakingly restored for private collections or museum display. Hot Rod Milestonescovers 25 of the most influential, innovative hot rods ever built from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. These cars include the Niekamp roadster, Isky's T, the Pearson Brothers coupe, Doane Spencer's '32, the So-Cal'34 coupe, The Pacific Gunsight Special, and Roth's Outlaw T. Each car's history, technical background, and influence are discussed, along with information on the builders and owners.

Why does marijuana seem to affect ones problem-solving capacity? Intoxicating Minds is, in the author's words, \\"a grand excavation of drug myth.\\" Neither extolling nor condemning drug use, it is a story of scientific and artistic achievement, war and greed, empires and religions, and lessons for the future. Ciaran Regan looks at each class of drugs, describing the historical evolution of their use, explaining how they work within the brain's neurophysiology, and outlining the basic pharmacology of those substances. From a consideration of the effect of stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine, and the reasons and consequences of their sudden popularity in the seventeenth century, the book moves to a discussion of more modern stimulants, such as cocaine and ecstasy. In addition, Regan explains how we process memory, the nature of thought disorders, and therapies for treating depression and schizophrenia. Regan then considers psychedelic drugs and their perceived mystical properties and traces the history of placebos to ancient civilizations. Finally, Intoxicating Minds considers the physical consequences of our co-evolution with drugs how they have altered our very being and offers a glimpse of the brave new world of drug therapies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T2wbAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Megali+Idea+and+the+Greek+Turkish+War+of+1897&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eric Sloane's an age of barns","description":"This is a re-issue of Sloane's classic folksy history of barn folklore, architecture, and history, which has been out of print for twenty years. \\"Eric Sloane's An Age of Barns\\" is filled with fabulous black-and-white illustrations from this great American artist.

During this time the crown tried to force churchmen to accept policies many considered inconsistent with ecclesiastical freedom and traditions--such as paying war taxes and expelling the Jews from the kingdom. William Jordan considers these issues through the eyes of one of the most important and courageous actors, the Cistercian monk, professor, abbot, and polemical writer Jacques de Th rines. The result is a fresh perspective on what Jordan terms \\"the story of France in a politically terrifying period of its existence, one of unceasing strife and unending fear.\\" Jacques de Th rines was involved in nearly every controversy of the period: the expulsion of the Jews from France, the relocation of the papacy to Avignon, the affair of the Templars, the suppression of the \\"heresies\\" of Marguerite Porete and of the Spiritual Franciscans, and the defense of the \\"exempt\\" monastic orders' freedom from all but papal control. The stands he took were often remarkable in themselves: hostility to the expulsion of Jews and spirited defense of the Templars, for example. The book also traces the emergence of King Philip the Fair's (1285-1314) almost paranoid style of rule and its impact on church-state relations, which makes the expression of Jacques de Th rines's views all the more courageous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W2-YDwAAQBAJ&dq=Unceasing+Strife,+Unending+Fear:+Jacques+de+Thrines+and+the+Freedom+of+the+Church+in+the+Age+of+the+Last+Capetians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diversity in America: Keeping Government at a Safe Distance","description":"A revisionist history of race in America focuses on the nation's pioneering role as the world's first truly multi-ethnic state, citing numerous examples of the ideal of diversity in American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6RCfAdTWiYYC&dq=Diversity+in+America:+Keeping+Government+at+a+Safe+Distance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian reflections,","description":"In our hearts, we know that every event in our lives is providential and that each of us plays a critical role in the unfolding of the story God has written. We believe that God's will is anchored deep within our soul, and so too is the desire to know it and to live it. In these pages, acclaimed Catholic author Anthony Esolen claims that the story of your life has already been written and can be discovered by considering the life and person of Jesus. Only in God does the world possess meaning, and therefore only in relation to God are our lives genuine stories. Here, Esolen offers a brilliant reflection in ways that only he can upon what it means for any of us, and for all of us together, to dwell in a world of stories. And he shows how we can take events in the life of Christ as the touchstone for all that happens to us on our journey from time to eternity. Indeed, this book will finally awaken in you the unshakable confidence that despite even the tragic stories of this life, the good things you've known and loved are not gone forever: all that is lost will be found; all will be restored; all will be perfected. Truly, there will be a new heaven and a new earth (Rev 21:1). Like the star that led the Magi to Jesus, the wisdom in these pages will lead you to Christ.

We've left you parentless in the world. This letter is our attempt to explain why we worked so hard to develop the germline genetic engineering technology that enabled your conception.For too many generations, our ancestors have voluntarily relied upon birth control to limit the growth of their own population. They used technology to save lives and reduce suffering. In doing so they unwittingly allowed our genome to accumulate noise. The medical issues we live with as a consequence demonstrate that this is not a sustainable reproductive strategy.It's clear that your genetic engineering violated the ban and that we put ourselves in legal jeopardy by doing it anyway. What's not clear is how your contemporaries will view the use of this technology or how history will view us...Confessions from the Consortium of Rogue Gene Scientists: An Open Letter to Our Two Children was written by loving parents and addressed to their genetically engineered children. It is now being published pseudonymously--and posthumously. The letter explains the parents' decision to develop and use genetic technology despite the prohibition. Their goal was not only to keep their heritable diseases from impacting their children but also to create a fundamentally new option for human reproduction. They argue, in effect, that a ban on human genetic engineering violates their religious freedom.At the request of the authors this letter is being posthumously released to the public. Though their children are the primary audience, they hope that by sharing their story and world view, it will help to usher in greater public understanding and acceptance of gene technology. It functions as a declaration of intent to the scientific community, a persuasive argument for the general reader, and a personal letter to the authors' children.Part love letter from parents to their children, part manifesto on the potentials of gene editing, part exploration of our individual and collective responsibilities to the entire species, Confessions from the Consortium of Rogue Gene Scientists is a stirring look at the immense potential of the future of genetic research--if we are brave enough to take an unbiased look at ourselves and our biology. About the AuthorsCharles and Cassandra suffered from hemophilia A and cystic fibroses, respectively. Each of them independently dedicated themselves and their careers to understanding the science behind their conditions. In the course of their graduate research they met, fell in love, and made the decision to have a family.Founding members of the Consortium of Rogue Gene Scientists, married couple, and doting parents, Charles and Cassandra Doe were vigorous proponents of germline genetic engineering to treat hereditable genetic diseases in the human population. Unable to reap the benefits of their own work they each passed away in what could have been their prime.Both highly respected scientists in their field, Charles and Cassandra loved each other and their children dearly. Their greatest hope was for the widespread acceptance of germline engineering as a humane way to prevent the proliferation of genetic disease and for the benefit of future generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3N9rzQEACAAJ&dq=Enough:+Setting+Limits+on+Human+Genetic+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1500 Ways to Escape the Human Jungle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-NyePQAACAAJ&dq=1500+Ways+to+Escape+the+Human+Jungle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Blue Water Death","description":"This story or history was written to correct one of the many wrongs in the recording of American History.

As the volume opens, a new president is installed and Jefferson is anticipating his return to Virginia, where he will pursue a fascinating range of personal and intellectual activities. He prepares for his final departure from Washington by settling accounts and borrowing to pay his creditors. At Monticello he tells of his efforts to restore order at his mismanaged mill complex, breed merino sheep, and otherwise resume full control of his financial and agricultural affairs. Though he is entering retirement, he still has one foot firmly planted in the world of public affairs. He acknowledges a flood of accolades on his retirement and has frequent exchanges with President James Madison. While fielding written requests for money, favors, and advice from a kaleidoscopic array of relatives, acquaintances, strangers, cranks, anonymous writers, and a blackmailer, he maintains a wide and varied correspondence with scientists and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic. The volume's highlights include first-hand accounts of Jefferson's demeanor at his successor's inauguration and one of the most detailed descriptions of life at Monticello by a visitor; Jefferson's recommendations on book purchases to a literary club and a teacher; chemical analyses of tobacco by a French scientist that first isolated nicotine; the earliest descriptions of the death of Meriwether Lewis; one of Jefferson's most eloquent calls for religious tolerance; and his modest assessment of the value of his writings in reply to a printer interested in publishing them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_5ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thunderbolt, The Republic P-47 in the Pacific Theater - Aircraft Specials series (6079)","description":"Nadat een 12-jarige jongen uit zelfverdediging een bewaker in de jeugdgevangenis heeft neergestoken, wordt hij op zijn vlucht gevolgd door de politie en een huurmoordenaar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qA12NQAACAAJ&dq=Thunderbolt,+The+Republic+P-47+in+the+Pacific+Theater+-+Aircraft+Specials+series+(6079)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossfire Volume 1: Hollywood Hero (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Crossfire+Volume+1:+Hollywood+Hero+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Than The Law: Behavioral And Social Facts In Legal Decision Making (Law and Public Policy: Psychology and the Social Sciences)","description":"FacultyAwards.org is the first and only university awards program in the United States based on faculty peer evaluation. Faculty Awards was created to recognize outstanding faculty members (as viewed by their Faculty peers) at colleges and universities across the United States. Faculty members voted through the 2014-2015 academic year for their peers at their academic departments and schools within a number of categories. Access to FacultyAwards.org to nominate and vote for Faculty was limited to university professors or faculty members at accredited U.S. institution of higher education. Faculty members were nominated and voted for by other faculty members in their own academic departments and schools. We strove to maintain an accurate peer-review process. Voting was not open to students or the public at large. In addition, faculty members voted for educators only at their own college or university. Winners for the 2014-2015 academic year, in all departments and colleges across U.S. institutions of higher education were announced in March 2015 and are permanently archived at FacultyAwards.org, as well as recognized in this 2015 print edition of the Faculty Awards Compendium. For the academic year 2014-2015 votes were cast to nominate and vote for Faculty members, and no self-voting was allowed, to assure the integrity of the whole process. This volume of the Faculty Awards Compendium includes Faculty awardees within Fine Arts, Humanities, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences Disciplines for the 2014-2015 academic year. A total of 1608 winning Faculty members in 584 higher education institutions were determined after tallying the votes.

While encountering the influences of an increasingly overwhelming popular culture, the men and women in this book follow age-old patterns of folklife and custom, making their own music and dance in celebration of them. Shedding new light on a region that maintains ties to the cultural identities of its earliest European and African inhabitants, Gerald Milnes shows how folk music in West Virginia borrowed rhythmic, melodic, and vocal forms from the Celtic, Anglo, Germanic, and African traditions. These elements have come together to create a body of music tied more to place and circumstance than to ethnicity. Milnes explores the legacies of the state's best-known performers and musical families. He discusses religious music, balladeering, the influence of black musicians and styles, dancing, banjo and dulcimer traditions, and the importance of old-time music as a cultural pillar of West Virginia life. A musician himself, Milnes has been collecting songs and stories in West Virginia for more than twenty-five years. The result is an enjoyable book filled with anecdotes, local history, and keen observations about musical lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nEooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Natural Remedy Book for Dogs & Cats","description":"A guide to the use of nutrition, vitamins, minerals, massage, herbs and homeopathy to support your pet's health and vitality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6-XcwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Natural+Remedy+Book+for+Dogs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The deluge: An historical novel of Poland, Sweden and Russia : a sequel to \\"With fire and sword\\"","description":"The peoples of Poland and Lithuania rally when the Swedes invade their countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1MqnCzsUBFoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World's Finest Mystery and Crime Stories: Third Annual Collection","description":"Gathers mystery, suspense, and crime stories from around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JICUhkP_MVMC&dq=The+World%27s+Finest+Mystery+and+Crime+Stories:+Third+Annual+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry--and Made Himself the Richest Man in America","description":"Gates reveals the guiding genius behind the unparalleled success of the Microsoft Corporation-- the biggest and most profitable personal computer software company in history-- and exposes the intensely competitive tactics that help it dominate the desktops of America.

Some time ago, in particular, a lively, pleasant, popular writer devoted an essay, lively and pleasant like himself, to a very encouraging view of the profession. We may be glad that his experience is so cheering, and we may hope that all others, who deserve it, shall be as handsomely rewarded; but I do not think we need be at all glad to have this question, so important to the public and ourselves, debated solely on the ground of money. The salary in any business under heaven is not the only, nor indeed the first, question.

Offering a provocative reassessment of Derrida's influence on modern thinking, Norris attempts to sever the tie between deconstruction and American literary critics who, he argues, favor endless, playful, polysemic interpretation at the expense of systematic argument. As he explores leftist attempts to arrive at an accommodation with postmodernism, Norris addresses the politics of deconstruction, the issue of men in feminism, Habermas' quarrel with Derrida, narrative theory as a hermeneutic paradigm, musical aesthetics in relation to literary theory, and various aspects of postmodern debate.

And if neoconservatism can be said to have a father or an architect, that person is Irving Kristol. Neoconservatism is the most comprehensive selection of Kristol's influential writings on politics and economics, as well as the best of his now-famous essays on society, religion, culture, literature, education, and - above all - the \\"values\\" issues that have come to define the neo-conservative critique of contemporary life. These essays provide an unparalleled insight into the 50-year development of Kristol's social and political ideas, from an uneasy socialism tempered with religious orthodoxy, to a vigilant optimism about the future of the American experiment. Those already familiar with Kristol's work will especially enjoy the new autobiographical essay that introduces this volume; it is sprinkled with personal recollections about such luminaries as Lionel Trilling, Leo Strauss, Saul Bellow, Sidney Hook, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb (who is also Mrs. Kristol). Those relatively new to Kristol's writings will be treated to some of the most lucid, insightful, entertaining, and intellectually challenging essays of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S2nUuTagIw8C&dq=Neo-conservatism:+The+Autobiography+of+an+Idea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 90's ; Decade of the Apocalypse: The European Common Market--The End Has Begun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LV-9AAAACAAJ&dq=The+90%27s+%3B+Decade+of+the+Apocalypse:+The+European+Common+Market--The+End+Has+Begun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remains Silent","description":"Robert Lichti started life as a happy boy, living on the family farm.

Included in these pages are some of the leaders in the movement, from Novella Carpenter s farm in an empty lot in Oakland to Growing Power s vast compound in Milwaukee. In addition to stories about the farms and their owners, sidebars provide basic how-to tips for such activities as composting, canning, beekeeping, and growing vegetables. A burgeoning movement that is fast catching on, urban farming taps into many touchstones of the zeitgeist, including environmental awareness, the foodie culture, localism, distrust of mass-production farming practices, and the DIY approach to life and living. Praise for Urban Farms:  Sarah C. Rich s handsome, intelligent URBAN FARMS (Abrams, $30) chronicles a movement to bring kale to the people, an effort that stretches across the country, from Brooklyn to Oakland. . . . Benson s spirited photographs capture the joy and beauty of urban farming s bounty. No vase full of lush peonies from the grounds of an elegant estate could inspire such looks of eager joy as do the tomatoes harvested out of New York City s Edible Schoolyard. These vegetable gardeners and farmers are working against such odds that there s simply no excuse to let a comparatively lush suburban backyard lie fallow.

Chronicled in these illuminating pages is life on the sugar plantations; the painful experience of caste hierarchy and racism; the devastation of World War; peace, colonialism, and the struggle for independence from imperialism. Subtly and concisely, Jagan outlines the corporate and economic interests involved in attempting to perpetuate colonial subjugation in British Guiana. Larger in scope than Jagan's Forbidden Freedom (also available from International Publishers), The West on Trial provides important historical context that enables readers to grasp the pivotal post-World War II period of anti-colonial, national liberation movements and the role of British and U.S. imperialism throughout the 1950s and 1960s in destabilizing democratically elected popular governments. For students of decolonization, the Cold War, and the struggle for independence, Cheddi Jagan's The West on Trial: My Fight for Guyana's Freedom is required reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z-FrAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+West+on+trial%3B:+My+fight+for+Guyana%27s+freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sins of the Flesh","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H4W24mCzTO4C&dq=Sins+of+the+Flesh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Bones of Truth Multimedia Edition","description":"Lancelot's greatest secret isn't just a desire for Lady Guinevere.... No other legend has captured the imagination of readers as completely as that of Lancelot, Guinevere and King Arthur. Now, enter a realm at once familiar and completely new. Britain in the late 400s was a land in transition. With the Romans gone and the traditional pagan ways slowly being replaced by Christianity, a clan leader arose to unite the warring factions against the Saxon threat. This is Arthur's world. And in this world, Lancelot, raised by the Lady of the Lake, is not one of Arthur's chosen knights but the consummate outsider: Pagan in a Christian court, the Queen's champion sworn to protect her against all harm. When harm does come -- it's in the form of a betrayal so insidious it shakes the foundation of the kingdom and threatens to expose a secret that Lancelot must hide at all costs. Drawing on the little-known legends of the false Guinevere and Lancelot's trials at arms, Queen's Champion, the second book in Windstorm's Classic Tales Retold series, is a vibrant new look at the Arthurian tales, a work alive with passion, promise and a love that transcends time.

Nearly four decades later, as the world's oldest astronaut, his courage reveted a nation. But these two historical events only bracketed a life that covers the sweep of an extraordinary century. John Glenn's autobiography spans the seminal events of the twentieth century. It is a story that begins with his childhood in Ohio where he learned the importance of family, community, and patriotism. He took these values with him as a marine fighter pilot during World War II and into the skies over Korea, for which he would be decorated. Always a gifted flier, it was during the war that he contemplated the unlimited possibilities of aviation and its frontiers. We see the early days of NASA, where he first served as a backup pilot for astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. In 1962 Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. Then came several years in international business, followed by a twenty-four year career as a U.S. Senator-and in 1998 a return to space for his remarkable Discover mission at the age of seventy-seven.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F5i-DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planting Eli (Southern Tier Editions)","description":"Ed Dell is gay, single and confidante to goddess Oprah Winfrey - at least in his fertile imagination.

Given Cambodia s need to restore its shattered social and physical infrastructures after decades of violent conflict, and with tourism to Angkor increasing by a staggering 10,000 per cent in just over a decade, the site has become an intense focal point of competing agendas. Angkor s immense historical importance, along with its global prestige, has led to an unprecedented influx of aid, with over twenty countries together donating millions of dollars for conservation and research. For the Royal Government however, Angkor has become a  cash-cow  of development. Post-conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism critically examines this situation and locates Angkor within the broader contexts of post-conflict reconstruction, nation building, and socio-economic rehabilitation. Based on two years of fieldwork, the book explores culture, development, the politics of space, and the relationship between consumption, memory and identity to reveal the aspirations and tensions, anxieties and paradoxical agendas, which form around a heritage tourism landscape in a post-conflict, postcolonial society. With the situation in Cambodia examined as a stark example of a phenomenon common to many countries attempting to recover after periods of war or political turmoil, Post-conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism will be of particular interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Asian studies, tourism, heritage, development, and cultural and postcolonial studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8JZ8AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Shift Daddy","description":"A father shares dinner and bedtime rituals with his daughter before going out to work the night shift.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WdUTPwAACAAJ&dq=Night+Shift+Daddy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resident Evil 2: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BtXEzgEACAAJ&dq=Resident+Evil+2:+Prima%27s+Official+Strategy+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Like Me Notes","description":"Don't want to read the actual book?

At the center of this conceptual and analytic approach is the contention that social outrage emanating from horrific and often sensationalized cases of child maltreatment plays a major role in CPS decision making and in child outcomes. The ebb and flow of outrage, we believe, invokes three levels of response that are consistent with patterns of the number of child maltreatment reports made to public child welfare agencies, the number of cases screened-in by these CPS agencies, the proportions of alleged cases substantiated as instances of real child abuse or neglect, and the numbers of children placed outside their homes. At the community level, outrage produces amplified surveillance and a posture of \\"zero-tolerance\\" while child protection workers, in turn, carry out their duties under a fog of \\"infinite jeopardy.\\" With outrage as a driving force, child protective services organizations are forced into changes that are disjointed and highly episodic; changes which follow a course identified in the natural sciences as abrupt equilibrium changes. Through such manifestations as child safety legislation, institutional reform litigation of state child protective services agencies, massive retooling of the CPS workforce, the rise of community surveillance groups and moral entrepreneurs, and the exploitation of fatality statistics by media and politicians we find evidence of outrage at work and its power to change social attitudes, worker decisions and organizational culture. In this book, Jungian psychology intersects with the punctuated equilibrium theory to provide a compelling explanation for the decisions made by public CPS agencies to protect children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_pQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meaning Of Things","description":"The meaning of things is a study of the significance of material possessions in contemporary urban life, and of the ways people carve meaning out of their domestic environment. Drawing on a survey of eighty families in Chicago who were interviewed on the subject of their feelings about common household objects, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton provide a unique perspective on materialism, American culture, and the self. They begin by reviewing what social scientists and philosophers have said about the transactions between people and things. In the model of 'personhood' that the authors develop, goal-directed action and the cultivation of meaning through signs assume central importance. They then relate theoretical issues to the results of their survey. An important finding is the distinction between objects valued for action and those valued for contemplation. The authors compare families who have warm emotional attachments to their homes with those in which a common set of positive meanings is lacking, and interpret the different patterns of involvement. They then trace the cultivation of meaning in case studies of four families. Finally, the authors address what they describe as the current crisis of environmental and material exploitation, and suggest that human capacities for the creation and redirection of meaning offer the only hope for survival. A wide range of scholars - urban and family sociologists, clinical, developmental and environmental psychologists, cultural anthropologists and philosophers, and many general readers - will find this book stimulating and compelling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5sWxHTayN0wC&dq=Meaning+Of+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wildcat Wine: A Novel of Suspense","description":"It's hard being Lillian Belle Rosemary Cleary.

In today's corporate upheaval, a new business paradigm is evolving. While many CEOs are being exposed for their greed, truly visionary leaders believe in a goal that benefits themselves as well as others. They realize that it is their vision and \\"soul\\" that attract loyal employees willing to go above and beyond the call of corporate duty. And their employees are realizing the same thing: while 80 percent of adults claim they'd work even if they didn't have to, the majority of them can hardly wait to leave their jobs and get home. Good Business starts with the premise that this is an age in which business and work have replaced religion and politics as central forces in contemporary life. The book reveals how business leaders, managers, and even employees can find their \\"flow\\" and contribute not only to their own happiness, but also to a just and evolving society. It identifies the factors crucial to the operation of a good business: trust, the commitment to fostering the personal growth of employees, and the dedication to creating a product that helps mankind.

Now housed in the Berlin Ethnological Museum, the Jacobsen collection remains one of the earliest and largest from Alaska s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. When Ann Fienup-Riordan first saw the collection being unpacked in 1994, she was \\"stunned to find this extraordinary Yup'ik collection, with accession records still handwritten in old German script and almost completely unpublished.\\" In 1997, Fienup-Riordan and Yup'ik translator Marie Meade returned to Berlin with a delegation of Yup'ik elders to study Jacobsen's collection. Yup'ik Elders at the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin recounts fourteen days during which the elders examined objects from the collection and described how they were made and used. Their descriptions, based on oral history and firsthand experience with similar objects, are imparted through songs, stories, and personal narratives. Woven together with Jacobsen s writings, technical descriptions, and accession information, the narrative presents a vast array of knowledge. For example, Jacobsen had observed that large grass mats were woven for use as sleeping mats in houses and were often taken on journeys; a Yup ik elder demonstrates how the grass mat would be folded and fitted into a kayak. Another elder describes a dance in which fox masks similar to those in the collection were used. Yet another elder, inspired by a carving of a paalraayak, launches into a story about the creature, which was sometimes encountered in the mountains near her home. An introductory essay describes Jacobsen's life and trip to Alaska and the region as it was then and as it is today. Informal snapshots show the elders interacting with the objects and miming their use, while Barry McWayne's large color photographs make possible the \\"visual repatriation\\" of this extraordinary collection. Yup'ik Elders at the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin also includes extensive notes summarizing accession information, a glossary of Yup'ik object names, and a detailed index. This is the first time a major Arctic collection has been presented from the Natives' point of view, an example of \\"reverse fieldwork\\" that can enrich understanding of Native American collections the world over.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uIdiQgAACAAJ&dq=Yup%27ik+Elders+at+the+Ethnologisches+Museum+Berlin:+Fieldwork+Turned+On+Its+Head&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toward the Making of Thoreau's Modern Reputation: Selected Correspondence of S.A.

The authors present concepts simply, then move the discussion toward complexity the opposite of the approach taken by many current texts. Clear yet sophisticated, the casebook is the perfect choice for all skill levels. Including problems that students can and should be able to do on their own, explanatory answers, and skills-based exercises, this casebook is both professor-friendly and student-friendly. Themes that run through the course are highlighted throughout the book, resulting in a casebook that clearly presents the fundamentals of property law. This allows students to develop an understanding of basic concepts on their own while allowing professors to assist their students in developing an advanced understanding of property law. The authors of Property Law are experts on the property coverage on the bar exam, and while this casebook goes far beyond test-only material, students will benefit from their expertise and will learn every topic they are likely to see on the bar exam. New to the Second Edition: Additional text on racial discrimination and other critical issues in a subtle way, giving instructors the choice of how deeply to explore those issues. Revisions to Chapter 9 to include Murr v. Wisconsin, the Supreme Court s most recent regulatory takings case. A Revised Chapter 10 that includes new material on Intellectual Property and Property Theory. Minor corrections and refinements throughout the casebook. Professors and students will benefit from: A text that starts from simplicity and moves to complexity: The book first provides text that explains the basic doctrine, then presents a simple case example, and finally moves to more complex issues. Cases that are introduced with explanatory text discussing the law and issues surrounding the case. This radically different approach from most other casebooks allows students to have a better grasp of the concepts and themes before they even read the case. Problems and exercises that students can complete on their own, with explanatory answers included in an appendix. An innovative design that aids student learning, with sidebars, diagrams, charts, and illustrations that make concepts clearer to students. Cases that are used as examples, not introductions to legal rules. Many topics in the book feature introductory text, illustrations, and problem sets before a single case is introduced, to aid in students  legal learning. The inclusion of sample documents, helping students to understand core concepts. A book perfect for a four-credit course but also features a modular design that can be used in courses of varying credit size. More comprehensive bar exam topic coverage than any competing book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9cPRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cases+and+text+on+property+(Law+school+casebook+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surprised by joy: The shape of my early life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=igkMAQAAIAAJ&dq=Surprised+by+joy:+The+shape+of+my+early+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sideshow Monkey - The Art Of David Hartman","description":"Freaks Monsters Girls The art of illustrator David Hartman.

Scratch a gentile,  the saying goes,  and you re sure to find an anti-Semite.  That notion is given credence by the fact that the first two millennia of the Jewish-Christian encounter culminated in the systematic slaughter of six-million Jews in the heart of Christendom. But Dr. Paul R. Carlson, author of Christianity After Auschwitz, is cautiously optimistic that the dawn of this new millennium may lead to Jewish-Christian amity as the Church faces up to its past sins and seeks to work with the Synagogue against those demonic forces which threaten civilization itself. However, as Carlson illustrates, the genocidal germ that gave birth to Hitler s criminal regime still flourishes among countless Christians, many of whom would passionately deny they harbor any anti-Semitic notions or sentiments. While the book is addressed primarily to Carlson s fellow evangelicals, both Jews and Christians will discover that it provides the general reader with an overview of those critical issues which scholars alone have in the past wrestled with in the post-Holocaust Jewish-Christian encounter. At the outset, Carlson is quick to concede that the late Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, a scion of the great Chechnowa Rebbe, was certainly correct when he insisted that  Christians have never tried to penetrate the soul of the Jews.  They have read the Bible but neglected the oral tradition by which we interpret it,  he noted.  This makes a different Bible altogether. For example, says Rav Soloveitchik:  To equate Judaism with legalism the way Christian theologians are prone to do is like equating mathematics with a compilation of mathematical equations.  By the same token, old stereotypes die hard.  The Jew has been pictured as the arch-capitalist and the arch-Bolshevik and chastised for being both, whipsawed by contending forces,  says Nathan C. Belth.  The Soviet authorities [saw] Jews as a threat to the state, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who castigate[d] Soviet terror, sees Jews as libertarians who brought on socialism, after, of course, rejecting Christ.  Since time-immemorial, anti-Semites have also portrayed the Jew as the greedy, shady businessman or banker. But they conveniently forget stories such as that of Haym Salomon [1740-1785], the Jewish broker whose financial aid staved off starvation and desertion among American troops during our War for Independence. At one critical point, Robert Morris, the American financier and statesman, sent a messenger to alert Haym Salomon of the plight of the cash-strapped Colonial forces. The man brought the news to Salomon while he was attending Yom Kippur services at Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia. The congregation was shocked at the intrusion on the holiest day of the Jewish year; but Haym Salomon quietly informed the messenger:  Tell Mr. Morris our country s appeal will not be in vain.  But that old canard about Jews and their money remains grist for the anti-Semite s mill. By the same token, Jews have not been entirely blameless when it comes to their own stereotypes of Christians, particularly evangelicals. Nathan Perlmutter confessed as much during his tenure as national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of B nai B rith.  Our image of the fundamentalist and the evangelical is a kind of collage assembled out of bits and pieces from Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis and Erskine Caldwell . . . ,  he admitted.  Even after all this time memories of the great swarm of sex-ridden, Bible-thumping caricatures continue to exert a pervasive power.  But evangelicals would be among the first to admit that Jews have come a long way since the days of the infamous Toledot Yeshu, or Life of Jesus, which depicted the Galilean in scandalous terms. Indeed, the Israeli author Shalom Ben-Chorin is representative of those Jewish intellectuals who now believe that  it is time for Jesus to come home again.  Meanwhile, few Christians realize just how vulnerable many Jews feel in what they perceive to be  Christian America.  That perception is heightened by the 1992 American Jewish Year Book finding that  roughly 12 percent of Americans of Jewish heritage are now Christians.   There is another way of looking at what I have called a disaster in the making,  says former US Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, author of Faith or Fear: How Jews Can Survive in a Christian America  Of the 6.8 million people who are Jews or of Jewish descent, 1.1 million say they have no religion and 1.3 million have joined another religion, adding up to 2.4 million,  Abrams observes.  This means that one-third of the people in America of Jewish ethnic origin no longer report Judaism as their current religion (Abrams italics). Such statistics illustrate why Jewish leaders unanimously condemn those Christian missionary agencies which specifically target Jews for conversion. They have been particularly incensed by one recent evangelical effort, known as Peace 2000, which aimed to convert every Jew in Israel to Christianity by the dawn of the new millennium.  Centuries of martyrdom are the price which the Jewish people has paid for survival,  says Brandeis scholar Marshall Sklare.  And the apostate, at one stroke, makes a mockery of Jewish history.  But if the convert is contemptible in Jewish eyes,  Sklare adds,  the missionary   all the more, the missionary of Jewish descent -- is seen as pernicious, for he forces the Jew to relive the history of his martyrdom, all the while pressing the claim that in approaching the Jew he does so out of love.  What kind of love is it, Jews wonder, that would deprive a man of his heritage,  Sklare asks.  Furthermore, given the history of Christian treatment of the Jews, would it not seem time at last to recognize that the Jew has paid his dues and earned the right to be protected from obliteration by Christian love as well as destruction by Christian hate?  The distinguished Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was even more pointed about the matter.  I had rather enter Auschwitz,  he once remarked,  than be an object of conversion.  All of this leads to the opening chapter of Christianity After Auschwitz, which introduces Christians to Emil Fackenheim s  Eleventh Commandment    or 614th Mitzvoth   which decrees that Jews are not permitted to grant Hitler any posthumous victories through intermarriage, assimilation, or conversion to a faith not their own. In a word, they are commanded to remain Jews. By the same token, Jewish scholars are quick to recognize that any  open and honest  dialogue will at some point involve a frank discussion of the similarities and differences between the Jewish and Christian perception[s] of the Messianic hope. With that understanding, the second chapter deals with the remarkable career of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh and last Grand Rebbe of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidim. Many of his talmidim, or disciples, believe he will ultimately be revealed as King-Messiah. His life and work are considered within the context of that of Jesus of Nazareth, as well as those of several pseudo-messiahs who have troubled Israel down through the centuries The author then makes it clear that Jesus himsel","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SQWPAAAAQBAJ&dq=After+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hartley Field: Poems","description":"These are truly original poems, enriched by metaphor and lit by a hard won optimism.--Linda Pastan","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qmpbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hartley+Field:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wild Thing","description":"Op de avond dat Max voor straf zonder eten naar bed wordt gestuurd, beleeft hij op zijn eigen kamer de wildste avonturen.

Its new stadium is on the Rumney Marsh in Saugus/Revere, and dark and lonely death suddenly stalks its receiver corps. When a speedy and highly gifted wide receiver is drafted by the Phantoms out of a Florida college, it is discovered, all the way back to high school, that any receiver ever slated to play ahead of him had an unsure future, if any. Strange calls come in the night, strange but age-old lures are put into action, and death comes in a variety of ways to team wideouts, youngsters or veterans alike and those newly acquired in trades.

As her cornerstone, Koci uses Hans-Georg Gadamer's claim that there are two complementary paths towards understanding and knowledge: science and art. Thus, to be faithful to the creed of the great hermeneutist, Koci ventures into both topics, arguing that while science sets out historical-critical analysis of the promised land motif in the Hebrew Bible and its later receptions, art enriches the interpretation with its literary illustrations. This volume places particular focus on American contexts, since the concept of the promised land is so deeply intertwined with American religious-political mythologies, and with the art of John Steinbeck and Walter Brueggemann in particular. By discussing artistic interpretation in biblical hermeneutics, the context and reception of Genesis 15.7 and Exodus 3.8 in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, and the history of the promised land motif and its interpretations, Koci argues that artistic receptions of biblical motifs are crucial for biblical scholarship in opening new hermeneutical and thematical horizons.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4mw0EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Summer","description":"The Dangerous Summer is Hemingway's firsthand chronicle of a brutal season of bullfights.

D'Ailly's writings on the stars, the focus of this book, clearly illustrate the complex relationships among astrology, science, and Christian thinking in the late Middle Ages. Through an examination of his letters, sermons, and philosophical, astrological, and theological treatises, Laura Ackerman Smoller reveals astrology's appeal as a scientific means to interpret history and prophecy, and not merely as a magical way to forecast and manipulate one's own fate. At the same time, she shows how d'Ailly dealt with delicate problems--such as free will and God's omnipotence--in elevating astrology to a compelling, but not always consistent, \\"natural theology.\\" The French cardinal's most intriguing prediction was for the advent of Antichrist in 1789, one that stemmed from his deep concern over the Great Schism (1378-1414). Smoller maintains that the division in the church led d'Ailly to fear the imminence of the apocalypse, and that he eventually turned to astrology to quell his apocalyptic fears, thereby gaining confidence that a church council could heal the Schism. In elucidating the place of astrology in medieval society, this book also affords a personal glimpse of a man facing a profound crisis. Originally published in 1994.

Especially for middle managers and below. Empowered cultures attract and retain talent. They produce high achievement, high accountability and high commitment. The Empowered Manager uncovers a roadmap to creating a more accountable culture in today's fragmented and virtual world. Bestselling author Peter Block is a true visionary: author of the classic Flawless Consulting, his work is about empowerment, stewardship, chosen accountability, and reconciliation of community. In this book, he returns his eye toward management to renew our efforts to create a shift in the traditional hierarchy. Twenty years after the original book, Block talks of why it is so difficult to both open the door to empowerment and more importantly, have people walk through it. It is more important than ever to create a culture in which all members of an organization are treated as entrepreneurs, giving them ownership over their role and responsibilities. This is in the face of the reality that most employees want safety, not the adventure of empowerment. Peter enhances the first edition of the book by acknowledging employees wish for dependency. Their longing for the days when a job carried a promise of a future, and companies cared more about the product and the people, than about the money. This is written primarily for people in the middle. Good managers and employees who care more about doing good work and treating people right, than ambition and making it into the ruling class. The upper middle and below is where there is the greatest need for great management. Which builds on valuing strengths, and allowing talent the space to stretch and achieve. Almost independent of the power points of people at the top. This book shows you how a new approach to management empowers all employees at all levels, and culminates in better business outcomes for the entire organization. Help shape a culture of commitment Develop the political skills to negotiate successfully Take responsibility for your actions Learn to fail up, and face setbacks with courage If you feel controlled by bureaucracy, unrewarded for creativity, and from a distance, powerless to control your own destiny, this book is the breath of fresh air your career has been craving. Timeless tips from a master of business strategy alongside a framework for more effective management makes The Empowered Manager a must-read guide for anyone doing business today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mGdJDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Empowered+Manager&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual of Neartic Diptera, Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Soj_ZwEACAAJ&dq=Manual+of+Neartic+Diptera,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Mad Universe (2nd Bantam printing #1253)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ooEtAQAAIAAJ&dq=What+Mad+Universe+(2nd+Bantam+printing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Did Man Just Happen?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0dfzoQEACAAJ&dq=Did+Man+Just+Happen%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Aluminum Alloys Containing Scandium: Structure and Properties","description":"This is the first book to generalize and analyze the extensive experimental and theoretical results on the phase composition, structure, and properties of aluminum alloys containing scandium.

More than just a true-crime story, it is the stunning expose of spurious science that sent medical researchers in the wrong direction--and nearly allowed a murderer to go unpunished. On July 28, 1971, a two-and-a-half-month-old baby named Noah Hoyt died in his trailer home in a rural hamlet of upstate New York. He was the fifth child of Waneta and Tim Hoyt to die suddenly in the space of seven years. People certainly talked, but Waneta spoke vaguely of \\"crib death,\\" and over time the talk faded. Nearly two decades later a district attorney in Syracuse, New York, was alerted to a landmark paper in the literature on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome--SIDS--that had been published in a prestigious medical journal back in 1972. Written by a prominent researcher at a Syracuse medical center, the article described a family in which five children had died suddenly without explanation. The D.A. was convinced that something about this account was very wrong. An intensive quest by a team of investigators came to a climax in the spring of 1995, in a dramatic multiple-murder trial that made headlines nationwide. But this book is not only a vivid account of infanticide revealed; it is also a riveting medical detective story. That journal article had legitimized the deaths of the last two babies by theorizing a cause for the mystery of SIDS, suggesting it could be predicted and prevented, and fostering the presumption that SIDS runs in families. More than two decades of multimillion-dollar studies have failed to confirm any of these widely accepted premises. How all this happened--could have happened--is a compelling story of high-stakes medical research in action. And the enigma of familial SIDS has given rise to a special and terrible irony. There is today a maxim in forensic pathology: One unexplained infant death in a family is SIDS. Two is very suspicious. Three is homicide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dPHScmCibD8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defiant Rose","description":"Rose Carney expects day-to-day difficulties in running her circus on the American frontier of the 1870s, but she does not count on her backers backing out, nor on the handsome representative sent by them to close down the show.

It takes a fresh and engaging look at the common themes that dominate this period, as well as examining the differences in the work of the six philosophers. Through vivid and witty prose, Richard Francks skilfully presents ideas that have informed the development of philosophy as we know it, and which present a challenge to beliefs and attitudes that most of us now share. In this work we find the source of modern philosophical inquiry - questions such as the existence of God, the Mind and Body problem, the idea of self, and the existence of the world had their birth in these texts - as well as broader questions about political and social philosophy. Thinkers discussed: Rene Descartes Baruch Spinoza Gottfried Willhelm Leibniz John Locke George Berkeley David Hume This will be ideal for anybody coming to the ideas of these philosophers for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HvKNAgAAQBAJ&dq=Modern+Philosophy:+The+Seventeenth+and+Eighteenth+Centuries+(Fundamentals+of+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics, Classical Inference and the Linear Model (Kendall's Library of Statistic) (Volume 2A)","description":"The development of statistical theory in the past fifty years is faithfully reflected in the history of the late Sir Maurice Kendall s volumes The Advanced Theory of Statistics. The Advanced Theory began life as a two volume work (Volume 1, 1943; Volume 2, 1946) and grew steadily, as a single authored work until the late fifties. At that point Alan Stuart became involved and the Advanced Theory was rewritten in three volumes. When Keith Ord joined in the early eighties, Volume 3 became the largest and plans were developed to expand it into a series of monographs called the Kendall's Library of Statistics which would devote a book to each of the modern developments in statistics. This series is well on the way with 5 titles in print and a further 7 on the way. A new volume on Bayesian Inference was also commissioned from Tony O'Hagan and published in 1994 as Volume 2B of the Advanced Theory. This Volume 2A is therefore the completely updated Volume 2 - Classical Inference and Relationship. A new author, Steven Arnold, was invited to join Keith Ord and they have between them produced a work of the highest quality. References have been updated and material revised throughout. A new chapter on the linear model and least squares estimation has been added.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_1wnQwAACAAJ&dq=Kendall%27s+Advanced+Theory+of+Statistics,+Classical+Inference+and+the+Linear+Model+(Kendall%27s+Library+of+Statistic)+(Volume+2A)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pastel City","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kmTkAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Pastel+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Ojibway country: A story of early missions on the Minnesota frontier","description":"\\"The greater portion of the materials embraced in this little volume have been gathered from the private journals and correspondence of those who were the leading actors in the events described.\\"--Foreword.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QBQ7AQAAMAAJ&dq=In+the+Ojibway+country:+A+story+of+early+missions+on+the+Minnesota+frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (Modern Problems in Pediatrics)","description":"This book covers the exciting developments of the last ten years of fetal therapy including drug treat ment, blood transfusions, and operations on the fetus inside the womb.

They are not theoretical works in the traditional sense, but more a series of lessons from a chess expert with extensive over-the-board experience with an opening. You will gain an understanding of the opening and the middlegames to which it leads, enabling you to find the right moves and plans in your own games. It is as if you were sitting at the board with a chess coach answering your questions about the plans for both sides, the ideas behind particular moves, and what specific knowledge you need to have. The Queen's Indian is an important and popular opening at all levels of play. Black's flexible stance allows him to choose between a range of solid and dynamic structures. In turn, White can play flexibly, opposing Black's fianchetto, or can try to force the pace in the centre and start a hand-to-hand fight. It is an opening rich in nuances, and many of the modern main lines involve moves that look extravagant, but are backed up by a deep underlying logic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u4gSAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Queen%27s+Indian:+Detailed+Explanation+of+an+Important+and+Popular+Chess+Opening&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carolina Drosophila manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4NLZOwAACAAJ&dq=Carolina+Drosophila+manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bless This Food: The Anita Bryant Family Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wp8nAQAACAAJ&dq=Bless+This+Food:+The+Anita+Bryant+Family+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruth: The bridegroom's love for the church revealed (SpiritLed Woman Studies)","description":"A SpiritLed Woman Bible study This study of the Book of Ruth illuminates the allegorical account of this historical love story, pivotal in the genealogy of the house of David and of Jesus Christ.

Every few years, Phaidon brings together 10 illustrious curators to choose 100 of the art world?s best and most important emerging contemporary artists, and what they discover becomes an invaluable resource in an ever-changing art world. As has proven to be the case with those featured in the previous four Cream books, these will be the 100 artists the world is talking about for years to come. Valued by art collectors and art lovers alike as a road map through the ever expanding international art scene of gallery shows, museum exhibitions, biennials, and fairs, the Cream series is a must-have for anyone interested in the art world?s latest news and is an excellent introduction to the dialogue among some of its best minds. The introduction features a conversation between the ten curators discussing one of the art world?s hottest topics ? the recession and how it has impacted the market and artist creativity.

By any standard, this was a family with problems. Jacob's oldest son Reuben is said to have slept with his father's concubine Bilhah. The next two sons, Simeon and Levi, tricked the men of a nearby city into undergoing circumcision, and then murdered all of them as revenge for the rape of their sister. Judah, the fourth son, had sexual relations with his own daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, jealous of their younger sibling Joseph, the brothers conspired to kill him; they later relented and merely sold him into slavery. These stories presented a particular challenge for ancient biblical interpreters. After all, Jacob's sons were the founders of the nation of Israel and ought to have been models of virtue. In The Ladder of Jacob, renowned biblical scholar James Kugel retraces the steps of ancient biblical interpreters as they struggled with such problems. Kugel reveals how they often fixed on a little detail in the Bible's wording to \\"deduce\\" something not openly stated in the narrative. They concluded that Simeon and Levi were justified in killing all the men in a town to avenge the rape of their sister, and that Judah, who slept with his daughter-in-law, was the unfortunate victim of alcoholism. These are among the earliest examples of ancient biblical interpretation (midrash). They are found in retellings of biblical stories that appeared in the closing centuries BCE--in the Book of Jubilees, the Aramaic Levi Document, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, and other noncanonical works. Through careful analysis of these retellings, Kugel is able to reconstruct how ancient interpreters worked. The Ladder of Jacob is an artful, compelling account of the very beginnings of biblical interpretation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AErYG-lcVF0C&dq=The+Ladder+of+Jacob:+Ancient+Interpretations+of+the+Biblical+Story+of+Jacob+and+His+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Ingerfield,: And other stories, (On cover: Buckram series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZwTAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventure in Meditation : Spirituality for the 21st Century: Vol II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2cyF1p3GFKkC&dq=Adventure+in+Meditation+:+Spirituality+for+the+21st+Century:+Vol+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bone","description":"\\"On the way to hurricane-ravaged Isle of Palms, a barrier island off the South Carolina coast, Tempe receives a call from the Charleston coroner.

The colossal dimensions of these cathedrals required not only enormous financial outlay, but also great organisational and technical skills. How, for example, were such long-term projects planned, lasting in some cases for many generations? How was work organised on the building site? Which forms were used, and how were they developed? What were the representational aims of the patrons of churches and secular buildings? And what symbolic significance lies behind these buildings, which were not only architectural masterpieces but also a vehicle for theological content, as part of the liturgy? We can only begin to understand the 'spirit of the Gothic' through an understanding of the historical, sociological, theological, economic and technological background in this time of change. Given this, we can then start to read Gothic cathedrals like the pages of a book.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

A day of family reunions, meals, and fun, Halloween brings people of all ages together with rhyming, storytelling, family fireworks, and community bonfires. Perhaps most important, it has become a day that transcends the social conflict found in this often troubled nation. Through the extensive use of interviews, The Hallowed Eve offers a fascinating look at the various customs, both past and present, that mark the celebration of the holiday. Looking through the lenses of gender, ethnicity, and religious affiliation, Jack Santino examines how the traditions exist in a nonthreatening, celebratory way to provide a model of how life could be in Northern Ireland. Halloween, concludes Santino, is a marriage of death and life, a joining of cultural opposites: indoor and outdoor, domesticity and wildness, male and female, old and young. Although current folk and popular traditions can be divisive, Halloween in Northern Ireland is universally considered to belong to everyone, regardless of their background or political leanings. The holiday is a dramatic example of how a community comes together one day a year, and these Northern Irish traditions capture the fundamental and everyday dimensions of life in Ulster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KEsoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Woman and Nation: Nationalisms, Transnational Feminisms, and the State","description":"An examination of nationalism and gender.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iZqv_ZcsipgC&dq=Between+Woman+and+Nation:+Nationalisms,+Transnational+Feminisms,+and+the+State&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Curved Planks: Poems / A Bilingual Edition (French Edition)","description":"For decades readers and critics have acclaimed Yves Bonnefoy as France's greatest living poet.

However, much less attention has been paid to the strategies of persuasion employed by the regimes to win over the masses for their cause. Among these, fascist propaganda has traditionally been seen as the key means of influencing public opinion. Only recently has the fascination with Fascism become a topic of enquiry that has also formed the guiding interest of this volume: it offers, for the first time, a comparative analysis of the forms and functions of theater in countries governed by fascist or para-fascist regimes. By examining a wide spectrum of theatrical manifestations in a number of States with a varying degree of fascistization, these studies establish some of the similarities and differences between the theatrical cultures of several cultures in the interwar period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-rJXLLyF21AC&dq=Art+in+Germany+1933-1945%3B+Architecture+(Kunst+in+Deutschland+1933-1945:+Architektur)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo! and the Groovy Ghost","description":"WOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Agincourt is the quintessential English battle. Outnumbered English forces meet the French on the battlefield, and through courage, tenacity, (and a wicked Welsh weapon called a longbow), they win the day. While Henry V was triumphant, and was immortalized by Shakespeare for his victory, his gains were later squandered by his son, Henry VI, so ultimately not much was accomplished. In this Henty book, Guy Aylmer is an English squire and the son of a knight. He travels to Villeroy, in France, where his lord has a castle, but is swept up in it's defense when it is attacked by Orleanist forces. He winds-up as a prisoner in Paris where he and his charges are assaulted by the White Hoods-the butchers of Paris. After several adventures and escapes he later returns to France with King Henry V and fights in the Battle of Agincourt.

Focusing on daily and domestic life in communities where more than half the population lives and works, these essays highlight the struggles and hardships of women in the region and also establish the distance between this invisible world and the conflict over Islamic issues that dominate headlines in the West. Indeed, as these essays illustrate, from the perspective of this invisible population, Islam appears variegated and tempered by cultural, historical, and gender circumstances. This work also documents the general emergence of the female-centered informal economy from the shadows toward a central role in the lives of Middle Eastern women in their respective nations. Part I.

For Claire Lacombe and Pauline Leon, two poor women of eighteenth-century France, the lofty ideals of the coming revolution could not seem more abstract. But when Claire sees the gaping disparity between the poverty she has known and the lavish lives of aristocrats as her theater group performs in their homes, and Pauline witnesses the execution of local bread riot leaders, both are driven to join the uprising. They, along with upper-class women like Madame Manon Roland, who ghostwrites speeches for her politician husband and runs a Parisian salon where revolutionaries gather, will play critical roles in the French people s bloody battle for liberty and equality. Based on a true story, author Marge Piercy s thrilling and scrupulously researched account shines with emotional depth and strikingly animated action. By interweaving their tales with the exploits of men whose names have become synonymous with the revolution, like Robespierre and Danton, Piercy reveals how the contributions of these courageous women may be lesser known, but no less important. Rich in detail and broad in scope, City of Darkness, City of Light is a riveting portrayal of an extraordinary era and the women who helped shape an important chapter in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pSafCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Tales from Spanish America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VixLXwAACAAJ&dq=Classic+Tales+from+Spanish+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Honeywell Pentax Way The Pentax Photographer's Companion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N29xSAAACAAJ&dq=The+Honeywell+Pentax+Way+The+Pentax+Photographer%27s+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning Curves III, The Guide To Understanding Derivatives","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l-JGAAAACAAJ&dq=Learning+Curves+III,+The+Guide+To+Understanding+Derivatives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trailsman #245, The;: Bloody Brazos","description":"Skye Fargo's on a mission of mercy to Nebraska and straight into hell...

Through his relationship with two other boys T?rless is led into sadistic and sexual encounters with a third pupil which both repel and fascinate him. Estranged from everyday life, T?rless gradually learns to accept his experiences and describe them with analytical precision. The novel is based on the author's own experiences at an Austrian military academy. A school story with a difference, T?rless extends the scope of fiction with its non-judgemental presentation of transgressive sexuality and violence. It is a profoundly disturbing exploration of a non-moral outlook on life and of dictatorial attitudes that prefigure the outbreak of the First World War and the rise of fascism.

The recipes (spelled \\"\\"receipts\\"\\") it published were often submitted by women from both the North and the South, and they reveal the wide variety of regional cooking that characterized American culture. There is a remarkable diversity in the recipes, thanks to the largely rural readership of Godey's Lady's Book and to the immigrant influence on the country in the 1860s. Fish and game were readily available in rural America, and the number of seafood recipes testifies to the abundance of the coastal waters and rivers. The country cook was a frugal cook, particularly during wartime, so there are a great many recipes for leftovers and seasonal produce. In addition to a wide sampling of recipes that can be used today, Civil War Recipes includes information on Union and Confederate army rations, cooking on both homefronts, and substitutions used during the war by southern cooks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0wlIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Green Alligators, Zoo & Farm Animals Card Game","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EV1WAAAAYAAJ&dq=Green+Alligators,+Zoo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coaching Fastpitch Softball Successfully (Coaching Successfully)","description":"Field a winning fastpitch softball team year after year with the knowledge and insights of a coaching legend!

In doing so, Europe Undivided illuminates the changing dynamics of the relationship between the EU and candidate states from 1989 to 2004, and challenges policymakers to manage and improve EU leverage to support democracy, ethnic tolerance, and economic reform in other candidates and proto-candidates such as the Western Balkan states, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Perhaps best known for shepherding the Deocratic party through its political exile during the Reagan/Bush era, Pamela Harriman used her third husband Avrell's fortune and her own charm and intelligence to help propel a grateful Bill Clinton into the White House. But well before her recent rise to prominence, Harriman already had an international reputation. The vivacious daughter of a rural English baron, at 19 she married the only son of Winston Churchill and played a small part in the unfurling of history, while living with the Prime Minister during World War II. Her second marriage to celebrated producer Leland Hayward put her at thr crossroads of Hollywood and Broadway throughout the 1960s. Married to statesman Harriman in 1971 - 30 years after a wartime affair - she dealt with Soviet, Chinese and European leaders. Along the way she had affairs with such rich and powerful men as Gianni Agnelli, Frank Sinatra and Elie de Rothschild. Derived from months of exclusive discussions with Harriman (for a proposed autobiography which was subsequently abandoned), and interviews with nearly 200 friends, relatives and critics, this is a look Harriman's extraordinary life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jfJtHAAACAAJ&dq=Life+of+the+Party:+The+Biography+of+Pamela+Digby+Churchill+Hayward+Harriman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing Word of God: Joy & Light","description":"This book is filled with Healing Scriptures from Holy Bible.

Other topics include attack and defense in equal positions, where both sides must judge carefully how much of their resources to devote to the attack and the counter-attack. The main subject, though, is the case where the defender is fighting for his life, and must decide how to maximize his chances of survival. Marin considers psychological issues and explains the main options available to the defender: simplification, cold-blooded defense, a positional sacrifice, 'blackmailing' the attacker, or a counter-attack.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3fgGAAAACAAJ&dq=Secrets+of+Chess+Defence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World","description":"Acheson is the first complete biography of the most important and controversial secretary of state of the twentieth century. More than any other of the renowned \\"Wise Men\\" who together proposed our vision of the world in the aftermath of World War II, Dean Acheson was the quintessential man of action. Drawing on Acheson family diaries and letters as well as recent revelations from Russian and Chinese archives, historian James Chace traces Acheson's remarkable life, from his days as a schoolboy at Groton and his carefree life at Yale to his work for President Franklin Roosevelt on international financial policy and his unique partnership with President Truman. Acheson was a housemate of Cole Porter's at Harvard Law School, a prot g  of Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter's, a friend of poet Archibald MacLeish's, a key adviser to General George Marshall, and a confidant of Winston Churchill's. Serving as Truman's secretary of state from 1949 to 1953, he was indeed \\"present at the creation,\\" as he entitled his memoirs. More than any other of Truman's powerful and glamorous advisers, Acheson conceived the shape of the postwar world and mastered the policies that ensured its birth and endurance. He was the driving force behind the Truman Doctrine to contain the Soviet Union's expansionist ambitions; the Marshall Plan to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe; and NATO, the military alliance that would bind Western Europe and the United States and keep the Soviet Union firmly behind the Iron Curtain until it collapsed. Chace corrects many misconceptions about Acheson's role in the Cold War. Acheson was not one of the original Cold Warriors. In 1945, willing to acknowledge Soviet concerns about its security, Acheson worked closely with Secretary of War Henry Stimson on a plan to share America's scientific information about atomic energy with Moscow in order to avert an arms race. It was only when Moscow made threatening demands on Turkey for bases in the Dardanelles that Acheson hardened his views toward the Soviet Union. Acheson's initial approach toward Communist China was similarly nonideological. He had little sympathy for Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists on Taiwan and, until the outbreak of the Korean War, held out hope that the United States would soon recognize Mao Zedong's regime as the legitimate government of China. Acheson's early pragmatism toward Moscow and Beijing, and his refusal to denounce Alger Hiss, a State Department colleague accused of being a Communist, earned him the enmity of the McCarthyites, who accused Acheson of having \\"lost\\" China and of sabotaging General Douglas MacArthur in Korea. Later, Acheson encouraged President Kennedy to stand firm against the Soviets in the Berlin Wall and Cuban missile crises. He headed a group of elder statesmen who advised President Johnson on the Vietnam War. When Acheson turned against the war, Johnson realized that domestic support for his policy had crumbled. Acheson is a masterful biography of a great statesman whose policies won the Cold War. It is also an important and dramatic work of history chronicling the momentous decisions, events, and fascinating personalities of the most critical decades of the American Century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Jf32GR7t3IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claudius the god: And his wife Messalina","description":"Depicts the turbulent life of a Roman emperor, reconstructing the decadence of the Roman world","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QOWK6WFwQLMC&dq=Claudius+the+god:+And+his+wife+Messalina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Violence & Power in Sports: Rethinking Masculinity","description":"This book contextualizes the complexity of sexual violence within its broader context  from war to the resolution of interpersonal disputes  and covers a wide span including sexual harassment, bullying, rape and murder as well as domestic violence. Written by leading academics from a variety of disciplines, contributions also include commentaries that relate the research to the work of practitioners. Despite advances made in the investigation of sexual offences, evidence still points to a continued belief in the culpability of victims in their own victimization and a gap between the estimated incidence of sexual violence and the conviction of perpetrators. Adopting an implicitly and explicitly critical stance to contemporary policy responses that continue to fail in addressing this problem, this book focuses on attitudes and behaviour towards sexual violence from the point of view of the individual experiencing the violence  perpetrator and victim  and situates them within a broader societal frame. It is through an understanding of social processes and psychological mechanisms that underpin sexual violence that violence can be combated and harm reduced, and at this individual level that evidence-based interventions can be designed to change policy and practice. The Handbook is split into four sections: 'Legacies: Setting the Scene' offers a critical overview of historical, legal and cultural processes which help to explain the origins of current thinking and offer steers for future developments 'Theories and Concepts' examines contemporary thinking on sexual violence and reviews explanatory frameworks from a number of perspectives 'Acts of Sexual Violence' reviews a number of specific types of sexual violence, elaborating the range of circumstances, victims and perpetrators with a view to addressing the general and pervasive nature of such violence thus contradicting narrow cultural stereotyping 'Responding to Sexual Violence' overviews and evaluates current policies and practices and offers new ideas to develop different types of interventions. The editors  conclusion not only draws out the key themes and ideas from contributions to the Handbook, but also considers the nature of and the extent to which any progress has been made in understanding and responding to sexual violence. This will be a key text for students and academics studying sexual violence and an essential reference tool for professionals working in the field including police officers, probation staff, lawyers and judges.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZLqoAgAAQBAJ&dq=Sex,+Violence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Delia Webster and the Underground Railroad","description":"In this captivating tale, Randolph Paul Runyon follows the trail of the first woman imprisoned for assisting runaway slaves and explores the mystery surrounding her life and work. In September 1844, Delia Webster took a break from her teaching responsibilities at Lexington Female Academy and accompanied Calvin Fairbank, a Methodist preacher from Oberlin College, on a Saturdary drive in the country. At the end of their trip, their passengers Lewis Hayden and his family remained in southern Ohio, ticketed for the Underground Railroad. Webster and Fairbank returned to a near riot and jail cells. Webster earned a sentence to the state penitentiary in Frankfort, where the warden, Newton Craig, married and a father, became enamored of her and was tempted into a compromising relationship he would come to regret. Hayden reached freedom in Boston, where he became a prominent businessman, the ringleader in the courthouse rescue of a fugitive slave, and the last link in the chain of events that led to the Harpers Ferry Raid. Webster, the focal point at which these lives intersect, remains an enigma. Was she, as one contemporary noted, \\"A young lady of irreproachable character?\\" Or, as another observed, \\"a very bold and defiant kind of woman, without a spark of feminine modesty, and, withal, very shrewd and cunning?\\" Runyon has doggedly pursued every historical lead to bring color and shape to the tale of these fascinating characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ykooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dolphin Luck","description":"It's Christmas, and the inhabitants of Porridge Hall are suffering from the winter blues.

Otherwise they will be marginalized by the impact of digital technology on their traditional customer base.Author Ralph Blanchard, drawing on twenty years of experience as an information services entrepreneur, argues that it is irresponsible for librarians to simply turn academic tasks over to search engines, as many do. Instead, libraries should expand digital services and, using the tactics and strategies of successful for-profit information service businesses, reconnect with their customers by promoting themselves as 21st Century information experts.Topics in this wide-ranging study include: The library as a service business Change, risk and unintended consequences The Internet search engine business model Problems with students using search engines The evolution of \\"ambient information\\" Music and information technology \\"Millennials\\" as library customers Hiring and training library information workers Push and viral marketing strategies for libraries The Digital Challenge for Libraries calls for new initiatives by librarians and for a rekindling of interest in the vital role libraries play in an informed, prosperous and democratic society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Tj40zqeN4EC&dq=The+Digital+Challenge+For+Libraries:+Understanding+the+Culture+and+Technology+of+Total+Information&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The diary of Virginia Woolf: Vol. 2, 1920-1924","description":"Entries interrupted only by her periodic breakdowns record the daily events and activities, enthusiasms and disappointments, and writing tasks in Virginia Woolf's life and her responses to people, books, and her own work","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ULInAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+diary+of+Virginia+Woolf:+Vol.+2,+1920-1924&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day the Earth Went Flat","description":"The day comes when the earth goes flat and everyone on the planet strives to find a solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LkJ-AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Day+the+Earth+Went+Flat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revolution of Forms: Cuba's Forgotten Art Schools","description":"\\"A revolution of forms is a revolution of essentials.\\"-Jos Mart, Cuban intellectual and independence leader. Although the current surge of interest in Cuba has extended to that country's architecture, few know that the most outstanding architectural achievement of the Cuban Revolution stands neglected just outside Havana. The Escuelas Nacionales de Arte (National Art Schools), constructed from 1961 to 1965, were the result of an educational program initiated by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara soon after the Revolution of 1959. The architects they commissioned created an organic complex of brick and terra-cotta Catalan vaulted structures that reflected the optimism and exuberance of the period. The schools attempted to reinvent architecture, just as the Revolution hoped to reinvent society. However, even before construction was completed, the schools fell out of official favor and were subjected to an attack that resulted in their subsequent \\"disappearance.\\" An ideological campaign branded them politically incorrect, a bourgeois luxury that was not in keeping with the Revolution. The buildings fell into disuse and, abandoned to the jungle, were literally overgrown. Now, almost 40 years later, Cuba is beginning to recognize and reclaim these significant works of architecture. Revolution of Forms investigates the history and politics surrounding the creation of these structures as well as their subsequent abandonment. The text is accompanied by archival photographs, plans, and images of the present condition of these structures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vaWs_59ZafYC&dq=Revolution+of+Forms:+Cuba%27s+Forgotten+Art+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Original Dog Bible: The Definitive New Source To All Things Dog (Original Dog Bible: The Definitive Source for All Things Dog)","description":"The wooftasticsecond edition.

In contrast to the way inheritance is understood in scientific discourse and culture more broadly, inheritance in psychoanalysis is a paradox. Although it s impossible, strictly speaking, for the unconscious to be inherited, this volume demonstrates how the concept of inheritance can occasion a rich reassessment and reinvention of psychoanalytic theory and practice. The collection enacts a critical traversal of inheritance for psychoanalysis: from the most basic assumptions of natural or biological inheritance, such as innateness, heredity, evolution, and ontogenesis, to analysis of the ways cultural traditions can be challenged and transformed, and finally to the reinvention of psychoanalytic practice, in which the ethics of inheritance is fully realized as the individual s responsibility to transform the social bond. Featuring strong interdisciplinary analysis rooted in both psychoanalysis and philosophy, this volume further engages science, politics, and cultural studies, and addresses contemporary political challenges such as autism and transgenderism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UT1MDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing With Microsoft Project 98","description":"\\"This classic guide enables you to learn from the successes and failures of leading companies, explore new cost control and risk management techniques . . . and obtain the information needed to study for the PMI Certification exam.\\"-The Design-Build Institute of America\\"This book is more like an encyclopedia of project management than simply a textbook . . .

Harding may be best known as America's worst president. Scandals plagued him: the Teapot Dome affair, corruption in the Veterans Bureau and the Justice Department, and the posthumous revelation of an extramarital affair. Raised in Marion, Ohio, Harding took hold of the small town's newspaper and turned it into a success. Showing a talent for local politics, he rose quickly to the U.S. Senate. His presidential campaign slogan, \\"America's present need is not heroics but healing, not nostrums but normalcy,\\" gave voice to a public exhausted by the intense politics following World War I. Once elected, he pushed for legislation limiting the number of immigrants; set high tariffs to relieve the farm crisis after the war; persuaded Congress to adopt unified federal budget creation; and reduced income taxes and the national debt, before dying unexpectedly in 1923.

Owing to the war having been an unsuccessful one for our arms, British writers have avoided the subject, and it has been left for American historians to describe. These, writing for their own countrymen, and drawing for their facts upon gazettes, letters, and other documents emanating from one side only, have, naturally, and no doubt insensibly, given a very strong color to their own views of the events, and English writers have been too much inclined to accept their account implicitly. There is, however, another and very different side to the story, and this I have endeavored to show you. The whole of the facts and details connected with the war can be relied upon as accurate. They are drawn from the valuable account of the struggle written by Major Steadman, who served under Howe, Clinton, and Cornwallis, and from other authentic contemporary sources. You will see that, although unsuccessful,--and success was, under the circumstances, a sheer impossibility,--the British troops fought with a bravery which was never exceeded, and that their victories in actual conflict vastly outnumbered their defeats. Indeed, it may be doubted whether in any war in which this country has been engaged have our soldiers exhibited the qualities of endurance and courage to a higher degree.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IcXQDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McDougal Littell Nextext: Great Expectations Grades 6-12 (Classic Retelling)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2E-VAAAACAAJ&dq=McDougal+Littell+Nextext:+Great+Expectations+Grades+6-12+(Classic+Retelling)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Profitable Retailer: 56 surprisingly simple and effective lessons to boost your sales and profits","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j7mxi5j3A_sC&dq=The+Profitable+Retailer:+56+surprisingly+simple+and+effective+lessons+to+boost+your+sales+and+profits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett, 2006 Literary Edition","description":"In this second volume of The Deals of Warren Buffett, the story continues as we trace Warren Buffett's journey to his first $1bn.

In this book, part biography, part literary criticism, she takes the reader into the mind of Freud, toward a better understanding of the thinker, his work, and art itself. The very idea of the subconcious as a constant, active presence in our daily lives was Freud s greatest contribution and has allowed generations of people to experience their lives more deeply. His rigorous exploration of the dynamism and structures of the subconscious, Chamberlain argues, was in itself an important work of art. Using Freud s own writing on art and the aesthetic theories of thinkers ranging from Nietzsche to Lionel Trilling, Chamberlain examines Freud s art and shows how his imaginative creations have revolutionized not only mental health, but our thinking about art in general, by opening up the individual subconscious as a subject. In elegant, accessible prose she describes how \\"Freud split the aesthetic atom, releasing a vast energy for individual creativity.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sh3479PzNPUC&dq=SECRET+ARTIST&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And the Band Stopped Playing: The Rise and Fall of the San Jose Symphony","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cgRkAAAACAAJ&dq=And+the+Band+Stopped+Playing:+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+San+Jose+Symphony&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flambards Divided","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Krishna and Orpheus: The great initiates of the East and West","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rtKfPwAACAAJ&dq=Krishna+and+Orpheus:+The+great+initiates+of+the+East+and+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archeology of Violence","description":"Interdisciplinary study of the role of violence in the Mediterranean and Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MvaXa_OtXfQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horsemen of the steppes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PyqkQgAACAAJ&dq=Horsemen+of+the+steppes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical Physics","description":"Mathematical physics plays an important role in the study of many physical processes   hydrodynamics, elasticity, and electrodynamics, to name just a few.

It has a structure with long conversations and extended debates, and much of its content is not found elsewhere. Jesus' relationship to the Father and his teaching on the Holy Spirit are given special prominence. Ultimately, faith, believing in Jesus, is at the centre- with signs highlighted to provoke faith, and stories of those who responded to Jesus as examples of faith. Colin Kruse ably shows how the Fourth Gospel weaves its themes of belief and unbelief into its rich Christology. The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world's most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable, and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series. These Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date, and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tQo9MQAACAAJ&dq=The+Epistles+of+John,:+An+introduction+and+commentary,+(The+Tyndale+New+Testament+commentaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cities and society: The revised Reader in urban sociology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9sivnQEACAAJ&dq=Cities+and+society:+The+revised+Reader+in+urban+sociology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected Poems: Edwin Morgan","description":"Edwin Morgan 'catches in full sight' in his lyric epiphanies, in the focus and refocus of sequences, the wily relocation of words in concrete poems, the weird rhythms of sound poems.

After a Stroke: 300 Tips for Making Life Easier is addressed to this wide audience. Because hospital stays after a stroke are often short compared to the lengthy period of rehabilitation and gradual return of function, After a Stroke concentrates on the home recovery process after a stroke and assists those patients and their families in attempting to grow from patient back to person. The author, a twelve-year stroke survivor and nurse, gives readers tips she learned and used herself during her recovery. She addresses topics such as communication, emotional liability, safety issues, personal care, relaxation techniques, and intimacy issues. The tips included in this book cover everything from dressing, hair care, cooking, and airline travel to using a computer and alleviating pain. Many activities that we take for granted can become a challenge after surviving a stroke. After a Stroke describes in detail how to accomplish daily living routines, combat fatigue, enjoy recreational activities, and how to turn stroke deficits into assets. The book frankly discusses self-esteem issues and using humor as a healing tool. No subject is off limits. Hutton leaves no gaps in relating what families and fellow stroke survivors need to know to live a full life post stroke. With over 300 tips to assist stroke survivors, this book offers tried and true methods for coping with the aftermath of a stroke. It is a very useful reference guide and can be read in sections depending on the reader's area of interest. The book's mission is to foster independence for people living with stroke and promote healing through a positive outlook.

The fear of food, as author Andrea Arnold calls it, is one of the most serious collective panic attacks we as a nation have ever experienced. Its instigators, well-known interest groups and the news media, are threatening the agricultural productivity of the nation with highly exaggerated stories of imminent hazards that upon investigation turn out to be low-level risks already being removed by our regulatory agencies. Modern agriculture of the kind that feeds hundreds of millions of people cannot thrive without safe controls on the myriad of pests that decimate crops annually. Properly tested and approved pesticides are essential to our survival. By spreading false and misleading scare stories of exaggerated dangers from pesticides, the instigators could very well cause public panic and ill-conceived political measures that would destroy America's farm productivity- and the American farmer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0u9AAQAAIAAJ&dq=Fear+of+Food:+Environmentalist+Scams,+Media+Mendacity,+and+the+Law+of+Disparagement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Red Scarf: A Mystery Novel","description":"Kay's striking resemblance to another draws her into a baffling case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ChV7twAACAAJ&dq=The+Red+Scarf:+A+Mystery+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Careers for People on the Move & Other Road Warriors","description":"Looks at job opportunities, training requirments, and salary statistics for such careers as trucking, bus driving, tax and limousine driving, and delivery services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-CqjPwPaRn8C&dq=Careers+for+People+on+the+Move&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spatial Epidemiology: Methods and Applications","description":"This is a new paperback edition of the well received text Spatial Epidemiology: Methods and Applications.

Resources for Teaching Middle School Science, developed by the National Science Resources Center (NSRC), is a valuable tool for identifying and selecting effective science curriculum materials that will engage students in grades 6 through 8. The volume describes more than 400 curriculum titles that are aligned with the National Science Education Standards. This completely new guide follows on the success of Resources for Teaching Elementary School Science, the first in the NSRC series of annotated guides to hands-on, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and other resources for science teachers. The curriculum materials in the new guide are grouped in five chapters by scientific area-Physical Science, Life Science, Environmental Science, Earth and Space Science, and Multidisciplinary and Applied Science. They are also grouped by type-core materials, supplementary units, and science activity books. Each annotation of curriculum material includes a recommended grade level, a description of the activities involved and of what students can be expected to learn, a list of accompanying materials, a reading level, and ordering information. The curriculum materials included in this book were selected by panels of teachers and scientists using evaluation criteria developed for the guide. The criteria reflect and incorporate goals and principles of the National Science Education Standards. The annotations designate the specific content standards on which these curriculum pieces focus. In addition to the curriculum chapters, the guide contains six chapters of diverse resources that are directly relevant to middle school science. Among these is a chapter on educational software and multimedia programs, chapters on books about science and teaching, directories and guides to science trade books, and periodicals for teachers and students. Another section features institutional resources. One chapter lists about 600 science centers, museums, and zoos where teachers can take middle school students for interactive science experiences. Another chapter describes nearly 140 professional associations and U.S. government agencies that offer resources and assistance. Authoritative, extensive, and thoroughly indexed-and the only guide of its kind-Resources for Teaching Middle School Science will be the most used book on the shelf for science teachers, school administrators, teacher trainers, science curriculum specialists, advocates of hands-on science teaching, and concerned parents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XgOdAgAAQBAJ&dq=Crime+Lab+Chemistry+(Old+Edition)+(Great+Explorations+in+Math&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Six Sigma Book for Healthcare: Improving Outcomes by Reducing Errors","description":"Annotation Consultant Barry; Amy C.

Daarbij bezocht de auteur alle Afrikaanse landen waar Heineken brouwerijen bezit, sprak hij bijna 300 betrokkenen en deed hij diepgravend archief- en literatuuronderzoek. Met zijn levendige en toegankelijke stijl geeft Olivier van Beemen bovendien inzicht in het moderne Afrika en de rol die het bedrijfsleven daar speelt.

A powerful call for conservation, and an exciting bird adventure  (The Boston Globe). What is it about the ivory-billed woodpecker? Why does this ghost of the southern swamps arouse such an obsessive level of passion in its devotees, who range from respected researchers to the flakiest Loch Ness monster fanatics and Elvis chasers? Since the early twentieth century, scientists have been trying their best to prove that the ivory-bill is extinct. But every time they think they've finally closed the door, the bird makes an unexpected appearance. To unravel the mystery, author Tim Gallagher heads south, deep into the eerie swamps and bayous of the vast Mississippi Delta, searching for people who claim to have seen this rarest of birds and following up sometimes more than thirty years after the fact on their sightings. What follows is his own Eureka moment with his buddy Bobby Harrison, a true son of the South from Alabama. A huge woodpecker flies in front of their canoe, and they both cry out,  Ivory-bill!  This sighting the first time since 1944 that two qualified observers positively identify an ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States quickly leads to the largest search ever launched to find a rare bird, as researchers fan out across the bayou, hoping to document the existence of this most iconic of birds.

For years, science and society have struggled with this question. Experts have put great effort into developing ethical principles and rules that adequately protect and respect volunteers in studies aimed at improving human health. But experts have missed something important. They have created a research ethics system without the help of people who know what it is like to be a research subject. This is a serious omission. Experienced research subjects can make valuable contributions to research ethics. People who have been in studies have information about the experience that other people can overlook. Their experience as subjects gives them special insights into ethics, too. Experienced subjects also know about problems that can lead people to refuse to join studies, or drop out before studies are complete. Scientists and ethicists often speak of subjects as partners in research, but the reality is quite different. Experienced subjects are rarely appointed to the advisory groups that create guidelines for ethical research, or to the committees that review individual studies to determine whether they meet ethical and regulatory standards. A large body of work describes the perceptions and viewpoints of people who have participated in research. But experts rarely use this material to guide improvements in human subject protection. Although subjects have the power to decide whether to participate in a study, they have little control over anything else that goes on in research. Silent Partners moves research subjects to the forefront. It examines what research participation is like for healthy volunteers and patients. It explains why subjects' voices should influence research ethics. Silent Partners shows how experienced research subjects can become real-not just symbolic-partners in research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x9koDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bridging the Gap: College Reading","description":"The first reading text to focus on how to read college textbooks, Bridging the Gap, by Brenda Smith continues to be the #1 textbook choice of developmental reading educators.

Rather than being ruled by fixed laws, nature is essentially habitual. All human beings draw upon a collective human memory, and in turn contribute to it. Even individual memory depends on morphic resonance rather than on physical memory traces stored within the brain. Morphic resonance works through morphic fields, which organize the bodies of plants and animals, coordinate the activities of brains, and underlie mental activity. Minds are extended beyond brains both in space and time. This fully-revised and updated edition of The Presence of the Past summarizes the evidence for Dr Sheldrake's controversial theory, reviews new research, and explores its implications for biology, chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology. In place of the mechanistic worldview that has dominated biology since the nineteenth century, this book offers a revolutionary alternative, and opens up a new understanding of life, minds and evolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SyeKFT9hPTUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder in the Cathedral and Other Poems by T.

In this volume, Starr covers the crucial postwar period--1950 to 1963--when the California we know today first burst into prominence. Starr brilliantly illuminates the dominant economic, social, and cultural forces in California in these pivotal years. In a powerful blend of telling events, colorful personalities, and insightful analyses, Starr examines such issues as the overnight creation of the postwar California suburb, the rise of Los Angeles as Super City, the reluctant emergence of San Diego as one of the largest cities in the nation, and the decline of political centrism. He explores the Silent Generation and the emergent Boomer youth cult, the Beats and the Hollywood \\"Rat Pack,\\" the pervasive influence of Zen Buddhism and other Asian traditions in art and design, the rise of the University of California and the emergence of California itself as a utopia of higher education, the cooling of West Coast jazz, freeway and water projects of heroic magnitude, outdoor life and the beginnings of the environmental movement. More broadly, he shows how California not only became the most populous state in the Union, but in fact evolved into a mega-state en route to becoming the global commonwealth it is today. Golden Dreams continues an epic series that has been widely recognized for its signal contribution to the history of American culture in California. It is a book that transcends its stated subject to offer a wealth of insight into the growth of the Sun Belt and the West and indeed the dramatic transformation of America itself in these pivotal years following the Second World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BvPQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jewish state;: An attempt at a modern solution of the Jewish question,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L33UAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Jewish+state%3B:+An+attempt+at+a+modern+solution+of+the+Jewish+question,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce encyclopedia of healing","description":"Edgar Cayce used his psychic trances to diagnose and treat illnesses from arthritis to epilepsy.

In 1963 Friedan's The Feminine Mystique was published, and since that time this writer, teacher, public intellectual, and passionate advocate of social and economic justice in America has remained in the public spotlight. Transforming her into the mother of modern feminism, her landmark book challenged the prevailing gender ideology in the country and ultimately led to one of the most profound movements for social change in American history. In these interviews her arguments about equity and fairness -- as well as the striking consistency of her views about men, women, and the American family -- provide a rich resource for scholarly research. The interview genre captures Friedan's immediacy, her passion, her wit, her candor, and her contradictions. In showing her political and philosophical development, they reveal her to be one of the twentieth century's most significant thinkers.

His play, Arden of Faversham, inaugurated a new genre of 'domestic' drama, set in near-contemporary England and concerned with issues of marriage, crime, and property rather than war and power. Arden dramatizes a notorious murder case of forty years earlier, in which a wealthy husband was killed by his wife and her lover. In Thomas Heywood's A Woman Killed with Kindness, a wife is caught by her husband in bed with his best friend, only to find that he takes unusual reprisals. The Witch of Edmonton combines a true-life story of witchcraft with a fictitious tale of bigamy and wife-murder, and The English Traveller deals with the unexpected and unwelcome changes people find when they return home after a lengthy absence. Part of the Oxford English Drama series, this edition has modern-spelling texts; a critical introduction that outlines the way all four plays raise powerful and complex questions about the English society in which their tragic events unfold; wide-ranging notes; a chronology of the plays from their sources to recent performance; and appendices relating to two of the plays: who wrote Arden of Faversham and when did Heywood write The English Traveller. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2lhxa9C1ggYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"90 Day Wonder - Darkness Remembered","description":"Cooper was a young US Navy officer who spent three years in the Pacific during World War II.

What texts, if any, come to mind when you consider what the scriptures might say about environmental ethics? To help readers think critically and clearly about the Bibles relation to modern environmental issues, this volume expands the horizons of biblical interpretation to introduce ecological hermeneutics, moving beyond a simple discussion about Earth and its constituents as topics to a reading of the text from the perspective of Earth. In these groundbreaking essays, sixteen scholars seek ways to identify with Earth as they read and retrieve the role or voice of Earth, a voice previously unnoticed or suppressed within the biblical text and its interpretation. This study enriches eco-theology with eco-exegesis, a radical and timely dialogue between ecology and hermeneutics.

Fifteen years after her father s death, Hilary Hemingway receives a curious inheritance: an audio cassette of Les, her father, telling outrageous stories about hunting with his famous older brother, Ernest Hemingway. Les clearly aims to amuse the listeners with tales of the Hemingway brothers hunting vicious ostriches, hungry crocodiles, and deadly komodo dragons, but where Les Hemingway gets serious is in defending and explaining his brother s reputation to a contemptuous Hemingway scholar. Hilary transcribes these stories, revealing the bond between two larger-than-life brothers and tells of her own quest to make peace with the painful parts of the Hemingway legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CdU4CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven pillars of wisdom,: A triumph","description":"In his classic book, T.E.

At first a shy Oxford scholar and archaeologist with a facility for languages, he joined and went on to lead the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks while the rest of the world was enmeshed in World War I. With its richly detailed evocation of the land and the people Lawrence passionately believed in, its incisive portraits of key players, from Faisal ibn Hussein, the future Hashemite king of Syria and Iraq, to General Sir Edmund Allenby and other members of the British imperial forces, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom is an indispensible primary historical source.

As Ricoeur says in his Foreword: Tolerance is a tricky subject: too easy or too difficult. It is indeed too easy to deplore intolerance, without putting oneself into question, oneself and the different allegiances with which each person identifies. In order to explore these complexities, he has gathered together a number of prominent thinkers from various parts of the world and areas of activity and invited them to reflect on the obstacles and limits to tolerance. The Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, issued by the United Nations in 1995, rounds up this remarkable collection of essays.

These two names have been inextricably joined since the two climbers disappeared on Mount Everest more than 75 years ago. Could they have been the first to reach the summit of the world's highest mountains-some 30 years earlier than Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay? Mallory's story has been well chronicled, but Irvine has always been overshadowed by his more famous climbing partner and little has been written about him. Who was he? Why was he invited by the British Everest Committee to join the 1924 expedition despite his limited mountaineering experience? And why did Mallory, 16 years his senior, select Irvine as his partner for the final assault on the summit? Julie Summers, great niece of Sandy Irvine, has been fascinated since childhood by the story of Uncle Sandy. In May 2000, Julie made an astonishing discovery: a long forgotten and unopened trunk containing Irvine's letters and photographs from Everest. Drawing on these and other material, Julie writes a revealing story of a fearless young adventurer whose life and death linked him with one of the greatest mountaineering legends of all time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hH3uxpxSrWoC&dq=Fearless+on+Everest:+The+Quest+for+Sandy+Irvine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese English Bible Traditional Union/Niv New Testament","description":"The first full-length monograph on the history of the translation of the Bible into Chinese, this book tells a fascinating story beginning with Western missionaries working closely with Chinese assistants. They struggled for one hundred years to produce a version that would meet the needs of a growing Chinese church, succeeding in 1919 with publication of the Chinese Union Version (CUV). Celebrating the CUV's centennial, this volume explores the uniqueness and contemporary challenges in the context of the history of Chinese Bible translation, a topic that is attracting more and more attention. Peng's experiences give her a unique perspective and several advantages in conducting this research. Like the majority of readers of the CUV, she grew up in mainland China. When Chinese Christians went through severe political and economic ordeals, she was there to witness the CUV comforting those who were suffering under persecution. She has participated in Chinese Bible revision under the United Bible Societies. She was also director of the Commission on Bible Publication at the China Christian Council and chief editor of the CUV concise annotated version (1998).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8-ssEAAAQBAJ&dq=Chinese+English+Bible+Traditional+Union/Niv+New+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NEGOTIATION: The Only Realistic Solution to the Continuing Threat of War.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YZp8mwEACAAJ&dq=NEGOTIATION:+The+Only+Realistic+Solution+to+the+Continuing+Threat+of+War.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Jury of Her Peers","description":"Here in one convenient volume are the two versions of the same story that Susan Glaspell wrote.

More amazing, all were critical and/or box office successes. What accounts for this explosion of interest? Much of the appeal of these films lies in our nostalgic desire at the end of the millennium for an age of greater politeness and sexual reticence. Austen's ridicule of deceit and pretentiousness also appeals to our fin de si cle sensibilities. The novels were changed, however, to enhance their appeal to a wide popular audience, and the revisions reveal much about our own culture and its values. These recent productions espouse explicitly twentieth-century feminist notions and reshape the Austenian hero to make him conform to modern expectations. Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield present fourteen essays examining the phenomenon of Jane Austen as cultural icon, providing thoughtful and sympathetic insights on the films through a variety of critical approaches. The contributors debate whether these productions enhance or undercut the subtle feminism that Austen promoted in her novels. From Persuasion to Pride and Prejudice, from the three Emmas (including Clueless ) to Sense and Sensibility, these films succeed because they flatter our intelligence and education. And they have as much to tell us about ourselves as they do about the world of Jane Austen. This second edition includes a new chapter on the recent film version of Mansfield Park.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nqf_Wj2Wwx4C&dq=Jane+Austen+in+Hollywood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Father's Island: A Galapagos Quest","description":"The author recounts her journey to the Galapagos Islands in an attempt to discover what happened to her father in the Galapagos after his flight from Nazi Germany, in a chronicle of her parents' marriage, her father's tragic death, and the evocative natural beauty of the Galapagos Island","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DIMmAAAAMAAJ&dq=My+Father%27s+Island:+A+Galapagos+Quest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Was So Much Older Then","description":"See:","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XfMUBQAAQBAJ&dq=I+Was+So+Much+Older+Then&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Achieve Ielts Teacher's Book","description":"'Achieve IELTS' prepares students for the International English Language Testing System, providing candidates with a strong grasp of key topics in language and communication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PK36OwAACAAJ&dq=Achieve+Ielts+Teacher%27s+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11","description":"In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, some of New York's leading authors of fiction, poetry, and dramatic prose reflect on the event.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z3oTCgAAQBAJ&dq=110+Stories:+New+York+Writes+after+September+11&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Six Names of Beauty","description":"Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but it's also in the language we use and everywhere in the world around us.

Then, without warning, the despised singer drops dead in the middle of a performance. That s the cue for audience member Detective Inspector Musgrave to make his grand entrance. But the able police investigator is unprepared for the complex drama awaiting him backstage, and a tragically twisted plot that includes dark secrets, jealousies, old grudges, and murder most foul. As always, the Edgar, Agatha, and Gold Dagger Awardwinning author of the Brother Cadfael Mysteries  writes with undiminished skill  (The Times, London).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QpVgCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortune's Rocks","description":"Fortune's Rocks transports the reader to the turn of the twentieth century, to the world of a prominent Boston family summering on the New Hampshire coast...

Casey's remarkable doctrine of Visionary Activist Astrology. In this reverently irreverent mystery school disguised as a book (in which each of the planetary gods is a professor), we are invited to think of our lives as spiritual detective novels. For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world. Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life. We can then become increasingly conscious players on the team of creation, capable of sharing our gifts with the world at this crucial historical time.

Formed into a brigade with the 2nd, 6th, and 7th Wisconsin, these Indiana soldiers fought their first real battle at Brawner Farm.

He could \\"age\\" a house and its furnishings to any period his client desired--and would pay for. Wilson's adventures were even more daring and varied, and his quick wit was legendary. In addition to getting rich on the Alaskan gold rush, he had careers as a singer, playwright, prizefight promoter, con man, real-estate salesman, and shady hotel owner.

There, in southwestern Chihuahua, terrain terminates at the edge of canyons; there mountains border the sky. In these pages, words by W. Dirk Raat and images by George R. Janecek are testimony to the endurance of the Tarahumara people. Today, roughly fifty thousand Tarahumaras continue living in ways similar to those of their ancestors, retaining many customs from their pre-Columbian past. At the same time, as outsiders modify the environment in an effort to subsist - and to profit - the Tarahumara have adapted their culture in order to survive. Contemporary Tarahumara culture is a product largely of the Jesuit era, from 1607 to 1767. The native people responded to the Spanish either by trying to live beyond the influence of the Church or by becoming Christianized Indians and seeking Church protection. This distinction still can be seen. However, even those who became Christian did not succumb to attempts to eradicate traditional religious and cultural practices. Rather they incorporated Christianity into their own world view. The nineteenth century saw the arrival of gold and silver miners and of American promoters seeking to extend their commercial empire into northern Mexico. The twentieth century has witnessed the Mexican Revolution and the emergence of the \\"mestizo age\\". In the canyon homelands of the Tarahumara, railroads and electricity have facilitated extensive timber and copper mining as well as increased tourism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5mS4w7j6Mt8C&dq=Doctrinal+Commentary+on+the+Book+of+Mormon,+Vol.+1-+First+and+Second+Nephi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvel Masterworks: The Invincible Iron Man Vol. 1 (Reprinting Tales of Suspense #39-50) (1992) (Marvel Masterworks Vol. 20)","description":"James Kakalios explores the scientific plausibility of the powers and feats of the most famous superheroes   and discovers that in many cases the comic writers got their science surprisingly right.

Created in 1872, Yellowstone has been at the center of efforts to conserve the nation's once vast western wilderness. In turn Yellowstone's history has demonstrated how complex those efforts to conserve it have been. As Schullery writes, \\"We inherited this great humming thing . . . Ever since then we have imagined ourselves wise enough to control it and have rushed to judge what is wrong with it. And every time we looked hard enough, we discovered that there was more wrong with our judgment than with Yellowstone.\\" This marvelously detailed book skillfully and objectively traces the park's social and ecological history from Pleistocene times to the present.

As late as the 1960s, the Wari' Indians of the western Amazonian rainforest ate the roasted flesh of their dead as an expression of compassion for the deceased and for his or her close relatives. By removing and transforming the corpse, which embodied ties between the living and the dead and was a focus of grief for the family of the deceased, Wari' death rites helped the bereaved kin accept their loss and go on with their lives. Drawing on the recollections of Wari' elders who participated in consuming the dead, this book presents one of the richest, most authoritative ethnographic accounts of funerary cannibalism ever recorded. Beth Conklin explores Wari' conceptions of person, body, and spirit, as well as indigenous understandings of memory and emotion, to explain why the Wari' felt that corpses must be destroyed and why they preferred cannibalism over cremation. Her findings challenge many commonly held beliefs about cannibalism and show why, in Wari' terms, it was considered the most honorable and compassionate way of treating the dead.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kNLXbTJ29EkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Combing Through Your Scraps","description":"An authoritative single-volume reference on the design and testing of electrostatic discharge (ESD) structures Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a serious challenge to the reliability of semiconductors, integrated circuits (ICs), and microelectronic systems on-chip ESD protection is a vital component of smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices.

He offers his perceptive observations on the subject of ice-fishing, getting lost, fishing at night, tournaments and the fine art of tying flies.

Always entertaining, often irreverent and illuminating, Gierach invites readers into his enviable way of life, and effortlessly sweeps them along.

But what does that really mean? Is it an indefinable hybrid? An anomaly in the history of poetry? Are the very words \\"prose poem\\" an oxymoron? This groundbreaking anthology edited by celebrated poet David Lehman, editor of The Best American Poetry series, traces the form in all its dazzling variety from Poe and Emerson to Auden and Ashbery and on, right up to the present. In his brilliant and lucid introduction, Lehman explains that a prose poem can make use of all the strategies and tactics of poetry, but works in sentences rather than lines. He also summarizes the prose poem's French heritage, its history in the United States, and the salient differences between verse and prose. Arranged chronologically to allow readers to trace the gradual development of this hybrid genre, the poems anthologized here include important works from such masters of American literature as Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, Ernest Hemingway, James Schuyler, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, and Elizabeth Bishop. Contemporary mainstays and emerging poets -- Robert Bly, John Ashbery, Charles Simic, Billy Collins, Russell Edson, James Tate, Anne Carson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Lydia Davis, among them -- are represented with their best work in the field. The prose poem is beginning to enjoy a tremendous upswing in popularity.

Lorelei Fuchs proposes the theological concept of koinonia, loosely translated as communion, as the key to moving the fractured churches toward a future unity. Fuchs challenges churches to move beyond mere dialogue to apply their ecumenical insights at the local level. She begins by relating the exegetical meaning of koinonia to its ecumenical meaning, tracing the place of koinonia both within the churches and between the churches. She then examines the concept in the extensive and fruitful dialogues that have taken place between Lutherans, Anglicans, and Roman Catholics, finally articulating a symbolic competence for communionality that provides a rich and workable way forward for church unity at all levels. Encompassing the latest in ecumenical thought within the Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran milieu, Koinonia and the Quest for an Ecumenical Ecclesiology provides a framework for moving closer to the reality of Christ's prayer that all may be one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UlFBjgU_37sC&dq=Koinonia:+A+Contemporary+Study+of+Church+Fellowship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concrete Eyes","description":"This popular, topically organized, and thoroughly updated child and adolescent development text presents you with the best theories, research, and practical advice that developmentalists have to offer today.

Spectacularly successful, this high-gloss portrait of glamorous living and sexual adventure would eventually draw some one million readers each month. Exploring the world created in the pages of America's most widely read and influential men's magazine, Elizabeth Fraterrigo sets Playboy's history in the context of a society in transition. Sexual mores, gender roles, family life, notions of consumption and national purpose-all were in flux as Americans adjusted to the prosperity that followed World War II. Initially, Playboy promised only \\"entertainment for men,\\" but Fraterrigo reveals that its vision of abundance, pleasure, and individual freedom soon placed the magazine at the center of mainstream debates about sex and freedom, politics and pleasure in postwar America. She shows that for Hugh Hefner, the \\"good life\\" meant the \\"playboy life,\\" in which expensive goods and sexually available women were plentiful, obligations were few, and if one worked hard enough, one could enjoy abundant leisure and consumption. In support of this view, Playboy attacked early marriage, traditional gender arrangements, and sanctions against premarital sex. The magazine also promoted private consumption as a key to economic growth and national well-being, offering tips from \\"The Playboy Advisor\\" on everything from high-end stereos and cuff-links to caviar and wine. If we want to understand post-war America, Fraterrigo shows, we must pay close attention to Playboy, its messages about pleasure and freedom, the debates it inspired, and the criticism it drew--all of which has been bound up in the popular culture and consumer society that surround us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zk_iBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ESSAYS, SPEECHES AND PUBLIC LETTERS.","description":"An essential collection of William Faulkner s mature nonfiction work, updated, with an abundance of new material.

Written by a Sailor whose service included sea duty in patrol craft, destroyers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers as both an officer and a \\"white hat,\\" this newest edition has been overhauled once again to reflect the current state of the ever-evolving U.S. Navy, including changes in uniforms, ratings, ships, aircraft, and personal policies, among many others. Primarily intended to serve Sailors (from seamen to admirals), this book has long been used by potential recruits, Navy buffs, and a cadre of dedicated collectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w9NzrgEACAAJ&dq=Bluejackets+manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolutely Fabulous","description":"Jennifer Saunders is Britain's best-loved comedienne, screenwriter and actress.
