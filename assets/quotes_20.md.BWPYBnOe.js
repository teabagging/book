There is much to be learned from this fascinating book, aside from the astonishing revelation that the blood of our first national hero lives on in an African American family. The book gives us a whole new set of heros - in the form of courageous, lively people of color, and of mixed race - who have been omitted from our texts. This is a generous gift to America and the author is to be applauded.

Ms Bryant has done some fascinating work researching her family's journey from the Bushfield plantation of 1785 through the Civil War and race riots in Chicago in 1919. You'll find much of this is mysteriously missing from our current high school history curriculum.

Was this man the son of George Washington? After reading this fascinating book I can say, YES HE WAS!I Cannot Tell a Lie is a deeply affecting story and I found myself moved by the plight of this courageous family as they struggled through two centuries to maintain their secret legacy throughout American history's most insensitive times.The characters are vivid and their story will haunt you for weeks after you've turned the last page. I can't wait for a movie to be made."},{"Title":"I Cannot Tell A Lie: The True Story of George Washington's African American Descendants","review":"A Quote from West Ford \\"Tell your children, tell them about the Old General. But don't tell nobody else' cause white folks won't accept it.\\"My initial thoughts on this book were \\"why did I volunteer to review this,\\" I wasn't partial to history, could barely keep up in school. I progressed to the foreword and realized this might be interesting. After completing the foreword, I noticed there were portraits of George Washington at age 25, West Ford age 21 and his mother Venus Ford. I was totally intrigued. The resemblance West Ford had to George Washington his father, was uncanny.I am sure the question at the forefront of your mind is how? So let me start there. Venus Ford was a mulatto slave for Massa John Washington, Master George's brother. Massa Johns' son Augustine was killed in a gun accident. The Washington family was grieving over the lost of Young Augustine, Master George's nephew. At the request of Massa John, Venus was asked to comfort the Old General. Venus understood comfort to mean lighting a fire and warming some bricks for his bed. Massa Johns' next words startled Venus, \\"Ah...Master George needs warming of another kind.\\" After that one night whenever he visited Bushfield or when Venus went with her Mistress to Mount Vernon, Venus became his sex slave.What was so different about this story from all the other influential white men who bedded mulatto slaves and wives of sharecroppers? Nothing. What's interesting is how the Fords kept their family secret legacy alive. The prologue opens with Elise Ford Allen, facing her 79th birthday and choosing the \\"special ones\\" who would continue the legacy of the family. Each generation had a chronicler, who would continue the legacy. How neat is that. I for one am happy they did this, imagine not ever knowing West Ford's story.This book is for everyone, young or old. History tells us that our first president and first lady birthed no children together. George Washington's first born was born of a slave not of Martha's womb. This was a different read for me. The author Linda Allen Bryant found a way to write about history and made it entertaining. At times I forgot this was a story of West Ford, George Washington's first born.Reviewed by Missy"},{"Title":"I Cannot Tell A Lie: The True Story of George Washington's African American Descendants","review":"The book is a great read, and contains documented evidence of the very strong connection of the Fords to the Washington family. I don't think you will find ANY slaveowners leaving a former slave 160 acres of land in a will without a family connection. That fact alone is proof to me of the relationship. Of course, it is easy to blame it on the ubiquitous \\"nephew,\\" as happened with the Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings case. Truth be known, there is unlikely to be a single Virginia founding-father-type, \\"aristocratic\\" slave-owning family without its black offshoot. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and these folks had total and complete power over their slaves, and nature was bound to take its course. I know of other stories such as this, and have a few in my family that will probably never be told, at least not by me. In my spouse's family, it was the ninth governor of Alabama. What a country this is!

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many.

The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been. Here you have charecters of honor and dignity who thought their honor was more important than life itself. Something modern society has lost."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"For anyone whose only expsure to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the Sherlock Holmes tales, this book will be an interesting read. It's a fantastic adventure book, featuring characters with depth set in a truly historical setting. Doyle did his research, and while the characters may be mostly fictional, the rest of the book is historically accurate."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"A romantic intperpretation of the 100 years war. Wonderful charectorization of archetypes of the period. Has an underlying populist and pro britania themes. Very fun."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"Did any of the other reviewers really read this book? This book is clearly about HONOR, and our aspiring knight is on his walkabout trying to decide where he should spend the rest of his life. Our hero is educated and an asset to the company. But his moral training gives him a perspective that makes ordinary people and situations fascinating. This book combines the best of the movie &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. There is humor and adventure here. But never forget, it's about Honor, even when the characters are less the honorable. This story would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"I seriously doubt that this really should be read to infants and preschoolers.

But the text on many of the pages in my copy is faded, like a bad photocopy. Legible, but faded. I'd return it, but if they're all like that, there's no point."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"This books is definitely the stuff of childhood dreams and imagination. Who among you can say they have never imagined themselves playing the part of the intrepid knight battling injustice or the damsel awaiting the return of his true love? The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale. It is gripping without being brutal but with the endearing quality of a bed time or fireside tale."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"I loved this book as a kid, and found new depths to it when I came back to it as an adult. A must-read! The breadth of imagination and the color and vividness of the descriptions are hard to match, and the characters are memorable -- Samkin Aylward the master-archer is my favorite."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The white company (Classics illustrated)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

It is full of amazing stories of just that: BRAVE MEN! Ernie Pyle was a war correspondant during WWII who wrote a column that was published back in the states. The guys he wrote about loved him and the public back home loved him too. When he was killed on an island in the Pacific in 1945 President Truman had all flags flown at half-staff in his honor! Read the book! I'm not going to spoil it by giving examples. I'm sure you can imagine some stories. Read the Book!"},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"What can I say about Ernie Pyle? One of the most well-known correspondents in WWII, he wrote with an empathy for the common infantryman that transcended his simple, eloquent prose. \\"Brave Men\\" is a collection of the articles he wrote while covering the war in Sicily, Italy, England, and France. Exceedingly modest, Pyle always downplayed his role while extolling the infantry fighting on the front lines, his beloved \\"dogfaces.\\" Pyle may not have thought that he was doing anything of importance, yet his articles served to bring the war home to an American public that was being fed a somewhat sugar coated version of the war by the government; in turn, the GI's loved Pyle as one of their own. He immortalized as many of them as he could in his articles, stating the names of the many men with whom he had contact, and often their full home address for good measure. He shared many of their hardships on the front lines, and now, more than 60 years later, his articles offer an insight into WWII for today's readers that is as poignant now as it was then. He makes the reader feel as if we know these men personally-they are our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, neighbors, friends. Impossible to put down, this book is the enduring legacy of a great man whose life ended much too soon (after surviving the European theater, he traveled to the Pacific at the request of the Navy, where a Japanese sniper took his life on the tiny island of Ie Shima, just off the coast of Okinawa); I would recommend this book to everyone I know with an interest in WWII."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"I read the book when I was in high school in the (1960's).

Once in a while there is a short column that made me wonder why did they include this in the book; it was if the publisher just &quot;through&quot; it in there just because; this is the reason for the 4 stars.

To say the military \\"exaggerated\\" is being unreasonably kind to them, they outright lied to the press and the press never questioned them.War Correspondents like \\"Little Ernie\\" Pyle would have laughed at \\"embeds\\" calling themselves reporters. Ernie traveled with the troops, shared their misery and privation, and wrote honestly about what he saw. He took care to censor some sensitive-information places himself, and most of all, he wrote about the individual soldiers he got to know. He could recognize the pretentious brass hats and saw the ground level G.I.'s and the America they came from and wrote passionately about the bravery of the front line infantry and artillery units.I've read other books by Ernie, based on his newspaper reporting, and each one shows the true cost of war. The death and wounds and combat fatigue of men in hard battle with a ruthless enemy.Burgess Meredith portrayed Ernie Pyle in a movie based on Ernie Pyle's writings, \\"The Story of G.I.

He learns what they do for their part of the war, learns where he had the wrong impressions about what they do, enjoys talking with them and relating their stories, funny ones as well as actual events.He is masterful in a description of employing just one word in an unusual way that rivets your attention, such as \\"As far as you could see in every direction the ocean was infested with ships.\\"He also includes his own reactions to things going on, such as \\"After it was over itseemed to me a pure miracle that we ever took the beach at all. For some of our units it was easy, but in the special Sector where I landed our troops faced such odds that our getting ashore was like my whipping Joe Louis down to a pulp.\\"I would recommend the publisher do two things for the next edition. This version had around 10 typographical errors in the first half of the book. It needs a thorough proofreading by a human who knows spelling well. The typesetter also eight times substituted the word \\"lie\\" for \\"he\\". It was disconcerting to read that, as it was like he was saying the men's stories were made up. I like to decide that for myself. This was not a polemical book, so I found that disfigurement particularly appalling.The publisher could also include in the back a simple one page Dictionary. There were around four terms used in the book I did not recognize from being a civilian and not living in the time of the writings. It would be nice to flip back there and find out what something like \\"barrage balloons\\" were, what they did, and how they did it."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"An excellent compilation of newspaper columns written by WWII war correspondent Ernie Pyle from the fighting in Europe and published in 1944. Pyle was killed the following year on Iwo Jima, but he was especially popular for his intimate style of reporting that focused on the perspective of soldiers instead of the generals.He says about D-Day: \\"I want to tell you what the [invasion] entailed, so that you can know and appreciate and forever be humbly grateful to those both dead and alive who did it for you\\" (pg. 360). And reading this book really gives you a feeling for what they went through, both the grueling horror and the intense boredom. He covers not only the infantrymen on the front lines but the artillerymen behind them and the fighter and bomber pilots above. He tells what their days were like, what they ate, what kind of reception the locals gave. He shares his experiences at sea with the Italian invasion, how the supply chain worked, and how difficult it was to rebuild bridges that were blown up by retreating Germans. He tells not only of \\"GI Joe\\" but of \\"Sad Sack\\" and all the others who served, no matter how gloriously or not. It was surprising at first to see soldier's names and home addresses, and I can imagine people watching his columns, hoping to see a familiar name or even writing to strangers. It's all done in his folksy way that must have forged a stronger connection between home and the front."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"\\"Brave Men,\\" by Ernie Pyle is an american literary classic. From the turning of the first page, the reader is taken back to a time when the world was aflame. Yet, the story is told through the eyes of the men who fought that war. Not the generals and the admirals or the heads of state, but the sailors and GIs and airmen who did the fighting, the bleeding and the dying.Pyle, arguably one of the finest writers of the 20th century, was worshipped by american fighting men and women. My father, who served in the US Navy in Europe and the Pacific bought a copy of Brave Men so that his friends and family \\"could see for themselves, how Americans fought and what they fought for.\\"America's finest hour came during World War II. Ernie Pyle was its finest chronicler of the events of that time."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"This is the third volume of World War II reporting from Ernie Pyle, the great war correspondent of the common soldier. It covers the Sicilian campaign and Anzio, England in the runup to the invasion of France, D-Day and the hedgerow campaign up to the liberation of Paris.Pyle gives us the soldiers-eye view. He rarely gets anywhere near the politics or even the grand strategy of the war. He wrote for the families and neighbors back home to give them some idea of what it was like for Americans at the front. His formula is pretty straightforward (what was this fellow before the war, what he is doing over here, the hardships he is enduring, the comradeship, fear, courage, boredom, and spectacle of it all, and what he hopes to do if he makes it back home).One thing that sticks out for a modern reader is how much our forces in World War II really were citizen soldiers, a cross-section of the whole country gone off to fight. The conscripts we sent to Vietnam were, for the most part, not joined by the sons of the rich or the middle class. Our all-volunteer military today is, by contrast with both of them, incredibly professional. I pray that we never again see the whole nation at war like this. But behind all of the tragedy and waste, there was something noble about it nonetheless.Ernie Pyle wrote one more volume of war memoirs (Last Chapter). It too was reporting, not reflection or analysis. We'll never know what he might have had to say looking back on it all from across the span of some years at peace. After so many close calls and near misses, he was killed by a Japanese machine-gun bullet just four months before the end of the war in the Pacific."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"Ernie Pyle was truly the soldier's reporter. I have the original wartime copy of \\"Brave Men,\\" and it's a work of genius. Pyle knows how soldiers feel, Army, Navy, Army Air Corps, from Privates to Sergeants to Lieutenants to Generals, Pyle brings their stories to life with a simple sort of clarity that nonetheless retains every ounce of power that original stories had. Many reporters told the stories of World War II, grand theaters, massive battles, staff meetings, generals, leaders, strategies. Ernie talks about privates, sergeants, lieutenants, the adrenaline highs and sheer terror of close combat or being surrounded by flak, the miseries of mud and rain and the joys of the girl at home and that package of fried chicken that some thoughtful mother sent. All the little things that make soldiers soldiers, and men as well.Pyle was nothing less than a genius, and his death on Ie Shima resulting from a Japanese sniper's bullet was a loss to journalism. But then, I'm at Indiana University Bloomington, within spitting distance of the Ernie Pyle School of Journalism, so I guess I'm biased. =D"},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"I had high hopes for this book by the famous Ernie Pyle. It is authorative, but it becomes tedious very quickly. There is no real story. It is a compliation of news clips with names and addresses of soldiers in different WWII theaters.

He wrote about the lives of the common soldier, sailor, airman. These are the \\"Brave Men\\". The guy that just does his job as best he can while trying to survive and get home in one piece. My father, a combat rifle platoon leader with the 9th division in France and Germany in 1944, once told me that he was no hero, and he wasn't brave, but he saw a lot of guys that were. Funny how they all say that. Ernie's book is about guys like my dad and a million other anonymous guys like him that did the dirty work of war. They're my heros."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"Ernie Pyle was one of the most effective and well known battlefield correspondents of World War II. Pyle's on-the-spot reporting gave the American public a firsthand view of what war was like for their boys on the front lines he followed American service men into the trenches, battlefield combats, field hospitals, and war ravaged cities of Europe. What he witnessed he was able to vividly record and describe with clarity, sympathy, and grit to give his readership an immediate and accurate sense of the foot soldier's experience. Brave Men is a collection of Pyle's wartime newspaper columns detailing the 1943-44 fighting in Europe and endures as a fitting monument to both one correspondent's courage and journalistic expertise and the battlefield experiences of a generation of young American soldiers in the European theater. Tragically, when Pyle went to the South Pacific to continue his wartime reportage, a sniper's bullet took his life in 1945.

The world of 1944 was at war and terrible things were happening on the battlefields of that world to perfectly average people. How they coped with it, overcame the ironic battlefield alternatives of horror and boredom, and marched on to victory is best recounted in the writings of Ernie Pyle. No one spans that range of experience with greater mastery than unassuming Pyle. There's no showing off here. He has one goal and one goal only: putting you right there with the American forces slogging through Italy and Normandy. His vivid dispatches preserves their fears and aspirations in a casual, offhand prose that charms you one minute and tears your heart out the next. No one loved the common soldier better nor observed his daily life with greater insight than Ernie Pyle. He recounts the whole of war, neglecting neither its horror nor its humor, neither the frontline nor the rear echelon. With deft care he selects the incidents that hit home, setting them against a background of individual soldiers going about their daily jobs. In doing so, Pyle conveys a sense of the scale of the great WWII military enterprise: from the lone soldiers huddling in foxholes to the great and complex machinery laboring behind the scenes to support them."},{"Title":"Brave Men","review":"One of the first grown-up books I ever read was a tattered copy of Ernie Pyle&#65533;s \\"Brave Men,\\" derived from his articles written from Sicily to France, 1943-44. Pyle was a man&#65533;s man of a journalist, and was loved by men and women of all ranks. People on the home front eagerly read his dispatches from fronts all over the world. Pyle wasn&#65533;t interested in criticizing the government or military. He was man enough to realize that both make mistakes, but to harp on them was a disservice. His subject was the fighting man: low-ranking soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and officers who did the dirty work. Men who drove mule trains up the Italian mountains and flew dive bombers over France. Men who strung telephone wires across North Africa and stormed the shores of Pacific islands. Men who manned anti-aircraft guns on ships and led platoons through the French bocage. He reported on the war with his wonderful prose and gift for storytelling until a sniper&#65533;s bullet claimed him during the Okinawa campaign in 1945.Ike and his top brass, once they understood how Pyle operated and once Pyle gained their trust, let Pyle go wherever he wanted and talk to whomever he wanted.

In this role, it became the prototype for all the thousands of commercial towns and cities that sprang up along railroads across the Midwest during the nineteenth century, as well as the crucible in which the Midwest's particular brand of evangelical protestant piety was first worked out. 'A Shopkeeper's Millenium' is by far the best examination of this important piece of American history I have found anywhere, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A SHOPKEEPER'S MILLENNIUM : SOCIETY AND REVIVALS IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, 1815-1837","review":"Paul Johnson's highly readable case study of Finney-inspired revivals in Rochester argues that these revivals were a response to the breakdown of social relationships involving work. His research finds that the revivals converted the relatively stable entrepreneurial class of Rochester who had recently abandoned former traditional employer-employee relationships where the employee boarded within the home of the employer. The revival legitimized this abandonment (and the resulting free labor system) by emphasizing the individual's moral freedom. Furthermore, the revival united the entrepreneurial class behind a mission-oriented Protestantism that enabled them to assert economic pressure, and a measure of social control, over the working class. While clearly sympathetic to the working class perspective, Johnson does not create a Protestant hegemonic conspiracy where none existed. Although one may dissent from his fundamental assumptions and approach, Johnson's argument is quite effective within the framework he has set for himself. I recommend this work to students of religion and society and antebellum reform."},{"Title":"A SHOPKEEPER'S MILLENNIUM : SOCIETY AND REVIVALS IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, 1815-1837","review":"Through patient research (six years in the making) and profound interpretation Paul E. Johnson has composed a small, but masterful, account of how the rising bourgeois class of Rochester, New York shaped its budding culture around religious action within the tsunami of pre-industrialism that was flooding American mill and manufacturing towns during the early nineteenth century. Taking Rochester as a representative microcosm of the new capitalist paradigm that was sweeping the new nation, A Shopkeeper's Millennium dissects the roots, causes, changes, and outcomes that occurred during 1815 to 1837 that paved the way to a new dominant culture where old paternalistic norms for social control gave in to devout religious internalization. Johnson's thesis centers around the climatic role that the Rochester religious revival of 1831 played in converting not only individuals first, but in the aftermath, Rochesterian society as a whole. The Rochester revival of 1831 played a! ! vital role in the Second Great Awakening. Rochester was the pivotal point in Charles Gradison Finney's rise to fame. As Peter Worsley in his book, The Trumpet Shall Sound, discovered that \\"charisma provides \`more than an abstract ideological rationale...It is a legitimation grounded in a relationship of loyalty and identification in which the leader is followed simply because he embodies values in which the followers have an interest.'&quot; Through Finney's charisma, converted Rochesterians; many being the master workmen or manufacturers; took the proverbial \\"bull by the horns\\" and ran with their new found paradigm--a paradigm that justified, through religious conversion, the acts that one social class should dominate another for economic gain. Prior to the 1831 revival, social construction in Rochester was quite different."},{"Title":"A SHOPKEEPER'S MILLENNIUM : SOCIETY AND REVIVALS IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, 1815-1837","review":"A Shopkeeper's Millennium is in response to new interest in the Great Awakening. But while previous studies have explained the growth of multiple cities during this time period, Johnson's book focuses entirely on Rochester, arguing that it was \\"America's fist inland boom town\\" (33). A combination of factors, including improvements in inland transportation and prime geographical location, made Rochester an ideal place for opportunity and social mobility, according to Johnson. His book utilizes many rags to riches stories that effectively demonstrate how farmers started to become businessmen, which increased their revenues (16). One example is Johnson's illustration of how two of the ten richest men in 1827 Rochester grew up in poverty (28). The promise of rags to riches experiences led to an increase in migration from those seeking to advance their economic status, and Johnson discusses how this increased influenced and changed people's relationships, especially as citizens were constantly moving. With all of this social upheaval, Johnson argues, many turned to the churches for stability. With this milieu of social forces came the emergence of distinct social classes and pronounced party politics. Ultimately, Rochester offers a rich account of how these classes and party politics operated in early 19th century New York.This book effectively explains how party politics emerged in response to the newly distinct social classes. According to Johnson, social classes started to become distinct after 1825. Johnson believes this happened because some of the middle class started to move away from their businesses and into side streets while the working class started to live in their own residential areas. Although some middle and working class peoples started to live in their own areas, there were some who decided to live in a mixed class area (48). Because of these distinct neighborhoods, political parties started to emerge to serve their interests. In particular, the book discusses how Whigs drew their support from church members and the middle class while Democrats drew their support from the working class (129). This created class conflict because each political party had its own class interest. For example, the Whigs cracked down on drinking by limiting four grocery licenses at forty and fifty dollars each (131). Workingmen were most affected by this policy because they became heavy drinkers during the revivals (58). This forced every drinking establishment in working class neighborhoods to either go out of business or operate illegally (131). Johnson successfully demonstrated the emergence of party politics through an effective use of methodology.Johnson uses an effective use of methodology in this book. The author uses first hand accounts to provide a better description. For example, the author used a first hand account to effectively describe theatre crowds as being \\"rowdy\\" (54). The author uses statistical analysis to demonstrate change. He used statistics to show the changes of householders headed by proprietors from 1827 to 1830, which showed a decrease in percent change (107). Another effective use of statistical analysis was \\"In 1826 an editor estimated that 120 persons left Rochester every day, while 130 more arrived to take their place\\" (36). This shows the difficulties of lower class peoples to settle in. A Shopkeeper's Millennium uses first hand accounts and statistical analysis to achieve the goals of this book.Although this book is a detailed account of Rochester, it does have some weaknesses. One of the main weaknesses of the book is that it does not provide enough background information about the Great Awakening. Also, it provides little information about the women's reaction to the changes. Women's reactions to this economic and social change are as important as other groups because women belong to the same social structure. Another weakness of this book is that it could have been longer. As mentioned earlier, the book could have added much needed background information as well as women's reaction to make this book longer and more effective. Even though A Shopkeeper's Millennium has many strengths, the weaknesses make this book fall short of being great.Overall, A Shopkeeper's Millennium is a good book that is well written. This well-written book is also well organized. Each chapter's goal is clearly defined and has an effective introduction, body, and conclusion. Unlike other books in this genre, A Shopkeeper's Millennium focuses on the transformation of one city instead of multiple cities. This allows the author to show effects on different social groups more effectively by their responses to policies that directly affected them. This book is also well written and easily understood by anyone who is interested in Rochester, New York during 1815-1830. A Shopkeeper's Millennium is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the economic, political, religious, and social transformation in early America."},{"Title":"A SHOPKEEPER'S MILLENNIUM : SOCIETY AND REVIVALS IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, 1815-1837","review":"This is one of the textbooks my daughter needed for her college class.

Any thoughtful socialist wants to, in fact need to, know how the various classes in society were formed, and transformed, over time. A lot of useful work in this area has been done by socialist scholars. One thinks of E.P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, for example. One does not, however, need to be a socialist to do such research in order to provide us with plenty of ammunition in our fight for a better world. Shopkeeper's Millennium by Paul E. Johnson is such a work.One can disagree with Professor Johnson's conclusions, and perhaps aspects of his methodology that relies very heavily on the interpretation of governmental and church records. He has nevertheless written a very interesting case study of Rochester, New York as a prime example of how America in the 1820's and 1830's, that is at the infancy of American capitalism, turned from a wilderness into an important new center of capitalist development as the Eire Canal became a cog in the transnational transportation system. Johnson has also provided some useful insights into the role that religion, especially the \`born again' evangelical religion that we are familiar with today, helped form the prevailing capitalist ethos that drove this expansion forward.Professor Johnson uses the well-known sources (city directories, tax assessments, censuses, Church registries) to flesh out his argument. One can take exception to some of his conclusions based on rather scanty data (and on the reliability of such data in a very mobile and transient environment). However the overall thrust of his work makes the important point that this period turned this part of America away from a sleepy agrarian/mercantile society to a rather dynamic capitalist one within a relatively short time. And, moreover, the social preconditions that fostered such growth were not merely accidental but represented the expansion of an already stable elite ready to take advantage of the new mode of production. In short, as we have seen at other previous nodal points of history (and today, as well) the rich and able have a leg up when the new riches are to be distributed.Religious indoctrination, strict social mores, intense social pressure and flat out coercion are detailed here as ways in which the budding capitalist class dominated the society. Religious revivals, anti-Masonic struggles and various social reform campaigns, particularly the fight against 'demon' whiskey, play their part. As does plain old-fashioned politics that we are very familiar with. Perhaps not as familiar is how political sides were chosen in various local fights, like the closing of dram shops, despite common religious affiliation.The key struggle in forming the capitalist mode of production was the effort to discipline a reluctant workforce to the tasks at hand. That was achieved in Rochester by many of the old tricks like coercion, ostracism and shunning that we have seen elsewhere at the rise of capitalism, particularly in England. In an interesting sidelight Professor Johnson details the change over, in a fairly short period of time , from workers being housed under the paternalistic supervision of their employers in their homes to the establishment of separate working class quarters. This is a big step in the forming of class-consciousness, both ways.Such details are the stuff that makes this an interesting study.Is this what today's working class looks like in a \`post-industrial' American society? No. However many of the same techniques of domination still hold sway. Read this book about the days when American capitalism was a progressive force in the world. And begin to understand why it needs to be fought tooth and nail now."},{"Title":"A SHOPKEEPER'S MILLENNIUM : SOCIETY AND REVIVALS IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, 1815-1837","review":"Though Johnson does his homework in bringing Rochester and revivals to life, the book is too short.

Like so many other athletes in his time Delahanty lived for today rather than postpone immediate gratification for a greater future reward. The lure of the racetrack while wintering in New Orleans and later alcohol were contributing factors leading up to the decline of this once great superstar. &quot;The Only Del&quot; toiled for unheralded losing teams such as the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Senators. Baseball wars were on and Delahanty had the problem of not caring how many contracts he signed as long as he played with the team that offered him the most money. I felt the author did a good job of sorting through the possibilities regarding Delahanty's death on the International Bridge crossing the Niagara River between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York. Delahanty was removed from the train for abusive behavior, and from what information we have available it appears that he stumbled over railroad ties in an effort to elude the bridge watchman. His body was discovered below the Canadian Horseshoe Falls in the Niagara River one week later on July 9th. This was an era in which the owners had it all their way, and players had no financial benefits that today's players enjoy. Players usually reentered the regular workforce once their playing days were over. Delahanty, however, lived lavishly during his playing days without a thought to his post-playing days. Information is also provided on his baseball playing brothers in addition to his wife and daughter after Ed's death.

It is fascinating to see the 1890s version of the immature superstar with only one marketable skill (crushing a baseball) as he tries to cope with personal and family problems as that skill rapidly deteriorates. You know the outcome, but it is still a great read. I found the descriptions of the Phillies management very interesting, and learned a few new things about John McGraw.

Even Larry Anderson, one of the Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters, was unaware of how teh late Phils slugger Ed Delahanty died. (I'm not telling you, you'll find out easy enough, anyway.) He only found out recently during a blow out game, when a certain player had a chance for hitting 4 home runs in single game. A feat, which was accomplished by the Only Del.In the 1890's, the Phillies had one of the best teams ever to be featured on a baseball diamond. None the less, they were never able to put together a champion. Most of the blame should go to the Phillies owners, who insisted on paying their players far below their worth, and the hiring of string after string of bad managers, not to mention constant inteferance with said managers by the Front Office.Of Course, the players didn't have much say in any of these things. They could do what they did on the playing field, but a pay raise was hard to come by. In fact, many players saw their salaries go the other way during the 1890's. The reserve clause bound you to your team, and the others in the league weren't allowed to sign you. This set of circumstances led to the creation of the short lived Player's League in the early part of the 1890's and later the formation of the American League in 1901. (At least in part.)Ed was one of the many great Irish players in baseball at the time. The Irish far outnumbered any other minority in baseball during this period. Irish Ed was one of the greatest players of his (or any other) time, and other teams repeatedly offered the Phillies rather large sums of money in exchange for Big Ed. Ed batted over .400 for a good chunk of his career, and played at every position except pitcher and catcher. He was an amazing left fielder, but kept being moved back to first base for various reasons. (Injuries to other player's, mostly.)Ed had a love for the arts, and this is the only part of the book that is never really expanded on. Big lived a \\"Superstar\\" lifestyle without much regard for his or his families future, rather foolishly thinking that baseball could support him forever. Sadly, he only wanted to be paid what he was worth, and this led him to jump to the American League's Washington Senators in 1902. The departure of Delahanty and the core of the great Phillies team left the Phils in such a state that it took the franchise years, even decades to recover.Big Ed didn't seem to be as loved in Washington as he was in Philadelphia. At first, maybe, but as time went on, most of the media and cranks (Rowdy bleacher fans) turned on him. During this period of time, Ed began his descent that would end in his death. He had problems with gambling and alcohol late in his life, and after losing a good chunk of cash betting on the racetrack Ed attempted to jump back to the National League for the New York Giants. It was a lucrative contract with a huge, unheard of, bonus for it's time. But it didn't work out. Ed was beset by the owners of the Phillies and Senators, and the rest of the League Owners, and eventually during the winter and spring of 1903, Ed was forced to return to the Senators.He had already spent most of his bonus, and the two teams agreed to take the money out of Ed's salary. Ed was now being paid almost nothing for his services, and debts began to mount for him and his family.Ed continued to have deeper and deeper problems with alcohol, depression, and gambling as the season went on, in that order. He wasn't in great shape, and his playing suffered at times. Finally, desperate, drunk, and depressed Ed decided to try to Jump again to the Giants after a few players had successfully switched leagues just recently. After a drinking binge and subsequent confrontation by his monther and teammates in Detroit, Ed boarded a train leaving them behind and heading across Canada for Buffalo, where he would switch to a train bound for New York. He never told anyone where he was heading, and even left his mother strnaded in Detroit, with no money to return to Cleveland, their familiy home.He never arrived in New York. It is a sad tale, but a tale worth reading. Casway has written a fine book, one of the most detailed books about baseball ever written. The Life and Times of Ed Delahanty will come to life in this book. It truely was the Emerald Age of baseball, and it should not ever be forgotten again. If you think for a moment that my desciption of this book in any way gives you the jist of the story, you are sadly mistaken. No review could come close to ever doing this magnificent book justice.

It is thoroughly researched. I could not put this book down once I started reading it."},{"Title":"Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball","review":"I just finished reading Jerrold Casway's epic work which focuses on the life, times and career of \\"contract-jumper\\" Ed Delahanty, little-known (at least to me, up until I read this book) Hall of Fame baseball player who starred in the late 1800s- early 1900s.This book is painstakingly and meticulously researched (45 pages of footnotes alone, no less!)-- and the enormity of this undertaking by a highly skilled author is readily apparent with every turn of the page. Anyone who appreciates and enjoys the game of baseball (formerly called \\"Base Ball\\" as so documented in the book) should find this to be a VERY insightful read-- not only about the EVOLUTION of our National pastime (artfully related IN CONTEXT with key news, events, and \\"snapshots\\" of the surrounding world outside-- i.e. Presidents, wars, strife, natural disasters, etc. at any given time along the continuum in which the story is being told)-- but also about the life, times, mighty feats, travails and the ultimate demise of a skilled but wanton, highly intemperate (off the field) slugger.To this reader, it became apparent while reading this masterpiece is that a great many parallels can be drawn from a MANAGEMENT/PLAYER relations standpoint between today's game and that of yesteryear. In other words-- \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same\\". I have now learned that adversarial relationships have always existed between these parties. This is not at all unique to today. Skilled ballplayers sought the highest bidder for their services then, as now. Ed Delahanty, though, was the ultimate \\"contract-jumper\\". He'd strike a new deal while the ink was still drying on another one that he had just signed. Being mindful of the limited window of opportunity that he had (before his playing skills would deteriorate), he played this card for all it was worth-- or not.The game was in a rather constant state of \\"flux\\" during Delahanty's time-- what with new \\"upstart\\" leagues raiding the incumbent leagues for key talent. Legal decisions and eventual reversals of those decisions abounded. Signed contracts would ultimately be voided by the courts. The emotional turmoil of being \\"caught in the middle\\" of this tug of war.. A \\"pickle\\" of his own making.. Whilst feeling the \\"crunch\\" of legal obligation to several teams at once-- was a source of great distress to Delahanty... and helped lead to his eventual demise... His liquor problems notwithstanding.But there is much, much more to the story. I simply suggest that you just pick up this book and read it. You will not be disappointed. Another aspect that I thoroughly enjoyed was the manner in which the author \\"works in\\" various \\"snippets\\" of columns written by the sportswriters of that era-- offering their \\"take\\" on the various baseball news items-- and there are many-- that came up. This book is extremely well-documented.One caveat- unless you are a Evelyn Wood grad, you will find it very difficult to \\"speed-read\\" through. That is because a great many paragraphs are jam-packed with facts and detail. This book is also written for the intelligentsia amongst the baseball/Irish history buff contingent. In other words, this is a college-level book. If your reading level is 6th-grade, for example, you may not be able to keep up. On the other hand, this book is VERY intellectually stimulating to those of us that truly appreciate MASTERFUL application of the English language-- a very COLORFUL and ARTFUL one, at that. So, grab your favorite beverage, curl up on the couch and enjoy this fine work.I rate this book FIVE AND A HALF-STARS OUT OF A POSSIBLE FOUR!Tim Fitzgerald, Chicago IL"},{"Title":"Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball","review":"As the author of a later 2004 release, Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat, I was excited to buy a copy of Jerrold Casway's Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball. Kelly and Delahanty are the first 19th-century Hall of Famers of Irish descent to be the subject of full-length books. Each of ours seeks to be the standard biography of our subjects, and Casway didn't have as much of a head start (Kelly was treated in an 1888 ghostwritten autobiography, the first book about a professional baseball player, and in Marty Appel's 1996 Slide, Kelly, Slide).In the 1880s, Kelly was to baseball, in a more animated way, what Delahanty was, in a more workmanlike way, in the 1890s. Casway likes social history, and he relates Delahanty's Irishness to the general status of the Irish in 19th-century America (he had written a 1999 essay in the Encyclopedia of the Irish in America entitled &quot;Irish American Factor and the Emerald Age of Baseball&quot;). To make Delahanty's story whole, he has unearthed personable information about Delahanty and his family, and his &quot;Irish Kid from Cleveland&quot; chapter is arguably the most interesting chapter of the book.I find Casway's book most similar to Reed Browning's about Cy Young, as both were fairly stoic figures or at least covered without great detail to outside interests. A case in point is that Delahanty adored the theater, and even founded a social group featuring athletes, actors and businessmen. But reporting on that great love of his was apparently scant as it is limited to a few pages of the book. Kelly loved the theater as much as Delahanty and, in part because of Kelly's own stage career which included recitations of &quot;Casey at the Bat,&quot; a lot more was said about his relationships with theatrical personalities and other players who performed on stage (who thus had a sense of the theatrical), especially Cap Anson and Arlie Latham.Delahanty's arguably greatest significance was as a power hitter, when leading the league in doubles (which Delahanty did five times) was to batting what leading the league in home runs is today. Casway adequately reflects that aspect of his play while wrapping his career broadly around social history themes. Arguably Delahanty's main appeal today is his mysterious death, and the author is able to write definitively on the subject especially because of a prior book on the subject: Mike Sowell's July 2, 1903."},{"Title":"Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball","review":"ED DELAHANTY-THE ONLY MAN TO WIN THE BATTING TITLE IN BOTH THE NATIONAL AND AMERICAN LEAGUES (1899 AND 1902)WITH THE PHILLIES AND SENATORS DIED A TRAGIC DEATH IN 1903.HE ONCE HIT 4 HOMERS IN A GAME- ALL IN SIDE THE PARKERS!

With the exclusion of Negroes, Latins etc. Irish did stand out as a \\"colorful\\" minority."},{"Title":"A Framework for Task-Based Learning (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"How can we get students to learn? &quot;I've taught them, but they didn't learn&quot; is one of the most common complaints ELT teachers make, especially when it comes to grammar and pronunciation.Another problem is preparing students for real life - how should we choose the vocab/grammar to teach - things that will be really useful and how can learners be prepared for the listening, reading, writing and speaking they will need to do in the 'real world' that lies outside the classroom.In her brilliant book, Jane Willis will guide you in small easily manageable steps from the latest research into how languages are learnt to a concise guide to implimenting a new paradigm in language teaching that addresses all the issues above. Everything is backed up by clear theoretical reasoning and lots of practical examples.The bibliogaphy alone is worth the price of the book as all the books, ranging from deeper theory through to fantastic textbooks and resouce books, are ALL superb - buy all these books and you'll have a mindblowing library of ELT books!Finally, if you want more you can read her husband's (Dave) book The Lexical Syllabus which parallels this book illustrated by lots of examples from her astonishing but sadly long out of print 'COBUILD English Course series' (which I have a copy, hee, hee!)Adjectives cannot do justice to just how good this book is!"},{"Title":"A Framework for Task-Based Learning (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"Jane Willis takes the completely ignorant, (that would be this reviewer), and gives them a thorough grounding in the principles and ideas that go into Task-Based Learning. In a book that is very practical and accessible, Willis gives quite a detailed introduction that is still very usable in the classroom.Willis breaks down the three major phases of a Task-Based lesson and addresses each in turn, effectivley taking the reader through a very detailed lesson overview. With excellent diagrams and pictures to help, there is little to get confused about. There are also sections with plenty of advice for getting the most out of TBL and what problems one may encounter. There are also some good sample lessons to back all this information up.In short, this book is without peer as an entry point into Task-Based Learning and what it is all about. I really enjoyed this book and found it exceptionally valuable. Without hesitation, I recommend this one for your EFL library."},{"Title":"A Framework for Task-Based Learning (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"An excellent introduction to TBL for Tefl teachers.A useful book for anyone in the industry,but particularly useful for Diploma candidates because of the nice mixture of theory and examples.

It is not up to date reporting and discussion on the latest task-based SLA research.This is not so much a criticism of the book (I admire anyone, even people somewhat removed from everyday teaching, attempting to translate research and research concepts into real-world teaching knowledge) as it is a charge against task-based learning. For a start, it oversells output. If you teach beginning level EFL, for example, in a monolingual environment, most students won't produce much output in English, what they do produce will not be understood by the other beginning learners, and both learners will soon lapse into speaking their shared native language.So the real task for classroom teachers in EFL and even a lot of ESL situations is how to provide abject beginners enough experiences of the foreign or second language to build up their own mental grammars and lexicons that they can use to speak and write. Hint, it won't be done by naively pretending you can recreate the US or UK circa 2007 in your EFL classroom in Japan or Korea or Taiwan or China. Output tasks that simply lead to breakdowns in communication and lapses into L1 are not much of an accomplishment either.If all the SLA research and researchers disappeared over night, Language Teaching would still go on pretty much as it is. This, at least, is one book coming out of SLA 'opinions as established/establishment knowledge' that could justifiably retained for 'day zero'."},{"Title":"A Framework for Task-Based Learning (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"Longman! Why is this out of print? I have had to summarize, paraphrase and even (gasp) copy many of these chapters for my Korean preservice teachers in Seoul! I really believe that TBLT and CBLT are the future of language teaching and learning in this country's context. And out of all the texts I've seen for learning about task-based teaching and learning, l think this is the most accessible and easiest to use with non-native English speaking teachers who have never taught or who have limited teaching experience. The language is straight-forward. There are are so many examples. It is so well organized. And it even has a chapter on how to use TBL with beginners and children.

It's small size may be a benefit to those looking for a quick treatment, however, so if it is the Cliff Notes to TBL that you are looking for, this may well be it. However, the diminutive size also ensures that it can only touch lightly on the underlying theory. Also, one should be aware that this is not really a book about &quot;How to TBL&quot;, but rather about &quot;How to TBL with a LEXICAL SYLLABUS&quot;. The author has obviously been heavily influenced by her husband in this regard. So if you don't agree with the precepts of a lexical syllabus, you are not going to agree with a lot of this book.I give it 4 stars instead of 3 due to two outstanding ideas it presents: one concerns the importance of a &quot;cold task&quot; wherein learners cannot rely on short-term memory and imitation to perform; the other introduces a method whereby native or high-level speakers are recorded performing each task, and these recordings are then used for learner tasks. This idea even allows structuring a syllabus with regard to linguistic complexity, since one can then know in advance exactly what structures high-level speakers tend to use in a given task. Interestingly, this idea also effectively undermines a key argument in favor of the lexical syllabus, which the book is trying so hard to sell."},{"Title":"A Framework for Task-Based Learning (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"&quot;I've taught them it but they didn't learn it&quot; is one of the comonest complaints made by ELT teachers.

An area beclouded thus far. Chapters 3 and 16 thoroughly present duties attaching on the assured, failling which triggers misrepresentation per commissionem and that of a per ommisionem nature. The draconian nature of warranties is effectively unbuttoned, thus the author does give a glance to an incontemtible standards and failure by the insured to 'stick to what he\\\\she warranted'.Bennett passionately, although at pain, the resulting repudiation of the policy by the insurer in case of breach of warranty. An insurer's absolute trump card!Chapter 4 does no wonders to contribute to the insurance intermediary question, but from the insured's angle it creates a heaven, since it tackles the scope and content of his\\\\her mandate or instructions given to the insurance broker.On chapters 7;8;9;10;11;12 and 13, Bennett demonstrates a depth of scholarship in his commentary on the insurable risks. Note that the most commonly used clauses in marine insurance are those of the ICC (see Appendix ii of the work under review.The work adequately journey through maritime risks and insurance in respect thereof thus ensuring security for the interested parties. Chapters 14 and 15 essentially corroborates the unanimous opinion (academic, usage, and otherwise) regarding the moment when the consignment is covered, and termination thereof. Chapter 17 comprehensively coveres what is generally known as 'cession' and authors indepth learning and observance of case law, serves as proof that this book achieved its goal i.e to contribute immensely towards a student who ventures the field, at the same time seeking to revolutinize the marine insurance law as it stands.Lastly chapters 18;19; and 20 are taken together since they all address the question of indemnity. Althogh ch.20 differs slightly since it addresses an insurer right to 'come into the shoes' of the assured, insurance is not an investment thus if some third parties are liable towards the insured, he\\\\she must subrogate such rights arising therefrom to the insurer.Having this review in mind (see also the Preface of Bennett's work) the work is of a high standard. The journey undertaken by the author strengthens international trade in a sense that as the scope of marine insurance is subjected to 'litmus test', those interested in a subject but above all those engaging in sale contracts are assured of their respective obligations. The work remains a reliable witness that certainty or even uniformity can be achieved.Schorlarly engineered; develishly presented; and downwright a international, if not eternal, mouthpiece !"},{"Title":"The Scholarship Book 2003: The Complete Guide to Private-Sector Scholarships, Fellowships, Grants and Loans for the Undergraduate","review":"This book was simply a waste of money-awful.

But going out one night, my friend got me to try a full face of make-up, and I looked pretty good. This book helped me do it on my own. It was a great starting point, easy to follow with great pictures. I learned how to take care of my skin better and it looks healthier. I also found with the help of the color chart some new and different choices to make with my clothes, and it even suggested accent colors to compliment your main outfit color. You can't always wear black! The skin type chart helped me realize that I actually have combination not oily skin. Oily skin would be especially oily in your t-zone and then all over.

The information on skin care was helpful."},{"Title":"The African American Woman's Guide to Successful Makeup and Skincare, Revised Edition","review":"The skin type chart in the book is just plain confusing. You'd have to read the whole chart in the book to see what I mean. It's on pages 46 and 47. For an example, in the column for oily skin where it asks in the section 'does your skin feel greasy or slick?' it gives you the options 'T-zone' and 'all over'. What is this supposed to mean when 'T-zone' is an option in all of the columns? This doesn't make any sense. Another section in the chart asks the question,'If you bathe with deodorant soap, how does your face and body skin feel after an hour, without any type of moisturizer?'. My skin feels comfortable after this so I picked the option 'Oily forehead eyelids, nose, and chin' which is in the column for oily skin, but the chart next asks 'What do your pores look like?'. My pores look invisible, but this was in the column for dry skin. It's impossible for someone to have dry skin and oily skin all at the same time!Now for the confusion of the color chart. The color chart says that the complimentary accent colors for dark complexions (specifically where it says 'dark skin') are: yellow etc., but in the section of the chart where it says 'medium skin' it reads on with more information about dark skin saying people with medium brown and dark complexions, in general, are flattered by colors with blue undertones, rather than yellow. HOW CONFUSING! By the way, what are complimentary accent colors?

She refused to comply with directors' wishes for her to dirty her fingernails and she cared much more about the way she looked than her acting abilities. Unfortunately, few of her films survive today, so we have little to judge her on, which is why this book is so valuable. With that said, this book is slightly disappointing. Instead of coherant explanations on events in her life or films that she worked on, Madge mainly gives a short recap and excuses her behavior based on the arguement that she does not know why she did what she did. This excuse is often given by middle school aged children who follow the crowd, not elderly film stars. Film stars tend to be a lot of egotists who carefully plan their lives and enjoy reflecting on them. It seems she is contrary to this stereotype, but it makes one wonder why she wrote the book. She might have been intelligent- she enjoyed reading a great deal- but she certainly wasn't a mature woman, even at the end of her life. Thankfully, there are some interesting stories and plenty of excellent photographs to see. They help us piece together a career that is largely lost due to the decay of time.Also included are letters sent to Madge. These are interesting as examples of how silent stars' careers were dealt with and we get a taste of the writing style of the time. In addition, a filmography is included and an introduction is written by film historian Kevin Brownlow."},{"Title":"A darling of the twenties: Madge Bellamy","review":"Madge Bellamy is not a name the average person, or even the average movie buff, would know - her fame rests on two films, John Ford's silent classic OLD IRONSIDES and especially the talkie WHITE ZOMBIE, made on the cheap in 1932 but recognized for decades now as one of the essential horror films of the era. Madge was one of those big-eyed innocent looking starlets so popular during that the silent era and was a good if unremarkable actress. She was also quite cute, beautiful even, and appealing on screen. Perhaps her greatest personal success was the silent version of LORNA DOONE, which has been rediscovered in recent years and is currently available on DVD.DARLING OF THE TWENTIES is Madge Bellamy's autobiography published coffee-table book style with many large photos throughout the text. Opening with a warm and sympathetic introduction by the silent film historian Kevin Brownlow, Madge recounts her life from her troubled relationship with her parents, her years of stardom at Fox Studios to her fall from grace in the early years of talkies (she unwisely had a spat with the studio just as the new talkie era was beginning and despite having a hit with her talkie debut MOTHER KNOWS BEST she left the studio and was unable to keep her stardom much longer), her erratic career in 1930's talkies (I actually feel she was much more beautiful during this era judging by the photos here) to her romance scandal of the 1940's that put her back in headlines if not in movies when she shot and wounded a lover to her later decades in poverty so extreme she and her mother went rummaging through a trunk of old unopened fan letters in hopes of finding quarters once sent to pay for photographs. Madge's chaotic story came close to having a happy ending when in her last years she sold her property during the 1980's California real estate boom for what she says was more than she made during her film star years but there was one final tragic twist with Madge dying just months before her autobiography was published and unable to enjoy the new attention it would have no doubt brought her.Far from an empty-headed starlet, Madge enjoyed intellectual pursuits and attempted (unsuccesfully) to become a novelist. Madge's willfullness perhaps made her her own worst enemy, indeed she is brutally honest about herself. \\"I maintained my independence, but in the process, lost many of the rewards of life...it took me eighty years to know the stranger within.\\" Yet one cannot help but admire this courageous woman who remained strong throughout her melodramas and this beautifully designed, nostalgic book is a great success in capturing what life is like as someone who caught glory, lost it, and lived to tell."},{"Title":"MURDER IN THE CIA","review":"I was looking for a quick reader for a book report and came upon this one.

Its strongest point is excellent plotting. The character development and scene-setting seemed a bit thin to me. Unlike the Smiley series by LeCarre, the writing seems much more commercial -- and it is hard to really feel (and intensely care about) the characters. (There are the usual romantic/sexual/love interests stirred in, but they seem superficial, reflecting Collette Cahill's shallow personality.) On the other hand, Truman's characters outshine Ludlum's stickmen; hers seem like real people (though just acquaintances, not friends). On excellent attribute of 'Murder in the CIA' is that one doesn't know who the 'bad guys' and the 'goods guys' are until just before the end of the tale. I would strongly suggest that readers who don't want to lose track of everyone really should keep a pad to jot down the names of each of the characters. This 303-page potboiler brings in quite a large cast, and many of them are important to the plot. This book was written during the Cold War, and younger readers may have some trouble connecting with the anti-Communist motivations behind a lot of the action. Also some of the devices (post-hypnotic recollections, for example) seem both contrived and dated. Things have changed a lot since 1987. --- In short, 'Murder in the CIA' is not great literature, but it is a fun read."},{"Title":"MURDER IN THE CIA","review":"She did a great job in this book I simply could not put it down!

My parents were alive during the war and they have memories of Americans saying things like \\"the one good thing Hitler is doing is getting rid of the Jews\\". That was the sentiment in America, whether America wants to face it or not.The Times would have lost all credibility with racist America and delayed our entry into the war if Americans had framed defeating Hitler as a \\"Jewish\\" war. Give credit where credit is due and lay blame where blame belongs- at the feet of American popular sentiment towards Jews circa 1935.It's hard to believe that this first-time author from nowhere isn't engaging in a little revisionism..\\"I think it's very hard to say what kind of influence anti-Semitism had (on America's attitude towards the war).\\", she says. She claims that because the American govt. didn't poll Americans to find out if the anti-Semitism would have changed their minds about going into the war. I swear she said this on C-SPAN. That would have been like polling to find out if America thought African-Americans should intermarry with Whites. No polling needed.Anti-semitism was absolutely rampant in America and a radioactive subject which would have delayed America's entrance into the war. Tough times call for tough-minded decisions, and the Times made one. Revisonist historians aided by politically-correct 20-20 hindsight need not apply.America's anti-semiticism and its influence on popular media circa 1935- now there's a book that needs to be written.This author has done nothing but earned her place in the pantheon of Fox News darlings.... look for her to be pitched softballs by OReilly sometime soon...."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"I was turned on to this book by a friend and when I next saw him, he asked me, refering to the author Laurel Leff's revelations, \\"did you know that?\\" I answered that I didn't know that the Times had basically hidden the news of the holocaust but, on the other hand, finding this out didn't surprise me. Sulzberger was an assimilated Jew, the descendent of Rabbi Steven Wise, a renowned Reform Rabbi whose theology was very assimilationist. Thus, despite his Jewishness, the Times rarely ran a major story about what was going on in the concentration camps and the stories that were written were not positioned in a prominent place. If they made the front page, it would not be postioned as the lead story.Incredibly, the coverage of the holocaust did not mention \\"Jews\\" specifically. By reading the Times, you would not have known the extent of the genocide nor would you have known that Jews were the major target of the Nazi extermination efforts. It is important to note that there was never a \\"smoking gun\\" uncovered, i.e., a memo or written directive from Sulzberger ordering the staff of the Times to soft pedal the events in the concentration camps. What is beyond dispute is that the Sulzberger family was secular and did not view Jews as a people. What is further beyond dispute is that the coverage by the Times was scant. Thus, whether by directive or not, the Times failed miserably in its role as \\"journal of record,\\" making a mockery of its motto \\"all the news that's fit to print. What is particularly reprehensible is that members of the Sulzberger family were being rescued while the details of the holocaust were being quashed.The Times, could have been influential but, tragically, it failed to exercise it's influence. Roosevelt basically looked the other way and, in sadness, we can only wonder whether he could have withstood the pressure and continued to do little if the Times had fully covered the events. Back then the Times obviously had an agenda and today, it still does. There was daily coverage of the Abu Ghraib prison abuses with one breathless headline after another. That was the more recent Times' agenda, specifically, to discredit the efforts in Iraq, particularly in an election year when the events there might have been a campaign issue. Tragically, there were no such breathless headlines during the darkest hours of the holocaust."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"Laurel Leff has provided not only an exhaustively researched account of the New York Times' coverage of the Holocaust, but also a nuanced account of how newspapers make decisions on the placement of news items. She shows how the failure of the nation's most important newspaper to recognize the importance of the Holocaust while it was occurring was in part traceable to the fact that those making the decisions on Page One play were lower-level editors without much clout. So they simply did what had always been done, and downplayed the importance of the Jews' suffering. Her portrayal of Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger's anti-Zionist leanings and connections also breaks new ground. This book is must reading for anyone interested in the history of America in the 1940s and for any student, professional or amateur, of American journalism. This goes far beyond the usual, cliched critique of the Times or other papers as being \\"biased\\" in one way or another. Leff also has a fine sense of style and tremendous command of her material."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"This is a very good book about how the New York Times family owners purposefully avoided dealing with the issue of anti-Semitism in Europe, and particularly Nazi Germany, while at the same time the Sulzberger family did everything it could to get its relatives out before the deluge. Laurel Leff has done a masterful job of showing how the Sulzberger clan became complicit in one of the darkest chapters in human history by not using the power of the paper to expose the real nature of the evil that Nazism was. Of course she does address the fact that anti-Semitism was not just a German issue, but from my perspective she does not go into enough detail about the extent of anti-Semitism in the US, and particularly major movers and shakers such as Joseph Kennedy who hated Jews so much that he always referred to them as \\"kikes\\" and opposed any action by the Roosevelt administration to educate the American public about the threat to Western civilization, even though he was ambassador to the Court of St. James at the time.But the problem with this book is that it focuses on the Times as if it somehow committed this sin for the first time in misleading the American public. I agree with her thesis that the Times has been hoisted as the most influential paper in the world among lazy elites, including those who have reviewed her book, but that is rapidly changing now, primarily due to the fact that the paper has failed so miserably in many areas, including the latest diversions of small change like Jason Blair. But the biggest holocaust of the last century did not occur in the ovens built by the Nazis, it was committed in the Ukraine when Stalin's forced collectivization starved far more Ukrainians to death than Hitler killed with his Zyklon-B. And the Times had a reporter, Walter Duranty, in Moscow at the time who won a Pulitzer Prize for mis-reporting this horror. Duranty was \\"Stalin's apologist\\" in many ways, dismissing honest reporters who covered the biggest holocaust as \\"overwrought\\" when they filed stories about the millions murdered by Stalin, filing stories about the \\"show trials\\" of Stalin as if they were legitimate trials that led to the deaths of millions more, and many other atrocities. Most serious scholars now have to acknowledge that the starvation of 8 million Ukrainians was not just an \\"unintentional consequence\\" of collectivization, and it really remains the NY Times most outrageous attack on the truth, the Nazi death camps notwithstanding. There are many stories in the NY Times that reveal the lie that is it's masthead of \\"All the news that's fit to print.\\" The Times fought mightily to keep Duranty's prize last year when serious reporters wanted to take it away because it was gained by fraudulent means. Of course the paper has done a great job of condemning the awarding of Olympic medals by drug-enhanced athletes, but can't see the hypocrisy of its own efforts to keep Duranty's decades of duplicity being rewarded with a Pulitzer.I recommend this book because it shows the hypocrisy of the Sulzberger clan in dealing with Hitler's \\"final solution\\" but it is not the biggest sin committed by this paper in miseducating the people it supposedly serves."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"One reviewer on Amazon criticized Laurel Leff for the tone of outrage which informs this work. But how is it possible not to be outraged when one considers that the Times, and its chief during the Second World War Arthur Sulzberger may well have been responsible ,through their downplaying of the story of the Nazi extermination campaign against the Jews, for not preventing the deaths of tens of thousands of people. Stories from the 'Times ' pointing out the evil of the Nazi plan might have for interested induced the Allies to bomb the rail- lines leading to Auschwitz. And that ' small action' might have saved thousands upon thousands of lives.Moreover Leff does not simply rage out of thin air, but very carefully documents the whole story of the Times action. And she puts especial emphasis on the bias of the then publisher Sulzberger .His anti- Zionism, his desire to dissociate himself from any national Jewish connection, his fear of having the Times be labeled as a 'Jewish newspaper' all these were part of the formulating of a top- down policy in which the story of what would later come to be known as the 'Holocaust' was downplayed.One feels the author has done a long- due and necessary job."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"Obviously, the New York Times did a horrible job of reporting the slaughter of millions of Jews by Germans and others during World War Two. And Laurel Leff has done us all a service by explaining this in detail.Did this betrayal of journalistic standards harm anyone? Of course it did. Still, it happened decades ago, so why worry about it now? Well, there are good reasons for worrying about it now. For one thing, the New York Times hasn't improved much, judging by its biased coverage of Israel. And while it is too late to save those who died in World War Two, there is still time to help those who are threatened today.Leff explains that the Times managed to ensure that fewer people would hear the last screams of those murdered in World War Two. Now, why did the Times do such a thing? The author analyzes this in some detail. And part of the reason was that Sulzberger did not want his paper to appear too \\"Jewish.\\"I think there is a moral here, namely that journalists need to report honestly, even when honesty might appear to make their group look good or bad.We humans do not make good choices when the information we need is omitted or reported inaccurately. It does no one any good if we lie on the grounds that truth might seem to be self-serving! And I think this case shows us why."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"Laurel Leff has given us a nicely detailed description of how the New York Times, then as now the most eminent newspaper in the country, failed to appreciate the historical significance of the Holocaust while it was under way in Europe.This was not a matter of suppression of news. Whatever news was available was published in the Times, but it was buried in back pages. The Nazis' systematic killings of Jews, when news of them reached the West, were not accorded the front-page status that, in hindsight, these events warranted. And here lies the fundamental weakness of the book as I see it. The author's vision is ahistorical, anachronistic; it applies what we know now to a judgement of what was done then.Nevertheless, Leff's book cannot help but be of importance to anyone interested in the period. Her strongest point is the role of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the Times from 1935 to 1945. Scion of a wealthy family of German Jews, living in a period in which Jews were still excluded from many positions of influence and were strictly limited in the prestige universities, Sulzberger felt uneasy about his Jewish identify. He was, in the language of those days, an assimilationist. He was very much worried that the public might consider him a Jew before it recognized him as a newspaper man. Leff's description of his role in the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism is most enlightening. But, as Leff also points out, the Reform Judaism of his day was also largely anti-Zionist. Sulzberger was not the only, nor the most rabid of the anti-Zionists among prominent American Jews. In any case, as Leff indicates, he was also basically fair-minded and was not given to suppressing news.The extent to which Sulzberger's personal values may have influenced the Times's coverage of the Holocaust is not clear. This question, as well as the larger question of how unique the Times was in its Holocaust treatment, can only be explored by a comparative treatment. How did the Times compare with other news outlets ? How much better could it have done, given the limitations in the world's understanding of the significance of the Holocaust while it was in progress ? Leff suggests that the Times was not unique, but she gives no particulars. She is not interested in making comparisons with other papers, either here or abroad.The New York Yiddish press of those days was still very important and very vibrant. There were several Yiddish dailies, with the Morning Journal and the Forward probably the most important. There was also the Tug (Day), and the Freiheit, the Communist Yiddish daily. Leff takes scant interest in any of these. She certainly does not do what would be required to understand the Times's treatment of the Holocaust, viz. a detailed comparative analysis of the Yiddish press accounts in relationship to those of the Times.We are left with a description of what happened at the Times only, and this description is both enlightening and thorough. But we are not told whether, with all of Sulberger's qualms and other institutional peculiarities of the Times, that newspaper could have given us a sustained, balanced, meaningful treatment of the Holocaust as it was unfolding, given the fact that the world simply could not grasp the horror and the novelty of the Nazi crime.I was a newspaper reader in those days, not only of the Times, but also of a variety of Jewish sources (but not of the Yiddish press). I read all the little facts. But I had no inkling of what was really happening, of the magnitude of the Holocaust. That came to me, as it did to the rest of the world, only some years after the war."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"Is it not peculiar that the New York Times burries its head in the sand about the fate of Jews during WW2? Not only during WW2 did it hide the news about their extermination, on the inside pages, but it continues even today to stay away from reporting how the organizations, the lawyers and the establishment is depriving the survivors of their due compensation. For example, of the recent Swiss bank settment of $1.25 billion only 4% is \\"earmarked\\" for Jews in the US.This is so, even though it was their money that the Swiss banks stole. The Time's reporters refuse to publish the facts of this tainted affair.The same goes for the \\"German Settlement\\", where a lawyer, Burt Newborne, representing the 2nd Federal District Court in Brooklyn has accepted $5 billion in fees from the German Government to taylor the agreement in such a manner that it protects the German companies from further claims and for this they pay the victims \\"peanuts\\" (to quote Judge Judah Gribitz). It is shameful for a person, like Neuborne, who works for a court, and is supposed to be impartial, goes ahead and gets a fee from the defendants. This is especially true of Neuborne, a law professor, a former member of the ACLU and the principle lawyer for the Brennan Foundation, a victim protection agency.The Times, just like during WW2, hears nothing, sees nothing, and writes nothing about these attrocious treatments of the Jews who are victimized today. Why? Ask Mr. Sulzberger!This is why this book is such a well written documentary and a must read."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"This is the story of the failure of the New York Times to adequately report on the Holocaust during World War II. It makes for very good reading not only to learn what was happening, but to understand what makes stories newsworthy.At one point Edward R. Murrow went to visit Belsen camp. He did not write a story about, he said, \\"I am an American reporter for the American public, and I cannot go north to talk about the British occupying a camp.\\" One of the things that journalists are taught is to provide what their readers want to read. Murrow's readers wanted to read about what the American Army, their sons were doing.\\" That says \\"talk about the Bataan Death March, not the Holocaust.\\"This book causes me to think a lot about the situation at the time and about publishing in general. Right now the respect of the average American for the press is pretty low, probably right down there with respect for Congress.This book has a story to tell. But it's telling the story in retrospect. We now have access to a lot of facts that were collected one at a time over years. Now we can see the big picture that allows us to pull out those facts that may have been invisible at the time. This is not unlike the facts that should have warned us in advance about Pearl Harbour.The book certainly makes for interesting reading. And the anti-liberal media people will have a blast with it."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"Leff provides a necessary look at how the most influential newspaper in America dealt with the Nazi regime before and during the Second World War.It seems to me that given the very important strength of anti-semitism in America during the first half of the 20th Century, the amazing thing is that the American Jews were not persecuted and interned on some pretext, that the US supported the creation of the State of Israel -- and just barely did so despite the opposition of the State Department -- and that American Jews have reached a position unequaled anywhere. It all might have been different and in the days of Father Coughlin and Charles Lindburgh and Joseph Kennedy it certainly looked like it would be different.Ms. Leff has meant well and has made a contribution. Moral outrage in this case is less useful than a calm assessment of the real forces at work in America concerning the Jews and how best to prosecute the war.The real outrage should be saved for the role of Christianity for fifteen hundred years or more in victimizing the Jews -- to the extent that only a small percentage of Christians could avoid the ever-present temptation of Jew hatred."},{"Title":"Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper","review":"This is not a book about The New York Times and its miserablecoverage (never on the front page) of the War Against the Jews. It isa book about a self-hating man, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, to whom thevery word \\"Jews\\" was anathema. No, we are Americans who happen to beJews. There is no such thing as a Jewish people, no such thing as aJewish nation; those are Hitlerite concepts.And that explains why Sulzberger kept a Nazi as head of his BerlinBureau and allowed his nephew Cyrus to cover the Babi Yar massacre bynot mentioning that the victims were Jews.And the people who revolted in Warsaw's ghetto were not Jews, either.Wherever possible, the victims of the Germans were either part of alarger group, including all the massacred Norwegians, Belgians, andLuxembourgers, or simply \\"refugees.\\"Leff, whom I would not hire as a prospective reporter, lays it allout -- and then some. She adds the superfluous detail whereverpossible and then pads out her book with a mish-mash of stuff thatshe simply gets wrong, like the well-known sinking of the \\"Sturma\\"(sic). She just has it sink without saying why. That sort of writinggets wearisome after a while, but she just loves to throw in \\"sic\\"when she catches a misspelling or a typo.Not wanting to go on with superfluous details of my own, all I cansay is that this would have been a fitting subject for someone whocould discipline her writing. Leff did not."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"I stopped to write a review only because I saw that all five stars were not fully checked. One can like or not like the content of the book, but as a exposition of writing craft it is - bar none - the best book in the world. (Allright, I'll be circumspect, maybe one of the best). It will blow you away and change the way you think about the novel as a literary form. A genius at his best, no less."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"Told from the perspective of the people who encounter the Mani family throughout the generations this book is amazing. WHile it takes a few pages to get used to the fact that the Mani men will not be speaking for themselves, once that is accepted this book moves along making you think and feel for these people that you only encounter through the perspective of strangers. What's even better is that you see a character in one generation from one perspective and then in the next chapter the character is considerably younger and there is some one else's perspective. So the father about to commit suicide and who is the mission of the first narrator becomes a child Jew that is an inconvenience to the Nazi character with a conscience of the second chapter. Where most experimental literature is only experimental, this book shows that storytelling and style don't need to be mutually exclusive."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"I concur with other readers that &quot;Mr. Mani&quot; stands in a class of its own. The book, which spans centuries, manages to do so while remaining riveting and vivid. That I remember it years after re-reading it, that I am now trying to write my own novel allows me to now see how truly masterful this book is. If you don't write you may not realize how much had to go into the leaping stories, the profundity of character and the great subject this author took on and completed. Maybe a few on this earth are as blessed with the gift of creation, but they are very few indeed."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"Unlike most, if not all \\"experimental\\" novels, which rely on a technique for delivery their story, Mr. Mani never allows the technique to control the novel's story, even as it shapes and molds its contours. Perhaps this is one of the most powerful endorsements of Mr. Mani as a masterpiece of a novel. Rather than becoming a confining element, the experiment (which is confining in its scope and shape) gives the novel a massive reach and scale. For in this novel, A.B. Yehoshua has done nothing less than chart the course of modern Jewish history, both in Palestine, the State of Israel, and the Diaspora. But at the same time, while attaining this mighty reach, the novel is extremely intimate. The Mani family and their connection to Jerusalem is unforced and natural. Yehoshua is telling us something about the naturalization of Jews in the Holy Land. Simple categories of identity fail to capture all the nuance of this unique connection. In fact, all binary oppositions are melting into one shade of marvelous gray in this very masterfully written work."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"This is a book that is unforgettable. I read it five years ago and I still have dreams about it. I still find myself in the scenes and epochs that Mr. Mani traverses. I am a professor of literature and so I must read more than most. This book has the hand of God on it. It stands out. Buy it and love it."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago and I still remember it as a favorite. Really the literary device of telling the story backwards in a series of five one sided conversations about the Mani family works wonders in offsetting and bringing you into their lives. You want to know more about them, but you also think that you have heard enough. And the narrators themselves are fascinating. There's the pregnant girl that thinks she is saving the Mani family and there's the Nazi who is making deals with his commanding officer as well as the British soldier whose sending them back to Europe.Throughout the book the ironic twists and turns make for compelling reading and even though you are reading it backwards and even though the backwards motif is almost played out by now (Irreversible, Ju Rei, Yellow Raft in Blue Water), it works here.I never read the original Hebrew version, but I rather liked the English version. A.B. Yehoshua is pretty hit or miss for me, but in the case of this book definitely a hit."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"In a nutshell, this book was: brilliant, original, and haunting. I couldn't put it down, but when I got to the end I wished I had not read it. The ending was more horrible than I could have imagined.Each character is intense and unique; the historical details span centuries and the globe. In those ways, the book is quite a literary feat.This book follows the genius and madness of the Mani line. It was both wonderful and shocking, giving much food for thought. Where did the madness originate? With each succeeding generation, is it passed on to it's innocent victim only to surface in a different form? What combination of genius and madness will be produced and which will prevail? What is cause and what is affect? Is this the story of mankind? Is this the story of sin and it's affects? When will it end and how?Since I am not a sholar and probably don't appreciate greatness when I see it, I could only give this book 4 stars because it was a bit too radical for me. I found the ending too shocking, even though it tied the whole book together. Looking for an escape from the madness of real life in the imaginary world of literature, I was not pleased to find that this book only injected a fresh dose of it into my private world.This book perhaps could be put in the category of contemporary or modern art. Even if you don't like the style or subject, it's great artistic value cannot be argued."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"Yehoshua tells the story of 6 generations in reverse historical order using the interesting technique of reporting conversations but with only one side of the conversation recorded. Like other readers I found this style a bit infuriating at first and I was about to put the book down several times except the author then introduces some other interesting and yes, gossipy, detail and I felt compelled to carry on.Of the various Mr. Manis described I found the middle segments of the book strongest and the opening and closing segments the weakest. The reader should be advised of the time line at the back of the book which should keep each of the individual Manis sorted out, especially as there 3 different Yoseph Manis. The segment that takes place in WWII where the speaker is a Nazi soldier talking to his estranged mother is perhaps the most interesting, followed by the middle segments that take place in and around Jerusalem, esp. the young Joseph Mani who flits from group to group as if he were a secret agent working to create a destiny for the future trying both hopefully and desperately to bring it about.Its probably not the kind of a book you can hand to a friend and tell them to read but it's good literature and if you persevere with the style it grows on you and is quite excellent."},{"Title":"Mr. Mani","review":"The story of the Mani family through six generations, moving backward from 1982, as told by an Israeli woman, a Nazi soldier, and doctor (among others).

His work is probably outstanding in the original Hebrew. However, in translation it is boring. I read only 150 pages of this book and then I put it down. Only three people in my book club finished it including the Israeli born woman who recommended it. Only two people liked it. I don't think that this author cares about the quality of the translation. Another Hebrew speaking person I know recommended The Liberated Bride by the same author. It was a runaway hit in Israel. However, the original which was over 900 pages bore little resemblance to the English translation of just over 300 pages. She told me that the translation was like reading a completely different and inferior book. This novel which goes back in time tracing the Mani family through its patriarchs was a tedious read. The sentence structure and vocabulary were excellent so I know that this author can write. I will not try to read this author again. I will not recommend him to anyone who cannot read it in the original Hebrew or perhaps, in an Arabic translation.

It will help to put this semi-autobiography into perspective, and if you're already an Ellroy fan it will make a great deal more sense. It's an extraordinary piece of work, so ruthlessly exhaustive in its detail that I for one felt almost physically tired by the time I had finished. Not tired of reading the book itself, but tired just to think of the incredible lengths Ellroy went to in order to track down his mother's killer some 37/38 years after her death in 1958. Although the book is dedicated to Ellroy's wife Helen, it could just as well have been dedicated to Bill Stoner, the retired ex-detective who committed himself absolutely to the cause of helping Ellroy in his unusual quest - but this might be an opportunity to mention two of Ellroy's greatest works American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand, one a sequel to the other; the latter was in fact dedicated to Stoner and deservedly so.In one sense I feel that this book was written almost exclusively for Ellroy himself to read, I'm sure that he had little commercial incentive or reasoning to do it. Yet the raw, body-pummelling honesty of the book from start to finish makes for fascinating reading for those who, like myself, have ever wondered what made Ellroy write in the way he does in such classics as The Black Dahlia or The Big Nowhere. I have to admit that the short sentence style adopted in My Dark Places does irritate at times, in spite of the fact that the writer explains this after the end of the story. It gave me the impression that what we are reading, much of the time, are either his own or Stoner's investigatory notes and copied to the page verbatim.The lasting impression though is the tireless and absolutely relentless commitment to the cause of a murder investigation. Although there are only a handful of characters who appear in the book throughout, there are nevertheless several hundred others who are mentioned during its course, the majority of whom are either related to the victim or are suspected of being so - and ALL of these suspects, no matter how faint their association to the crime might seem, have to be contacted and interviewed. I guess that this gives us an insight into the mechanics of any murder investigation, and how different it is to the relative glamourisation we see on the TV. This book covers, in finite detail, the day-to-day work of a real-life murder investigation, one which was spread well over a year and one which covered every single day of that period. The huge difference of course is that the victim is the investigator's mother, and the death took place most of his life ago.After closing the last page, I felt that while I didn't exactly understand Ellroy as a personality that much better, I certainly knew him and his motives as a writer more than I had. My Dark Places strips away much of the mystery surrounding him and helps to explain what made him a self-styled specialist of 1950's LA crime fiction; he was a victim of the real thing."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Over the past twenty years, James Ellroy has written nearly a dozen novels that have established him as the foremost contemporary successor to the noir crime fiction of forerunners such as Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett and James Cain. Set primarily in Los Angeles (although some of his novels, such as \\"American Tabloid\\", have taken on bigger settings and themes), Ellroy's narratives are marked by what one critic has described as a \\"telegraphic\\" style, one short sentence following another in a breathless staccato of hard-boiled language, graphic (at times grisly) description, and a pervasive, and often seemingly morbid and pessimistic, obsession with sexual crime and violence.Ellroy is an astonishingly good writer, albeit a writer who is not for everyone: his vivid and grotesquely detailed explorations of rape and murder, of men preying on woman, of brutal police practices, often make the reader squeamish and uncomfortable. The effect is powerful testimony to the talent.But where does Ellroy's remarkable writing come from? \\"My Dark Places,\\" subtitled \\"An L.A. Crime Memoir,\\" provides an answer: from the real life noir of Ellroy's life.On a Sunday morning in June, 1958, James Ellroy's forty-five year old mother, Jean, was murdered. Her body was found in a vacant lot next to a school in El Monte, California, a gritty, working class city east of Los Angeles. \\"A nylon stocking and a cotton cord were lashed around her neck. Both ligatures were tightly knotted.\\" James Ellroy was ten years old at the time. His parents were divorced. He had just returned home from a weekend visit with his father when he was told about the murder. While a \\"Swarthy Man\\" was seen with the victim, the murder was never solved.\\"My Dark Places\\" tells the story of Jean Ellroy's murder in 1958. It also tells the story of the next twenty years of James Ellroy's life, when he drifted to drugs and alcohol, to an obsession with crimes of sex and violence, to a kind of noirish bottom which was the prelude to his life as a writer. It tells the story of how the noir obsessions of Ellroy's fictions were the creative and self-sustaining response to the dark episodes of his real life. And, finally, it tells the story of Ellroy's renewed search for his mother's murderer and, along the way, his search for his mother herself. In Ellroy's words:\\"I knew things about us. I sensed other things. Her death corrupted my imagination and gave me exploitable gift. My mother gave me the gift and the curse of obsession. It began as curiosity in lieu of childish grief. It flourished as a quest for dark knowledge and mutated into a horrible thirst for sexual and mental stimulation. Obsessive drives almost killed me. A rage to turn my obsessions into something good and useful saved me. I outlived the curse. The gift assumed its final form in language.\\"\\"My Dark Places\\" is a dark and disturbing memoir, an intimate plunge into the life and the psyche of James Ellroy. It is also, like his novels, a chilling exploration of real life crimes of sex and violence in Los Angeles, Ellroy's search for his mother's murderer being the touchstone for a narrative contrail of grisly and perverse crimes that he encounters along the way."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I read the first three books of Ellroy's famous 'LA Quartet' and before I went on to White Jazz (the final) I came upon a copy of 'My Dark Places' in a used book store and couldn't help but start reading it (before WJ which I had on ice). I guess I felt compelled to get a little insight into the man who managed to write these incredible novels. I'll just say that if you are like me, impressed with his work and curious about his notorius past (the murder of his Mother and obsession with the Black Dahlia) then this book is a must read. It helps explain his fixation on crime and how he came through a troubled earlier life living solo in the parks, rooftops, jails and rehabs of L.A. He proves how some great minds are made through adversity. We all have heard the question \\"If there was one person you could have over to dinner, who would it be?\\" and my hands down first choice would be Ellroy."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"The places James Ellroy boldly takes us ARE, without exaggeration, dark and scary and kind of banal which is why they're so wierd. I started to wonder whom he imagined his readers were, given that his language and approach are startling and bone-crunching, but I don't think he has an imagined audience. If there is any at all, it's himself. He's writing for himself to get it out of his head and it's a bold expurgation.The redhead is James Ellroy's mother who was murdered on a dark road outside an El Monte high school in 1958 when the author was 10 and the victim was 42 years old. Confused and disoriented as only a 10 year old from a raging broken home can be, Ellroy grows up - or at least advances in years since real maturity comes later - perversely relieved to be rid of his mother and develops major addiction problems and asocial behavior. In recovery terms, much of the book seems to serve as Ellroy's fourth step (a moral inventory of oneself) and is both oddly delicious and repellant. The real punch comes when Ellroy is determined to find his mother's killer, the so-called Swarthy Man, but in fact begins to discover who that redhead is and how she found herself on a dark road in El Monte after a Saturday night of bar-hopping.No criticism or re-interpretations can be proffered. The guy lost his mother to an unknown murderer. Who can fully understand what that means?"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"My Dark Places chronicles James Ellroy's life and his search for his mother's murderer. It gives the reader an amazing amount of insight into the mind of one of the most important living writers. You can see the seeds of much of Ellroy's work here, especially Killer on the Road. If you want to understand Ellroy's work and his perspective, this is essential reading.However, the book stands very well on its own. Despite what some of the other reviews have said, I found myself fascinated by every element of the book including Ellroy's detailed descriptions of his young and his exposition of Stoner's past cases. One of Ellroy's best virtues in fiction is that all of his characters seems alive and vibrant if not honorable. In this book he shows the same skill in describing real people, allowing you to see into the souls of Ellroy and Stoner and understand to some degree what each man has been through.Ellroy's descriptions of his troubles and the cases Stoner was involved in only serve to reinforce one of the prime themes of his fiction, that of the world as a corrupt place. Certainly there are good people, there are innocents, but for every one of them there is someone corrupt qand capable of things the innocents would never consider. He demonstrates the struggle that each person must go through to live in this world as he did in many of his novels, such as American Tabloid, Brown's Requiem, and Killer on the Road.Ultimately, this book serves many purposes. Read as an autobiography, it reveals much about what drives Ellroy to write the books that he writes. Read for pure titilation it offers sex, violence, and drugs although classical music takes the place of rock and roll. It can also be read as an analysis of man's essential character, and an examination of the human condition. All in all, this is a monumental work."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Ellroy is becoming more and more well known since the adaptation of LA confidential as a film, and the success of his most recent novels, but if you want brutal, honest truth about the man, this harrowing, gut wrenching truth to tell story of how he got the way he is, and how he lived enough for three men by the time he was thirty, this is worth reading. It is blatantly Freudian, explicitly forward, and never, ever compromises. If you would like to see just how interconnected the entire world of Ellroy's fiction is tied up with his real life, pick this up."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Have you ever known somebody really, really bad, and wondered what is going on in his head? For those of us who lead a straight life, the world of drinking, drugging, stealing and lying is inexplicable. James Elroy tells us all about it with brutal honesty. His parents were the typical troubled pair, the mother a kind of seedy bar girl, the father a manipulative con. Then Elroy's mother was murdered in a dark and perverse way. He became fixated with her murder, and the mysterious bad man who did it. This is a \\"coming of age\\" tale gone really wrong. He does not work hard in school and go on to become a sqeeky clean cop who tracks down her killer. He becomes a strange dark person who tries to figure things out from the underbelly of society, the world where the crime took place. Elroy's father's strange criminal personality and shallow affect are just what I have personally observed in the father of one really bad aquaintence. He accepts his son's increasing delinquency and mental disturbance with equanimity. The way the Elroys treat their dog reflects the way the young Elroy grows up, given a very shaky roof over head and a little food, but no moral compass or consistency in life. The author is left with the memory of his mother, who, the prototype of many women, struggle to work for a living and raise their children in the midst of their own disfunction and the bad men their lifestyle exposes them to."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I am writing just to quickly recommend this book. James Ellroy has a vast imagination to go with an experienced life. To say the least he has lived a full life with some fascinating stories.\\"My Dark Places\\" is an entertaining book that keeps you wondering what is next. From the death of his mother to his fantasies about her, this book is full of first hand vivid explanations into the mind of an unusual character that happens to be true."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Honest, blunt, unflinching, searing, brutal, graphic, scary, and dark, this is Ellroy's premiere work.But really it's his magnum opus on what drives men to commit the heinious crime of murder. Forget what others have said about Ellroy's ego, his twisted persona, or his damaged psyche. If only everyone could be this honest. Sometimes you must not only measure a person by how much they have overcome, but how honestly they assess their own foibles and frailties. Yes, Ellroy is a rich and celebrated writer, but how many people in the world would freely admit a tenth of what he reveals in this book? Most people want to keep their skeletons very deep in their closets, thank you. Why expose yourself to the world -- too painful, right?The second chapter is a textbook example on how a writer should develop setting into a work. If I were teaching 10th graders the art of writing a setting into a book, I would use this as an example.It's going to be hard for Ellroy to ever top this, but as America's seminal writer currrently working in both fiction and non-fiction, he is capable of anything."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy survived his childhood with his sanity intact, which is absolutely amazing. My Dark Places describes his coming of age after, at age 10, his mother is murdered. His subsequent life with his father is an extrordinary disappointment. And his turn to petty crime and drug abuse almost finishes him. Yet he pulls himself out to become a successful novelist, and later to journey back in time to try to find his mother's killer. What he is really searching for is not his mother's murderer, but his mother. He seems to need her now even more than when he was a boy. The pain is raw and the anger is vivid. I understand to some extent his desperate attempt to regain what was unjustly denied him by tragic circumstance. My mother is lost to me via Alzheimers disease. Although she is physically here, she is really as gone as Ellroy's mother. It's just agonizing to try to recapture what is gone. Full of regret and anger, confusion and frustration. I really hope Ellroy comes to terms eventually with his loss. The book is probably a good try in this direction. For any reader who is hoping for that illusive, imaginary balm of &quot;closure&quot;, (a word which Ellroy rightly disparages) this book illustrates that the concept simply does not exist. The pain is always there. A tough read, but a memorable one."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Parts of this book were fascinating - how the author slowly became addicted to true crime, how he encapsulated his memories about his mother, and the dark places he went to in his youth and early adulthood. If written as a straight memoir it would have worked very well. As is was written, however, it is packed with dreary information (endless names and places), that lead to nowhere, weigh the book down, and grow quite tedious."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Great book. What I like most about his story is Mr. Ellroy's honesty. His honesty about what he was, what he did, and what he thought. Most men would never admit to lusting for their own Mother. I love his 'what you see is what you get' attitude.My heart went out to this little boy that was filled with hate towards his Mother. I can't even begin to imagine how he felt about his own life or of the murder and disposal of his Mother's body as if she was trash.He is lucky to be alive today after all of the alcohol and drug abuse he punished himself with.This book is well written and covers much detail.I hope that Mr. Ellroy is happy these days. If anyone deserves to be happy, it's James Ellroy."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Ellroy is no doubt a gifted writer, and this book travels part of the circuitous route that he took in claiming this gift. I chose this book based on the fascinating premise of a talented crime writer investigating the long unsolved murder case of his own mother - a murder that took place when the author was only ten years old. The book begins with a competent reconstruction of the sequence of events after the murder. Some surprising twists in the story take place when we see the impact of this murder on the author's life afterward. Many crime stories are woven into the narrative, and one feels sadness for the innocent victims. The perpetrators identified in the story are all clearly sociopaths - folks that operate on a different wavelength than your common petty thief and substance abuser. In the end, the author's investigation does not solve the mystery of who killed his mother. Too many years had likely passed since the crime, and it appears that the sociopath who had done the killing apparently had made a short, fleeting career of his murderous exploits leaving just one or two victims in his wake. Some bonuses included in the book are the rich descriptions of everyday life in the 1940's and 50's, particularly, but not limited, to the Los Angeles area."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"my first ellroy book, i have seen his movies and love them. The story was great , i love true crime and i love Los Angeles so the book was a great combo of both for me. Also i am a police officer and have an interest in cold cases. The story of ellroys life and what made him the man he is today is a must read. I was introduced to him by the article about his mother in GQ and im glad i bought the book. One of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Ellroy has big issues and rightfully so.The murder of his mother when he was only ten and his consecutive years as a young \\"bum\\" in L.A. have marked him for the rest of his life.Now 40 years later he musters the courage to investigate that murder and simultaneously his own life. He is relentless in his search and leaves no stone unturned. His writing is unforgiving,painfully honest and obsessive about the thruth. You might call him a Mad Genius or a total Nutcase, the fact remains that his novels have the power to shock, touch or move you, they never leave you indifferant.A great and powerful book."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"As an Ellroy fan, I, too, was annoyed at his not telling us the full story of how he \\"turned his life around\\" -- but then I recalled his mentions of 12-Step groups. In NA, AA, CA and all the rest, \\"A\\" stands for \\"anonymous.\\" Mr. Ellroy might choose to disclose how 12-Step recovery groups helped him (members can compromise their own anonymity), but a careful reader will notice he doesn't do much beyond making mention of his involvement in such groups, tells a couple of anecdotes and that's it. He's honor-bound not to provide any details that might compromise the anonymity of another member (e.g, his sponsor, those other group members who helped him through the inevitable crises). Bill Wilson (whose last name we NOW know), one of the founders of AA, always emphasized that the welfare of the group was more important than the self-interest of any of its members. Fortunately, Ellroy was doing pretty well by the time he wrote this memoir, so (I'm surmising) he didn't have to fight with his conscience over including more specific information to boost sales. Consequently, we really can't expect a clear picture of recovery aided by 12-Step groups. I definitely picked up that Ellroy is very much aware that his involvement in such groups saved his life. I don't know the man personally, but by the time he wrote this, we had become a facile enough writer to \\"dance around\\" the subject of those lost years. Unwilling to fictionalize a memoir -- and he does strike me an a honorable man -- he did the best he could. The result? A somewhat choppy book that looks as if it could use surgical editing (to \\"track\\" the story properly). This book clearly comes from deep within Ellroy -- and it's a book he HAD to write. Try to temper your judgment of its style and structure with that knowledge and, I hope, compassionate understanding of the author."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"My Dark Places stands alone among the most naked, poignant, exquisite writing I have ever encountered. Anyone unmoved by either its subject matter or the sheer beauty of Ellroy's prose must be clinically dead."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This is the true story about the unsolved murder of James Ellroy's mother, and his attempt to help police solve the murder years later.If you have ever read an Ellroy book, and been touched by the ease in which he writes about death, now you will know what personal experiences he draws his ability from. This book could read like fiction, but it is not."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I have been a fan of James Ellroy's for a couple of years now. After reading American Tabloid and LA Confidential, i wanted to know more about the genius behind them. MY DARK PLACES reveals so much. He writes bravely and leaves nothing to the imagionation. I could not belive how honets he is. This is a must-have book."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This is the most brilliant and brutalizing read since Native Son. Entirely honest, absolutely absorbed in the jumble of rage,desire, pleasure, and abandonment feelings a son might feel toward a mother (and father) whose contradictions expose him to the extremes of survival. The legal detail is also wonderful. Where the desire for knowledge and for women meet, Ellroy leads us viscerally through neighborhoods we might not really want to go, places where we might already live..."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"\\"Best of all, I'm so glad to be alive,\\" Captain Jack Aubrey said. It was the end of the tape. The end of the story. Fictional naval captain's glad to be alive. Grand.I was too. Glad to be alive. It was night. Just a hair after midnight. I was driving home from work down a two-lane country road. Time to break out the next box of tapes.James Ellroy's memoirs. Abridged. Read by the author.Later that night, I'm sitting in my driveway. I didn't want to go in. Ellroy's voice wouldn't let me go. He had to tell me a story. About his mother, Jean Ellroy, and her murder.It was in 1957. Ellroy was ten. His parents had been divorced for four years. His father picked his son up on weekends. His mother would go out. She was an alcoholic and fast. A round-heeled woman. She dated men. One of them killed her.Ellroy tells that part of the story as if he was writing a script for \\"Dragnet.\\" Just the facts. Many of them can't be repeated in a newspaper, but you get the idea. The police pursue her killer. They interview witnesses. She had been seen in a bar with two men and a woman. She had visited a drive-in with the suspect. Twice. The police push forward their investigation, but it hits a dead end. The case grows cold. They never find her killer.Then he tells the story through the eyes of the young Ellroy, coming home to his mother's bungalow. Seeing the police officers surrounding it. He knew, from some instinct, that his mother had been murdered. He kept his cool. He didn't cry. A nice officer took him to a neighbor's workshop. He sawed away on a block of wood with a file. The police photographer took his picture. The flashbulb popped. Fwoosh. You can see the picture on the front of the box.\\"I gave them nothing,\\" he said of that moment. \\"I kept everything inside.\\"Four decades pass. He decides to reopen the Jean Ellroy investigation, enlisting the help of a retired LAPD detective. They look up old witnesses and read the old reports. While the case remains unsolved, Ellroy discovers connections and unearths memories that fill out his life that seemed to start at the age of ten with he knowledge that someone murdered his mother.\\"My Dark Places\\" is a memoir, a journey and at its tragic heart, a love story. The abridged version, read by Ellroy, comes on two tapes and seems complete enough that I felt no need to read the book. But I did look it up, because it contained something that the tape box left out. The photograph. Showing Ellroy sawing at a block of wood with a file. Showing no emotion. Giving up nothing."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I met James twice in the past couple of months. The first time at Learning Annex event where I stepped on his foot and admitted I had never read any of his books. The second time at a Bruce Wagner reading where I talked to James for awhile and discovered what an extremely cool and funny guy he was. So, I was obligated to read something of his.I decided to start with \\"My Dark Places\\" because it's his memoir and I wanted to know more about him before moving on.This book blew me away and I am now an official fan! I highly recommend this book to everyone. Especially girls like me who wouldn't normally read \\"crime\\" novels. I couldn't put it down and am now on a mission to read everything he has ever written. It was so great to meet you James and thanks for making me a new fan!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy may be Amrica's most talented crime writer. In his novels there are no good and evil characters. Everyone is flawed to some degree. Good and evil are more like shades of gray, rather than black and white. As James Ellroy goes back into his childhood to write about, and attempt to solve, the murder of his mother, he gives an almost autobiographical account of his life, especially his early years. Ellroy describes his guilty feelings at the excitement that he would permanently live with his father after his mother was murdered. It appears that when she was alive, he felt no love for his mother, in fact he hated her lifestyle. Ellroy may be a little to blunt in his criticisms of his mother, given his own penchant for booze and sex. Ellroy temed up with a soon to retire LA County Sheriff's Detective, and snooped around the Jean Ellroy case, as well as another unsolved case. This book gives an interesting account of growing up in Los Angeles and the surrounding communities. Everything about this book was fascinating, and I could not put it down. Like his characters, Ellroy and his family are neither clearly good or evil, but more like shades of gray."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy, author of great novels like &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; &quot;White Jazz&quot; and &quot;American Tabloid,&quot; goes through his own dark past in &quot;My Dark Places.&quot; This is a great read, and an effective one too. Ellroy takes us into a dark and disturbing world of murder, lust and perversion full of rich characters, chilling situations and thrilling drama. And it's all true. Few memoirs are this good. Ellroy manages to examine the events surrounding his mother's murder, his hard early life and how it hellishly got out of control, but he also does an examination of the nature of crime against women, and that area is the most disturbing. Not only does &quot;My Dark Places&quot; give insight into the brilliant writer that is James Ellroy and how his mother's death has affected him, but into the chilling world of violence against women in America and opens the eyes to how and why some of the women that are found murdered end up there. &quot;My Dark Places&quot; is graphic, darkly romantic, all too real and effective. A great book."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy,an extremely original noir writer,has been obsessed by dead women.And in &quot;My Dark Places&quot;,he finally drew ultimate &quot;dead woman&quot; to him--Geneva Ellroy,murdered 1958,his mother.You must be electrified and stupefied when you finished reading this. The style is less crazed than &quot;White Jazz&quot;,though,it is totally dead-pan,even in describing his own mother's death scene. But it is not mere dry prose,there pulsing under the cold narrative,a repressed emotion that can be expressed only through such a thingistic style.In Part 4,Ellroy and a ex-detective investigate the murder of Geveva. Ellroy's pen gets really paranoiac.He reports EVERYTHING. Every store he went,every suspect they found not guilty,every telephone reporting fake information. Do they have any significance? Nothing. No evidence can be found in them. But this meaningless enumeration perfectly expresses Ellroy's craazed love toward his mother.This work must be very very private one. Never a mere memoir. This is a report on Ellroy's psychotherapy on himself,a private letter to his mother wrote in burning curse and extreme love.Reconstructing the trail of mother's life,Ellroy desparately struggles to get mother's real image.Somwhat rough piece,but a dark vibration would hit you,an indescribable force clearly dominates on every single page"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"'My Dark Places' is a most interesting read, and would have been a good book if the author could decide on writing either a true crime story (about the murder of his mother) or an autobiography. Unfortunately the combination of the two makes it to be a but jumbley, with neither theme being fully exploited. The fact that the author, James Ellroy, is a very popular crime writer adds an enticing twist ... and the man can write. But in the end 'My Dark Places' left me with the impression that the book served as primarily some sort of soul-searching exercise by Ellroy rather than something to be enjoyed by the reader.Oh, there are some interesting moments. The murder of Jean Ellroy is graphically recounted. James Ellroy's perspective of this murder, both as a boy when it happened and as an adult researching the case (..still unsolved), is intriguing and unexpected. However Ellroy also goes into great detail of his rather wasted youth ... it seems he was a total mess for half his life. This was not too interesting, and his transformation from dunken hobo to crime writer extraordinary and member of the establishment is not really addressed. So I felt this entire element was a real waste.Bottom line: a very mixed bag. Certainly a must read for Ellroy fans. However I'm not so sure if anyone else while find value in reading it."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Like many fans and anti-fans of James Ellroy, my first contact with his work came when I saw the movie &quot;L. A. Confidential.&quot; I have long had an affinity for the L.A. detective genre, and I settled in to buy and read all of Ellroy's books, beginning with the LA Quartet, moving on to American Tabloid, then returning to his early, mid-1980s novels including Brown's Requiem.Ellroy took the traditional path of an author; he read hundreds of books in his chosen genre, he wrote a few early novels in which he learned his craft, and honed his style in the late 1980s. The LA Quartet was a breakthrough, the most entertaining group of books I have ever read...period.I did not pick up &quot;My Dark Places&quot; until I had read all of his novels. In my opinion, those readers who don't like &quot;My Dark Places&quot; don't really understand Ellroy the man or his work. They can't get past the blackness, the violence, the language, etc. Most can't understand that an American can live like Ellroy did the first three decades of his life.Books give us a window into a world that is not our own. It allows us to glimpse, at safe remove, people and situations that we otherwise cannot predict or invent--after all, the worst epithet a critic can ascribe to a publication is &quot;predictable.&quot; We cannot abide predictability in our entertainment, we live in it all day, every day. Ellroy's books step far, far away from predictability, yet have a veneer of believability...we read &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and think that yes, it could have happened that way.&quot;My Dark Places&quot; brings unpredictable entertainment and reality one step closer to each other. We see the reality that, thank God, happened to someone else. As dedicated experience junkies, it is entertaining, thrilling...yet safe. We're built with blinders on, we have safety stopgaps, both inherent and through training. Adolescent boys won't read this book (or any other) and turn into lunatics, though there exist unsavory subcultures in America who would take great delight if that were the case.No, this is an experience that is simply too much for some people. These are the people who claim they don't like the book. It overwhelms them.How about you? Are you a thrillseeker?"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I'm at a loss to understand the raves here for this book. My only familiarity with Ellroy being the wonderful film of L.A. Confidential, I thought, as Michiko Kakutani did, that My Dark Places would \\"serve as an introduction for new readers to this gifted writer's disturbing oeuvre.\\" Like Kakutani, I was wrong. My Dark Places is an overlong, precious, redundant and annoying book.Every beginning writing course teaches two absolutes: First, the fact that something actually happened does not automatically make it either interesting or dramatically relevant. Second, the character in your story that is most like you is almost always the least interesting. Ellroy is no neophyte, but he stumbles into both minefields and is blown to pieces. Making it worse are Ellroy's constant grandiose references to the brilliance of his own writing, made ludicrous by his efforts here: Short, punchy sentences adding up to...boredom. \\"Shocking\\" revelations of petty crime, masturbation, Electra fantasies and Benzedrine abuse that accrete to...yawns.Suffering from an obvious lack of fact to base the book on, Ellroy resorts to retelling the same series of events several times, from several points of view, like \\"Rashomon.\\" Unlike \\"Rashomon,\\" the end result is irritation, as there is little new insight gained from each retelling. And when sheer repetition fails to bulk up the book enough, Ellroy includes - verbatim - long transcripts of many rather dull witness interrogations, all of which ultimately lead nowhere. If Ellroy is trying to make us feel the tedium and endless dead-ends of a murder investigation, he succeeds too well. But I suspect the real reason was his first draft wasn't thick enough.But then even his main story runs dry, so Ellroy starts chronicling - at great length - the rather prosaic life experiences of an L.A. Sheriff's Dept. Homicide detective, and the progress of various, completely unrelated, L.A. County homicide investigations. The other murders are more interesting than Ellroy's mother's, but you get the feeling that every retired homicide cop in the world has written his own book filled with exactly the same stuff....and you don't buy those books.Try as he might, Ellroy never manages to make his mother a vivid, engaging personality for us. But as the book grinds on, one begins to suspect that his failure is not completely his fault. It gradually becomes clear that Geneva Ellroy's death was the most interesting thing about her.No doubt researching and writing the book was a great catharsis for Ellroy. But like the onanism which Ellroy recounts here at such tedious length, there's little in it for anyone else."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I've been a fan of James Ellroy since reading \\"The Black Dahlia\\" years ago. He blended violent death and raw eroticism, threw in a few dashes of creative nonfiction, and came up with a fast-paced noir tale about a detective who becomes obsessed with the murdered Elizabeth Short, aka The Black Dahlia. The protagonist doesn't content himself with merely trying to unmask her killer- he pursues Short as if she were yet attainable, loving her more in death than he ever could have in life.\\"My Dark Places\\" evolved from an article Ellroy wrote for GQ Magazine after viewing the homicide file of his mother, Geneva 'Jean' Ellroy, whose strangled remains were dumped in a seedy L.A. suburb in 1958. The killer was never found and the case was closed, but the ten year old Ellroy was left with a lifelong fascination with the beautiful and the slaughtered. After battling through a personal hell of drug and alcohol addiction, he made unconscious attempts to reconnect with his mother by writing provocative and darkly loving crime fiction whose primary love interests were dead women.Ellroy teamed up with veteran homicide detective Bill Stoner and re-opened the thirty year old case case. They pored over yellowing files and battered evidence boxes, and interviewed some of the last people to see Geneva Ellroy alive. Ellroy recounts their efforts in a suspenseful manner that would do justice to a good piece of detective fiction. While their investigation does not result in the finding of her killer, Ellroy clearly experiences a psychic catharsis in the process, and the reader witnesses a documented softening of a child's hostility into an adult son's love for a mother he never truly knew."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I first saw James Ellroy when he was being interviewed about this book by Catherine Crier on Court TV. My heart both broke and went out to him: his mother's murder, although 10 years' after the Black Dahlia, has some similarities. This book is about his re-opening the investigation of her case, but it is more about his coming to terms with her and her murder after many years of his being lost and floundering, and his attempts to reconcile many conflicting feelings and memories of her. But most of all it is about this bravely emotional, heroic man who, despite rock-bottom suffering, faces life honestly and dead-on and reacts to it in a way that is uniquely raw, visceral, powerful, affirming, and fiercely intense, like his writing style. Unforgettable book and writer!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I heard Ellroy interviewed on public radio when this book came out. I was fascinated then by his story. I didn't get his name just right and had trouble finding the book. While browsing recently in a book store I came across it, somehow placed in the wrong section. It was as good as his interview promised it would be. Having lived in California for over 20 years his descriptions of the LA scene and the lifestyle there ring true. I can't wait to read White Jazz and the rest of his books. Now I know why I left California."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I am a devoted fan of James Ellroy's work and My Dark Places is the source and raison d'etre for all his other work. After experiencing his own mother's murder and how this in turn affected his life, I feel he is by far truly qualified to narrate tales of LA street violence and criminal compulsion-he has lived it first person and this work candidly reveals his innermost thoughts and personal investigation into his mother's murder. My biggest hope throughout the reading was that the killer himself would make contact and fill in the missing essential of that fateful night. Weird- I was also born in 48, grew up in Glendale California and got hooked on my own unsolved-the murder of a classmate that will forever haunt me. I understand the need to solve the crime so the victim can at least have some partial power restored."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Mr. Ellroy takes on the difficult task of confronting the ghost of his murdered mother, and he deals with his confusion, anger, love and hate with an unparalleled honesty. I have not previously read Ellroy's fiction, but look forward to it now. It is rare for someone to write of their pain with such insight, without the sentimentality one generally finds in autobiographical works. Superb, gritty, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This true crime memoir reads like fiction (or more accurately Ellroy's fiction). Here's where all the fuel for his fantastic noir novels comes from. I found the sections on the initial investigation in 958, and Ellroy's own in the 1990's to be the most interesting of the book, but reading about his life is both shocking and eye opening as well. A great read."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Readers now know why James Ellroy's novels are filled with so much evil and sordidness. As &quot;My Dark Places&quot; reveals, his novels are filled with mirror shards of his own life. The book is not for everyone (reading these online reviews shows that clearly). It is compelling to those who are drawn to his novels by the sharp dialogue, the seamy characters, and the sense that real life is exactly like his stories. I can't say I &quot;enjoyed&quot; the book just like I can't say I enjoyed driving past the scene of a car crash. But reading this book gave me the same feeling I get when I drive by the scene of a car crash.

An autobiographical book detailing Ellroy's troubled life after learning of his mother's murder. This event begining Ellroy's decent into a very troubled life which he shares for his readers in all of its dark, painful, obsessions. I give Ellroy much credit for opening up his life to strangers. It is a rough painful life, but worth reading about. And equally important told to his readers without any apologies or excuses. In this age of looking for someone to blame, Ellroy's book is in many ways refreshing. Ellroy has opened the door of his life to the public in a way few people ever do. All I would say to his sharp critics is, Do you have the courage to reveal you own horrors and obsessions the way Ellroy has? Ellroy has his &quot;dark places&quot;. I have mine. Don't you?"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I can't say this is a book that I &quot;enjoyed,&quot; but I am infinitely glad I read it. I don't think it's a book you can really get pure &quot;enjoyment&quot; out of. It is much darker than any of his other works and left me feeling unfulfilled at the end, simply because of the hopelessness of the invesigation. I cried at one point because of the futility of his search. It's emotionally trying - Ellroy challenges readers to try to understand his obsessions and his personal demons. I think this book is only for the true Ellroy fan. For others, his self-revelations might be repulsive."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"My Dark Places is one of the most compelling books I have ever read. It is also very upsetting, as would be witnessing an act of gruesome violence or a terrible crash. I do recommend it, not least for the light it casts on other Ellroy books, but you should keep it for a time in your life when you can afford a sleepless night or two. I lent it to my business partner and he almost fired some of our workers so upset was he while reading it.Buried within the book is also a fascinating expos&eacute; of the settling of some outer L.A. suburbs."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Readers often wonder what makes their favorite writers tick--we want to point to a significant moment in their lives, a single event which made them become writers. When asked this question, most authors tend to shrug it off, saying that they were always compelled to write. James Ellroy would answer the question differently, because he knows the defining event of his personal life and writing career. It happened in 1958, when he was ten: his mother, Jean, was found murdered, a nylon stocking and a cotton cord lashed around her neck. Her corpse was found in an ivy patch near a high school, looking, as Ellroy himself describes it, \\"like a classic late night body dump.\\" Despite a thorough investigation, her murderer was never found.When his mother died, Ellroy, the innocent victim of his parent's acrimonious divorce, was already well on the way to perfecting his \\"Crazy Man Act\\". Always somewhat of a misfit, Ellroy began to revel in his strangeness under his father's care. After his father's death seven years later, Ellroy spent the next thirteen years in a steep downward spiral, engaging in petty crime, serving jail time, and abusing drugs and alcohol. His only solace during this time were the wild fantasies he concocted in his head, and the crime novels which fueled those fantasies.During those decades, Ellroy struggled with the memory of \\"the redhead\\", as he often refers to his mother. Outwardly professing to hate her, he was confused by his true feelings. These repressed emotions produced a life long obsession with crime and crime fiction, which eventually surfaced in the recurring themes present in many of his novels. \\"Her death corrupted my imagination and gave me exploitable gifts.\\" His writing, which allowed him to cope with his inner demons, eventually provided a means of reconciling with his mother--he would investigate her death, and attempt to find some answers to what had become the defining mystery of his own life.In 1994, Ellroy, at the urging of his future wife, decided to try to reopen his mother's police file. With the help of Bill Stoner, a 32 year veteran of the L. A. County Sheriff's Department, Ellroy conducted his own investigation of his mother's death, which ultimately failed to uncover any significant new leads. Although marked by some startling revelations, the investigation was hampered by the passage of time and the dimming memories of the parties involved. The investigation was not a total failure, however, because in trying to find the killer, Ellroy found his mother instead. Now, instead of a fantasy construct, Ellroy has a better idea of who the real Jean Ellroy was.Ellroy's failure to discover his mother's killer might bother some readers, but shouldn't. My Dark Places is, in the final analysis, Ellroy's attempt to reach out to his mother nearly forty years after her death, and as such, is eminently successful. By writing this memoir, Ellroy resurrects \\"the redhead\\" for a brief moment, just long enough to come to appreciate her as a person. Doing so, it seems that he finally comes to terms with her death."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy's unique voice in contemporary crime fiction springs from events in his own life which are the basis for My Dark Places. This book reveals a tortured early life overshadowed by the murder of Ellroy's mother and subsequent contact with police along with an adolescent descent into petty crime and drug use. That the person portrayed in these pages manages to sublimate his demons and channel them into some of the best noir fiction ever written, is a remarkable human achievement. Those who love Ellroy's books should read this memoir for the insight into the man it provides and, also, for the pleasure of reading a real life version of what could easily be a typical Ellroy subplot to an L.A. mystery.Really interesting stuff. Read this and you will know why Ellroy seems stuck in L.A. in another age - and why he can make it come to life with such power."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Ellroy is an internationally best-selling crime author (L.A. Confidential, The Black Dahlia, etc.). He also grew out of true crime--his mother Jean Ellroy was assaulted, murdered, and had her body dumped in a ditch in 1958, when James was 10 years old. James's father poisoned him against his mother, portraying her as a drunken whore. The boy grew up a troublemaker and serious addict, stealing, burglarizing, lying, using, and living on the streets. Somehow (not covered in this book, to my disappointment), he got his life together, became a star as a crime novelist, and then decided to re-open the 30-year-old unsolved murder of his mother.Ellroy himself admits that he had dubious motives for re-visiting his mother's murder case--he thought writing an article for GQ about his fascinating past would generate some excellent publicity for his upcoming novel. To his own surprise, Ellroy became engrossed in the dead-end case. He was mystified as the concept of his mother as anything other than a \\"drunken whore.\\" Ellroy ends up partnering with seasoned homicide detective Bill Toner to re-open then case, investigate 30-year-old leads, trace old witnesses, and garner publicity for potential witnesses to come forward. During the course of the new investigation, Ellroy learns more than he planned about his mother's past, her motivations, and her heritage...which is his own heritage.The memoir is structured into four parts--(1) a third person, chillingly detailed account of the 1958 murder and ensuing investigation, (2) a first-person account of Ellroy's boyhood, loss of his mother, and descent into criminality and vagrancy, (3) a third-person telling of the career of Bill Stoner and his successes and frustrations in homicide investigations, and, finally, (4) the story of the Ellroy/Stoner partnership in re-opening the murder investigation. Through and through, the book reveals the tedium of chasing down tenuous leads, dealing with crazy tips, canvassing for tiny leads, and the overwhelming dedicated labor of crime detectives. Reading about all the dead leads can exhaust the reader, so one can only imagine how the detectives felt.Due to the four-part structure, those coming for \\"true crime\\" will most like the first and third parts, while anyone who is interested in Ellroy as a person will enjoy the second part, but may well be frustrated that many years of his life immediately before his success as an author are omitted. The fourth part, about the re-opened investigation, is frustrating for both the participants and the reader, and lacks nice, neat Hollywood-style plot developments. But it is real life!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"\\"My Dark Places\\" is about the author's futile search for his mother's killer. It is also a fascinating memoir of one of today's most successful crime writers. Although there is an obvious link between these two themes - a link that Ellroy indulges a very large chunk of his book to - the two parts fail to form a complete marriage. For my money the memoir elements of \\"Places\\" are much more compelling and readable. The second half of the book, which documents his work with a retired homicide detective to find the killer, is, well, a little dull. I found myself wishing he would dip back into the well of his youth, when his life was herky-jerky and wild. The investigation into his mother's death is spiked with dead-ends and ponderous soul-searching. And it is dreadfully repetitive at times."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Both autobiography and biography, Ellroy narrates the account of his search for the truth behind his mother's murder in four parts. He begins with a cold journalistic account of the initial investigation that does not quite come off. In part two, he details a protracted adolescence that begins at age 9 when his mother is murdered and does not end until he is 30, in which his existence deteriorates into what call only be called depravity. The third part of the book delves into the life and career of real-life cop Bill Stoner and the beginning of the reinvestigation into the murder with Ellroy. The final part details his mother's life up until her murder, the outcome of the reinvestigation, the last murder case in the career of Stoner, and the trial of O.J. Simpson. This book is a must read for many reasons, but chiefly for its brutal honesty. Firstly, it is an unadulterated autobiographical account of the writer's complicated psychology and his descent into sexual perversion, drug addiction, alcoholism, and petty criminality. Rarely do we admit these to our close family and friends let alone an international audience and certainly not with the perceptiveness and brilliant narrative that Ellroy is capable of. Secondly, nobody knows the mind of cops like Ellroy. His are like no others described in fiction or fact, they are flawed geniuses that demand condemnation and sympathy simultaneously."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Over the years, crime writer James Ellroy has put up a macho front about the brutal death of his mother Jean, aka Geneva, in 1958, referring to it as \\"the whack\\" and \\"the Geneva snuff\\". His mother was raped and strangled, her body dumped near a school in El Monte, CA, a run-down white-trash suburb of L.A. The crime remained unsolved.Never sure if he was actually sad at his mother's death--his parents were separated and his mother was given custody, even though he wanted to live with his father--Elroy became obsessed by a more celebrated unsolved murder, that of Elizabeth Short, the so-called Black Dahlia. After years of petty crime, drug abuse and alcoholism, he became a successful writer, using the Black Dahlia case as the basis for his bestselling novel of the same name, in which he finally perfected his ultra-hardboiled, violent and cynical style, looking into L.A.'s corrupt heart of darkness.My Dark Places grew out of a story he wrote for GQ magazine in which he went to see the police files on his mother's slaying, which included graphic photographs and autopsy reports. Ellroy employed a former homicide detective to re-investigate his mother's murder, going over some of the suspects, witnesses and detectives from the original case. More importantly, Ellroy, for the first time, re-examined his own feelings for his mother, looking into her secret life after years of having abandoned her.This account is genuinely appalling and, unlike the novels, Ellroy makes no secret of the pain, frustration, fear, sense of loss and the knowledge that he himself has been wrong about his mother for most of his life. My Dark Places is one of the most courageous books ever written."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This is a remarkable book. If there were a five-plus rating, that is what I'd give to this astonishing work of art.James Ellroy's quest is to solve the 1958 murder of his mother. Along the way, we learn about his twisted adolescence, and his brushes with madness, depicted brilliantly.The reader has to have come to grips with his or her own demons in order to be comfortable reading this book, in that Ellroy's feelings for his murdered mother include the incestuous feelings Freud always claimed we all feel for our opposite sex parents. Ellroy describes these feelings with enormous intensity. In fact, this book is all about intensity, from the first page to the last.I've read any number of true crime books, and though this is not exactly a true crime read, that's about as close as the reader can come to describing it. In the books I've read, the victims have, unfortunately, not been described intently enough that I've really remembered them after I've finished the book. With My Dark Places, Ellroy so intensely describes his mother, Jean, that she is as real to me as someone I knew intimately.I think, in fact, that &quot;intimate&quot; describes this entire book. Rather than give away any of the story, let me just say that this book is as intimate as a dark night's sexual encounter with someone dangerous.This is one of the best books of any kind that I've yet read."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy writes dark crime books. This memoir explains why.When Ellroy was ten, someone strangled his mother and left her body in a car. Her killer has never been found.The memoir documents Ellroy's life before and after the murder. In denial at first, he escaped into a life of drugs and crime. Later, Ellroy dropped the lifestyle, but maintained a fascination with crime, especially murdered women such as the famous &quot;Black Dahlia.&quot;Ellroy's writing style swings between two extremes. At times he writes with the cool detachment of a detective. For example, he describes in extensive detail the murder scene and the state of his mother's violated body, reporting much as a uninvolved coroner might do. This unemotional style, Ellroy explains, was one method he developed to cope with his mother's death.In other parts of the memoir, though, Ellroy departs completely from this eerie detachment. He invites the reader into his &quot;dark places,&quot; the ugly parts of himself that most people keep hidden. These scenes are some of the most intensely personal, and powerful, in the book. By writing about dark emotions and dark experiences, Ellroy is able to move past them.Part of the memoir focuses upon Ellroy's attempts, thirty years later, to track down the truth about his mother's life and death. Truth about others, much like the truths about self that Ellroy explores earlier in the memoir, prove difficult to grasp."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"\\"My Dark Places\\" has become a new classic in the genre of intimate true crime. Think about it: Most true crime is a fairly pedantic and formulaic affair in which a detached observer drops into the investigation (or maybe even the trial) and retells some rewarmed facts more or less accurately.Very few entries in the true-crime genre have been written by professional storytellers with intimate connections to the crime and its aftermath. Vincent Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter\\" comes to mind ... and he was the prosecutor, not a relative or friend of the criminals or the victims. Ann Rule's \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" is another.Ellroy's is even more intimate, even more visceral. The son of a murdered woman -- a cold case, nearly 50 years later -- he goes in search of her killer, as well as some of his darker Oedipal tendencies as he tries to explain himself and his mother's murder.Without giving away the ending, I'll say this: It ends as most of these things do. In that, there's a ring of truth in this \\"true\\" crime."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Like all great crime novels, Ellroy's memoir starts with a compelling murder. Kids playing baseball would find her body in some ivy in El Monte, California. From a disheveled dress and an exposed upper chest, to ligatures constricted with such force they were only three inches in diameter, Ellroy describes the crime scene and those opening weeks of the investigation with his familiar staccato style. There is more here than meets the eye, however. We begin to see a picture of a 10 year old boy whose entire life has been ruled by a crime; not just any crime, but the brutal murder of that pretty redheaded woman in the ivy. Her name was Jean Ellroy. That boy is author James Ellroy.She got a divorce and started over in El Monte with her son. She tried to balance the two worlds of her drinking and promiscuity with her work as a nurse and the solid life she was trying to give her son. Those two worlds would merge on a King's Row curb. This memoir is a dance of reconcilliation for Ellroy, and an attempt to separate her death from her life, and make her ghost come alive as a real person. Brutal and unflinching in its honesty, this memoir is not for the weak. It is a true crime story that reads like a police procedural. The crimes are real. The people are messed up. The names have not been changed beacause there are no innocents.Once we realize this is Ellroy's love letter to his slain mother, we can't put it down. Ellroy describes in detail and with brutal candor the bitterness between his mother and father and the war fought for his loyalty. Once she was dead, he would both obsess over, and run from her murder his entire life. He spouted propoganda and hate just to get attention. The parenting skills of his father, which can best be described as permissive neglect, left him with too much freedom and far too much time. It was this time he would use for elaborate fantasies about his mother. He would form an obsession with the Betty Short-Black Dahlia murder. In every fantasy, Ellroy would somehow save the women and they would be grateful. He could not save his mother. He was still running leading to years of drug and alcohol abuse, finally escalating into voyeurism and crime. The temporary highs were an escape that would come to a screaching halt when his mind had had enough, and decided to take a timeout. When Ellroy got his mind working again, he found work as a golf caddy and began writing crime novels. After some success, he finally decided to face his mother's ghost by solving her murder. Unbelievably, this memoir has just begun.Detective Bill Stoner was living with dead women as well, and Ellroy brings them all to life for the reader as he takes us into the world of cops and crime. Cops like Stoner knew about obsession. Ellroy explains that almost all homicide cops love the old film \\"Laura.\\" Because they too have all fallen in love with dead girls, just like Dana Andrews does in this cinematic masterpiece. Stoner was leaving the job after 32 years, the last 12 in homicide. Stoner was a well known and respected cop willing to help Ellroy attempt to to find closure. Stoner was the cop responsible for solving the famous Cotton Club murder. He understood Ellroy. He too was living with dead girls. Ellroy pays homage to the ghosts of Stoner's women along the way, making sure you will always remember names like Bunny Krauch and Susan Hamway. You will remember a baby murdered by proxy. Perhaps foremost, you will remember a young and innocent Tracy Lea Stewart. She would be picked up by Robbie Beckett and brought to Daddy Beckett like a lamb to the slaughter. She would be raped and murdered. Convictions would not equal closure.The reader spends over a year with Stoner and Ellroy as they probe the memories of old cops and witnesses and chase down leads. They would go public in GQ Magazine and on TV with Unsolved Mysteries. Though this memoir is brutal and sad, it is also tense and exciting, and at times, very funny. I can not tell you the ending, or even if there is one. You have to read this for yourself. What I have described of this brilliant book is only the tip of the iceberg. You will never forget this after reading it. Unfortunately, you will never forget a lot of things..."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Over the past twenty years, James Ellroy has written nearly a dozen novels that have established him as the foremost contemporary successor to the noir crime fiction of forerunners such as Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett and James Cain. Set primarily in Los Angeles (although some of his novels, such as \\"American Tabloid\\", have taken on bigger settings and themes), Ellroy's narratives are marked by what one critic has described as a \\"telegraphic\\" style, one short sentence following another in a breathless staccato of hard-boiled language, graphic (at times grisly) description, and a pervasive, and often seemingly morbid and pessimistic, obsession with sexual crime and violence.Ellroy is an astonishingly good writer, albeit a writer who is not for everyone: his vivid and grotesquely detailed explorations of rape and murder, of men preying on woman, of brutal police practices, often make the reader squeamish and uncomfortable. The effect is powerful testimony to the talent.But where does Ellroy's remarkable writing come from? \\"My Dark Places,\\" subtitled \\"An L.A. Crime Memoir,\\" provides an answer: from the real life noir of Ellroy's life.On a Sunday morning in June, 1958, James Ellroy's forty-five year old mother, Jean, was murdered. Her body was found in a vacant lot next to a school in El Monte, California, a gritty, working class city east of Los Angeles. \\"A nylon stocking and a cotton cord were lashed around her neck. Both ligatures were tightly knotted.\\" James Ellroy was ten years old at the time. His parents were divorced. He had just returned home from a weekend visit with his father when he was told about the murder. While a \\"Swarthy Man\\" was seen with the victim, the murder was never solved.\\"My Dark Places\\" tells the story of Jean Ellroy's murder in 1958. It also tells the story of the next twenty years of James Ellroy's life, when he drifted to drugs and alcohol, to an obsession with crimes of sex and violence, to a kind of noirish bottom which was the prelude to his life as a writer. It tells the story of how the noir obsessions of Ellroy's fictions were the creative and self-sustaining response to the dark episodes of his real life. And, finally, it tells the story of Ellroy's renewed search for his mother's murderer and, along the way, his search for his mother herself. In Ellroy's words:\\"I knew things about us. I sensed other things. Her death corrupted my imagination and gave me exploitable gift. My mother gave me the gift and the curse of obsession. It began as curiosity in lieu of childish grief. It flourished as a quest for dark knowledge and mutated into a horrible thirst for sexual and mental stimulation. Obsessive drives almost killed me. A rage to turn my obsessions into something good and useful saved me. I outlived the curse. The gift assumed its final form in language.\\"\\"My Dark Places\\" is a dark and disturbing memoir, an intimate plunge into the life and the psyche of James Ellroy. It is also, like his novels, a chilling exploration of real life crimes of sex and violence in Los Angeles, Ellroy's search for his mother's murderer being the touchstone for a narrative contrail of grisly and perverse crimes that he encounters along the way."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"On a spring Sunday afternoon of 1958, 10-year-old James Ellroy returned to his El Monte residence after spending a weekend with his father. He wondered why the residence was surrounded by police cars and uniformed officers. Ellroy was quickly informed that his mother had been killed.Jean Ellroy, a former Midwest beauty contest winner who had come to Southern California in hopes of becoming a film star, had been raped, then strangled, her body left in an empty lot next door to a school. The tragic death prompted Ellroy's life to spin into a web of tragedy and confusion and he did not find himself and end his turbulent existence until he reached his thirties.After his mother's death young Ellroy went to live with his father. His parents had divorced and his father, an accountant who once worked for screen siren Rita Hayworth, was going to seed through alcohol. At a time when Ellroy needed stability and proper attention he received neither.Ellroy sought recognition in the wrong way. Attending a predominantly Jewish school in West Los Angeles, he successfully shocked and antagonized his schoolmates after riding his bicycle to Hollywood and obtaining anti-Semitic right wing hate literature from the notorious John Birchite local bookstore, \\"Poor Richard's,\\" reading the material, then unleashing it on his schoolmates. He also lost himself in a world of alcohol and drugs, holed up in an abandoned residence at one point, and burgled homes in the area.His life began taking a different turn when he went to work at a ritzy local country club. Though he was ultimately fired after a physical altercation, it was here that Ellroy stumbled on what would become a lucrative profession that would make him an international celebrity. Still seeking to comprehend the meaning of his mother's unsolved murder, Ellroy began reading Jack Webb's magazine regularly. Webb became famous in the fifties as the creator of the hugely successful \\"Dragnet\\" television series, which he produced and starred in, playing a Los Angeles police detective. Ellroy read the magazines religiously, began reading crime novels of the greats such as Chandler and Hammett, and finally began writing himself. It was anything but coincidental that one of Ellroy's biggest hits was \\"The Black Dahlia\\" based on the character Elizabeth Short, who came to Los Angeles in hopes of becoming a film star, was brutally murdered, and left in a vacant lot by her killer. The facts closely paralleled the life and death of Jean Ellroy.When Ellroy achieved riches and renown, also producing such runaway bestsellers as \\"American Tabloid\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" the latter becoming a highly successful film, he turned his attention to the detective case which had dominated his mind from 1958, the unsolved murder of his mother. Ellroy secured the services of retired Los Angeles homicide detective Bill Stoner to assist him in his effort to crack the case. Ultimately Stoner would become the detective novelist's best friend as they revisited crime scenes in and around El Monte and closely re-examined all available evidence.While their cumulative efforts would not result in finding the killer or killers of Jean Ellroy, the novelist would find the experience cathartic. He came to know his mother in a way he never had earlier.One of the most interesting aspects of the investigation was the interview of a woman who had been working as a car hop at a drive in, believed to be the last person to see Jean Ellroy alive aside from her killer. The woman described Jean as a gregarious, friendly woman. The man with her, however, was uncommunicative. The description she gave of a tall, swarthy, dark-haired man correlates with the disclosures of others who earlier that night saw Jean drinking with a man fitting that description at an El Monte nightclub-bar. The same man had been seen at the same establishment as well as another in the area prior to that night. He would never be seen again in the area.Speculation further abounded over the murder by strangulation of a woman not far from where Jean Ellroy met her death about a year later. If the suspect in question had been a serial killer, however, using that MO, then a question emerged: Why was there no further evidence of future murders or attempts?The best guess as to what happened to Jean Ellroy was furnished by those who concluded that her killer, expecting sex, ran into resistance. Deciding to take her despite her resistance, spurred on by alcohol, he ultimately concluded that it was better to kill Jean Ellroy rather than risk her reporting the rape to the police. It was very late, dark, and there was presumably no one around so the rapist decided to opt for murder to silence Jean Ellroy. Police investigators speculate that he was an intelligent, perhaps well educated man due to the thoroughness displayed subsequent to the killing. In that he was never seen in El Monte again he might well have been from another area.This is a work perhaps even more riveting than Ellroy's traditional page-turning fiction in that this is a story of a young boy who lost his mother at the impressionable age of 10, and who was determined to understand Jean Ellroy better and reach a measure of closure in his life."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I have read most of Ellroy's fiction, and delighted in the unashamed darkness of those works, but none of them come close to this. This is the real Ellroy, and his dark places are too dark for most of us. Sit back and marvel at the truth of his depravity, safe in the knowledge that his tour de force writing saves us all from the taint of voyeurism - that's my excuse, anyway."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Ellroy is one of the finest novelists of crime fiction that we have today. This book however is not fiction, but rather an account of Ellroy's search for the killer of his mother when he was but a 10 year old. Ellroy delves into his relationships with a divorced mother who loved him but lived a restless and somewhat promiscuous life, and a distant emotionally cold philanderer who never grew up for a father. Ellroy teams up with a homicide detective to see if they could come up with a plausible suspect. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others who enjoy non fiction crime books."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I randomly stumbled on this book in the library when I was in high school. I'm rereading it now and it's even better the second time around. What hooked me was the the mention of the city I lived in on the very first page. Throughout the book, Ellroy goes into detail about the San Gabriel Valley, and gives you history on the area. It was such an interesting read because this is where I grew up so it was nice to learn a bit of history about it. He is a very skilled writer and the way that he tells you this very personal story in this point of view makes for an addictive read."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I started to reading James Ellroy in the late 1990s when I was in College. The film adaptation of \\"LA Confidential\\" had come out my senior year of High School and made a big impact on me. So, starting in 1999 I began my trip through Ellroy's LA. About mid-way through this dark and often unpleasant journey I read \\"My Dark Places\\", Ellroy's own quest to solve the murder of his mother and a autobiography of sorts. If you like Ellroy's books, this book is an important read as far as understanding where it all comes from. It would seem that much of what Ellroy is as a man, and a writer, comes from this experience. Ellroy peppers in some interesting details on 1950s/1960s Los Angeles, Law enforcement and other historical elements, but at the core is his mother. Its a very revealing, and interesting read, and may even serve as a guide for Ellroy's fiction. But like his novels, it is hard to read sometimes. Ellroy seldom holds back, and what he reveals in both prose and truth is sometimes very dark indeed."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"In reality, this is more than a memoir--it's an urban composition that paints a picture of a city suspended in time, and a murder that still remains unsolved. It tells the story of a lost child and the man he becomes, detailing the crooked path it took to get there. More importantly, it tells the story of a child who lost his mother to foul play, and the man who rediscovers who she was by studying the evidence surrounding her case. This was my first Ellroy book, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I've read autobiographies in the past that reeked with the air of insencerity. It seemed that the authors focused on insubstantial fluff as a gesture of self-promotion--putting on airs, so to speak--while completely ignoring anything even remotely negative. Ellroy does more than expose the less than pleasant points of his life, he revels in it. What guts! This guy doesn't just open old wounds, he douses them with salt. Is it an uncomfortable book? At times, yes. Is it a rewarding read? Definately. It's truely refreshing to see a best-selling author expose himself with such sheer honesty."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"My Dark Places is James Ellroy's fascinating and dark look at his relationship with his mother who was murdered when the author was 10. Leaving nothing to the imagination and writing in the same style he has used in his previous fiction works, Ellroy treats us to a fascinating if sometimes macabre look at his personal life following the death of his mother. Ellroy's mother was strangled and left near his home in El Monte when the author was 10. Ellroy uses this book to talk about the feelings he had as a child, his behavior after, and his search as an adult for the killer of his mother. Through his search, he gets in touch with all the forbidden feelings he's had locked up inside for many years. Few authors would dare to write what Ellroy has here, revealing a combination of feelings which few of us would ever even admit to having for our parents. This remarkable book also shows the redemptive nature of getting in touch with those feelings leaving his soul to bare for the world to see. Compelling."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This book is readable,though not quite up to other reviews that led me to buy it...it is finally an obsessive, inconclusive whodunit, with interesting rooted-in-LA detail but I am less interested in J.E./s dissolute boyhood than he thinks I am."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This book floored me like a bottle of cheap whiskey, a fat joint, and a leggy blonde weaing a garter and stockings."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I was a huge fan of James Ellroy until I read 'My Dark Places,' now you couldn't give me one of his books to read. It appears that this book comes from a very sick, twisted mind, of someone who truly had no respect for his mother. The book is very distrubing, somewhat boring and very disgusting, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I've read the books of James Ellroy and I concluded that he is the most important contemporary north-american writer in the sense of his work: the art of writing. This book is necessary for the reading of the others because is autobiographical - it's important to remember the hard life of the author, the death of his mother (this fact was a crime), the absence of his father, the superation of these and other trauma by the way of reading and writing - and because it serves as a map of the work at all. Perhaps I recommend as the second reading his story book and so the fiction and romance. Ellroy is a classic, not only a noir writer or police/crime/suspense writer - he is a classic writer: it's not sufficient one reading and it's necessary the reading.

Ellroy could not have portrayed himself any more convincingly as the author I would LEAST like to meet. From his choice of words and awkwardly- placed profanities, to his tacky pride and conceited name change, he doesn't seem to have evolved much in character since as a 10-year old he lapped up his father's propaganda about his mother. Poor dear Geneva - your son has disgraced you in the interests of his own 'success'. Poor Aunt Leoda - little Leroy never learned respect. In future books, I hope Leroy, I mean James, strives for better content, nobler content, white orchids.

The first section chronicled the death and investigation of Mr. Ellroy's mother. That was OK. We were then subjected to a detained listing of the author's alcohol and drug use covering over ten years of his life. It was little more than a list of where he went, what drugs he took, where he went, what drugs he took, where he went, what drugs he took, how much he drank-how he could remember all that under the influence of such is amazing. We next got to meet the police officer who assisted him in his search to find the murderer of his mother. OK.The rest of the book is simply a repetition of who was investigated for the murder, how they discovered the name of that person, and why that person was dismissed as a candidate for the murderer. The information often ran page after page of simply names and alibis. The only reason I finished the book was a curiosity over whether or not he would name the murdered-which he never did. There was a final \\"making peace with himself and his mother\\" that was almost over before I realized it had started.Not a typical Ellery book."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I know how a bad review can hurt the author and I don't take that lightly. I just don't want someone else to buy this novel without knowing what they're getting. I found the book boring and repetative. I kept reading it anyway because I kept hoping it would get better. It never did. I then kept reading hoping for a good ending. I got no satisfaction with that either. It leaves you hanging. I really enjoy true crime stories but this one makes me not ever want to read one again. Sad but true!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy steals the spotlight of a horrendous crime.

I would not have continued it after the first 50 pages if it had not been the selection for the local book club. If you ever have the chance DON'T READ IT! It is a true crime/detective story about the murder of his mother and contains many disgusting, foul and obscene parts. It is truly amazing that with the many evil, black (not just dark) thoughts James Ellroy has/had about his mother and other murdered women in the L.A. area that he did not turn into a serial murderer himself. The only enlightening thing about the book is the question of how many other boys reading &quot;true crime&quot; books will accept his dark thoughts and evil suggestions as normal and be pushed into a private life as perverted as the one James Ellroy describes as his own. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This is not a book about Ellroy's attempt to find his mother's killer. No more so than MOBY DICK is about one man's futile attempt to catch a white whale. This book is about a search which will never end, even if the murderer is some day discovered. This is a book about self discovery. It is an incredible introduction to the tedious, relentless and passionate process of discovering who this woman was, and who James Ellroy is. MY DARK PLACES is the MOBY DICK of the nineties. The LAPD is our Ahab. Ellroy is our Ishamel."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"&quot;My Dark Places&quot; is about James Ellroy's search for the person who murdered his mother in 1958. The first half of the book is interesting and as well-written as any of Ellroy's novels. It deals with the circumstances of his mother's murder, his troubled adolescence, and background on his search partner, former cop Bill Stoner. The second half, which details Ellroy and Stoner's investigation, is tedious and gets nowhere. I think it's time for Ellroy to stop the search, forget about Mom, and get on with something else (like the cold war machinations of &quot;American Tabloid&quot;)"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy's &quot;My Dark Places&quot; is unlike anything I have ever read before. This true life account of Ellroy's investigation into his mother's murder nearly 30 years ago is as raw a confessional as one is likely to encounter. His depiction of the impact of his mother's slaying on his own life and the resultant inferno-like descent makes for riveting reading, though not for those who are easily offended. This is noir as bottomless pit. You don't just scrape your knuckles going down, but the understanding you're likely to garner is well worth the bruises"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This is a facinating read for for Ellroy fans as well as those reading him for the first time. One note of warning: If an abundence of harsh language and harsher attitudes will bother the reader, move on. But if the reader takes pleasure in open wound psyches and hammer to head honesty then grab this and immerse youself in a fascinating journey into the soul and life of a man who has lived the kind of life that should be on a poster of how not to do it. While on the surface this book is about the re-investigation of the murder of Ellroy's mother it is in fact a confessional of his life and an examination of a pervereted father-son-dead mother relationship.The difference between this book and other such confessionals is Ellroy's pull no punches examination of his own mistakes, seperate from the abuses heaped on him by his father and the terrible loss of a none too perfect mother. From peeping tom to burgler to junkie to best selling author, his story might be hard to believe if he were not so harsh on himself. A big plus to Ellroy fans is the look at many of his past deviant behaviors which he has used,to great obsessive effect,in all of his fictional books. As a side note he finally, through this work of non-fiction, turn the voyeuristic tables on the reader who will cringe all the way through, but like a car wreak has to look. All in all an incredible read"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Imagine you're ten years old, returning home from a weekendwith your father. Cops are there to greet you. Yourmother's dead. Murdered. They're never going to find thekiller. There's never going to be a clear picture of whathappened the night she died. And you're going to spendthe rest of your life wondering who ... wondering why.If you love Ellroy, you'll love this book. All the classicEllroy touches are there. His twisted love for L.A.,the crazed staccato authorial voice, like Jack Webb oncrystal meth, the obssesion with doomed women. If you'vewondered what makes Ellroy tick, you'll find answers here.Maybe more answers than you're prepared to know. It'sa hot ride into the L.A. night. The car door is open.All you need to do is get in.One note, if you don't know Ellroy, this one isn't foryou.

Quartet and then move on to&quot;My Dark Places&quot;."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I must admit that this is my first James Ellroy book (having selected it in my book club based on the interesting sounding synopsis). If I weren't reading it for the book club, I would not have bothered finishing it (I still wish I hadn't).I could deal with Ellroy's \\"hip\\" lingo and short sentences, if only they were about something I could care about (no, in my opinion I shouldn't have to read his other books in order to appreciate this one). I didn't connect with any of the characters (and it's not like he developed many). He does a good job at painting the El Monte area of the late 50's but all the people you meet are folks that really are not that interesting. The first part of the book drags, with accounts and, often verbatim, transcripts of the initial investigation. When it's finished, you hope that finally something interesting is going to happen.You are sorely disappointed. In the second section Ellroy gets to play the exhibitionist. He tells you all about his deprived (depraved?) childhood, and goes into vivid detail about his Oedipal tendencies and his youthful exploits with drugs, petty theft and the occasional voyeurism. Are we supposed to be impressed? Shocked? Feel sorry for the kid? Admire the now-successful author? I did neither; instead the pathetic little creep bored me do death.The next two sections add the retired LA detective who's supposed to help him to uncover the dormant case. He's the first likeable character we meet (there are very few altogether), but again, Ellroy drones on and on about his background and many of his cases. Sure, the cases have nothing to do with Ellroy's mom, but hey, since they involve murdered women, which Ellroy digs, we get to read all about them. The whole re-investigation is one huge, never ending tedium.In the final section we meet Ellroy's estranged relatives and get some background on his mom (nope, not very interesting or revealing, either). Finally, as you breathe a sigh of relieve, the book mercifully peters out.I don't understand how Ellroy's editor would let him publish this schlock. Ellroy is simply regurgitating his research (we wouldn't want the years of obsessive search be a total waste, would we?) and performing some uninspiring self-psychoanalysis. He should know by now that despite the clich&eacute;, truth is usually NOT stranger than fiction. And in his case, it's definitely much less interesting."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I think most high school sophomores can write better sentences than Ellroy's which are devoid of any complexity like clauses and phrases. Most sentences begin with the subject and follow a monotonous pattern which is annoying. However, Ellroy's passion and powers of observation are rarities that impel the reader through the wasteland of his prose. The book is almost unbearably intense as he deals with the raw emotions of facing up to his guilt in emotionally abandoning his mother who was murdered when he was ten. He makes sleazy L.A. come alive; the reader can understand his attraction to this nearly evil place. This is a creepy but fascinating world."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Well worth reading. Very interesting style of writing. Moving, effecting and haunting."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"This initially provocative story was written with such great style, the realization that it wasn't making any real progress was slow in coming. One must appreciate the guts and talent it took to write it, but can't help feeling cheated &amp; abandoned in a strange place. Perhaps that was his point."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"Readers who like a gritty, noir, call-em-as-you-see-em, writing style will love James Ellroy. Ellroy is one-of-a-kind and My Dark Places is his finest work.What a tragedy for a youngster to lose his mother in such a way (the killer never caught.) Usually I cannot get through an entire celebrity autobiography. But I could not put My Dark Places down. This is no looking back through misty eyes. Ellroy's warts shine through--but readers will love him warts and all."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"A disturbing, involving, enrossing, ride through a man's hellish life and times. And search for love (of all kinds). A rip roaring detective yarn. Ellroy's writing is like Hemingway on crack...he searches for the killer of his mother and tries to find her (and his) soul in the process. Many of the reviews here do justice this extraordinary book. It moved me. It scared me. It fascinated me. Crime to Ellroy is lifeblood. We see where it all began. He is one of the great America writers."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I read this in one sitting. It is compelling, bold and brave. It is also one of the most honest accounts of young adulthood - almost shocking in its candour. And every word was integral to the web of understanding which the author was trying to enmesh us in (successfully).A masterpiece. If you like Ellroy, or are fascinated by the psychology of the impact of a crime like murder, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I've read several books by James Ellroy. I was prepared to not like \\"My Dark Places,\\" but it held me for all of its 428 pages. I didn't want to put it down. I think it's his best book (his only nonfiction book as far as I know). In spite of the unpleasant subject matter (the murder of his mother in 1958) and the graphic detail, it's very accessible to read. It makes a lot of fiction seem trivial in comparison. If you want to take a a \\"walk on the wild side\\" vicariously, this book is for you."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"The title of *My Dark Places* is not a metaphor. Ellroy's mother was raped and murdered when he was 10 years old (1958) and the memoir covers the initial investigation of her murder; Ellroy's later downward plunge into drugs, booze, homelessness, theft; his subsequent crawl back out of the gutter to go on to a successful writing career; and finally, his own investigation (with the help of an L.A. Sheriff's Department Homicide detective) of his mother's death. This is a sometimes grim--and always uncompromising--book. Ellroy uses the same graphic, blunt, jazz-like language of his fiction, choosing to show racism and violence against women in an unvarnished way so we see the true horror of them without the compensation of prurient tingles up our spine or the softening of romantic prose. This is the raw stuff of hatred and crime--enthralling, engrossing, pathetic, sometimes hard to take. But even at its darkest, I could not stop reading, compelled forward by the need to know and by the virtuosity of the writing. Ellroy's own need to know made him seek out the murderer of his mother, first to free himself of her ghost, then to see if he could salvage anything of his love for her. He is as unsparing of his own misspent life as he is of his parents, but this is not a book which proclaims, \\"I am a victim therefore can't help how I am because my parents screwed me up.\\" Ellroy utterly rejects that line, taking an unsentimental journey down the spiralling path to hell which, with time, leads him to accept, and love, the wild, lost, and dark places he and his mother shared. Ultimately, the book is about redemption and rediscovered love, what we all seek, though perhaps not as dramatically and honestly as James Ellroy."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy's intense memoir explores the development of his imagination and psyche in relation to the most intense experience of his childhood: learning, at 10 years old, that his mother has been murdered. With searing honesty, Ellroy portrays his obsessions, the breakdown of his mental health, and his life as a petty criminal. Simultaneously, he probes the history of Los Angeles (city and county) and the fight against crime there. I found the Ellroy's layers of exploration fascinating. The book's turning point comes when, in 1994, Ellroy hires a detective to join him in reopening the unsolved case of his mother's murder. At this juncture, as he explores the history of detective Stoner, as he explores L. A. more deeply, and as he continues to come to terms with his own life, all of the many dimensions of this memoir begin to cohere and an extraordinary portrait of an artist, James Ellroy, and his milieu, Los Angeles, results."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"The only question I have about this book is one I can't answer: Is Ellroy's &quot;Bad Man Act&quot; just an act or is he just pretending that it's an act and he is, in fact, the Hitler-loving racist bad man? Where does his heart lie? This book attempts to answer that question, I think, in its own confusing way.In the end, I think Ellroy is a truly weird, gifted, obsessed, slightly over-rated, over-the-top evil genius. Any man who would confess to the things he's done, who would desecrate his mother's memory while worshipping it at the same time, is someone to watch. I don't think I'd want to be him or meet him, but I can read his books."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I just finished reading this book in about two days. I, unlikely as it seems, didn't come to Ellroy because of the film version of L.A. Confidential, I started reading him because an awful lot of writers in the genre admire and recommend his work. I would recommend to any one thinking of getting this book to read as much of the &quot;LA Quartet&quot; (Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz) before tackling it. I think it makes more sense and is especially rewarding when you see the direct correlations between what happened in his real life and what he wrote about. The police routine in the second half is a bit pedantic, but I generally skimmed through a lot of it (as I suspect most people would do). When I finished it, I immediately pulled out Black Dahlia and began re-reading it."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"I love Ellroy's work and have read a lot of it over a relatively short space of time. His style is highly infectious, and carries a punch that makes many other novelists seem fay by comparison. The main interest of this book for me was where all that narrative style and drive came from (mainly reading lots of crime novels, it turns out). As a memoir it's troublesome. Excellent on childhood and adolescence, but ultimately tedious about the police work that obsesses the author and has inspired so much of his work. In fact, this latter aspect makes you wonder if you ever want to read another crime novel ever again. If that was Mr Ellroy's intention - to show us the prosaic reality - he's to be praised for his bravery. Maybe he's made enough money and is tired of the inevitable bull that comes with crime fiction 99% of the time. If not, he may be cutting his own throat... I guess we'll know the answer when we see what his next novel is about - assuming he writes one!"},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"When I met &quot;Lee&quot; Ellroy in junior high school in 1959, we knew his mother had died, but we did not know how. I lost track of Lee after we graduated, and was reintroduced to him when he became James. &quot;My Dark Places&quot; is shocking in it's truth, and for me a trip down memory lane, because I knew the boy who lived through this horrible experience."},{"Title":"My Dark Places","review":"James Ellroy is undeniably a great writer, and the story he tells here --the unsolved murder of his mother when he was ten years old, and how the fact marked (and almost ruined) his life-- is an amazing one. But the book suffers, in my opinion, from a lack of editing. You can't blame Ellroy for believing that every single detail about the case, and his struggle to solve it, is fascinating, but the truth is, the writing suffers from too many details--some of them, irrelevant and even boring. A good editor could have transformed great but raw material into what it should have been: a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Letters To A Friend - The Correspondence Between T. H. White And L. J.

Most university history professors or fellow authors, as well as Bailey himself, consider this the most important work of his literary career. Bailey chronicles the research, writing, and difficulty in finding a publisher for this book in his autobiography, The American Pageant Revisited. The average reader may be overwhelmed with using this daunting volume in a one semester university-level Foreign Policy or Diplomacy course. However, this work is second to none in terms of quality and detail, which make it a highly-sought, highly-used work in such situations. Students as well as instructors may wish to supplement this, or even use this as a supplement, with Thomas Patterson's two-volume American Foreign Policy or the memoirs or official biographies of any relevant figures, especially modern figures such as Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. More advanced or more interested students may wish to follow up on the sources Bailey uses to comprise the bulk of his narrative. Nonetheless, this remains a seminal and irreplaceable work for use in the classroom, in research papers or as the groundwork for a book on foreign policy or diplomatic concerns."},{"Title":"A Diplomatic History of the American People","review":"I have used this book in college and for preparing high school classes. I find the explanation of historical events to be clear and systematic. The supplemental charts are easy to follow. I recommend this book for finding good explanations for the events that the United States was involved in and about the key players at the time."},{"Title":"A Diplomatic History of the American People","review":"Overall I am satisfied with my purchase since the content of the 10th edition of this book was the purpose of the purchase. I first read the book as a college student in the early 1960's and it literally opened my eyes to how our country evolved. I recently rediscoverd the book and purchased this particular edition as a refresher and update through the Vietnam War and the 1980's. Bailey's book is essential for anyone's personal library, as it is perhaps the best-researched analysis of the real making of american history (not newspaper headlines or a biased agendized version). Bailey documents the diplomatic (closed-door) dealings that formed and developed this country which is critical in understanding what is happening today.Unfortunately, the condition of the book I purchased was a little disappointing and distracting since whoever (probably a young student) used the book was very sloppy and abused his broad-tipped red magic marker for underlining and emphansizing his interests and dissatisfactions. Worse, the binding is partially detached making the volume fragile. I believe that I would have listed the condition as marginally acceptable or poor."},{"Title":"A Diplomatic History of the American People","review":"An outstanding historical overview of American foreign policy and individual Secretaries of State and the presidential policies they worked from (or at cross purposes with). Easy-to-read, it is written for the layman, not the academic.I learned things I'd never heard of before, such as the fact that the United States once had troops occupying part of Russia! During the intervention of 1918, Europeans and America went in to support the White Russians and help quell the chaos during the early Russian Revolution.Also that in early American history our relationship with Canada was anything but friendly. There were shooting incidents between Americans and Canadians partly over border disputes and partly over Canadian fears of American invasion."},{"Title":"The Notebook of Elbert Hubbard","review":"I have followed the various essays of Hubbard for a long time.

However, I thought this book was exceptionally well written, easy to follow (it has been along time since I took Organic Chem) and if one goes thru the Bibliography, one will find ALL the most noted researches in this field cited liberally. Highly recommend this as one of your go-to books on the science behind the beer."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"It's got good information, but shouldn't be the first book you pick up to understand a little of the science of brewing."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"The book was in great condition. The product was shipped and received earlier that I anticipated. Overall it was a great experience. The book was chocked full of info for the average beer geek that is trying to take their homebrewing to the next level."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"I do not know who this book was written for but it was not the homebrewer. It reads like it was written for the head chemist at Budweiser or a graduate school chemistry course. If you didn't major in chemistry or have been out of school a few years, it reads like a textbook. There is some interesting information in the book but you have to dig it out. Unless you really want to get very technical about the chemical changes during the brewing process, this book has little use for the average brewer."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"While jam-packed with technical brewing-related information on the molecular level, the book is virtually useless to the amateur brewer seeking to improve his or her beer. I did not expect instant enlightenment, but I did hope to glean some knowledge of water chemistry, hop utilization, etc. Unfortunately, I am brewing beer, not conducting experiments in a well-equipped laboratory. The prose is somewhat dry and reads like a post-graduate-level lecture. Definitely a chemistry text, and not a brewing text."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"This is a fairly technical discussion of the subject of brewing chemistry. It's probably more than your typical home-brewer will want to get into, but if you've got some biochem background, or have read Dr. Lee Janson's Brew Chem 101 book and are looking to read on from there, (or you're a very masochistic home-brewer :-)) this would be the next step to take. It does require a greater knowledge of biochemistry and some math (not too surprising, since Dr. Fix had a Ph.D. in math from Harvard). I note the problems with the citations another reviewer here mentioned, who said Dr. Fix refers to his own work and his other book too often, but I didn't mind that too much. Dr. Fix was certainly a competent professional in both math and brewing chemistry, and he did much important work on his own. The important thing is that this book helps to bridge the gap between the professional manuals of industrial microbiology and brewing chemistry and the professional literature. After completing this book, if you want more information, you'll have to go there, such as:1. Beer and Wine Production: Analysis, Characterization, and Technological Advances (ACS Symposium, No. 536)2. Biotechnology of Malting and Brewing by James S. Hough3. Malting and Brewing Science: Hopped Wort and Beer (Volume 2) by D. E. Briggs, et al4. Brewing Microbiology by Iain Campbell5. Methods of Analysis of the American Society of Brewing Chemists, by the American Society Of Brewing Chemists6. Malting and Brewing Science : Volume 1 (#Y0343)by Dennis Edward Briggs, James S. Hough7. Brewing Yeast and Fermentation by Chris Boulton, David QuainExcept for the Brewing Microbiology book by Campbell, all of the above are big, expensive professional volumes, but they represent some of the best technical titles out there.The book also has a nice introduction summarizing some of the important developments of the last 20 years that have made great improvements in beer, such as the use of modern double pre-evacuation bottle filters to cut down on cold-side oxygenation, the awareness of the staling effects of unsaturated long-chain aldehydes, the realization that hot-side aeration could contribute to this, and the importance of malting and non-enzymatic browning also in this process. These were all important developments that led to the modern low-oxygen brewhouse.So overall, a very fine discussion of all these issues, and I'd actually give the book 4.5 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"Principles of Brewing Science deals with the biology and chemistry of beer. With my background in biochemistry, I was able to enjoy a detailed analysis on the subject. My only negative criticism is George Fix's excessive and sometimes exhaustive references to his own literature. Fix referred to himself about 40 times in this 173 page book. That is almost 1 reference per 4 pages, not to mention the fact that roughly one third of the book is charts and diagrams. What is most disturbing is that his other book, An Analysis of Brewing Techniques, makes numerous references to this book. The reader ends up getting caught in a futile cycle of references between these two books where some of the referred items are redundant. This round-about circle of references boarders on academic dishonesty. Another eyebrow raising issue is a reference Fix attributes to Rabin and Forget, 1998 on page 152. The reference section, however, has no list of Rabin or Forget. In all fairness, this book is the best compilation of the science behind the beer process and is quite informative. But I think it would be better suited as an appendix for his other book."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"George has cleaned up this edition and offers many more citations and support than in the first edition.

I appreciate the scientific format of citing references to support claims, as you can easily go verify the statements for yourself. While this book does not read like a novel, I think the technical style is well written, clear and concise. You won't find elegant language or long prose; it isn't that kind of brewing or homebrewing book. I would recommend this book to anyone who ever asks the questions \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" when it comes to brewing. If you are simply looking for a how-to book then this may not be for you. If you want to know the answer to why hop oils isomerize or degrade the way they do, or why brewing water affects brewing or why different enzymes behave the way they do at given temperatures and pH, or how kegging pressure affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid (or many other questions like these), then this is your book.Overall, I think this book is an excellent distillation of more advanced (and lengthy) technical brewing books, and I will be recommending this to many of my friends involved in the AHA and BJCP."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"Great book, well written and researched. The book gives a much more thorough treatment of the chemistry of the process than many other texts on the subject. The book would likely not be of significant utility (they should readHow to Brew: Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right The First Timewhich is a very good practical guide), but for those who seek an deeper understanding of the molecular basis of said noble beverage it is well worth the effort.As a bit of a chemistry nerd, I really enjoyed this book. For those who don't have a chemistry background it may be a little bit overwhelming at times but probably no less interesting.I would like to take issue with the publisher however, as there are several errors in the printed text. Most of these errors are typographical by nature and as innocuous as any such error can be in a published work but for a work which markets itself as a serious study of brewing science it really is important to be reliable. When such errors relate to scientific information they can affect the delivery of information and markedly detract from the reader's overall impression of professionalism and validity.Despite this, I strongly recommend this work as a most thorough and entertaining explanation of brewing science."},{"Title":"Principles of Brewing Science: A Study of Serious Brewing Issues","review":"If you want an informative read on brewing science.. this is it.

Peter leaves Manhattan via the Long Island Cannon Ball Express for the posh North Dunes of Easthampton on a job he looks forward to performing as a summer escape from the heat of the city.He enjoys sunning and playing in the surf especially with Harper's Bazaar fashion reporter Liz Bessemer. However, his fun in the sun ends when his client's niece Mildred Brexton dies while swimming near a crowded beach in what everyone assumes is a horrific accident. When the police find an overdose of sleeping pills in Mildred's stomach, they believe she committed suicide but do not rule out homicide. While the cops investigate, Peter watches the reactions of family members of the victim to include his client, the victim's cramp spouse, and her two siblings. He knows the predator is debonair, intelligent and sophisticated.This is a terrific amateur sleuth supported by an amusing clash of the classes; mindful of the movie Laura. Fast-paced with a wicked and timely lampooning of the New York upper crust, Death Likes It Hot is a fabulous tale from the moment Sargeant and Veering meet and never slows down while he observes the rich and famous go about their lives as if a death is tea time.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death likes it hot (Atlantic large print)","review":"The book was recommended to me by the artist of the book's cover, Evan Gaffney.

There is a deep psychological teaching that mixes itself with high spiritual principles, esoteric Christian Gnosticism in its raw form, and countless viels that keep such things hidden from the eyes of the average literary scholar... Why would Burton write in such a way? The same reason Dante did...But what is it that Burton is trying to show us, with his quotes from the Alchemical Master Galen and Latin stanzas?Why must we understand the \\"Anatomy of Meloncholy\\"? The anatomy of our own suffering and the suffering of the world...The Master M refers to Burton in his books of Occult Mysticism.For us, as common \\"modern westerners\\", to understand such esoteric psychology-and not have to learn Latin, Tibetan, Sanskrit or Chinese, we must study the books of SAMAEL AUN WEOR. He writes in such a way as to unveil those truly hidden mysteries: \\"Know thyself and thy shall Know the universe and all its Gods\\".Find the book of \\"Revolutionary Psychology\\" or \\"The Perfect Matrimony\\" by the said author. These books are amazing supplements to books like Burton's. These books give the western student a strong foundation in the psychological aspect of Occultism. SAMAEL AUN WEOR's books can be a bit difficult (to find), as they are continuously being translated from the original language (Spanish). Yet they can be bought from any Gnostic Institute (www.gnosticinstitute.org)."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"This book is almost unreadable. First, physically. It is a paperback, but very thick and heavy, and does not allow easy reading except on a table; almost impossible to read in bed.Second, subject matter. These are the ravings of a totally unbalanced mind. Yes it is arcane and interesting to see how someone (admittedly brilliant) thought so long ago. And he had an opinion about everything! Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry. If you like that sort of thing, or some peekings into a pretty nasty anti-feminist, anti-modernity, deluded melancholy mind, be my guest.My advice: save your money."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"First of all, one has a very difficult problem in defining exactly what this compendium is. Is it a book, a poem, a history, an epic? Well, I think it is all of those and many more. The Anatomy of Melancholy is, without a doubt, the best book ever written, bar none.It was compliled from all the books of the 17th century and is not really about melancholy, per se. It is, rather, Robert Burton's view of mankind and mankind's condition. All mankind. And all conditions. It is about melancholia, sure, but it is about everything else as well. Melancholia was just Burton's excuse to write about everything under the sun in a strikingly original way and then have the nerve to remind us that there is nothing new under the sun. This is a book filled with both endless quotes and endless quotable material and, to the surprise of many, it is a comic masterpiece. Perhaps &quot;the&quot; comic masterpiece. Burton chose to publish this book as having been written by &quot;Democritus Junior,&quot; and if that doesn't give you a hint regarding the humor that follows, then not much will.If you like good literature, you'll love this book. If you like psychology, you'll love this book. If you want to seem pretentious, you need this book. Mostly, however, this is a book for people who love words. Burton may have seemed like a raving madman to some, but he was a man obsessed with a love for the English language...and it shows.The Anatomy of Melancholy wasn't meant to be read from the first page to the last; I have never met anyone who did that and one would have to be more than a little mad to even try. Just pick up the book. Open it to any page. You may find lists, digressions, bits of 17th century prose, quotes, much Latin. Whatever you find, it is sure to please if you only give it half a chance.The Anatomy of Melancholy is definitely &quot;the&quot; desert island book. The only problem with taking this wonderful book to a desert island with you (or anywhere else, for that matter), is its size. If you have the one-volume edition, as I do, it can be terribly unwieldy. I once tried reading it on a trans-Atlantic flight and had difficulty keeping my grasp...physically. I highly recommend the three-volume set, if you can find it. If not, make do with the one-volume. Just don't go without. That would be a terrible mistake.Be warned: this dense and brilliant book is extremely addicting. Once you start leafing through the pages and writing down your favorite passages, you'll find you never want to be without the book. And, as you'll come to see, that won't be such a bad thing at all."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Of all the editions of THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY that have ever been published, this may be the best for the general reader. The NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CLASSIC edition wisely reprints the great 1932 Everyman's Library edition, with its wonderful introduction by the noted bookman Holbrook Jackson. (Readers are advised to skim or skip the rather pretentious new introduction by William H. Gass.)Unlike the &quot;all-English&quot; edition referenced..., the Everyman/NYRBClassic edition gives the Latin tags as Burton scattered them through his work and translates each and every one, either in brackets immediately afterward, or (sometimes) in an endnote to each of the three volumes (now bound as one). I've tried to read the &quot;all-English&quot; edition, and it's disappointing, because it turns out that Burton wanted readers to read the Latin tags whether they could understand them or not. He included their syllables in the rhythm of his prose, so as you read this edition, you can almost hear him quote, then translate, then continue onward.No booklover should skip this one, and this is the edition to have."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this book, nor by what others may have told you about it. In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"The Anatomy of Melancholy may be a worthwhile read.

NYRB has reprinted the three volume Everyman's Library edition in a rather thick paperback. This is not the first time the three volume Everyman's Library edition has been reprinted in one volume. Everyman's Library had a one volume edition in the 1960's and Vintage had an edition in the 1970's, but these have been out of print for many years. Except for some minor changes such as a new introduction by William H. Gass, and the removal of the out-of-date select bibliography the NYRB edition is identical to the earlier reprints.There are disadvantages to this reprint. Perhaps the biggest is that this reprint does not take advantage or even acknowledge the 70 or so years of scholarship that has come and gone since it was published in 1932. In the 1990's Oxford University Press issued a multi-volume scholarly edition of the Anatomy but the price is prohibative for most readers. You should know that NYRB edition is still good as a reader's copy, but it is not a scholarly edition.Another problem is the editorial decision that Holbrook Jackson made to clear away Burton's anotations that were originally printed on the page, and moved them to the end of each partition. Instead of looking on the page for Burton's citations the reader is flipping back and forth to track them down. Burton sometimes has a great deal of fun in his marginal glosses, and you will miss them if you are not careful.A third problem is the index. If you wanted to find Burton's references to English writers such as More, Shakespeare, or Spenser you would be out of luck if you used the index in the NYRB edition, but you wouldn't be if you were reading Shilletto's 1893 edition. In that edition authors Burton quotes are listed and you have no trouble tracking most of them in Burton's Anatomy.These days I am more likely to read one of the 17th century editions of Burton's Anatomy or Shilletto's edition, but it is good to have Burton available again in a popular edition, even though this one is not ideal."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Usually available only in expensive private editions and nineteenth century complilations, the New York Review Books paperback edition of Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is handy and relatively cheap. It reprints the sixth and final edition that Burton issued, each edition expanding with afterthoughts by the author. The original in 1621 was one-half the size of the last edition.Burton was an Oxford scholar who had spent much of his life in Christ Church College of that institution accumulating quotes, ideas, and general collectible wisdom from the classics. His self-styled anatomy of the causes of melancholy is both ponderous and witty--quite in tune with Burton's styling himself as \\"Democritus Junior.\\" Democritus, you will recall, was a Greek philosopher of the 5th century BC who developed the idea of atoms forming the basis of the universe. He was also sometimes called the \\"laughing philosopher\\" because of his wit.Burton himself has a good time with this kind of humor, and his book is not at all a gloomy analysis of melancholy. What it is is a compendium of every kind of thought on the subject, and is replete with Latin quotations and Greek philosophy. It is a museum of myth, ignorance, and insight. Written in a uniquely antiquarian style, it is a treat for the modern reader. Like Sir Thomas Browne's gothic prose, Burton's is unique as well as intriguing. His book is meant to be dipped into, not to be read straight through. The wonderful thing is that it's not just a classic but a readable classic.

He invokes astrology and theology in forming his psychology.But in fact, Burton uses this arcane subject to go off on a profound and lengthy meditation on the melancholies and misfortunes of life itself. The author, it seems, was easily distracted, and his distractions are our gain. The passages on the Melancholy of Scholars, and the Melancholy of Lovers, are themselves worthy of the price of admission.His prose is unlike anything before him or since him.

And the section on Cure of Love-Melancholy is invaluable. It is amusing to see Burton (somewhat reluctantly) admit that \`The last and best Cure of Love-Melancholy is, to let them have their desire'."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"This was my 2nd attempt to purchase this unabridged edition, my daughter needed this for University as well as wanted this personally, she was very pleased upon finally being able to locate the correct version."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"OK. This for all of you autodidacts who love poring over your unabridged editions of the OED in search of abstruse verbal arcana and the history of obsolete verbiage (Ahem, I include myself in your number, of course.). This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one. The other aspect is rather more nebulous: What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned? The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot; But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were. &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot; And who knows exactly why it was penned? So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated. Burton demands enough of one's patience; one shouldn't have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor, even if one's Latin is good. After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated. Finally, I'll say that although Burton is amusing, the book is too long with too little content. Go back to his sources, read Swift, read Marcus Aurelius, read Kierkegaard on religious despair; and then, if you have time, read Burton-- or skim him."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Like Montaigne's earthy Essays, but more witty and ironic like Erasmus, sharp and scathing like Senecca, funny and entertaining like Rabelais etc.The preface suggest that Burton (aka Elephantus Jr.) spent a long time in the Vatican library sourcing obscure and horded texts. Reading this book is like a classical education on smartassedness."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"This was first published in 1927.

My only complaint is that the volume is too thick and heavy for comfortable, convenient reading. I am tempted to cut it down the spine into two volumes (which is what the publisher should have done). Go for it -- you'll really enjoy Burton's endless diatribes, which are infinitely inventive. A true feast."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Those who read Robert Burton's ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY for the first time most often do so as part of a course in 17th century English literature. And even then they wade gently through a few pages rather than simply plunging in and learning, perhaps for the first time, that words are more intoxicating than any drug could be. There is no melancholy in the book, at least not to the extent that one might think because of the title. Instead the intrepid reader finds that Burton has attempted what we now know to be the impossible: to master the sum total of human knowledge in one book. Astoundingly, Burton did not know that it was impossible, so he went ahead and tried anyway. He came damn near close to succeeding.Robert Burton was typical of many contemporaries, many of whom tried to be a master of all trades, but it was only he that came close. Burton's love of learning and his dry and droll wit excuse his failure to such an extent that we do not even care that he failed. Rather, we focus on his successful attempt to draw us into the magical world of knowledge for its own sake. His critics have been merciless in their snippets that TAOM is no more than a collection of informal and disorganized essays on man's dissatisfaction with the universe. They complain loudly of his wild abandon of Latinate phrases that pepper every paragraph or his frequent mention of obscure authorities that exist nowhere else save this book. Yet, I suggest that wild abandon has its charm too. If one considers his book as a very nearly unlimited number of paragraphs, each of which exists in its own self-contained universe, then that paragraph sheds light on the human condition itself. Human beings have eternally sought knowledge of the macro universe and its mirror, the microverse. It is only in such seemingly unwieldy tomes as TAOM that humanity may find answers. The beauty of Burton is that the effort to find Eternal Truth is worth the effort. One need not be a grad student of literature to know that."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"There have been recently some reviews complaining of shoddy paperback editions of this book, published cheaply and with many dubious errors, lacking translation of the Latin, etc. (These problems are due largely to the publishers' use of outdated or uncorrected texts.) Only buy this paperback version:The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics); it's by far the best available and of durable construction (for a gigantic paperback, anyways). It also has two introductions, wonderful in their own right, especially Gass's. It also contains the translations for the Latin phrases which so often appear. Don't buy any other copy."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"There are many reviews of Burton's \\"Anatomy\\" ranging from the 'best book ever written' downwards. I have been involved with many editions of this work over the years, and have a couple of things to add to what's been so eloquently said. First, it's a reference book and not a novel, and therefore shouldn't be read in a continuous way. It becomes tedious and incomprehensible. Like grandma used to say: \\"Take small bites so you don't choke!\\" There are parts of it that are dated but much that is totally applicable today. Second, it is a book about society, and the hypocrisy of the way different people get treated:\\"A sheep-stealer is hanged for stealing necessary victuals but a great man in office may safely rob, pillage, and destroy, and be honored for good service, and no man had best find fault with him.\\" This prefigures much of Enlightenment thinking and can be seen to relate to Culturalist Analytic thinking, like the works of Karen Horney. Third, it is a historical contemporary look at the Jacobean age, and even the Elizabethan world. If you're interested in the cultural climate of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, here is an overview of what was known and opined by a scholar. One wonders how melancholic he really was (in the modern sense) since the preparation and writing of such a compendium certainly requires motivation and energy, not generally associated with chronic depression. I would suggest the Preface and the Digression of Air as fascinating views of knowledge in the early 17th century. Even if you don't like it (which I didn't for about 5 years), it tends to grow on you as long as you go slow!"},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"The book deserves 5 stars, but not this electronic edition.

It kept me up later than I wished, and still \\"reading\\" it in my mind over and over again, musing on the insanity of it - the brilliant, always entertaining, enlightening, LIGHTING bolts of language and thought crammed so mercilessly between two covers. It won't drive you mad, though, or mess with your humours, unless, of course, a sense of one you don't have - a bricolage (I think) to be devoured ravenously and chewed interminably like an everlasting gobstopper - a joy to exhaust your mind and body by . . ."},{"Title":"The anatomy of melancholy,","review":"Amazon sells the public domain Nabu Press edition as though it is the entire work.

It reports on a trip to the American Northwest in the mid-1840s. It is Parkman's first book, written in his mid-twenties. I first read it in my mid-twenties when I was living abroad, and it made me homesick for places in the States I'd not yet been to. Now I'm seventy-one, and it remains just as good. It describes the Indians as a native and potent force, without condescension or romanticism. I suspect much of the Western (cowboy and Indian) movie tradition depends on this one book, with a lot of added malarky. To put it simply: the book is a masterpiece, and a great read."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life","review":"This was a very good read and very educational as to the experience of people that were there.

The level of warfare for instance. I wonder if this was heightend at that time related to population pressures from the east ( other tribes and whites ) Anyway, the writer tells an amazing tale of risk and daring while describing the lives of the natives- and we find out some things about the attitudes of the newcomers also.

You can't beat a first person report of traveling through Indian territory! The descriptions of the perils of the journey plus first hand experiences in dealing with the native population make you feel as if you are there, sitting in the teepee, watching as an Indian woman kills and cooks a puppy because you are an honored guest. Great descriptive writing; blood, guts, wildflowers, horses, sunsets, and the beautiful, healthy forms of our Native Americans while they were still free."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life","review":"Since getting a Kindle for Christmas, I can't stop reading this sort of thing! Extremely well-written account of life on the plains and mountains among the Dakotas (named \\"Sioux\\" by the French, we learn), mountain men, and an amazing assortment of characters, all described in intricate detail. I've rarely read a book, from any era, which conjures images as vivid as this one does. This account is a \\"can't put it down\\" narrative. Learned a lot of interesting annecdotes. For example, Parkman describes a scene of mourning in which the Indians, in their lamentations, sound like they are saying \\"hallelujah,\\" which apparently, along with other \\"coincidences,\\" lead the founders of the Mormon theology to conceive the \\"absurd notion\\" that the Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. This is a fascinating, contemporaneous comment on the then-early Mormon church. Having read other accounts of life on the frontier and of the trappers/mountain men, I was also interested to read of the same locations, incidents and battles, told from different perspectives, but clearly referencing the same events, locations and people. True, verified history, unvarnished as it would be by later historians.If you like this genre, be sure to read William F. Drannan's \\"31 Years on the Plains and in the Mountains.\\" Another barn burner of a narrative filled with harrowing and touching scenes from one end of the country to the other, described by a scout raised as a step-son by Kit Carson."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life","review":"if you do not bring modern prejudgement to the read and take it for what it is: An 1840s first person account of a horse back trip to the Rockys and back with a month or so spent living with the then untamed Ogallals, you should enjoy this read as much as i did. You get the sense that the author is not some distant, stuck up historical figure but rather that he is alive and speaking and joking directly with the reader across a 160 some year chasm. A little reading on the Francis Parkman will enhance the experience."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life","review":"In April 1846 Francis Parkman, a 23 year old Harvard Law graduate from Boston, left Fort Leavenworth (now Kansas) with his \\"friend and relative\\" Quincy Adams Shaw on \\"a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains\\".They had a small \\"French cart\\" known as a \\"mule killer\\", a team of mules, a tent, and a \\"miscellaneous assortment of boxes and barrels\\", some horses and guides and companions familiar with the territory they would be travelling through.Although he was the scion of a family of wealth and standing, and although he had entered Harvard at 16 and graduated with honors and had already taken the Grand Tour of Europe, he was no tenderfoot. He had always lived from time to time on the 3,000 acres of wilderness his maternal grandfather owned near Medford Massachusetts; and he was at home around the campfire in the woods.This experience would become invaluable. In the next five months Parkman and Shaw and their companions would sit around a hundred campfires as they traveled several thousand miles over the great High Plains using the rivers as their highway. They went up the Platte and crossed what is now Nebraska to North Platte where the river divides into to two extensive river systems - the North Platte which drains most of southeastern Wyoming - and the South Platte which drains the area of Wyoming around Cheyenne and virtually all of northeastern Colorado - Fort Collins, Denver, and Colorado Springs almost south to present day La Junta .Having gone up the North Platte as far as Ft. Laramie Parkman left the party and lived with the Ogallala Sioux for more than six weeks, traveling with them to the Black Hills of South Dakota and thence back to Ft. Laramie from whence the party went down the South Platte as far as La Junta where they met the Arkansas River flowing east and north and up which they traveled back to Ft. Leavenworth and then down the Missouri and the Mississippi to St. Louis; and then it was overland back to Boston where they arrived on or about the first of October 1946. It turned out to be much more than a trip of \\"curiosity and amusement\\". They were lucky to get back alive and unharmed. (There were hostile Indians. There were surly and dangerous travelers. They were thrown from their horses more than once. Parkman was so sick part of time he could hardly sit his horse.)Much more than \\"amusement\\" would meet the on the trip. They would meet the first immigrants to Oregon along the real Oregon Trail. (Not impressive, he writes.) They would meet the wagons of the Mormons westering from Nauvoo. (They were okay.) The would meet Mountain Men, trappers, mule skinners, soldiers (a \\"motley lot\\") on their way with General Kearny to the War with Mexico which had just been declared. The would meet factors, frontier storekeepers in Ft. Laramie and Bent's Fort east of La Junta on the Arkansas. And above Parkman would meet and live with the Indians - the Ogallala Sioux. He would live with them for more than six weeks, traveling, camping and hunting the buffalo; and his written descriptions would preserve for posterity their life, customs and appearance before they were affected by the white man's ways and alcohol and eventually penned up on their many Reservations This is not to say that they appeared to him as \\"noble savages\\". Not at all. He had little use for them and would write\\"For the most part a civilized white man can discover very few points of sympathy between his own nature and that of an Indian. With every disposition to do justice in their good qualities, he must be conscious that an impassable gulf goes between him and his red brethren Nay, so alien to himself do they appear that, after breathing the air of the prairie for a few months or weeks, he begins to look upon them as a troublesome and dangerous species of wild beast.\\"When he got back to Boston in early October 1846 he turned to his extensive journals and, with his memory refreshed, wrote up his experiences. The results were published the next year (1847) under the name \\"The Oregon Trail\\" and these experiences are now available to us with the same sense of \\"being there\\" and the same freshness that must have existed when he first put pen to paper 165 years ago. The book is a masterful verbal documentary on the Great Plains, their weather - for example the smell and quiet just before the sky blackens and the wind picks up and the thunderstorm breaks with indescribable violence, It's about the Indians and the way they lived, about the flowers in springtime on the Great Prairie, about the oppressive heat of summer, the flies and the mosquitoes, about the antelope and the prairie dog villages, the rivers, the hills and far away buttes, the long horizons, the big sky and the sense of great space. Had Ken Burns, the great documentary filmmaker, lived at that time we would see in his filmed documentary exactly the same things that Parkman saw and described so accurately in his book. Then there is Parkman's description of the buffalo hunt: Remember the great scenes of the buffalo hunt in Dances With Wolves? (It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1990.) They are right out of Parkman's Chapter on The Buffalo Hunt. Same for the movie's scenes of the Sioux Camp where Lt Dunbar first meets the Sioux You don't have to read the book to see the world of 165 years ago. You can go to the movie. But the book covers more ground and is the more preferable.If I were to find any fault or faults with the book it would first be the fact that there is certain \\"sameness\\" in its many chapters. The next one is often much like the one you just read. So you can skip some. But, then it all comes with the territory. That's what the Great Prairie is - a lot of \\"sameness\\" for a thousand miles. Next I would fault the title. It's not about The Oregon Trail. The trail is at best a minor part of the book. The book is truly the account of a journey. It's really about how things were on the Great Plains in 1846.Parkman went on to become one of the most prominent American historians of the 19th century, writing particularly about the French in America. However, in this book and without any authorial or scrivener's pretense Parkman has written a beautiful readable even lyrical - but accurate - account of how things were there and then. You don't have to read it in a hurry. Take your time. Go to your computer and dial up a map and follow where they are - or were - with their cart and mules. Think about it. Look up some pictures. This is not a book for speed or controversy. It is not a book about problems or politics. It is a beautifully written book about our America, about our history, our people, our experience and about travel and our country and it sets the standard by which all other similar books should be compared. It is an American Elegy"},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-mountain life","review":"I chose this book to read on my Kindle because it was free.

His adventures were quite amazing, but the best thing about the book is that all his adventures are true. After reading this book do a google look up on Parkman and you will find what is written in history is exactly the way he portrays himself in his journal.

I loved marching along with these folks as the maps and renditions take the reader mile after mile on their weary way.Although they did leave out a bit about coming down the snake river and into Baker valley, skipping over that to reach the next valley which is La Grande and the Grand Ronde valley. There is a beautiful historical center at Baker which is all about the history of the Oregon Trail.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the migration.

My mom read it to me 40 years ago, now I'm reading it to my girls who love it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The ABC Bunny","review":"All parents know that there are certain books that are hard to read to children with enthusiasm. Most children's books are terrible and hard to read--especially re-read. This is not one of those books. This is a favorite of mine too. I love to read this one with my kids, and they love it too.The book is creative, fun, exciting, and has a conclusion that, done properly, will want your kids to read it again and again.There are few children's books that adults can enjoy while reading to their kids, and this is one of them. Buy it and enjoy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The ABC Bunny","review":"This Newbery Honor book is a beautifully rendered alphabet set to an original song (musical score included). It tells a minimal story conforming with the letters of an original alphabet song, illustrated in pleasing and original black-and-white drawings. Singing books are great for holding very young children's attention, and this one also includes some unusual word choices and enjoyable animal pictures that will keep the attention of kids from 3-6. It is an excellent choice when seeking to appeal to both ages, or as a supplement for alphabet memorization. The song is lilting and repetitive, and a bit difficult to pick up at first, but with practice (or a better musical ear than mine) it quickly becomes easier to sing."},{"Title":"The ABC Bunny","review":"I bought this book at the suggestion of a Homeschool Curriculum and my son and I love it.

Damon, the Marquess of Savage's wastrel father needed the money that Lady Julia Wentworth would bring to a marriage with his eldest son. Julia's father wanted his daughter to wed a title - a future Duke. And so two children marched dutifully down the aisle. They have not seen each other since their long ago wedding because neither of them wanted to be wed....or at least wed by force. Julia left home for a successful stage career as Jessica Wentworth, determined to make her way alone in the world. Damon has been seeking her for 2 years to determine whether or not she wants to dissolve the marriage. The detective he hired was not able to come up with any information after she left her home and family.They meet as actress and noble. Sparks fly. She knows who he is. He remains in the dark and pursues her with mucho ardor. She is beautiful, intelligent, talented and he is a hunk. You can guess most of the rest...except Julia/Jessica won't give up her independence and career. Romance, love and feminism in Regency England = a terrific read.Lisa Kleypas has remained one of my favorite authors after reading almost all of her books. She herself is quite talented, knows how to tell a story with the best of them and writes with flair and intelligence. This is not one of her 5 star novels, but it is still a terrific read!JANA"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I wish I hadn't read all the negative feedback on this novel. It is one of the last Kleypas novels I had left to read due to all the bad publicity. Boy are they wrong! This is a delightful novel, very entertaining, fast moving, likeable characters. A truly good read and romance. Pick up a copy -- you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"In \\"Somewhere I'll Find You\\" Kleypas cuts down on thrills and focuses on carefully setting up the advance-and-retreat of the romance between Julia and Damon.In fact, she does such a good job of it that she doesn't have to fall back on the premise from which the novel begins: that Julia and Damon are already married. Rather than using that hook to lasso them together, by the time Julia and Damon recognize one another as husband and wife their relationship continues to develop with a momentum of its own.Julia is wonderful and vivacious. Damon was not a very well-defined hero, in my opinion; a little wooden. I never felt like I knew him well or understood him thoroughly. This is problematic because Kleypas devotes quite a bit of space in this novel to setting up the sequel, and the character of its hero Logan Scott is compelling and believable in a way that Damon isn't.Still, this is a better-than-average Kleypas, and Kleypas is always a cut above the rest in romance. It's worth a read."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"One would think that there are at least a thousand dukes in the UK. In every other romance novel there is a duke. And they do all kinds of things. They marry their mistresses, or an actress - who actually continues to act even after they are married. I know this is fiction, but still, wouldn't an earl be enough??Despite this, I liked it that the heroine was an actress. It was refreshing to see the world from that point of view. And I liked how determined Damon was. Julia was too stubborn for my taste. Unwilling to compromise. Well, in a way I think she wanted a lover - someone who wouldn't limit her. But of course, having a lover is not something our heroine with high moral standards would do. Give me a break. And then she *spoiler warning!!* suddenly decides that she will marry Logan. Why? Why couldn't she just go on as she was - not married at all? And she decided to do it at once, in a minute, without thinking about it. Stupid. She just didn't know what she wanted. And she kept asking everyone she knew what to do. As if anyone could tell her. And the way she reconciled with her father was ridiculous.Well, all in all this was not such a bad book, but there are many details that grated on my nerves... If you can borrow this book from a library, read it, if you can't, don't buy it!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This was definetly not one of lisa kleypas' best books. Maybe it was that the lead characters were so boring and one-dimensional. We know that Julia Wentworth is a great actress but the book just dosen't tell you alot about her outside of her career. There also really never seemed to be any real feelings between the main characters. They seemed to be sexually attracted to each other at most. Damon Savage was also unreasonable and obsessive. I think it says alot about the story that the secondary character of logan scott(who came off as cold and a jerk)was the one you really wanted julia to end up with. The author should know that you're never supposed to make the secondary male character outshine the hero."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Totally engrossing. A 'one sititng' read. Normally, I'm a historical romance reader, however, this one by Lisa Kleypas had me captivated. Though totally not original, the writer keeps the readers engrossed with the pain, anguish and resentment the characters feel for their situation. However, both are strong willed, independent, and determined to battle to the end to have their way, in other words, a typical romance novel written well enough to be 'oh so entertaining'. If you're a thespian, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll find you', if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll Find You', and if you're a historical buff like myself, read and enjoy it for the change and variety!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This was one of the few books I have owned by LK that I had not read yet. I kept reading the 3 to 3 and 1/2 star reviews and thought if it wasn't as good as her others then I'll put off reading it and read some others I have. Well once again I thoroughly enjoyed yet another of this wonderful author's books. Maybe this book wasn't \\"quite\\" as polished as some of her later books but I enjoyed it, was enthralled with it, loved it every bit as much and just barely noticed a difference. By now everyone knows the story so I won't even go into that here.I felt the story was fleshed out very well, I cared about the characters very much as they were well developed, and the love scenes were touching and marvelous as ever. Devil in Winter is still my favorite book by Lisa Kleypas so far, but, this one was quite enjoyable and touching for me. I have yet to be disappointed in any book by this fine author and I certainly was not in this one. Yes it's another Kleypas Keeper for me! Bravo Lisa K. once again."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"One of Lisa Kleypas's best books.The characters of the book seemed very alive to me and I was happy to encounter a heroine that stood to her own dreams and yet knew when to relent. Damon seemed like a heartless person at the beginning, but as I read on, I started to find some very good qualities in him.The back cover blurb reads: &quot;All of London is at Julia Wentworth's feet. The beautiful, enchanting actress is the toast of the theater world--and anything she desires is hers for the asking. But the incomparable leading lady guards a devastating secret: a mystery husband whom she does not know, dares not mention...and cannot love. For years Damon Savage has been searching for the stranger his unscrupulous parents wed him to without his consent. Wanting no more than to be legally rid of the foolish chit, Damon is shocked to discover his &quot;bride&quot; is the exquisite stage perfomer whom he intended to make his mistress! But though his wife by law, Julia will never truly be Damon's--until he conquers her fears, his formidable rivals...and the stellar lady's proud, independent heart.&quot;BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE is the continuation of one of the characters of this book. Although it gives a glance of what has happened to Julia and Damon, it's not as good as one would've wished.S."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This was the first Kleypas book I read and I could not put it down. I thought the 2 characters were spectacular and the chemistry was explosive. I was hoping to like the sequel &quot;Because You Are Mine&quot; just as much, but I was sadly disappointed. The leading characters were an arrogant creep and an immature stupid brat. Who could root for such a couple?"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This is not one of M. Kleypas' best. Trite plotlines, simplistic writing and shallow characters come across as a first-time author. I had a lot of issues with this story. To name a few. She explains why the characters feel a certain way instead of conveying the emotions through the story. The female lead is ridiculous. The idea that British society at that time would blithely accept a \\"Duchess\\" - of the highest peerage! - entertaining the lower classes on the stage is too far-fetched. (The cultural responsibilities of a Duchess went far beyond simply being concerned over snide comments about her possible affairs.) The whole idea of them rebelling so strongly against an arranged marriage - no matter their ages - is a bit off mark as well. Arranged marriages were still the norm in the upper aristocracy. there are so many irritants in this book. I was dissapointed. Save your money and go for a different Kleypas - or get Stephanie Laurens' Devil's Bride."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This story had the potential to be really great. Instead it moved very quickly through the plot line, with no real depth or character traits. I usually LOVE Lisa Kleypas books, but I would not put this on my re-read list. On numerous occasions as I was reading, I found myself going back through the story to find out how the characters had found themselves at a certain point. It really lacked clarity."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I wouldn't say this is Kleypas' best, but it's still an above-average offering for historical romances. The book is really more of a 3.5 star read, and that's in comparison to other Kleypas books I've read. (Which probably isn't fair, but that's how I roll.)The premise for this story is interesting & caught my attention right away. Some of the ways the plot played out seemed a little silly to me, unfortunately, but it remained interesting.Damon & Julia were wed as children, at the tender ages of 7 & 4 respectively, and then they were kept separate with the intention of reuniting them when they were older. This parental betrayal (the marriage, not the separation..though the separation was also a problem) results in understandable emotional injuries to both characters as they mature.The resulting story is sweet, though at times Julia's resistance to Damon's proclamations of love is irksome. She often comes across as more focused on self-preservation than on mutual love & respect. However, this attitude makes sense coming from her and does prove appropriate for putting Damon in a position to offer respect with his love. Even though he couldn't understand Julia's love for acting, he had to be able to accept her as she was.I loved how much of the story took place within the theater. As a theater lover, getting to read about the scandalous position of actors & actresses back then was a bit of a treat. It's certainly not the norm for historical romances and offered a refreshing change of scenery.Some of the dialogue seemed a bit tedious to me, and Julia was a bit more wishy washy than I'm used to, but her fears were understandable. I actually enjoyed Damon far more than Julia, probably BECAUSE he had to prove himself to her. He was a pretty sexy, determined man. I appreciated that, unlike so many romances, the hero had to fight for the heroine to love him. (I get a little tired of heroines who have to be sweet & innocent to win over the hero. It's fun, but still, a change is refreshing.)So overall, this was a good read, though not Kleypas' best. The plot & setting were original, which I enjoyed. The hero was hot, which I also enjoyed. The heroine was bit meh, but overall, I still enjoyed her. The dialogue could've been better, but it was still above the norm.If you're a Kleypas fan, be aware that this isn't a Wallflower book, but it certainly deserves to stand in its own right. If you've never read Kleypas, try the Wallflower series first. You'll still enjoy this, but it doesn't showcase Kleypas' talents quite as well.The next book in the series,Because You're Mine, was better written, in my opinion. You can also find a final offering for the characters in short story form inA HISTORICAL CHRISTMAS PRESENT, with I Will, which tells the tale of Andrew, Lord Drake (who appears in Because You're Mine).Personally I would've liked a story about Damon's younger brother, William, but so far there isn't one. After his introduction in this book, I really expected one."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I've read a lot of Kleypas for over a year now and this is my favorite, even more than Suddenly You. I think it's because both books are about women with work lives, and clearly, that probably resonates with some of us more than your average story about someone in the 18-25 age range who's an heiress and lands a peer or a man of means.It's just a great escape!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I unfortunately read this one after Because You're Mine, the second in the series, but I enjoyed it all the same. I LOVE these books involving London's theatre scene in the nineteenth century. It seems the general consensus is Lisa Kleypas' later books are better - I won't argue either way - but for me, anything involving the theatre is going to capture my interest.This book has an original idea in that the heroine struggles with the fact she'll have to give up her career for marriage - not exactly standard historical romance fare! Julia Hargate and Damon Savage were forced into marriage as young children, and some years later Julia is disowned by her family when she runs away to London and becomes a famous actress - under a new name. Damon has been searching for his wife for years, with the intention of dissolving the marriage. When he is introduced to her as a potential patron for the theatre, they fall in love. It looks as though Julia will be forced to choose between her career and her marriage.Some reviewers have expressed dislike at Julia's indecision, but that is what makes the story so good. I'm glad this heroine had something in her life beyond balls and fancy outfits, and I suppose it was the break from tradition that upset some.I adore books set in a theatre environment, and Lisa Kleypas really paints a realistic picture of the theatre world and the passion that comes with it. This is one of the most fascinating facets of London, and I only wish there were more books to the series. The story also takes us to beautiful Bath, which was another aspect of the story I really enjoyed.The relationship is wonderful - not only is the \`big reveal' brought out early enough for the characters to deal with their issues, but both Damon and Julia face the fact they are in love with each other quite early on. It is straight-laced Damon's struggle with social conventions, and Julia's passion for life that causes the conflict between them.As with the other Capital Theatre book, I love that we get to meet such a cross-section of London society in this book. This is a city functioning on all levels, not just a group of pretty little virgins lining themselves up at a ball. It really brings the story to life.The Capital Theatre books have been really great reads for me. The combination of the theatre, the characters, the conflicts and the romance is wonderful. I'd definitely recommend them."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I didn't care for this book at all... the writing was poor, the characters were not well developed at all. It was SO predictable, you can see the scene coming a mile away. Again, the character development was very poor. Also, the writing was too modern for the time period...if you removed the references to oil lamps and horses and carriages, this could have been a contemporary romance. Just finished reading the Outlander Series, and this doesn't even come within the same League."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"For me, I love this kind of story of a Duke and his duchess-- I'm a pure fantasy kind of romantic who likes to be captivated by this kind of example of a story. It's must read for those who want to read about alpha males and their \\"other half.\\" They had been married when they were both young. Damon meets Julia and there is instant sparks between them, though he has no clue that Julia is his child bride that he has been searching for. To put it short, you'll definitely love this story. Alpha male + jealousy on his part= great story"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This is my second favorite Kleypas book, the first being Lady Sophias Lover. This is a wonderful story of learning to trust and compromise. Damon is determined to never let anyone control his life, as is Julia. Evolution of Trust between the two make a great story."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I enjoyed this book. The heroine was strong and knew her mind.

It was a wonderful read as usual! Highly satisfied!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This book... I adore, to the n'th degree, most of Kleypas' books. Out of the 15 I've read to date, I've only thought two were okay. And this book is one of those two.It isn't the theatre aspect that I didn't care for. That was a spin on HR that I haven't read before and it was interesting. Overall, the problem with this book was believability. We're supposed to believe in a marriage between 4 and 7 year olds? When they themselves repeatedly say it wouldn't hold up to any legal scrutiny? It was just absurd.Another absurd aspect is how quickly the characters fall in love. After one dinner together, the next time they see each other they fall into bed - and then Julia believes herself in love with Damon. Though not enough to stay \\"married\\" or even talk and reach a compromise on her continuing acting in the theatre. No, no, no. She loves him enough to void the sham marriage and then marry someone else so that Damon will forever leave her alone.And Damon believes he was in love with her from the very start. Before they even talked.I'm not a hard sell on love in HRs... But this was asking way too much.And other than the back and forth love me/leave me - nothing else really happens plot-wise. It took me three days to finish this book and, truly, I almost had to force myself to."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"4.5 stars.As always, loved LK's book. I could not stop reading it.Love Julia/Jessica. Love Damon Savage, I liked that he was suspicious about Pauline's sudden pregnancy reveal when he was going to break it off with her and was realizing how manipulative she could be. I also loved that he didn't keep her on the side after having dinner with Julia, Pauline was there but he had made his intentions clear, he would be there for the baby (if there was one) but they wouldn't be together. I loved the scenes when Julia was in the theatre and on stage acting.Throughout half the book I was disliking/hating Julia's father and mother, the father was a jerk and her mother hadn't given Julia the love she needed as a child, however I was able to forgive them a little as Julia did after a certain point in the story. I really liked Logan and I cannot wait to read his book.Now onto the things I didn't like, they were minor things but they did make me lower my rating a half star. I didn't like that Damon (for most of the book) wanted Julia to quit acting and give up something she loved, thankfully the two characters reached a compromise on that issue. I didn't like that Damon had Julia kidnapped, especially the way he did it, he had a few days/weeks earlier saved her twice in the same night after almost being raped by two \\"admirers\\" so having two other guys come up, grab her, tie her up and put a bag over her head wasn't a very endearing action. Other than those 2 things I loved the book and will be reading it again sometime."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsWell I must say that this is a first for me. There actually exists a Lisa Kleypas book that I am not crazy for. Somewhere I'll Find You just fell flat for me. It took me a few days to read it because I just piddled through it without much gusto. First time ever that has happened with one of her books.The idea of the story was captivating enough but the characters, Julia and Damon were an utter bore. The secondary cast did nothing to enhance the story either. Damon came across as a clingy desperate man that held little appeal to me and Julia with her naive decisions just made me roll my eyes.With a theater as the back drop for the storyline, I thought I would be immersed into the story as I really hadn't read much in the way of historical theater stories. It intrigued me. I liked the idea of an actress being the lead of a story in a historical setting and I liked the idea of a hidden marriage. However the two just didn't mix. It struck me as odd that these two were forced to be married as very young children by their parents but then never saw each other afterwards.First it was just basically creepy about the marriage to begin with but then how the story itself was all carried out afterwards just didn't sink or become believable. Years later when they finally found each other and confronted the situation, their behaviour towards each other contradicted everything they said to each other. Damon ultimately fell madly in love rather quickly and almost immediately thrust forward with the \\"I love yous\\" and \\"come away and be my real wife\\" and oh by the way, drop everything you have worked for to hold this coveted theater position to be my wife. All this without even giving Julia a chance to weigh her options.I guess for me it simply came down to characters and the silly plotline. Unfortunately Somewhere I'll Find You just didn't work for me like other books Lisa Kleypas has wrote. Fortunately there are dozens of Lisa Kleypas books I am utterly in love with.Teasers: Child marriage, fake pregnancy by lover, theater fire, secret visits with mother"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I just completed this audiobook & loved it! I've read several Kleypas books - \\"The Devil in Winter\\" & \\"Then Came You\\" are my favorites, but I was drawn into this story because I felt that Julia & Damon were so right for each other but they had to throw ego & pride aside to reach a compromise in their relationship. Julia had a power & position that is unusual in a historical romance. I loved the way they were willing to compromise in the end. I could so relate to this story because of my relationship with my strong-willed hubby!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This story is one that can be enjoyed on audio as well as in book form. Both and Julia and Damon are tied down by a marriage that they did not wish for, leaving them with strained familial relationships and deep fears about the ability to control their own future. Julia has her dream job and stars in plays at the best theater company in town, but as long as she is on stage she seems unfit to be a Duke's wife. Damon has rescued his family's estate from ruins and has lived his life carefully to avoid the mistakes made by his father. But he finds himself in a situation where he must choose between his mistress, who wants to be his wife, and his wife, who he wanted to be his mistress.I really enjoyed this audio. The plot is very unique and I really didn't know what to expect as the story progressed. Though the conflict wrapped up in a pretty little bow, it was very difficult getting there. The characters seemed so real, not quite perfect and a bit selfish at times. It took a while for them to learn from their mistakes but I enjoyed the journey. Ms. Landor was not my favorite narrator but she was good enough for me to enjoy the story. I would consider listening to another book narrated by her though. I'm quite curious about the other characters and would love to read more of this series. If you like a good historical romance or you want to read a premise that hasn't been overdone, give this one a try."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I'm writing this for my mom, since she read the book. She said it was a so-so story, but kept her interest long enough to finish the book. But she also said the book had the most grammatical and typographical errors she's ever seen in a book. The three rating is not a reflection of those issues, but of the story itself."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Both STRANGER IN MY ARMS and SUDDENLY YOU are better than SOMEWHERE I'LL FIND YOU. I am an actress, so I was very much looking forward to reading this one. But I just didn't find the chemistry between Julia and Damon all that exciting. And about halfway through, the book started to become entirely too long. Or was this because I was reading it in an airport? Who knows?I've read the sequel, BECAUSE YOU'RE MINE, which I thought was much better. I found Logan to be a much more interesting hero."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"\\"Somewhere I'll find you\\" is the story of Julia and Damon. The two of them were married when they were just children in order to bring the two families close and never met after that.As they grow up they both realise they don't want to keep this wedding. Julia leaves her home to become an actress and Damon searches for her in order to get an annulment. They meet without knowing each other's identity and find they are attracted. When Julia realises that Damon is her husband, she tries to get away from him but Damon runs after her. After finding out that she is actually his wife, he is begining to think that their marriage might not be so bad after all. Julia refuses to stay with him though, because she knows he will ask her to stop her career as an actress but Damon won't take \\"no\\" for an answer...I read \\"Somewhere I'll find you\\" after reading \\"Because you're mine\\". I loved \\"because you're mine\\" and consider it one of the best books of Kleypas after \\"Dreaming of you\\" and \\"Then came you\\".\\"Somewhere I'll find you\\" was a nice book and a definite page turner. But after I finished reading it I realised one thing: the two main characters (Julia and Damon) have never shared a true conversation in the whole book! They never really talk about anything: their likes and dislikes, their interests, why Julia loves the theater so much, why Damon is so rigid and autocratic. All these come as realisations and deductions to each other. In fact, the only powerful attraction between them seems to be sex rather than love.Besides being an entertaining book, since Kleypas has the talent to write moving scenes and keep your interest, it is the most empty (from feelings) book I've read from her. When did lust became a synonym for love? As soon as it was over I felt that I didn't knew any of the characters and really don't care much about what happened to them afterwards. Besides the whole idea of their marriage, on which the story relies on, seems to be a little unstable since they both seem to acknowledge at the end of the book that their marriage was not a valid one anyway!I would suggest saving your time and skip this book. If on the other hand you are a Kleypas fan as I am and have plenty of time in your hands, you certainly will spend a few pleasant hours reading it."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I usually like Lisa Kleypas; I love her Wallflowers Quartet. This book is the worst of her offerings I've read so far, however. The characters left me cold, and I had to force myself to continue reading -- it went on way too long, and I just skipped the last few pages.One thing that just bugged me were mistakes in the writing and proofing. The heroine, Julia, has a dual identity, Jessica, and at times, Kleypas had characters who only knew her as Jessica call her Julia. It's just sloppy.By far the biggest problem happens towards the end of the book. I'm normally willing to buy a romance novel hero's insane jealousy, but the \\"hero\\" of this novel, Damon, goes so far as to abduct Julia painfully. At that point, I seriously expected her to turn from him and toward her friend and boss, whom Kleypas hinted from beginning to end felt more for Julia than he was letting on. After being abducted, and dealing with Damon's new and scary demeanor, Julia, unbelievably, melts towards him. She's supposed to be an independent woman, and all of her qualms about leaving her life, independence and acting behind just disappear...and why -- because he practically abuses her? She finds that endearing enough to completely submit to him?Normally, I wouldn't get so worked up over a throwaway romance novel, but this one offended and disturbed me. Yech. I literally threw it away when I was done. Get back to humor-filled stories, Lisa Kleypas, please."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"First in the Capital Theatre historical romance series revolving around Scott Logan's theatre. The couple focus is on Damon, Lord Savage, and his never-met wife, Julia Hargate.My TakeWhat a load of crap! Kleypas uses the flimsiest pretext for her conflict between the never-met husband and wife. Please. There is no legal precedent outside of royalty for marrying a four-year-old off to a seven-year-old and having it be valid. Then there's the overly dramatic writing...talk about a drama queen.Oh please, Julia thinks she can give in to him, make love to him with no consequences. Even if the \\"marriage\\" had validity, as soon as it's consummated, they can't get an annulment. How stupid is she? As for the passion Julia suddenly exhibits? No, Kleypas hasn't given me any reason to believe that Julia/Jessica is so carried away with passion that she'll give in to Damon. It's the latter half of the 1820s and I'm supposed to believe that a Duchess can be an actress on the stage. Ah well, it's as believable as the rest of this story. Not.Then there's the scene where Julia is hiding in another room when her husband confronts her mother. Oh, please. Put some effort into it, Kleypas. Get out that thinking cap. This scene was just embarrassing in its utter idiocy. Any respect I may have had for Julia's character went right down the tubes.Talking about going to his estate...in London. I don't think so. House, townhouse, yes. Then Damon asks Julia to \\"have supper with me tonight at my terrace\\" in Bath. Again, I don't think so. It would be either house or townhouse, again.Someone needs to proofread this. There are so many misspellings; the final blow was \\"Know what?\\"I appreciate the efforts Kleypas expended to promote Jessica's need for independence, not wanting to be under the autocratic authority of a husband. And it was nice how she finally got Damon to understand that he would lose her if he continued to be the man her father had been. But the presentation of the story is clumsy and overly dramatic. I will try another Kleypas in an attempt to be fair, but I ain't holdin' mah breath.The StoryStruggling to make a living, Mrs. Jessica Wentworth finagles an audition with Logan Scott, the preeminent actor/producer in London. Her friend, a somewhat retired and famous actress, Mrs. Florence, has encouraged her to pursue it and Mrs. Wentworth overwhelms Scott and his acting troupe with her ability to portray the characters realistically and with passion.Julia/Jessica soon rises to the top of her chosen profession. She's happy with her independence but she misses the companionship marriage could bring. This question soon becomes very real when she encounters her husband for the first time at a weekend country house party.It's fate that Damon, Lord Savage, had met her some years ago when he thought she was a minor actress. When he remembers her from that May Day fest, he becomes even more intent on spending time with this woman and forces a meeting on her by investing in Scott's Capital Theatre. There is something about this woman and Damon pursues her. And Jessica retreats.She retreats to yet another secret visit to her mother gifting her with a piece of jewelry Damon had given her. Only Damon has also come to Hargate Hall to see her father, to demand her father tell him of Julia's whereabouts. The encounter has results. Disastrous for Julia. Enlightening for Damon.Providing Damon with the ammunition he needs to pursue his reluctant lady wife.The CharactersJulia Hargate, a.k.a., Mrs. Jessica Wentworth, a.k.a., Lady Julia, Marchioness of Savage, refuses to kowtow to her father's arrangements for her marriage and runs away at her first opportunity. She finds a way to live and work pursuing the activities she escaped to throughout her childhood. Her father, Edward, Lord Hargate, is an unbending, iron-fisted tyrant with an ancient regret while Julia's mother Eva is a timid woman who resorts to illness to avoid the overbearing manner of her husband.Damon, Marquess of Savage, heir to a dukedom, has been sacrificed on the all-too common altar of financial expediency. His father, the duke, has squandered the family fortune to the extent that they are in danger of losing everything. A disaster averted only by the duke's arranging the marriage of his seven-year-old son to Lord Hargate's four-year-old daughter. Young Julia's dowry provides the seed money to rebuild the Savage fortune--how this worked when the father played ducks and drakes with it and Damon is only seven, I have no idea.Lord William is Damon's younger brother and fills out the character list while Lady Pauline Ashton is the requisite slut who provides the comic relief...oops, I mean the dramatic contrast with the virginal Mrs. Wentworth.Logan Scott owns the Capital Theatre and has a reputation for bringing the act of acting back to a more realistic portrayal. All of his passion is caught up in the theatre and his marriage proposal to Julia is strictly business...supposedly. I have my doubts with that last impassioned scene.I was expecting to find that Mrs. Florence was Lord Hargate's long-dead sister, but instead she is simply the voice of reason for Julia.The CoverThe cover is pretty enough with its lilac background and the watercolor effect of the Italian feeling landscape with its arched bridge crossing the river.The title is too, too accurate as Damon is adamant about finding his lost wife."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Just when you think all possible themes have been covered in Regency romance, here comes a quirky one. Married as children (at ages not even Islam would condone) these children never see each other again and yet permit this clearly illegal marriage to dictate their outlook on life. One begrudgingly throws himself into the role as heir apparent to a gambling/alcoholic duke, the other rebels and runs off to join an acting troupe. So while the domineering fathers don't see anything wrong with what they did, they fail to see the pain they've put their kids through. A chance meeting between Damon and Julia (aka Jessica) has Damon spellbound. But he doesn't know this actress, who he wants as a mistress, is actually his wife. And Julia won't tell him b/c she's trying to break free but can't because she's drawn to this man too. So it's part mistaken identity, part future Duchess the Actress, part rebellion, and part quirky fun."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Lisa Kleypas writes a mighty fine romance novel. We readers owe her for our many hours of pure reading bliss.Again, Ms. Kleypas has penned a perfect romance novel: &quot;Somewhere I'll Find You&quot; is flawless.I loved the story of the theatre and I was excited to find out about Julia's life and where she came from. Ms. Kleypas creates characters who seem real, yet who are also fascinating. That's a difficult task for a romance writer, but Ms. Kleypas has no problem giving us characters that come alive on the page, yet who also seem like people who could have actually existed.The book is also very sensual, yet tasteful ... you'll enjoy it.Don't cheat yourself! Buy this book and you'll read it all in one night!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Enter the world of acting - your consultant Lisa Kleypas. This story is fascinating, either the author has exhausted herself with research or she has first hand knowledge in the theater -- it is that convincing.The Marquess of Savage, Lord Damon, is searching for his obscure bride. Married as children, Julia Hargate and Damon Savage were united to further family advantage. Now the marquess wants to explore the future of this unacquainted marriage. The faltering detail: his marchioness has become the infamous stage actress -- Mrs. Jessica Wentworth.Ms. Kleypas writes a worthy story, the drawback -- Julia's endless hesitation; I realize she wants to be free to live her own life but the story drags because of her indecisions. This reader was fixed firmly on Lord Damon's side; he is hunka hunka burnin' love material.The author arranges a superb supporting cast. Damon's shameless mistress and her fabrications strengthen the storyline. Damon's brother, William, supplies the necessary sibling suffering. Yet, it is Julia's mentor and friend, Logan Scott, who steals the role as \\"Best Supporting Actor\\". Ms. Kleypas draws his character to perfection -- intriguing her readers with his eccentric lifestyle. Sequel? Believe it! This reader will explore the bookstores looking for \\"Because You're Mine.\\".A tempting book, but the heroine's anxiety is the main thrust of the story and thus is its downfall!Grace Atkinson."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This book... I adore, to the n'th degree, most of Kleypas' books. Out of the 15 I've read to date, I've only thought two were okay. And this book is one of those two.It isn't the theatre aspect that I didn't care for. That was a spin on HR that I haven't read before and it was interesting. Overall, the problem with this book was believability. We're supposed to believe in a marriage between 4 and 7 year olds? When they themselves repeatedly say it wouldn't hold up to any legal scrutiny? It was just absurd.Another absurd aspect is how quickly the characters fall in love. After one dinner together, the next time they see each other they fall into bed - and then Julia believes herself in love with Damon. Though not enough to stay \\"married\\" or even talk and reach a compromise on her continuing acting in the theatre. No, no, no. She loves him enough to void the sham marriage and then marry someone else so that Damon will forever leave her alone.And Damon believes he was in love with her from the very start. Before they even talked.I'm not a hard sell on love in HRs... But this was asking way too much.And other than the back and forth love me/leave me - nothing else really happens plot-wise. It took me three days to finish this book and, truly, I almost had to force myself to.Kleypas has written magical, romantic novels with fun and quirky characters... Some of my all-time favorite HRs... But this one falls way short of the others. I might still give the next Capital Theatre book (Logan Scott's) a try though. He kept and grabbed my attention throughout, and I'm curious what kind of woman could make him fall in love with something other than the Capital."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Their is a fine line in novels, between the description of a man violently and passionately in love, willing to do anything to have the woman he loves, and the description of a man who is over-bearing, manipulative and down right creepy. For most of 'Somewhere I'll Find You', our hero, Damon, fits perfectly into the first category. He's desperate for Julia and his love for her is charming, but, at one stage in the novel, he acts so rashly and violently that I couldn't help but be put off. Despite the 20 or so pages in which our hero acts more like a raving lunatic than a hero from a romance novel, I very much enjoyed this novel. It wasn't particularly original, but it was enthralling and witty. I would recommend this novel, if only because I can't dislike anything that Lisa Kleypas has written and because of the charming secondary characters that truly move the story along."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I put off reading this book for a while.

Damon was an obsessive, controlling, stalking idiot. I did not want the heroine to be with him in the end... he was scary! She should have married Logan! And Logan was interesting--business and money. I'm sure the sequel is more interesting than this. Why did she keep coming back to him? Why do all historical romances have to be based on sex? Why do all heroines have to give in? And why do they all have to be beautiful goddess, their lovers gorgeous, perfect gods? But Damon wasn't perfect--he was obsessive. If this were a contemporary romance, he'd be put in jail!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

But this story fell short for me. Considering once they discovered they liked each other and had passion, why did she keep denying it? Kind of found her constant denial irritating. Considering she was a blue-blooded female, I can't image her preferring the life in the theater to a handsome rich husband and children.

This book was put out in 1996 &amp; it doesn't compare with her more recent novels. I do believe that alot of historical romance readers would like it, but it just didn't thrill me. As usual, LK wrote an original storyline; I really enjoyed reading about the lives of thespians. As in her others novels, LK made the characters come to life for me. There were a number of secondary characters that really added to the story &amp; the hero &amp; heroine were good people..... but it just took sooooooo long for them to come to grips with what each other wanted &amp; needed - it dragged on way too long.

I don't know what it was exactly, but the Kleypas magic was missing. I liked the character of Savage - especially in the end when he really did turn into a jealous savage! ;) But the Julia character irritated me. She was far too docile in her dealings with Logan. I know she feared losing her job and that Logan was a man to be reckoned with. But I highly doubt a spirited young woman who gave up her fortune and became an actress would allow a man like Logan Scott to yell at her and criticize her unmercifully.I forgave Logan for his nastiness because I know in the sequel he is tamed by Charlotte. But I don't think Julia should have tolerated that from him. She was far too docile a character. I like them feisty and unafraid to take on the tough characters head on.The storyline was interesting and the book was still a good read. It's worth it just to watch Lord Savage lose his cool and become a man possessed at the end. Sexy guy!"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I have read many books by Mrs. Kleypas and this book just did not measure up to any I have read before. While on the surface it looks like this book has everything it needs to be good, its missing what makes it great. There could have been more chemistry between the characters. There was sexual tension, but not alot that lead to the deeper feeling that draw two people to eachother. Even though you know those deeper feeling are there somewhere, they remain elusive. Julia was a great character. She was strong enough to change what she did not like in her life and did not care about the consequences. She delt with them as they came to her. She was bubbly, smart, indepindent and strong. Not bird brained at all. Although at times she hid under her shell and really took some stuff. Like with Logan. Logan was a hard man and not that great of a friend really. With the advise he gave Julia, you almost have to know what happend to him so that way you dont end up not liking him. I will be getting his story as well. Maybe if he had some romantic reasons for being that way, the man does not see capable of feeling anything other then his love for the theater.Damon was a hard man. Strong willed and liked things to go his way and fit in the pattern that he thought was best. This makes for lots of tension between the two characters. Julia is one of the most indipendent women that I have read.So no, this book was not great it was not a total waste of time. Maybe if I had not read any of her newer books and know what she has the potential for, I would have like this alot more. Maybe because it is an older book, I really dont know. But if you like her newer books, stay away from this one. Its not like them at all."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This book was okay, but not as good as her other books. I'm having a hard time putting a finger on exactly what I didn't like about this books so I don't think its that I disliked anything about it.

Somewhere I'll find you was, in my opinion, her poorest book to date. The characters have lot's of sexual chemistry, but nothing deeper.The storyline was just too over the top. Between the \\"I cannot love you even though were married\\", to the heroine's \\"I can't love you because I'll lose my independence\\" it was downright boring and hard to get through. The characters were wooden and unlikable. There was nothing that endeared me to either of these characters, and a kidnapping scene towards the end had me almost quitting in disgust. The cherry on top was the heroines realization that she loves the hero only after this as well as a fight with her boss/fiance'.The second book in the series, Because You're Mine, is much better and fortunately I read these two out of order as I would have never read book two had I read this book first.1.5 stars."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This Novel lived up to all my expectations!

I find myself catching up with her past books. In this book Julia plays a determined woman that would give up fortune and title to do the one thing she loves, the theater. I like the historical 'facts' that go with the character fiction the most. Case in point is Julia's 'worldly' sacrafice, because, in truth only in recent centuries were actresses respected at all, and true in her book, they were just above prostitutes. Kleypa's books tend to have strong female characters and I like that they always look different, have different sizes, hair, etc., but yet hold a central theme of being strong-willed and independent.I did feel that this book had a little 'drag' to it and seemed to plod along to fill pages, once you get past those few chapters it picks up the pace and is an 'enlightening' read for the sequel, &quot;Because You're Mine&quot;."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"This Novel lived up to all my expectations!

I guess I blame her for liking him and him for being such an offensive and boring character. I blame myself for reading the entire thing when stopping after the first few chapters would have let me pretend ambivalence towards Damon...Julia really carried the book, for me. Logan Scott was also interesting. He's the aloof and business-minded kind you want to fall hard and get all mushy over a woman.Perhaps it was that it was written in 1996 and fit into the theming of that time. You know, the old romance style of \\"Me Tarzan - You Jane\\" where the man treats the woman horribly, makes her rather unhappy, and is considered dominant and romantic because of it. I'm glad to say that Lisa Kleypas' characters usually have more believable chemistry and more interesting relationships.I have the ebook version and will be glad to delete it.

The life depicted on stage as so wonderful Julia would never dream of giving it up is ridiculous given the nature of the theatre in this period of history, and especially given how actresses were treated.A little bit of fluff to pass the time, but don't expect any real romance or high drama except between the actress and her father (or was that melodrama...)"},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"SPOILERSWhen I came across this book on the used bookshelf at my local library for only 25 cents, I couldn't believe my luck. I was so excited to read yet another books by Lisa (who happens to be one of my favorite authors). But, unfortunately, my excitement gradually died away. Now, I'm not going to go and rehash the plot like others, but I will tell you my reactions to the plot. The first problem I had was with the conflict. The book was not at all complex, and it didn't have many surprises in it. The single conflict dragged along through the entire book before becoming resolved 10 pages before the book ended. All of a sudden, Julia could no longer be away form Damon and professed her love for him, when she was rude to him throughout the entire book. The books was choppy and just didn't flow right. Most of my complaints lie within Julia. She was selfish (even when her father was very sick, she still insisted on bringing up her past differences with him instead of setting it aside WITHOUT having to be told), she treated Damon very rudely through most of the books (even though they were BOTH victimized by the marriage), she was overly stubborn (even though she \\"loved\\" Damon, her reasons for trying to put up a wall between them were completely unreasonable, especially since she knew that Damon loved her), and she was just completely retarded (and WHY was it that she agreed to marry Logan? Her reasoning was a little... off balance). I honestly didn't like Julia very much. The only good thing that came out of this book was it made me appreciate the brilliance of Logan's story \\"Because You're Mine.\\" I wondered how such a terrible first book could lead to an amazing second book. Don't let this book turn you off of Lisa Kleypas! She is still an amazing author."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"I really enjoy this author.

Heroine Julia Wentworth is that rare thing in the early 1800s--an actress who isn't a prostitute. And, she's married, but no one knows it; after all, that's not her real name. The man she was forced to marry as a child, Damon, Lord Savage, falls for the actress only to discover she's his wife. Intriguing scenario, but as another reviewer mentioned, the reader lands firmly on Damon's side thanks in large part to Julia's hesitancy. Excellent hero.Logan Scott is a fabulous secondary character and appears, as mentioned, in other novels. The triangle between Scott, Julia, and Damon leads to interesting revelations as well. A romance between side characters also adds interest, as do Julia's interactions with her parents. The scheming mistress is the least interesting and least convincing part of the book.Kleypas writes well, as always, but she has only improved over the years. Don't miss this one, but realize that there are better ones, too."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Or, if not research precisely, at least a far clearer explanation of the situation. Once one gets well into the book, it's clear that not only the author knows that the hero and heroine are not married, but that they also know it.

If you are anything like me dear reader, a good romance novel MUST have two extraordinary characters: a great leading lady, and a sensual hero. That being said...I found Damon Savage to be one of the worst leading men ever put to pen. He was bossy, demanding, controlling, and selfish. His antics might have been justifiable, if I felt that there was ANY sexual chemistry between he and Julia Hargate, but there simply wasn't.Julia Hargate is an instantly likeable character. Forced into a marriage she never wanted, she flees to London and pursues a career on the stage. An instant media darling, Julia has everything she wants: critical acclaim, a home, fashionable clothes, and money. The only thing lacking is a man to share in her success. (Enter Damon, Marquess of Savage).Unbeknownst to Damon, Julia is his wife. Now that Damon has secured his family fortunes, he sees Julia perform and knows that he has to have her (marriage or not). Here's where things get tricky! Damon has a mistress who claims to be pregnant with his child. Being the real winner that he is, he seduces Julia at the same time he is trying to rid himself of his mistress. If I wanted a guy like this, I would have just turned on the TV to Jerry Springer...This book was forced, drawn-out, and I hated to see the heroine choose between the theater she loved and a controlling, manipulative man. At one point I literally threw the book at the wall in exasperation! As a footnote, I have liked many of Lisa Kleypas' books in the past (ie: \\"Dreaming of You,\\" \\"Then Came You,\\" and \\"Someone to Watch Over Me.\\" Perhaps I shouldn't have strayed to some of her earlier work, it just doesn't seem to compare."},{"Title":"Somewhere I'll Find You","review":"Irritating plot, irritating characters.

I've read some really good Lisa Kleypas books and loved them, this one was just not for me."},{"Title":"Died in the Wool","review":"I should probably read a bio on Ngaio Marsh, because I'm interested in knowing if she lived on a sheep farm when growing up in New Zealand - she seems to know an awful lot about wool! At any rate, this is another classic Marsh novel, though I do still miss Fox and co., as is the case with all the Inspector Alleyn novels set in New Zealand. Alleyn is performing War duty for the Special Services branch, when he responds to a call from a house where a Member of Parliament has been found murdered by being encased in a bale of wool on her own sheep farm. While there are household jealousies and inheritances, there is also a question of secret machinery plans being stolen and given to the enemy. As usual, the characters are finely drawn, and the plot superb (not to mention a bit bizarre!)."},{"Title":"Died in the Wool","review":"Yet another enthralling mystery by Marsh... The characters are realistic even their flaws. Died In The Wool- is set in New Zealand during the onset of WWll. A zealous, outspoken,and very popular MP is found dead in a bail of her own wool. The question is the motive. Had she made enemies because of her shrewdness, or was she caught in the middle of international espionage? Inspector Alleyn is brought in. Thanks to emotional and often biased analysis of this formidable woman by her relatives and employees, Alleyn recreates the circumstances that forced her murder."},{"Title":"Died in the Wool","review":"This is a beautifully written murder mystery that's also, to some degree, an espionage novel. As per several of her books, New Zealander Marsh places her detective Alleyn in NZ--this time during WW II. Thus, the usual cast of supporting characters such as Inspector Fox are absent as are the local police (except by reference). As in very few of her novels, Alleyn is on his own--but of course he solves the mystery. Similarly, while the mystery is good IMHO, the best part of the book is the writing--esp. the characterizations and the phraseology. The mystery revolves around1) a dynamic Member of Parliament-- p. 172: \\"It all hangs on her. The kind of woman she was.\\"2) her relationships with the people on her sheep station-- p. 238: \\"Isn't there something unsound in a happiness that fails in the light?\\"3) on a remote South Island plateau-- p. 270: \\"When you pause at midnight in this house, the landscape comes in through the windows & sends something exciting down your spinal column.\\"It's told via individual expositions by the main characters in separate chapters where, of course, one is tempted to jump to logical, but incorrect, conclusions about both the happenings & the people involved. For me, It was a very fast read--and highly enjoyable, perhaps one of her most enjoyable. Unfortunately, I have but one more of Marsh's novels to enjoy. The page #s refer to a March 1945, 270 page Little Brown, Boston edition. This novel is, interestingly, included in a set of 3 by different mystery masters:The Case of the Golddigger's Purse; Died in the Wool; Pearls Before Swine (Detective Book Club)as well as Marsh anthologies:3 FOR I SHIPPING DIED IN THE WOOL/KILLER DOLPHIN/A WREATH FOR RIVERA&Ngaio Marsh: A Wreath for Rivera/Final Curtain/Died in the Wool/Colour Scheme."},{"Title":"Died in the Wool","review":"The chief suspects in this murder mystery each describe their version of events, some eighteen months after the crime. This gives the story a most unusual and intriguing structure. The characters are well drawn, distinct without being overstated. There is also a fine sense of period and place, those being wartime New Zealand.So why a grudging three stars? Well, the solution to the puzzle is rather plodding; a systematic analysis of details rather than a brilliant insight. Also there is a general dullness about the characters and their setting. I suppose that's not surprising, given they are on a remote farm in winter, suffering the deprivations of war and trying to come to terms with an unsolved murder. But it would have benefited from the occasional comic relief or lightness of touch that Dorothy L Sayers or Conan Doyle could have brought to it.All in all, recommended for the unusual structure and setting (albeit the \`local color' is mostly gray) and for the quality of the writing, which is very good, but don't expect a classic puzzle. The author even makes one error in the solution (don't worry, this is not a spoiler) when Alleyn says \\"Only (the guilty person) could have put...\\". Actually, one other person could have; namely the one who found said item. I will however concede that the build up to the climax is genuinely suspenseful."},{"Title":"Died in the Wool","review":"The views of several people are hashed out as to the alibis of all concerned. It is a little slow to start but gets very interesting latter on. I liked the book very much."},{"Title":"The Grape Cure","review":"I have read this book many years ago, but it wasn't the first time I heard of a grape cure. Ancient Greeks used it, it is still used in Germany and Austria, I experienced it in Tyrol, for instance, where they have wonderful grapes.I've been doing small grape cures every year, when the grape season comes. I don't suffer from anything in particular, I do it as a regular detox. I feel wonderful, energetic and in a good mood; my skin becomes smooth and vibrant, every single pimple is gone, evacuation is normalized and I shed some unwanted weight too. I've never had any side effects, even when using it for two weeks, which is my maximum. You just have to be careful not to overeat, grapes are so delicious!I know nothing about it curing cancer, but in healthy people (who don't suffer from diabetes or such)who have minor little problems a grape cure can only be beneficial.There are people who wait for something to be \\"scientifically proved\\" to endorse it, without listening to the thousands of people testifying that it works. Yes, it's like homeopathy. It cannot be proven why it works, but it works anyway. Moreover, the book is cheap (especially the 1971 edition, still to be found if you search a bit on the Web), so you are not risking anything. (By the way, if you go to fruitarian com you will find the method outlined without purchasing the book). It's much better than many costly programs with pills and chemicals you know nothing about. At least this is a natural food. You are certainly not risking malnutrition if you only do it for a week or two, and you can also go on working normally, as the sugars in the grapes give you a lot of energy.I'm not saying all M.D.s are in bad faith: there are many who sincerely believe this is quackery: because of their frameset they are not ready to accept anything they didn't learn in medical school. However, I also feel the suspicion and slander from the part of some medical people come less from real conviction and more from the fact that if all people adopted natural cures they'd be out of a job."},{"Title":"The Grape Cure","review":"-Actual- science is a rarity. What is promoted as science in society is often deception: Research is conducted by supposed scientific groups that are actually owned by the product's manufacturer. Government organisations named to sound like protection offices,(Department of Agriculture), are actually in place to promote business. Results are simply not released when the results don't go the 'right' way, so what the public sees as proof may be the one time out of ten that insures the \\"scientist's\\" job security. Conclusions are often drawn that contradict the obviously real conclusions, with the understanding that most of us won't wade through the technical jargon. My point is that \\"anecdotal evidence\\" , so maligned by the supposed scientists, is a whole different matter when it's YOUR anecdote. I'm witnesss to benign skin tumors dissolving,(for lack of a better word), on diets similar to the Grape Cure. Yes, going too long would be a mistake, but a couple of weeks on fruits only, during the warmer months, is certainly less harmful than ANY alternative offered by the 'proven' methods of the medical community. If you want be a 'Quackwatcher', the first thing you need to 'watch' is the 'Quackwatchers' themselves, where hidden motives abound."},{"Title":"The Grape Cure","review":"There is no book like this. Highly educational and I've gone on the Grape Cure a couple times now. Everything the book says will happen does happen. It's reliable material and has saved the lives of a lot of people with cancer.

I buy them and give them out to those that are sick and I'm trying to get the word out that not all cancer diagnoses mean there is going to be a death, there's hope in The Grape Cure and Essiac Tea - another thing I order from Amazon: Essiac Tea in bulk by the pound.

It is divided by age group (baby boys and toddlers age 0-2, preschool boys age 3-5, etc. up to older teenage boys age 16-18) and by topic. I read the preschool section only with basic topics like bath time, bedtime, and eating, but with excellent others like computers/TV, gender identity, moral development).This book is simple to read and understand. The format of each topic is the same including Things to Consider, Three Things You Must Do, Things to Say (specific questions and sentences), Words, Phrases and Actions to Use (a nice list of specific words for support and encouragement), Things Not to Say and Do, and Words, Phrases, and Actions to Avoid.If you read the book straight through, it may seem somewhat repetitive, but I found that in my first reading (when I needed the most help with discipline), it helped greatly to have the \\"right words\\" to say repeated for me. You owe it to your boy to check out this book!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This book is a rich tapestry that effortlessly weaves through the initial mid 19th Century collision of cultures between the newly arrived Anglo Americans and the native Mexicans and American Indians. This loose historical narrative follows the careers of two French priests and boyhood friends (Bishop Latour and Vicar Vaillant), who were directed by Rome to discipline and expand a southwestern Catholic Church that had lost much of its connection to The Vatican. It is, unashamedly, a book that largely extols the contributions that the French priests and their Spanish forbears made towards developing the rich and unique culture that exists to this day in Northern New Mexico. Like the native posole, this book is a rich stew that blends the gorgeous landscapes, unique cultures, and turbulent histories into a not always seamless, but always interesting story. Perhaps the most interesting chapter relates to the Acoma Pueblo and how the Acoma Mesa Indians dealt, in their own even-handed way, with a Spanish priest who accidentally kills a young boy during a fit of rage. There are also elements of Cormac McCarthy in the book, like the renegade Taos priest who sets himself up Captain Kurtz- like as the leader of the local community. There is also the Gothic Western story of the murderous Anglo settler (and his Mexican slave/wife) who offers his rundown house as a refuge to waylaid travelers.In addition to the rich cultural, religious and historical backdrop, this is a story about an undying, lifelong friendship and two lives well-lived. The death of Bishop Latour, unlike the sinister overtones suggested by the title, was dignified, reflective and peaceful."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This story is a classic Willa Cather work. Vibrant account of pioneer New Mexico. This printing is inferior with words running together making it difficult to read. This edition should be withdrawn."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Death Comes for the Archbishop reminds me of a watercolor painting. At their best, watercolor is very fluid, and yet the result is often very beautiful and full of depth. This book was much the same. The story itself jumps around a lot and is more like a series of short stories, with the same main characters. It is very fluid.However, the finished book is breathtaking in its scope and beauty. It is a book about friendship, about evangelism, about a strange and desolate country, about the way that all these elements blend to give us a picture that is humanity. Very few books are able to really carry this off successfully. Death Comes for the Archbishop is one that is successful."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Let it be known that Willa Cather can not write a structurely sound sentence, but when you put her sentences into paragraphs then you have magic.

This book is my favorite. It was the first book I had read by Willa Cather, and what struck me most about it was her style. I remember thinking how clever and profound of her to describe in a passage not the landscape of New Mexico, but &quot;the sky, the sky!&quot;Everything about about this book is beautiful."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I have to admit that I enjoy the novels of Willa Cather more than those of many of her American contemporaries, like Heminingway and Fitzgerald. Perhaps because she primarily wrote books that were somewhat historical in nature she isn't perceived as relevant as them. For whatever reason, I find her to be a marvelous writer, and although I have read almost a dozen of her books, I haven't found anything that wasn't completely enchanting. If you like this one, follow it up with the almost equally marvelous SHADOWS ON THE ROCK."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"It has been a long time since I read a Willa Cather novel. I had forgotten how lively and spiritual she is. When I was a student at Vassar a number of years ago, I read &quot;My Antonia&quot; and &quot;A Lost Lady&quot;. At the time, I was going through a horrible breakup with my boyfriend and I remembered how uplifting these novels were. I sat in my room for weeks just reading and feeling a since of kinship with Antonia's troubled life and the Lost Lady's claustrophobic one. Recently, I was going through a troubled time in my life (my life-partner and I separated) and I decided to turn to Willa Cather again. I picked up &quot;Death Comes ... &quot; in a bookstore and knew it was the pick-me-up I needed. It turned out to be much more spiritual than the other two, but the complexity of the human dilemma was fully enlightening. I recommend this book to anyone having trouble in their personal life who needs to think bigger thoughts and move outside of themselve to find some answers."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Very difficult to read text in this book.

But most of all, I think that Cather and the artist Georgia O'Keeff were surely kindred spirits, both of whom were enriched by the beauty of the colors of the Southwest.

The characters aredescribed in the most impersonal terms,(we learn little of their internal life)there is no conflict that leads toa new resolution, the generalizationsabout people would now be consideredracist and dramatic tension is completelyabsent.So what makes this book so appealing?It's a question of charm. In the daysbefore the dramatic structure of televisionruled literature and people's leisuretime, a series of stories with a certainmoral center were enormously appealing.The tradition is long-morality plays toHoratio Alger.DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP is apre-television entertainment, a splendidway of passing a pre-electronic houror two in the evening.

Avoidthis publisher."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I didn't initially imagine I would like this book that much, although I love My Antonia. The title \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" is just too foreboding, too sectarian, too Catholic, too morose, I thought.Wow, nothing could be further from the truth of this book. It's about life, not death -- and moreover a life well lived -- to the fullest, with the fullest expression of humanity and joy and human interaction. In fact, interaction with people and places that range further than any other novel I've read.Furthermore, the book isn't about just one life, but several. Mainly the refined and introverted young missionary bishop, and his faithful co-missionary, who is by contrast extroverted and of a lively temperament, despite his frail and homely form. Between the two of them, they roam through the vast and alien and often forbidding expanses of the American Southwest of the late 1800s, when that territory was growing by leaps and bounds, but was mainly populated by Mexicans and Indians and consisted of bare dry terrain, beautiful in its austerity. The book is not limited to this area, however. We follow the two companions in France and in Rome, and encounter their superiors in Spain, the Great Lakes, and elsewhere. The book in fact becomes a delightful 19th-century travelogue of sorts.Don't be put off by the seeming religiosity of the title. In this book, faith becomes a wonderfully symbolic spiritualism -- a sense of inner goodness and kindness that transcends doctrine or dogma. I found it enormously appealling and uplifting.And I was surprised at how touching the novel is. I found myself welling up with tears a few times. That's the beauty of Cather's gift. To quote the original New York Times review: \\"From the riches of her imagination and sympathy Miss Cather has distilled a very rare piece of literature. It stands out, from the very resistance it opposes to classification.\\"By the way, be sure to get a good edition, as numerous editions of this book are extremely flawed and full of numerous weird typos and such. The best edition I've found is the Vintage Classics, which is perfect."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This remarkable story of faith in the wilderness of the American Southwest is remarkable, though not told in the format of our modern novels. Ms. Cather's work rather resembles a VCR in that she lets us see portions of the unfolding story before \\"fast forwarding\\" through resolutions and on into the rest of the story. At times this is a bit of a \\"let down,\\" especially when the reader had been building interest only to have the following events passed over superficially. On the whole, however, this book is masterfully written.The missionary priests seem so similar to the circuit-riding Methodist saddlebag preachers I've read about. The main difference is, of course, the nature of their religion. The privations and sacrifices associated with spreading their faith and fortifying it in the vast North American wilderness of the 1800s are the same regardless of specific beliefs.Anyone giving this book a fair reading will become very familiar with the two French priests and will finish the book having gained an appreciation for the history of the Southwest and for the faith of those first immigrants that settled it."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Of the many books I have read since beginning my prison sentence here in Danbury, Willa Cather's _Death Comes for the Archbishop_ has proven to be the most compelling. Cather's ability to interweave speculations about European art and culture, while painting with equal beauty the cerulean skies of Northern New Mexico provide me with great comfort, since my only view here in Danbury is that of my cell-mate's mattress-bottom.

Her mechanism for making this statement is a series of vignettes about the life of Archbishop Jean Latour. At first, there seems to be little connection between these stories, other than they detail Latour's work in bringing the Santa Fe Diocese into conformance with the mainstream Roman Catholic Church. However, nature plays a major role in each vignette. From the opening outdoor dinner of the Cardinals to the landscape Latour passes as he makes his way to his deathbed, nature is shown playing an important part in defining the choices that each character makes.No character has their personality more strongly refined by their exposure to nature than Archbishop Latour. The Archbishop is shown at the beginning of the book as clearly being most comfortable within the structure of the Church, to the point that he sleeps in a church's ruins rather than in an Indian pueblo. However, by the end of the book, Latour is portrayed walking among the hillsides around Santa Fe and perfecting his garden. While Latour never abandons his version of Catholicism, he does find that a respect for nature is complementary and enriching to his faith. Thus, his passing is not the tragic or pathetic death associated with someone who refused to change. Instead, it is a peaceful, uplifting, and natural end.Cather's greatest triumph is to convey the changing power of the New Mexico landscape in her writing. Reading this book is a lot like visiting New Mexico. At first, a visitor only sees the desert's desolation and monotony. Slowly, the beauty of the area starts appearing in little details. Finally, the visitor realizes that, while it isn't overly dramatic, there is much beauty in New Mexico. The same pattern of recognition can be applied to the book. At first, the book appears to be just about Latour's work. Yet, the frequent evocative descriptions of the New Mexico landscape plant seeds in the reader's mind. By the end, one has a clear understanding of the high desert's life-changing power.It is no surprise that this work is considered a classic. Cather's love for the New Mexico terrain clearly shows on every page. What is most impressive is that she was able to take that love and articulate it into a story which shows the way in which that terrain can change a person. Death Comes for the Archbishop not only stands as a model of good storytelling, but also as one of the premier works explaining the appeal that the natural grandeur of the American Southwest has on people's imaginations and hearts."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"If you have ever been to New Mexico, it's easy to see it as stark, barren, devoid of life. But it is only after really savoring the landscape, becoming part of it, do you begin to fully understand.Willa Cather's \`Death Comes for the Archbishop' makes you feel the same way. On the surface it is a lightly written sketch of the missionary journeys of two Catholic priests in territorial New Mexico. But it is that simple life chronicled that brings the desertSparse? Maybe. Beautiful? Definitely. But it is the very simplicity that draws you in.The two padres spend as much time on the road traveling between the small towns and villages of rugged New Mexico as they do ministering to their flock. Meeting renegade priests, Kit Carson, Indian settlements, criminals and horse thieves, and gold miners.In the end, we feel, with the Bishop as death approached, that we are leaving the past. We wait for the future to take care of itself."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Just to add to the warnings of many others here on this \\"Cassia Press\\" edition.

Reading this book feels like an honor. Finishing it feels like being with a good friend right before they have to leave for an extended time...ya just don't want it to end"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's famous novel \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" (1927) is set against the backdrop of the United States's acquisition of the New Mexico territory as a result of the Mexican War. Another less than happy historical incident also forms a boundary of the story: the forced removal of the Navajo Tribe from its ancestral home in the 1860s, with a great toll of death and suffering, followed by the return some years later of the Navajos to their current Reservation. Cather develops her timeless and asture story against the background of these events.Cather's book tells the story of Father Jean Pierre LaTour, a French priest who has come to the Ohio Valley to do missionary work. With the United States' acquisition of New Mexico, the Church sends him on an arduous journey to Santa Fe to become the Bishop and to revitalize the Catholic Church. He is soon joined in Santa Fe by his long-time friend from his seminary days in France, Father Joseph Valliant. LaTour is scholarly and aloof, while Valliant is emotional and impulsive, a man of the people. A great deal of Cather's book centers on the friendship between the two priests. Cather changed the names of her characters, but the depiction of the two priests is historically based. Cather adopted and idealized their portrayals for her purposes in the novel. Other historical figures in the novel include the scout Kit Carson, who receives a sympathetic portrayal, and the native priest Padre Martinez, who attempts to break away from the orthodox Catholicism of Father LaTour and to found his own order. Martinez receives a less than sympathetic portrait from Cather.Over the years of the story, LaTour and Valliant wander the deserts and small settlements of New Mexico and Arizona in an attempt to bring Catholicism to the people. During the timeframe of the book, the territory was inhabited largely by Indians and by Mexicans with only a few settlers from the States. As the book progresses, the pace of settlement quickens, as LaTour lives to regret the changed, urban character of Santa Fe where he builds a glorious cathedral. Cather is at her best in her descriptions of the landscape of the American Southwest, its distances, bleakness, deserts, heat, frost, wind, and cold. Cather offers a portrait of the Indian people, and the high mesas on which some of them lived. She shows a sensitivity to native Indian religions, which persisted through the Indians' nominal conversion to Catholicism.With her attraction to the Southwest and its people, Cather also was greatly devoted to French culture and to the life of the mind. There are many descriptions in the book of LaTour and Valliant's love for French art, literature, wine, and cuisine and music. I had the feeling that Cather wanted to bring the best of European civilization to the New World. Yet, both LaTour and Valliant fall in love with their new homeland and LaTour declines the opportunity to spend his final years in a university position in France.Cather wrote this book to emphasize the importance of religion in American life and in the settlement of the Southwest in particular. She had become dismayed by the increased emphasis on materialism, individuality, and sensuality that she saw in her contemporary America of the 1920s. She thus wrote a book that modified the usual picture of American expansionism to focus on religion. Today, as in Cather's day, many people overlook the role religion has played in shaping the American experience.As a young woman, Cather had converted from the Baptist to the Episcopalian form of Protestantism. She never became a Catholic, but she studied and learned a great deal from Catholicism that is reflected in this book. She emphasizes a life of simple piety, devotion, and order, finding God in the everyday. There are many beautiful passages in the book on the Virgin Mary and her role in Catholicism, and discussions of piety, celibacy, miracles, and living a quiet contented life.\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" has always been a difficult book to classify. The work has a surprisingly modernist structure for a novel, with its lack of a plot line. The book has a historical setting, but it should not be read as history. It is concerned with a religion in which Cather did not herself believe and it shows her hero, LaTour, as enduring many moments of doubt. The picture that emerges is ultimately one of serenity and faith, but it is a harder and more complex vision than may appear on the surface.I was pleased to have the opportunity to reread and rethink \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" when I read it with a book group. Many critics prefer some of Cather's lesser-known works, such as \\"A Lost Lady\\" or \\"The Professor's House\\" to this famous novel. But \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" is unquestionably a moving and compelling work. It deserves its place as an American classic.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Every year, I try to read one or two \\"classics\\", whether I need to or not. For 2001, I have chosen Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop. First published in 1927, this fine, spare novel tells of missionary bishop Jean Marie Latour, assigned by Rome to the new southwestern diocese which includes New Mexico. While the story centers on Latour and his vicar (later bishop of Colorado) Father Joseph, to Cather the dry, stunning landscape forms as much a character as her priest heros, as do the \\"simple\\" native Indians and Mexicans. In this novel, Cather's writing reminds me a great deal of Harriet Doerr, who wrote of American expatriates in rural Mexico. The title's focus on Latour's death is somewhat misleading; this novel is very much about his missionary life and accomplishments. His death takes up but the very end of the book, and is itself oddly peaceful and uplifting.Musing to Father Joseph upon an apparent \\"miracle\\" attested to by a rural monk, Latour comments: \\"Where there is great love there are always miracles. One might almost say that an apparition is human vision corrected by human love. I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I see you through my affection for you. The Miracles of the Church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is about us always.\\" Although the bishop, Latour's holiness and character comes as much from those times he receives ministry from his flock as when he gives it. Thus, when praying secretly with Sada, a servant - - and battered - - woman, Latour experienced again \\"those holy mysteries as he had done in his young manhood\\", and remembered that \\"this church was Sada's house, and he was a servant in it.\\" Well worth reading and pondering as Lent begins and Easter appears on the horizon."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This book was given for me to read as an English assignment. When I began reading it I had no problem with getting into it. It was just a real good book. Period! I really loved Bishop (or should I say Archbishop) Latour, he has an immensely great character."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Cather's descriptions are vivid and extensive, but to my taste not boring. I also liked the &quot;freeze frame&quot; style, because (this may be shallow) I have a 6 month old baby and that limits my time and attention span these days. I resisted this book at first, but got caught up in it pretty quickly. I did wish there was a chapter that fleshed out the Pike's Peak story."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is a wonderful book detailing life in the Southwest around the time America acquired the land. Cather has a nice writing style that keeps you interested throughout the life of the main character. Expect to fly through this book."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is a short novel that reads effortlessly. The story was interesting, not very busy- yet it held a certain pace. While reading it I often thought this book was intended for children, it is simple yet effective, bordering on lore. It is a tale, the type of book that captures you, takes you to a strange and distant land for light adventure and brings you back in one piece. This book might appeal to a wide age group, I think a sixth- grade reader could enjoy it. Cather creates a beautiful atmosphere with her words, and the story seems to take place on it's own."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Even though Willa Cather was not a Catholic, she has created a moving description of the dedication of a missionary bishop in New Mexico, and the difficulties he encountered in his work. Carefully crafted writing and the integration of the historical facts make this a must-read."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Gorgeous meditative writing. Subtle, mature, profound. Not for earth-bound, impatient geeks or silly high-schoolers."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"In music it would be called a tone poem. It is like reading a painting, probably the most visual book you'll ever find. The landscape of Taos comes to life. The narrative itself is secondary. The simplicity of the writing is deceiving. This could well be the most beautiful book in the English language."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather is in my opinion one of the great American novelists and Death Comes for the Archbishop is one of her masterpieces.The landscape is a major force in the book it seems like a seperate character and Cather's powers oofdescription are at their highest in this book The main character, Jean Latour , is the first bishop of New Mexico after America had won the territory from Mexico in the Mexican War. He faces many struggles with his friend and vicar Joseph Vaillant. Latour is a well wriien chracter and along with the descriptions of landscape and the cultuere Latour confronts plus several well written and compelling secondary characters makes this a 5 star book in my opinion"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"When I read this book I had just finished the last volume of Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After such a verbose book it was a delight to read this concise prose that captured the moment in such a compelling way. Her portrayal of the Southwest Indians was especially moving. Her respect for them and sorrow over their plight was unusual for her time. I truly enjoyed every page and hated to see it end."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP is both a celebration of the diverse strands of America's nineteenth century past and a minute analysis of the virtues of two men who helped shape that past. The publishing of the book in 1927 was only fifty years after the major events described so there were probably many elder readers who remembered quite well these events. Most of the plot occurs in the Southwest before, during, and after the Civil War. The America described is not the shoot-\`em-ups of the pulp cowboy fiction. Rather, Cather portrays a panorama that includes as much visual as historic. When Bishop Latour and Father Vaillant head for Santa Fe to tender to the needs of the natives, Cather allows their interaction with other characters to shrink into the background where the bleak and unforgiving sands of the desert hold sway. We read of the heroic efforts of the two priests to establish the primacy of the Church in a land so savage that even many of the resident clerics have become corrupted. We read of numerous tribes of Indians and Mexican peasants who are not convinced that the God of the Church is the one true God. We read of nasty brutes like Buck Scales and heroic women like Magdalena, Scales' wife, both of whom prove that a person's inner worth is less a function of geography and more one of integrity. Encompassing the events that span several decades suggests that this is a plot driven book. We note the testing of both priests during that time, but we are also sure that they will avoid the snares that rendered their predecessor clergy as unfit to serve. What holds us in thrall is not how Latour and Vaillant maintain their respective moral compasses but how they ensure that others can establish their own. As the decades unfold, South Western America changes for the better. If the mountain cliffs and pueblos could speak, they would surely comment on a slowly increasing nobility of a peasantry that needed a mere two priests to show that when death comes for an archbishop, that death is but one more step in the cycle of life."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"If you love exceptional writing this is a book you will savor. Willa Cather is a writer that not only creates a vision but catches the soul of the people, period, and settings she writes about. Death Comes for the Archbishop is a book for readers and writers. It is especially meaningful if you have ever visited New Mexico and Santa Fe and treasured its rich history. The simple elegance of the author's style is what has made this book a classic."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Great book as advertised. Arrived quickly. This is a story that everyone would enjoy. See also the novel \\"Converso\\" by Mario X. Martinez, which is a story that picks up some of the same elements."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Good book ! ! !Have been wanting to read it for some time.Not Disappointed"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's nostalgic Death comes for the Archbishop presents us the American frontier in the second half of the nineteenth century. In a land that is now New Mexico, her novel shows us the meeting between cultured Europeans, partially catechized Mexicans, and soon to disappear Indians. The protagonist Father Jean Latour must combat his desire for companionship and esteem as he establishes a diocese in the midst of a barren and desolate landscape. Cather's novel impels the reader to ask why a person would forgo the comfort and security of a familiar world to plunge into one where the only certainties are toil and sacrifice."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"It is about the growing relationships among people with the ever changing and inspiring nature as the central character and it is written in a clear, simple yet very reflective language. Descriptions of nature in novels often tend to be too ornate and distracting, but in this book, the nature is living, breathing, conversing, and interacting with all the characters, it is very refreshing to find a book like this. Each chapter is like a short story of intriguing personalities, very delicious."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is one of my most loved books as it gives a great insite into another church and from so long ago."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I attempted to read this book over the summer, but misplaced the copy not until this fall was I able to finish it. My overall opinion over the novel is a criticism on religion. If you are looking for action skip this one. What interested me is the impression I had of arrogance and ignorance of the religious Bishops to the well beings of others and especially the culture of the Indians and their beliefs. Seemingly they pay no emotional attention to others beyond themselves. What efforts/miracles/gifts they encounter they simply assume this is to be expected. I found it replusive to read about these Characters. On a mission for God, but so much missing the point of morality and respect for one another. I felt like it was a lesson for us all to try and be more respectful of not only others but what they have to say and believe in. The novel is not gripping like a Clancy, but it does have an elusive thought process and meaning underneath the surface."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Yes, it evokes the landscape--but in a telling passage, Latour looks at the mountains in the landscape and sees them as scattered buildings that look &quot;like mountains&quot; and in a later passage says the terrain is waiting to become a landscape. Really in touch, isn't he?And then, rather than challenge the white people who keep a slave, he secretly gives the enslaved woman a religious medal that's supposed to make feel better. This is the church as promising a good life in heaven and ignoring the very real social ills that hamper the growth of people on this earth.Finally, that yellow cathedral he builds is built on the backs of workers who have to lug that stone for him, piece by piece, in a harsh terrain of desert heat.These men are anything but sweet and simple--in fact they are the forerunners of the spread of capitalism and the forstering of racial discrimination.I would agree with all those who see this is a wonderful novel, but not for the same reasons. It's a wonderful example from a novelist who truly loves the landscape but certainly doesn't know doodly-squat about the indigenous people who live in it."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Father Jean Marie Latour comes to New Mexico in 1851 to reestablish the Church's control over the Catholic community in America's newly acquired South West. Over the next forty years, he &amp; his cohorts battle the landscape, corruption and indifference to restore the place of the Church in the lives of the local Indians, Mexicans and Americans.This is a spare &amp; simple story, which is both a strength and a weakness. Oddly missing from the tale are God and Jesus Christ. We admire the faith that sustains the priests in their work, but what is it that they have faith in? Why does this faith have the power to maintain them against all hardships?Because these questions remain unasked, let alone unanswered, the book is ultimately unsatisfying.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather sacreligiously portrays the father as some sort of hero because he is baptising and converting all the mexicans. Personally, i think this is disrespectful of all people's beliefs besides Christians. The descriptions are so boring and meandering, it is difficult to follow the paths of the characters. This book would have been better had it been reduced to about 30 pages, and written without these descriptions. I will never read this kind of drivel again."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I was forced to read this book for summer reading.

This is fortunate, because if this book is any indication, she was truly blessed with a rare talent. First published in 1927, the focus of this novel is New Mexico in the early to late 19th century. In fact, I chose to read it because my wife and I were making our initial trip to Santa Fe, and the New York Times has discussed the relationship between the novel and actual locations in the state. I am very happy that I finally got around to reading it.In a nutshell, the novel's two main characters are based on actual persons, although they are given different names by Cather: Archbishop Lamy, the first bishop of New Mexico, and his vicar, Father Joseph Machebeuf--childhood friends in France, who took orders together, and devoted their lives to missionary activities in North America. For anyone interested in, or familiar with New Mexico, this is the book to read. Set primarily in Santa Fe, and other locations within the state, one learns a good deal about the history of this period from the novel. It also adds luster that so many of the physicial locations in which the novel is set are still in existence and can be visited: Lamy's cathedral in Santa Fe; his retirement lodge and small chapel (the \\"bishop's lodge\\") on the grounds of the resort of the same name; and various pueblos and churches are all easily accessible. Cather obviously had done her homework and visited the very sites she includes in the novel.How the Archbishop undertook to administer a large territory (not just New Mexico, but portions of Arizona and Colorado as well) with minimal resources, which had substantial Mexican and Indian populations, recently taken over by Americans, and developed the Catholic church presence is truly an amazing story of unrelenting dedication and limitless energy. It all makes for a fine novel and makes one curious to know more about this amazing individual. This Vintage Classic edition is printed on high quality paper and is a pleasure to hold. Unfortunately, it does not contain any introduction explaining the role of the real Archbishop and the his achievements--but that is what we have Google for."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"From the opening pages in Rome, to the closing chapter in New Mexico, this is a novel about how time and place mold us, and how we, in turn, with dedication and love, can mold a place ourselves. It is a rare novel that never draws attention to itself, but meanders with the finality of a river running to a deep water ocean. Omnia mutantar nihil interit as they say. By the time you reach the final pages you'll be able to look back on the life of the Bishop with a clearer understanding of what it means to dedicate one's life to a single moral purpose and how to love a people and a place without judgement, but with hope and discipline."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This wonderful novel from Willa Cather is loosely based on a true story. It is the tale of Father Jean Marie Latour, a Catholic Bishop from France who is sent to be the first Bishop in the newly annexed territory of New Mexico, in the late 1850s. Latour and his companion, Father Vaillant, toil over the course of many years to build and develop the church there, strengthening the faith of Mexican and Indian alike. Latour's labor of love becomes a great cathedral in Santa Fe, completed before his death, while Vaillant is sent to spend the rest of his days working among the miners at Pike's Peak and throughout Colorado.This is a fairly simple tale of two very faithful men, whose love for their work created a legacy for each. Despite its simplicity, however, this novel approaches epic proportions, as the two men work side by side to, literally, convert the world. Over about thirty years and in an area covering thousands of square miles, these two Fathers fight almost alone to cleanse the church, purify the faith, and propagate their religion to everyone in the Diocese.This novel is a classic in Western literature, and definitely earns its place as one of the greatest stories of the American West. It belongs in the library of any fan of Western literature, or even American literature in general."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I ordered Death Comes for the Archbishop for my mother from Amazon. The edition she received was virtually unreadable--on every page many words on every line were run together, and this continued through the entire book. This edition had no orignial copyright date, no original date, no information from the Library of Congress."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This beautifully paced novel creates the atmosphere of the New Mexican desert and old Santa Fe through the observation of two French missionaries. It evokes this setting in beautiful language and through a series of character sketches. Slowly paced and poetic. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I just finished this book today. My wife belongs to a Book Club. This was their choice and they discussed it. Then my wife suggested I read it for myself. She reads about 5 books to my one, but she knew it would be MY kind of book! I loved the detailed descriptions of the New Mexico countryside. I looked up all the towns, mountain ranges and rivers in our big Atlas. I liked that it used a mixture of English, French and Spanish words without apology or too much translation. I Googled what I didn't know. It included some vignettes of the Native American culture of the time. It was tell-it-like-it-is in reference to the hardships, some cruelty, religious beliefs and interpretations, and a wonderful sense of love in more ways than several. The book traces the life of a Catholic Bishop and his Vicar from young men in their twenties until their deaths. The Bishop was assigned the diocese of New Mexico in the mid to late 1800s. He traveled enormous distances on horseback pulling a burro. It concludes with the railroad having been run to Santa Fe and how the transportation improvements also took away some of the adventure of the earlier travel experiences. There is no real plot. Somehow Willa Cather manages to evoke a multitude of scenes and stories that keeps one turning the pages. This is a real classic and I'm keeping it!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"One word in 4 is wrongly attached to another which makes the reading painful. A book like that should never have been out of the printshop. It is a shame because the story is good. It is also sadly evidence that Amazon do not check the books"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Purchased this book for a book study. Had been unable to find any copies locally. The book was very poorly printed. Each page had multiple words that were run together making it agravating to read. Lucked out by finding a copy locally. Did not send this one back because had thrown away all the paperwork and did not want to mess with it. Very disappointed that Amaazon would carry a product of such low quality."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Others here have already done a better job than I could of describing why this book is an example of great literature. I will add that as a young Catholic who spent a semester as a missionary on the Navajo reservation, it was quite uplifting to read such a well-written account of heroic virtue in the Southwest I remember so vividly. Reading about Chimayo, Shiprock, Canyon de Chelly and Santa Fe was a reunion with old friends. Archbishop Latour is a devout man, with flaws of his own, yet striving to serve the very different cultures of the Native Americans and the Mexicans. Some of Cather's sentences were like echoes in my soul of memories from this time. Here is what I want to remember:p. 50 \\"The Miracles of the Church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is ther about us always.\\"p. p. 203 \\"Once again this had been his month; his Patroness had given it to him, the season that had always meant so much in his religious life.\\"p. 217 My one complaint about this book is here. Cather writes for the most part with incredible insight into the Catholic faith, but here she misrepresents an important theological point. Catholics (if they are adhering to Church teaching) do NOT worship or adore Mary and do NOT view her as a female image of the Divine. We honor her for the pivotal role she played in bringing Christ to this world and for her continued intercession for us, her spiritual children. Only Christ's Heart is Sacred, Mary's Heart is referred to as the Immaculate Heart.p. 225 \\"Though the Bishop had worked with Father Joseph for twenty-five years now, he could not reconcile the contradictions of his nature. He simply accepted them, and, when Josph had been away for a long while, realized that he loved them all.\\" Our world today often does not understand spiritual friendship. The deep, fraternal love between Bishop Latour and Father Valiant is beautiful and inspiring.p. 232 \\"Elsewhere the sky is the roof of the world; but here the earth was the floor of the sky.\\"p. 273 \\"Something soft and wild and free, something that whispered to the ear on the pillow, lightened the heart, softly, softly picked the lock, slid the bolts, and released the prisioned spirit of man into the wind, into the blue and gold, into the morning, into the morning!\\"p. 279-The story of Bl. Junipero Serra's encounter with a family is awesome!p. 263 \\"I am enjoying to the full that period of reflection which is the happiest conclusion to a life of action.\\"Let us too lead lives of action!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Based on two real life French Catholic priests who were sent to the American Southwest in 1851, Willa Cather's 1927 novel captures the essence of their experiences. The Mexican people, formerly ruled by Spain, had been Catholic for centuries and welcomed the Bishop, Jean Marie Latour, and his Vicar, Father Joseph. As the two men travel through the countryside, it is clear that the landscape itself is a major character in this novel. Ms. Cather's descriptions brought me right there and I could almost breath the perfume of the earth as well as feel the impact of the mountains of rock and open desert.In what reads like a series of short stories, the priests travel throughout the area and meet a wide variety of people along the way. Always, their adventures take on mythical and religious significance, such as when Father Latour finds himself quite lost and then sees a juniper tree in the shape of a cross that leads him to food and shelter. Each of these stories has a crisis and each crisis is answered by a religious experience. This deepens the faith of the two priests who share their common religious feelings even though they have very different personalities.Ms. Cather had the uncanny ability to capture exactly what each character felt and let the reader experience it moment to moment. Her detailed descriptions are many faceted. For example she uses the character of Kit Carson to show both gentleness and compassion as well as vile cruelty to the Indians. Always, she just lays out the story and lets the reader make his or her own judgments.One of the problems I had with the book was my own desire to have the priests confront some difficult choice. That didn't happen. Their faith was always there. And, if there were any demons for them to conquer, it might have been a very subtle pride in what they were doing. In my mind, it made them just a little too perfect to identify with. This, however, was obviously not the author's intention which was to tell the tale as she saw it, filled with simple miracles and a loving testament to these two men whose impact can still be felt centuries later. It was a good book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"After reading with fascination the prior forty-plus reviews, they would appear to fall into three categories: juveniles who were forced to read the book for school, giving the book the lowest possible ratings. PC-types who judge both the writing of the book and the actions and beliefs of the characters by today's standards--such smug intolerance! Thirdly, those who love literature for its own sake, belonging to the community that has made this one of the classics in American writing.I admit, I am part of the third group. I fell in love with the writing of Cather as a teenager. To date, I have found no other author who can illustrate the great expanse of America and the vision of our ancestors in the way she could. Being set in New Mexico, the feeling of expanse of the American West permeates every page. I agree with another reviewer that this book is the writing equivalent of O'Keefe.While I can understand the young ones criticizing the book after being forced to read it, I don't understand adults who were dissatisfied. Was this their first Cather? Hopefully not (I'd recommend starting with &quot;Song of the Lark&quot; or &quot;O Pioneers&quot;. Her writing is not an unknown quantity.I've read the book many times over the past thirty years, and it's not a book for those who like to have their plots laid out for them. The plot is obscure, as Cather leaves the main story line with chapters diverging like side trails off a main path. Though not hard to read, it's not a book for those in a hurry. It's best being read in a comfy chair on a rainy afternoon next to a window. The sense of timeliness, of the stretching on into eternity, is seldom better conveyed than in this book.A hundred-plus years on, Willa Cather's writing remains the foremost example of American Midwestern writing. For those who love the narrative style, I'd recommend finding some of the writings of Sarah Orne Jewett, one of Cather's mentors. You will see the origin of some of Cather's style."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's works are more reminiscent of paintings than books. They are better described by words such a \`warm', \`vibrant' and \`rich' than by \`suspenseful', \`fascinating' or \`page-turner'. In \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" she does to New Mexico with black ink what Georgia O'Keefe needed a whole palette of colors to do.\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" is a multidimensional work skillfully woven together. On one hand Cather tells the story of New Mexico in the early days of its occupation by the United States and of the clash of two cultures trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to get along.On the other hand it is a portrait of a life. It is the story of Father Latour, a French priest sent to Santa Fe by the church to serve as an impartial intermediary between the protestant Anglo government and the Mexican Catholic population. He leaves behind all that is dear to him and dedicates himself to a life of service in a distant outpost far from what he must have considered civilization.While it's true that the book may be \`episodic' or \`anecdotal', few of us recall our own lives as a smooth, day-to-day rendering. What we remember are the high points and low points of our lives, and so it is here. This is, after all, the story of the life, and death, of a man.If you read books just to find out how they end, I'll save you the trouble. He dies. But if you read to experience the world through the heart and eyes of a great author, this book is for you. And once you read it you will find that, for you, Father Latour, hasn't really died. He'll stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"It is not my intention in this review to remark at any length on Cather's literary ability. Instead, I merely advise to anyone who plans on purchasing this book to purchase a different copy. This particular edition is poor in two ways.1. The only information the book offers other than the text itself is the publisher and date (Cassia Press, 2009) and that it was printed on 23 December 2009 in Lexington, KY. It fails even to give the year it was originally printed.2. More significantly, almost every single sentence in this edition has a typo where a space is omitted. The first two sentences of the prologue, for example, read: \\"One summer evening in the year 1848, three Cardinals and amissionary Bishop from America were dining together in the gardensof a villa in the Sabine hills, overlooking Rome. The villa wasfamous for the fine view from its terrace.\\" It makes it difficult to read. Horribly unprofessional."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"In the early 21st century, Willa Cather is perhaps best remembered for her chronicles of prairie lives, but one of her best works is DEATH COMES TO THE ARCHBISHOP, which depicts the southwest some 300 years after the Spaniards arrived, but barely into its American infancy. In the 1850s, there are no maps yet, and to the European eye, the landscape is a vast, primitive \\"geometric nightmare.\\" It is peopled by Mexicans and Native American Indians, and by a few rogue priests who so far from Rome and civilization have built fiefdoms and empires in the desert wilderness. It has been left so long untouched that Christian legends have grown up and become ancient alongside the lore of the Indians. By turns, the land and its people are hospitable and inspiring, misguided and harsh.In 1848, the church of Rome believes it is time to find a leader who will bring order to this region. Going against conventional wisdom, the leaders decide on a younger priest, Jean Marie Latour, a Frenchman currently stationed in Michigan, for the task. The first question that persists through this episodic story is, is he the right person? The book becomes a portrait of his steady cerebral yet compassionate leadership through the chaos he finds and the upheavals of an extraordinary period in history.The movement of the book zigzags among the people, both imagined and real (Kit Carson shows up), and the land. Especially, it looks at the land as it is shaped by belief-Christian, Indian and political. Cather does an extraordinary job of creating very vivid, complex characters. She also describes the land in a way that needs no photographs or maps to build it in our minds. Her prose is elegiac and yet nearly as clean as Hemingway's. There is power in it, and just when you think deep into the book that it is a series of sketches, it moves forward in the last part to the later 19th century and reveals how some characters' lives have taken some unexpected yet comprehensible curves and others were able to hold a course-the suspense was building all the time. In Latour there is the story of the human vs. the self, nature, other humans, and God. His personal story reflects the broader array of church and national history."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop is a deceptively simple but profound novel about two French missionaries in the Southwestern United States. These men are not terribly otherworldly and they are capable of enjoying good books, good wine, and good food. They are tough guys too, up to the task of traveling thousands of miles on horseback or facing down some bad guys. The religion they promote provides support and comfort to Mexicans, Indians, and some Anglo miners who need spiritual succor.The book presents us with several vignettes in the lives of these urbane priests, as well as some fables and Southwestern folklore. By living in harmony with God's law and the world he created, the men prosper. Eventually, they must part, and they must grow old and die. But death holds no horror for men like these who have spent their lives in service to others.Cather's writing is beautiful and direct. In the following passage, one of the priests and his friend spend several days traveling together:As Father Latour and Eusabio approached Albuquerque, they occasionally fell in with company; Indians going to and fro on the long winding trails across the plain, or up into the Sandia mountains. They had all of them the same quiet way of moving, whether their pace was swift or slow, and the same unobtrusive demeanor: an Indian wrapped in his bright blanket, seated upon his mule or walking beside it, moving through the pale new-budding sage-brush, winding among the sand waves, as if it were his business to pass unseen and unheard through a country awakening with spring.North of Laguna two Zuni runners sped by them, going somewhere east on \\"Indian business.\\" They saluted Eusabio by gestures with the open palm, but did not stop. They coursed over the sand with the fleetness of young antelope, their bodies disappearing and reappearing among the sand dunes, like the shadows that eagles cast in their strong, unhurried flight.Her book also contains some beautiful ideas. In this passage, the two priests discuss Our Lady of Guadalupe:\\"Where there is great love there are always miracles,\\" [Father Latour] said at length. \\"One might almost say that an apparition is human vision corrected by divine love. I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I see you through my affection for you. The Miracles of the Church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.\\"This book has it all: fine writing, adventure, and some lessons for living. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather, one of the best American novelists ever, turned her sights on the southwest frontier in 'Death Comes for the Archbishop'. It has been described as a quiet, gentle novel and a story of faith. It is that, but so much more.First, this small book defies categorization. Is it a generic novel that just happens to be set in New mexico, or is it historical fiction, ala Michener? Perhaps it is the barely novelized biography of the real first Archbishop of Santa Fe, Jean Baptiste Lamy (Bishop LaTour in the novel).Whatever the category, this well-written book uses simple, evocative prose to bring the main characters to life. You will feel youy really know Bishop Latour, his assistant Father Valliant, his native guide Jacinto, Kit Carson, and so many more.Cather's sense of time and place is perfect! I live right where this book is set and let me say that she has every detail down pat: the names of the old Spanish families, the quirks of the locals, the nature of Catholicism in New Mexico, the food, the topography, etc. are all just right. Most of all, Cather has, in prose, somehow captured the lighting and color which have made New Mexico \\"the land of enchantment.\\"This tale of a devout French priest sent to bring a neglected land back into the fold, could not be more authentic. A testament to a good man's life and a great writer's pen"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This book is the best description of the near absurd task that European missionaries faced in the American West. Willa Cather gives a sympathetic (and historically accurate) account of two French priests who are given orders to help the secluded diocese of Santa Fe, NM.The atmosphere of Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Tucson was unique on the american west. These were cities with centuries of Catholic culture resulting from early Spanish influence, but their extreme isolation made them a true oasis of civilization. The two main characters are very lonely on this foreign frontier, and the task they were sent to accomplish (tame renegade priests and rejuvenate the catholic culture) seems impossible due to language, cultural, and ideological differences.Fortunately, the two priests compliment each other very well, and enjoy some truly interesting adventures. Issues of Indian relations, slavery, lawlessness, heresy, and isolation are expertly dealt with in Willa Cather's narrative. This has been described as stylistically her best book. Willa Cather loved this book and spent years in the southwest researching the terrain and characters. It will not disappoint.If you find this story interesting, you may also be interested in books about Padre Kino of Tucson."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"In studying the history of the American West, I've come across a few real gems; Stegner's Beyond the Hundredth Meridian, The Journals of John Wesley Powell, Fremont's journals of his surveys, several books by Ed &quot;Vulture Breath&quot; Abbey, just to name a few. &quot;Archbishop&quot; is on the same shelf with these other classics in my bookcase.

French Jesuit woven into the fabric of New Mexican lore as he rubs soldiers with scout and Indian killer Kit Carson, jousts with the Catholic poo-bah in Taos, Father Antonio Jose Mart&iacute;nez, and others peopling the time and region.The title is a misnomer. The story is one of LaTour's entire missionary life, with memories of a youth in France thrown in for some Old World/New World contrast. His death comes only at the end, and without much surprise.This yarn is episodic, and moves from the mid-1800s to the later ones in fits and starts, zig-zags, backs-and-forths, but for all that, has a sense of being at least mildly woven.It is not a classic narrative that develops and reaches a climax. It is, simply, the life of a man moving among the notable and not so notable of old New Mexico, expending energy in his particular calling, gathering experience and enduring hardship until his own ending, unhappy as it is for us all.highwayscribery took \\"Death Comes to the Archbishop\\" on a recent trip to New Mexico and it served, eighty-something years later, as a marvelous tour guide because the state's history is hammered into (and out of) its landscape and everywhere places or features detailed in Cather's book jump out at you.Her descriptions of the land are dead-on. Early in the story, LaTour approaches his destination. The reader is with him:\\"As the wagons went forward and the sun sank lower, a sweep of red carnelian-coloured hills lying at the foot of the mountains came into view; they curved like two arms about a depression in the plain; and in that depression was Santa F&eacute;, at last! A thin wavering adobe town...green plaza...at one end of a church with two earthen towers that rose high above the flatness.

When we drove and looked out of the car windows, everything except the road itself, looked as it had in Willa Cather's novel. It was inspiring to meet with the devoted members of the parish in Santa Rosa, some of whose ancestors had been baptized by Father Lamy, the original 'archbishop' in the title."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This book has long been recommended reading for those visiting the Land of Enchantment. Using the true story of Father Lamy (Father Latour in the book) as the vehicle, Cather takes us on a tour (hence, La-tour?!) of many of New Mexico's most popular destinations -- Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Abiquiu,and Laguna. Along the way, we're treated to a few legends to help keep our attention.A word of caution, while I was myself visiting Santa Fe's famous St. Francis Cathedral in 1998, founded by Father Lamy (Latour), I overheard a tour guide say to one of the members of her company that many of the things said about Father Latour in Cather's book were not true of Father Lamy in real life. Cather evidently didn't feel bound by historical accuracy. No matter, the book is an easy read and does introduce the reader to both New Mexico's people and special place in history."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Death Comes to the Arch Bishop is a tightly woven historical novel about the rejuvenation of Catholicism in the newly acquired New Mexico Territory. Apostolic Vicar Jean Marie Latour, a 35 year old French missionary with nine years of service in Canada on the shores of Lake Huron among the Indians and French settlers, has been sent as temporary Arch Bishop to bring order to this huge sprawling territory inhabited mostly by Mexicans and Indians.Willa Cather writes precious prose that is frequently poetic. Her tale is spun against a landscape pastiche of the old South West, but some of Cather's most romantic descriptions are of sensory perceptions of the epicenter of Western civilzation that appear in the Prologue that sets the stage for her story in the Sabine hills of Rome. Three Cardinals meet at the villa of Cardinal de Allende, a sophisticated, rich, provincial Spaniard who knows of the New World only from reading James Fennimore Cooper (in the original English he is careful to point out) and who expresses the whimsical hope that Latour has eye for art so that he might perchance recover the El Greco de Allande's grandfather had given to a Spanish missionary to this same territory a century ago:\\"The villa was famous for its fine view from its terrace. The hidden gardenin which the four men sat at table lay some twenty feet below the south endand was a mere shelf of rock, overhanging a steep declivity planted withvineyards***********there was nothing to arrest the eye until it reachedRome itself*************The sun was still good for an hour of splendor, andacross the shining folds of the country the low profile of the city barelyfretted the skyline--indistinct except for the dome of St. Peters, bluishgrey like the flattened top of a great balloon, just a flash of copper lighton its soft metalic surface. The Cardinal had an eccentric preference forbeginning his dinner at this time in the late afternoon, when the vehemenceof the sun suggested motion. The light was full of action and had apeculiar quality of climax--of splendid finish. It was both intense and soft,with a ruddiness of much-multiplied candlelight, an aura of red in itsflames. It bored into the ilex trees, illuminated their mahogany andblurring their dark foliage; it warmed the bright green of the orangetrees and the rose of the oleander blooms to gold; sent congested spiralpatterns quivering over the damask and the plate and crystal\\"These Cardinals were men of the world, but it is plain that they were provincial and would never have dreamed of missionary work in the New World---de Allende's family home in Spain housed that country's most prominent collection of Spanish art (some El Grecos remained) and he and his peers were quite content to get no closer to New Mexico than a reading of James Fennimore Cooper would take them. The glorious setting in the Sabine hills of Rome stands in stark counterpoint to the New Mexico desert where we find our hero Bishop Latour roaming without water and coming upon a tree that looks like a cross, where he prays moments before stumbling upon an oasis. Rejected by the Spanish clergy for lack of documentation of his authority over the diocese, he had set out on a 1500 mile journey to Mexico to enlist the support of the Bishop of Durango in his bid for hegemony over a diocese controlled by native priests not enthused by the prospect of liturgical and doctrinal control from Rome.Latour has been sent to bring order to a diocese where liturgy and church doctrine are but a distant memory among much of its faithful, where priests have married and where Indians converted to Catholicism retain pagan customs---as Cardinals de Aliened put it, \\"Oh, the Germans classify, but French arrange!\\" Latour did arrange, but it was a long hard slog, and he had to bring all of his skills to bear to do it. He and his countryman and friend, Father Valliant, travelled the vast expanse of the diocese on the backs of two mules that Valliant had acquired from a rich rancher in much the same manner that de Allende's grandfather had been induced to part with his El Greco for the benefit of this outlier diocese. Latour went on to build the cathedral in Santa Fe over a period of 16 years and Valliant parted from his friend and mentor to became the Bishop of Colorado when gold was found there. But, the heart of the story is Cather's vivid description of the landscape of the territory in which the characters play out their roles and the trials and hardships that these two dedicated missionary priests endured as they baptized and married the faithful, reorganized the clergy and financed their dioceses in the wilderness. Along the way we encounter Indian legends, Kit Carson, mesas and pueblos, canyons, colorful and decadent clergy, noble Indian chiefs and a plethora of interesting local folks like Dona Isabella, who has to be coaxed by Latour to sacrifice her vanity and admit under oath to being 53 years old to save her inheritance (of which the archdiocese would get the remainder interest upon her death) in a will contest brought by her husband's brothers.In the end of course, as the title predicts, the Cardinal dies after retiring and deciding not to return to his native France. He stays \\"in New Mexico because the air is young and in New Mexico he always awoke a young man; not until he rose to shave did he realize that he was growing older. \\"Cather's prose is again poetic as she lays the Cardinal to rest, and one wonders upon reading it how long she labored over these lovely sentences.\\"That air would disappear from the whole earth in time; but not in his dayHe did not know just when it had become so necessary to him, but he hadcome back to die in exile because of it. Something wild and free, somethingthat whispered in the ear on the pillow, lightened the heart, softly, softlypicked the lock, slid the bolts, and released the prisoned spirit of man intothe wind, into the blue and gold, into the morning, into the morning!\\"Cather's elegant style and fascinating story combine to make a very rare piece of literature that defies classification and is a delight to read.like flag"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I wish I had read the readers' comments before I bought this edition.

This book is about a French priest, Father Latour and his partner, Father Vaillant. Father Latour is instructed to take over the position of archbishop in the New Mexico territory during the period following the Civil War.This territory had many renegade (and not so godly) priests that had lost touch with Rome and had adopted pagan beliefs. In addition, the area was huge and made it a risky proposition for the priests to visit distant parishes. Together, Father Latour and Father Vaillant discover this new world and run into many challenges as they encounter a variety of characters. Ultimately, Father Latour and his wisdom make a difference in this territory that is lasting, even after his death.This book was similar to Larry McMurtry's, Lonesome Dove, in the fact that each book gives the reader a very close-up view of what the west was like in that period of time. Latour's experiences are chronicled in several novellas, some narrating about miracles. This book was pretty impressive and left me with a greater appreciation for what the missionaries went through when the New Mexico territory was being settled."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"When I first moved to New Mexico, I was told that two books were prerequisite for anybody new to the state: John Nichol's The Milagro Beanfield War and this book by Willa Cather. I first read Nichol's book and loved it, but procrastination set in and it has taken me almost twenty years to get to Death Comes for the Archbishop. After finishing the novel, I am uncertain as to whether its merits are in line with its reputation.The novel is based (some would say loosely) on the life of Archbishop Lamy and his efforts to increase the authority of the Roman Catholic Church in New Mexico after the Territory was ceded to the United States. As such, Cather paints the picture of a missionary church on the American frontier making in-roads into the native Mexican and Indian populations while increasing the reputation of the new Diocese in Santa Fe. The story telling is straightforward, written in unabashedly simple language with hagiographic tinges. Unfortunately, the characters of the novel are never developed (with the possible exception of Father Vaillant) and remain as either stolid churchmen or stereotyped parishioners. Indeed, the main character of the novel, Bishop Latour, is more similar to the statue of Lamy in front of the Santa Fe Cathedral than to any flesh and blood model.There are passages of profound beauty in the novel, especially when the author is expressing her own feelings about the special and un-definable qualities found in New Mexico. In these instances, the reader gets a vivid picture of the wide spaces, mountains and light that have captivated visitors and residents for centuries. However, I found the book to be episodic to a fault. The action jumps about, chronology is all but dismissed, and the novel never achieves a tightness which characterizes the great works; instead of a great novel, I was reminded of the &quot;picturesque&quot; novels so popular in 18th Century England."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Do not buy this book from this publisher.

Naughty publisher!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This book has been recommended to me many times, and I have finally read it. Well worth reading. The language is beautiful.

I would love to hear this one read out loud... the imagery is so vivid and poetic."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's descriptions of the region paints a picture in your mind. Her nonjudgmental portrayal of the characters in historical context is refreshing & presents an honest look at the events that shaped the southwest. I wish I had read this book prior to visiting Santa Fe."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I have a strange system of reading, and in that system, I had no desire to read this book and wound up loving it. After the convoluted prose of Thomas Pynchon and the schlock value of Sandford, it was a welcome change.With a very simple and straightforward prose, Cather has crafted a quietly beautiful story of respect and love in a a barren and foreign world: New Mexico from the late 1850's to 1888, an unforgiving landscape that no longer exists in the roughness long since past. What is amazing is that Cather represents the reality of this hardscrabble existence without the overtly depicted violence and madness of Cormac MCCarthy's Blood Meridian. With the primary characters being Catholic priests, there is also none of the nihilism of the former book either.One of my initial qualms with the book is that it felt like nine very closely related short stories all dealing with the same primary characters of Latour and Vaillent. It jumps time between chapters and these time jumps seem to have no real rhyme or reason, but upon reflection, the book handles time as a fluid thing. It is dealing with a long ago past and the events seem to swim in and out of the consciousness like memories.My other issue was the lack of a sustained narrative. There is no quest but Latour's constant desire to engender himself to his diocese and eventually build his cathedral. But perhaps that is part of the draw of the story for me, the seemingly ho-hum existence of orinary men in an extraordinary environment that turns them into giants as a result of their will to continue on to their goals.An interesting part of the writing is the way characters spring up and dissappear out of nowhere, back story peppered through out the novel, all without sense of pretense or ulterior motive. Indeed, Cather saves the best for last. The final chapter (Death comes to the Archbishp), sees her at the top of her powers. The section is an emotional powerhouse and reveals the true difference between Joseph and Jean and their legacies, but it also gives as an understanding of what Latour's true gift to his world was: Joseph Vaillent himself.If you can get past the Catholic outlook of the primary characters (understandable but so hard to understand: eg their worship of Mary)and the bit of loving superiority that the Bishop and Vicar carry about themselves, the seemingly disjointed time slips and strange narrative have the effect of the bittersweet act of life passing so very long ago. It exists now as the remembrances of dead men and women who tell the story through time and the words of Willa Cather. A dream come to life.The ending is heartshatteringly beautiful (though the last paragraph feels tacked on) and brings the whole book together. I was glad to have read it and hope to read more of Willa Cather in the coming years.Death Comes to the Archbishop is character study int the life of a good man and the even stronger man he helped release upon the new world. We get a remarkable look into the foibles and doubts of a man of extreme faith- a faith that sustains him through the heat and cold of his adopted land all the way to the respect of the world and peoples around him."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Relish this wonderful novel slowly, like a ride on a good mule through the beautiful desert at sundown."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather was born in 1873, and the majority of the adventures of this book would coincide with the pioneering peers of her parents. The protagonist of this book is French born and American bound priest/Bishop: Father Latour whose adventures occur from the middle 19th century to 1888.The priesthood was relished and loved in those days. Latour is a calming and placable fellow. He is honest as the day is long. He is, unlike others around him, celibate and obedient to the church - whether its laws be appropriate or not.The amount of traveling on mules, the hard adventures to other civilizations and cultures, and the torrid natural elements fighting the priests are seemingly insurmountable. But, the priest, who becomes a bishop who later becomes an archbishop, lasts like the Energizer Bunny. He keeps moving, well beyond his retirement years. Having traveled to and fro by the least rapid of transportation modes.Latour may be outdone by comrade Joseph Valliant - who is called Father Joseph or Father Vaillant in the book. That man, small in size and thin as a rail, never stays put. On order by his comrade, he ventures about in nomadic style preaching to the Indians and Mexicans, delivering sacrament and church baptism and other rites to better their souls. And, in certain passages, the intellectual Latour - who sees Valliant as his closest and best friend - acknowledges his friend's superior constitution and abilities. Each has a strength and weakness. But, overall, the Bishop sees Vaillant as the superior man of the cloth.I admit this book impressed me in that there is little discussion of women. Instead, it is a tale. A greatly told tale. Of men in a man's world. And, all written by a woman. The ability to cross gender lines always impresses me - like Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", Iris Murdoch's \\"Under the Net\\", or even Alexander McCall Smith's \\"Ladies' Detective Agency\\" series.This was one of those books assigned to my parents as required reading. And, I am sure it was read, but with some disrespect to the teacher who made the assignment. Even though Kit Carson is referred to in the book, there is nothing exciting about what he does within the pages to lure the attention of young boys.Although it is about priests in the virginal new land, this book is without obfuscation, without much symbolism, without most of literature's cute tools. This is a tale, this is allegory, this is fine story telling. Something which was more common in the time that this book was written and something which is unfortunately becoming less common today."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"As a lover of the Southwest, I found it to be a fascinating and soothing depiction of the harsh landscapes and primitive lifestyles of the era. Written without a central plot, in the style of a journal, each story flowed easily into the next. It was a page-turner, but easy to put a bookmark into when it was time to fix dinner, knowing it could easily be resumed without having to refresh my memory regarding a plot. Good spiritual insights. I'll probably read it again the next time I'm sitting on the beach."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I recently purchased the Cassia Press 2009 printing of Death Comes for the Archbishop. Many sentences have words strung together. Very careless typesetting. I bought the book to give as a gift, but I am going to throw it away. Willa Cather would be horrified to see what happened to her work in this particular edition. Amazon.com ought to be more careful in who does their printing. The problem is, though, that customers cannot know in advance if the printing of the work has been carelessly done.Let's hope for higher quality next time....Joseph R OrnigWaukegan, Illinois"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Death Comes for the Archbishop is a unique reading experience in that the plot is almost hidden from the reader and Cather uses both landscape and the passage of time to give the novel its underlying structure. I know this sounds odd but the novel is written in very direct language in chapters that are almost short stories with a common set of characters. Yet the strength of her descriptions of New Mexico between 1850 and 1900 and her careful and subtle ability to express the slow passage of time serve as the underlying template on which the novel is built.There is very little 'page turner' tension and the characters undergo maturity but no great change in insights. In fact the two main characters, Bishop Letour and Father Vaillant, are guided by a set of moral principles and spiritual maturity with which they encounter every human interaction and natural (lost in the desert, snowstorms) challenge.There were several chapters and incidents that illustrated the differences between the upper middle class and scholarly Bishop Letour and his life long friend, Father Vaillant, a French farmer's son who totally exemplifies the concept of faith into action.Father Vaillant was always willing to undergo hardship to bring the comfort and challenge of Christianity to those in need. He goes into the Native Pueblos that had not seen a priets in many years. He goes into the new territory acquired by the US Government in southern New Mexico (the Gadsden Purchase) and wild west gold rush Denver.Bishop Letour on the other hand is more contemplative and strategic. This is especially true of his handling of the Spanish priests that came under his supervision when he came to New Mexico in 1851. These priests had been unsupervised for so long that many had common law wives and children. Many had grown rich as cattle farmers, land owners, and merchants. Father Letour was in the position of having been given responsibility but he was thousands of miles from central authority in Rome. He had responsibility but little resources. He eventually brings these priets into line, but he is very strategic in the process, not trying to take them all on at once.Kit Carson is a complex character in the story. At times he displays considerable refinement of character as the husband of a Native woman and a half-breed daughter. Then at others he takes on the role of the Indian Killer. The novel firmly falls on the side of the ill-treated and misused Native People of New Mexico.I once heard that there were two approaches to character development in fiction. The first type is those novels who's characters are shaped by the incidents of the story so that the characters are not the same men/women they were at the beginning. The second is those novels who's characters are of such strong character that they undergo a range of incidents, hardships, and challenges and yet remain true to an inner strength and conviction. Death Comes for the Archbishop is certainly a fine example of the latter type of novel.I also once heard there were only two real plot lines in novels. One is \\"a stranger comes to town\\" and the other is \\"someone goes on a trip\\". Death Comes for the Archbishop is actually a good mixture of both of these plot lines. The Bishop and the Vicar come together to New Mexico and must learn many lessons about the people, the tribes, the elements, and the landscape. Yet they must move from Santa Fe to address the spiritual needs of the New Mexicans and thus these many trips make up many of the chapters of the novel.Since passage of time in a slowly moving landscape is the primary structure on which the story/incidents are integrated; I suggest reading this novel slowly, calmly, and reflectively - as it was probably intended to be read."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop is habitually underrated by scholars of the American novel. While it lacks the compelling story of other of Cather's works, such as My Antonia, Death is a subtle episodic work that sneaks up on the reader both intellectually and emotionally under the radar.A chronicle of the career of the first missionary Catholic bishop of New Mexico, the novel blends subtle description with a narrative style that might be characterized as third person travel diary. Symbolically, the travails of Bishop Latour and Father Vaillant are an abbreviated version of the history of the Roman Catholic church and, more broadly, the spread of Christianity itself. The opening description of the Bishop's wandering in the desert may be compared to Christ's forty days in the wilderness, and the cathedral Bishop Latour wants to raise is a projection of the spread of the Catholic faith in New Mexico territory.The Bishop symbolizes the contemplative bent of the Church and the Thomistic tradition, while Father Vaillant represents the other aspect of Catholicism, its missionary zeal in the New World. The setting of the book is a microcosm of the world itself, desperately in need of salvation yet capable of bestowing, as Bishop Latour comes to realize, the gift of renewal and youth impossible in the more structured and jaded Old World, as in the prologue set in the Vatican.The rather mysterious title of the novel underscores one of its major thematic preoccupations: that we live in a state of constant interaction with life as it comes to us while still trying to maintain in our minds a picture of life as we would like it to be. The Bishop's story is told as a series of vignettes: our lives are made up of the small, commonplace, daily events we encounter. As the Bishop himself observes, he dies of having lived his life, an emphasis on the limited span of our lives and the manner in which we approach the challenges we encounter.This is a worthwhile read and a commendable exercise in subtlety. The scope of Cather's historical research is impressive."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"A new Bishop, Father Jean Marie Latour, is sent by Rome to spread Chrisitanity through new territory purchased in the Americas as part of the Gadsden Purchase. Father Latour takes with him his close friend, Father Jospeh Vaillant, to help with this cause. Latour is handsome, non-judgemental, amiable, keeps himself in check; Vaillant is his opposite, being not so pleasant of face but very very sociable and incredibly strong in faith.There isn't much of a plot for this novel. It's more of a photo album or a series of episodes about the unexplored Western United States. The reader sees what the territory of New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico were like before trains, when the desert was both a beautiful and a harsh place. And, the reader learns about the people living there, from the French Fahters sent to Chrisitanize the Indians to the Mexican and Spanish settlers to the native Indians who are untrusting of white men and still hold to their gods. And the reader sees it all through the eyes of Father Latour so we get his wonder and awe at this strange, new world into which he's been sent to spread the word of God."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I recently read My Antonia. This was my second novel by Willa Cather and was equally enjoyable and thought provoking. This novel beautifully illustrates how the Southwest was shaped by the Catholic Church and heroic missionaries such as the emotional and intuitive Father Valliant and the gentle and cerebral Father Latour . My youth was spent in Colorado, but nothing has taught me more about the forces (natural and human) which shaped this region than Death Comes for the Archbishop. Just as Father Latour builds his simple yellow cathedral one stone at a time, missionaries like Latour and Valliant built the Catholic Church in the Southwest one soul at a time over their lifetimes. Through this lifetime of work they became inextricably attached to the people and the landscape. This is a profoundly beautiful book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"In my AP English class, we were made to read many books. Some I liked, but many I didn't. This was my favorite. A great picture of Southwestern missionary work and the Southwest in general. I at first thought the book would be unenjoyable and bland, but it was great! Definitely the strongest of Willa Cather's that I have read, and well worth the time. Add it to my pile to carry with me at college!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"\\"Death Comes to the Archbishop\\" is one of the most moving books I have ever experienced.In many ways the American Southwest has never been protrayed better than in this Willa Cather.

Magical in its evoking of the American Frontier. Magical in its representation of a humble servant of God. Magical in Cather's language and images. Magical in its use of language.One of my favorite novels. My introduction to Cather and her unique style. Whatever happened to writers like this?Any Cather book is also a treat in audio forms.

The book is episodic in structure, each chapter a discrete, self-contained passage, only loosely connected to the others.In her narrative, Cather cleverly turns Latour's mission purpose upside down and inside out. He has come to bring God to this wild, distant corner of the world. But although Cather depicts Latour respectfully -- as a godly, sincere, patient and resourceful man -- one is left with the feeling that this desert land brought God to him, rather than the other way around.For example, Cather lavishes her most exalting prose, not on the church and its benevolence, but on the wonders of nature - of rock, of water, and most vividly of light - especially at the hours of the day when the shadows grow long, and the setting sun drenches the land and sky in rich, vibrant color.The introduction takes place on the terrace of a Cardinal's home in Italy, where Cather directs the reader's attention to the light of the dying day, \\"both intense and soft, with a ruddiness as of much-multiplied candlelight, an aura of red in its flames. It bored into the ilex trees, illuminating their mahogany trunks and blurring their dark foliage; it warmed the bright green of the orange trees and the rose of the oleander blooms to gold.\\" Cather very deliberately echoes this image in the first full chapter of the book, when Father Latour is received with unexpected Christian charity far out in the primitive village of Hidden Water, New Mexico. \\"The Bishop sat a long time by the spring, while the declining sun poured its beautifying light over those low, rose-tinted houses and bright gardens.\\"I was struck by the frequency with which Cather seemed to sanctify the desert landscape, even to the point where vainglorious intrusions by the European church are depicted almost as a defilement. When Father Latour climbs to the village of Acoma, high up on a giant flat rock, he is offended by the intrusive presence of the mission church there. \\". . . it was more like a fortress than a place of worship. That spacious interior depressed the Bishop as no mission church had done before. . . When he blessed them and sent them away, it was with a sense of inadequacy and spiritual defeat. . . What need had there ever been for this great church at Acoma? . . . The more that Father Latour examined this church, the more he was inclined to think that Fray Ramirez. . . was not altogether innocent of worldly ambition, and that they built for their own satisfaction, rather than according to the needs of the Indians.\\"Contrast that with Cather's later praise of the native dwellings, which she finds beautiful precisely because they minimally disrupt the landscape: \\"It was the Indian manner to vanish into the landscape, not to stand out against it. The Hopi villages that were set upon rock mesas were made to look like the rock on which they sat, were imperceptible at a distance. The Navajo hogans, among the sand and willows, were made of sand and willows. None of the pueblos would at that time admit glass windows into their dwellings. The reflection of the sun on the glazing was to them ugly and unnatural - even dangerous.\\"I found myself wondering throughout the book just who, more literally, was saving whom. Father Latour comes to New Mexico to save souls, but when he and Father Vaillant unwittingly stumble into the home of a murderer, their lives are saved by the silent warning of the man's Native wife, who makes a silent slashing motion across her throat and clandestinely points them to the exit. Later, too, when Latour is caught in a terrible snowstorm, his guide Jacinto saves him by leading him to a secret cave, sacred to the locals.Early in the book, Father Latour and Father Vaillant are dining together over soup made by the Vaillant, a pleasant import of one of the creature comforts of their former lives in France. Over that dinner, Vaillant begs Latour not to take him any further out into the wild than they have already gone. But by the end of the book, Father Vaillant is fully comfortable making his home in this country, spreading the Word on horseback, and sleeping under the stars. And when it is time for father Latour himself to die, he wants to return, not to France, but to Santa Fe, where he first established his mission church and, apparently, found his heavenly purpose.Those of you who relish the incomparable beauty of the canyons, mountains, mesas, and colors of America's desert southwest will respond intensely to Cather's vivid, painterly depictions of it. Instead of depicting, the world of nature as a harsh punishment to mankind after being cast out of the edenic garden (as traditional Christianity often did), she does quite the opposite, lending a sublime aspect to Latour's journey through the wild.Finally, to those students here who were forced to read this book for school and found it boring, allow me this observation: it's perfectly fine for your mind to wander on occasion when reading this book. Indeed, it's not a book for white-knuckled, gripping plot development, but for meandering reflection, much like a walk through the canyon country depicted in the novel, liberated from the sensory overload of so-called civilization. Give yourself time and space to visualize the scenes, to see the light of a desert dusk, to smell the juniper bushes, and for your mind to roam around aimlessly for a bit. In this book, the earthly journey means just as much as the heavenly destination."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is a novel for the discerning. The deceptively simple story line is sparingly told with an unerring authorial instinct for the essential idea or experience. That Willa Cather, a Protestant woman raised on the Nebraska prairie, could so movingly render the interior lives and experiences of two relatively cosmopolitan European Italian priests bringing the long reach of the Church of the Vatican to Hispanic and Indian peoples in the remote Southwestern frontier of 19th Century New Mexico, is a testimony to the power of the human imagination and to Cather's finely honed skills as a writer. One may lament the passing of a popular aesthetic that can comprehend, much less appreciate, either the thread of the story or the magnitude of her achievement. This finely drawn novel captured my imagination in a way few books ever have. If you are prepared for a work with the subtly emotive power to draw you into another place, time and life, I commend it to you. If not, please pass on by (and spare us any deprecating reviews). The fictional history of the West has suffered since the loss of Willa Cather."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Cather's historical novel is as serious and as peaceful as an amber-into-rust-into-rose sunset. The landscape itself has the richest characterization. She has crafted her prose in such a way as to give the land its own vitality and presence. If you like landscape art; if you stop at Scenic Overlooks on the highway; if you ever like to walk in the woods, the hills--just because--read this novel.Archbishop Latour, a Frenchman, has taken on the missionary work of creating a diocese in New Mexico Territory in the 1850's. Throughout his life's ministry, he encounters rogues, blackguards, ragmuffins, scalliwags, and ruthless soldiers, and then some simple saints, some lasting friends, and finally, death. When death finally does come, it brings his own peace, the restitution of justice.Cather writes lugubriously, moving from one anecdotal story to the next. But it is all against the backdrop of the land; when she is finished, the tapestry of the whole appears.Nice."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Cormac McCarthy and Willa Cather are two of my favorite authors. Both, to me, tell great stories and develop time and setting in a remarkable way. McCarthy writes about the arid Southwest, and I am familiar with Cather's autobiographical Nebraska novels. Clean, spare, descriptive writing. I like that. I have just read Death Comes to the Archbishop. Just two years ago I spent one month camping with my daughter on the Colorado Plateau. My daughter who grew up in Switzerland had never seen the Southwest. By sheer coincidence we visited much of the places mentioned in the novel. We visited the town Zuni which is just within New Mexico at the Arizona line, most of the Navajo reservation and some of the Hopi reservation, which is ensconced within the Navaho reservation in Northeast Arizona. We peered into the Canyon de Chelly also in Northeast Arizona. I applaud Cather for giving flesh and history to this part of the world. First off, how much do any of us know about the non-\\"American\\" history of the Western States? Her description of the impoverished yet devout Mexican's of the mid-1800s is remarkable. To me she captures the awesome beauty and likewise danger of the geographical, arid place: the danger being at times too much and more often too little water. This Cather novel might be too much for high school reading, as the time and place is perhaps somewhat obscure and the pace and nonlinear narrative is not what younger people are familiar with. It is not my favorite Cather novel, yet, but it is a part of the body of work of one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather was fascinated with the role that the Catholic church played in the shaping of America, especially among the western settlers and Indians. She drew upon real-life missionary priests for \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\", a book that is more a series of vignettes than a novel. The religious lives of the two priests, Jean Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant, are the centerpoint of a narrative that revolves around the land and the cultures of the native tribes.Both priests from France, Latour and Vaillant are sent to New Mexico to build up the church and to rein in priests who have abused their privilege. Both men are paragons of virtue, while distinctly different in personality and the way they reach out to the native population. Among their many years in the American southwest they must endure the hardships of life that the climate demands, and find a way to respect the Indian traditions while bringing Christianity to the people. Along the way their lives are enriched by the throngs of colorful people they meet (including Kit Carson) and the miraculous stories of faith and survival in that primitive land.\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" is relatively fast-paced, although a little choppy. Cather moves from one account to another with little transition between them. The title is a bit misleading, setting a tone of impending doom that is not present in the book. Through these stories, however; one gains insight into the trying lives of two priests who were following their purpose to serve God. It is a remarkable portrait of faith and endurance, tested time and again only to always make it through the fire."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's self-described narrative, \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" tells the story of the Southwestern U.S. at the middle of the 19th century, and the epic story of two Catholic priests who transformed it. Cather changes style from a traditional novel and tells her story in a detached, biographical manner, yet she manages to capture the aura and beauty of the Southwest and its people.At the onset of the novel, a French priest is wandering through the desert, lost and dying of thirst. Yet, a \\"miracle\\" happens, as he finds a hidden village with an underground water supply and is saved. Although this may be the first miracle for Jean Latour, his life is full of small miracles which help to transform the native Indians and Mexicans into devout Catholics. Indeed, the miracles that Cather describes through a rich tapestry of legends and stories, are those which happen to the poorest and most destitute in the unforgiving desert. Cather seems to imply that one need not be rich and powerful to be a recipient of one of God's countless miracles.When Latour first arrives in New Mexico in 1850, the Mexicans and Indian converts have corrupted the Catholic teachings, although they are devout. Indeed, hundreds of years have passed since they've had the rigid conformity of the Catholic church, as the priests currently in place are corrupt and sin-ridden. However, though they may not follow strict Catholic doctrine, the Mexicans are devout and ready to be molded by the right priest. It is Valliant and Latour who prove to be the \\"shepherds\\" to these \\"lost sheep\\" of God.Throughout the novel, Jean Latour, who eventually becomes an archbishop, is compared with Joseph Valliant, Latour's colleague and (very) close friend. While Latour is stoic and introverted, Valliant is outgoing and confrontational. In fact, Latour believes that Valliant is the better priest, for despite his ailing health, Valliant braves the elements and brings the desert's inhabitants back to God. And even though he may change dioceses often, he is always up to the challenge, even in the outlaw west of Gold rush Colorado in the 1850s and 1860s. Although they may have different styles, both Latour and Valliant prove irreplaceable as their valiant efforts transform the Southwest into a hotbed of Catholic fervor.Cather's vivid descriptions of the landscape help to bring this novel to life. Sweeping panoramas and mysterious canyons are brought forth in descriptive, imaginative language. The characters are given extra dimension through past antidotes and tales which give them a more personal, humanistic character. Although this may not quite be Cather's best novel, it is still a captivating tale and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is Willa Cather's superb novel about Bishop Jean Latour and his vicar Fr. Joseph Vaillant who come to New Mexico to re-establish the position and authority of the Church which has fallen sadly into neglect. (Both fictional characters are based on the historical Bishop Lamy and Fr. Machebeuf.) Latour, a Jesuit, is chosen by Church officials in Rome for his mission because of his moral fortitude and unbreakable will, and his success comes mainly from his unshakable confidence and quiet example. The evil he must overcome is represented by three old priests in New Mexico, one sodden with greed, another with lust, the third with creature comforts. Both Latour and Vaillant, who inspire each other, perform lasting and important services: building churches, converting the Hopi and Navajo, and providing the spiritual guidance and rock-solid fortitude to keep their communities on the straight and narrow. Cather utilizes a matter-of-fact and sparse style in relating her story; it's a most effective technique, but not very dramatic. Inspiring and noteworthy in every way."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Having read this book many years ago, I was anxious to read it again on my visit to Santa Fe and environs in October 06. It was a pleasure to read Cathers prose and steep myself in the history of the places we were visiting.

There are certain book titles which, upon seeing, compel me to pick up the book and read it, no matter the content, and &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; was one of them. I was expecting to read a dark, gothic novel with deep, philosophical discussions about the nature of good and evil, perhaps with Death and the Archbishop sitting down to a game of chess or something. Instead what do I get? Some thinly veiled Christian dogma set in an &quot;Oh, California&quot; textbook.But here's the strange part... I actually LIKED this book. For no tangible reason, I couldn't put it down. Now, to reiterate, this was what I would have considered, by any normal standards, to be an extremely stupid, boring book. There is no plot, to speak of. There are pages and pages, entire chapters almost, devoted solely to describing how peaceful and beautiful the arid New Mexican landscape is. And although it spans almost fifty years, it moves at the pace of a lone French missionary jorneying through the desert. But despite all this, I found myself liking it more intensely than almost any other book I've ever read. I found myself caught up in its slow, quiet, undulating rhythm. In fact, towards the end, I practically had tears in my eyes from the beauty of it all.I would have given it a ten, if I didn't find this whole thing so damn unsettling."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather's &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; is the story of two French American missionary priests, Father Jean Marie Latour and Father Joseph Vaillant, who are assigned by the Roman Catholic church to take command of the parishes of northern New Mexico in the middle of the Nineteenth Century. It is a lawless land of mostly Mexican and Native American inhabitants, recently seized by American occupation. Father Latour takes residence in Santa Fe, later becoming an Archbishop, and Father Vaillant goes to Albuquerque and later up to Colorado to establish a missionary church at Pike's Peak during the gold rush.The two priests build a religious foundation and provide spiritual and material aid for all the parishioners, rich and poor, devout and indifferent, Mexican, Indian, and American. Among the people they meet are the famous frontiersman Kit Carson, who takes charge of a Mexican girl on the run from her abusive, murderous husband, a couple of wealthy benefactors, and two friendly Indian guides, Jacinto and Eusabio, who educate them about tribal customs and superstitions. The priests also find themselves in dispute with two corrupt local priests, the licentious Father Martinez and the miserly Father Lucero.Unlike Sinclair Lewis's contemporary &quot;Elmer Gantry,&quot; Cather's novel is about good, honest clergymen, and she keeps her story straightforward and free of cynicism. The solemn, austere existence of the priests is complemented perfectly by the beauty and innocence of the landscape. Cather's vivid, colorful descriptions of the Southwestern deserts, hills, and adobe houses are matchless and mesmerizing; the book is like a Georgia O'Keeffe painting set to prose."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This is an historical novel set in the Sante Fe area of New Mexico in the mid to late 1800s. It describes the experiences of two French priests (Father Latour - the bishop, and Father Vallaint - his vicar) sent there to establish a diocese. Most of their congregation are Mexicans who have previously been served by the Spanish catholic church, and Native American tribes - some of whom have embraced this new religion but many who have not. The plot line consists mainly of a series of vignettes describing the life of the two priests as they go about their work.Willa Cather writes in a simple, but graceful style much like the personalities of her two priests. It is worth reading this novel just for her descriptions of the austere beauty of the American southwest. Many great authors have an uncanny ability to write beautiful prose with what appears to be very straightforward language, and Willa Cather certainly fits that category. Some have complained that her characters lacked depth in this novel, and though at times they seem to take a back seat to the setting, I found both men to be rich, real, and well-fleshed out characters. A recommended read."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"What motivated young, well-educated mid-19th century Frenchmen to leave their beloved country for the wilds of Lake Ontario and then the even wilder newly-annexed New Mexico territory? To toil there for decades amid the struggles -- often sanguinary -- between rival cultures? What caused them to choose to die there rather than a comfortable retirement back \\"home\\" in the old country? Cather answers with an exploration of religious faith, of the enchanting beauty of the desert, arroyos and mountains and of the indominable human spirit. I felt her questions were profound and her answers satisfying."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I've never really read anything like Death Comes for the Archbishop before. The stories of Sara Orne Jewett and other novels by Cather are the only things I know of that are similar, but Death Comes for the Archbishop has something different. There is just something truly sublime in these simple tales collected here.The novel is basically about these two priests trying to live out their faith in an alien land. It's truly a frontier novel, as so many sorts of frontiers are crossed in the novel. The priests cross the expanse between their own culture and those of their flock. The priests connect with Native Americans, Mexicans, and Americans, and they work toward achieving unity for all these peoples. Ultimately, the priests' goal is to guide these people (and themselves) toward unity with God. That's probably the real beauty of the novel. Each episode of the novel is simply told; these are simple stories of simple people trying to live in a harsh land. However simple and grounded these stories seem to be, though, a closer look reveals them to always be imbued with spiritual portent. Cather writes lovingly of these people and this land, and she finds the holiness located in life on this frontier.Overall, Death Comes for the Archbishop is such a lovely little novel. There's an extraordinary beauty and wisdom in every image and every word. It's a novel well worth reading and one that I will read several times more."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I read this slender volume on the plane ride home from a trip to Disneyland. It was a perfect antidote to the crowded modernity and garish consumerism of a theme park. I read an article in which the author claimed that Willa Cather is the greatest American writer, surpassing even Hemingway. I'm not sure about the truth of this statement, but I have loved everything that I have ever read that she wrote.Death Comes for the Archbishop is a mature book by a mature author. It tells the story of the life of a Catholic bishop, who eventually becomes, as the title would suggest, an archbishop. Bishop LaTour arrives in the southwest in the 1800s, and lives out his life there. The prose is spare and lovely, with descriptions of the geography of the southwest that somehow convey, in a few well-chosen words, the immensity and grandeur of the landscape. Willa Cather is able to define for us the interior and the exterior life of the bishop, and conveys his faith and his adherence to that faith so beautifully.The book takes the reader through forty years of Father LaTour's life in just a few hundred pages, beginning with the conversation (of which he is not a part) in Italy that results in his selection as the bishop. The main body of the book chronicles the first several years of his tenure as bishop, and contains rich anecdotes of his experiences with the Mexicans, Kit Carson, and other faithful residents of the Southwest. The end, when death does indeed come for the archbishop is quite simply heartbreakingly lovely."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"As close to history as Cather can make this storyWritten as a novel, Death Comes for the Archbishop is historical fiction based on the lives of Bishop Jean Baptiste L'Amy and his associates within the church. As such, it is representative of Cather's strong spiritual side. Set mostly in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, it chronicles the bishop's efforts to organize the Catholic diocese of NM. A character study in the old sense of the word, this book explores the paths and pitfalls of men determined to build a mission, a cathedral in the wilderness.After you've read this book, should you travel to New Mexico, be sure to visit the chapel of the archbishop on the grounds of Bishop Ranch, just outside Santa Fe."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I have a different kind of relationship with Willa Cather's novels. I read My Antonia for a class in college and loved it. It was one of the better books we read that semester and there were a few good ones. Later, on my own, I read O Pioneers! and it felt like I was dragging my feet through quicksand trying to get through the book. There was no connection, no spark. So, I didn't know what to expect from another Cather novel. When I picked up Death Comes for the Archbishop I had no real expectations except that it couldn't be as good as My Antonia.It is.It is a very simple story. In the mid 1800's the Catholic Church sends a young Bishop out into New Mexico to take over a diocese there which covers hundreds and hundreds of square miles. Perhaps thousands. The Church is moving the seat of power from hundreds of miles to the south in Mexico to Santa Fe. Bishop Jean Latour is sent from the Lake Ontario region and he travels across the country with his friend, the Vicar, Father Joseph Valliant to put together a parish and diocese in the still wild region of New Mexico. The span of the novel covers the next several decades as Latour and Father Joseph work together ministering to the local Mexicans and Native Indians. The novel is as much a collection of stories regarding Latour's time in the Southwest as it is a coherent novel. There is no \\"plot\\" as one would traditionally understand plot. But it is an examination of the grace and faith of Latour and his interactions with various personalities and confronting individual conflicts in a true Christian manner. If one was able to choose what sort of man would be a Bishop, Latour would be the first choice. He did good work and left a positive mark on everyone he came in contact with. There is no overarching conflict through this novel, but the conflict is the building up of the diocese and the small conflicts that any Bishop must face.For such a character piece as Death Comes for the Archbishop, I have to say that I loved the novel. Published in 1927 and set in the mid to late 1800's the struggles felt contemporary even though they are specific to a region still being settled. The attitudes and viewpoints of the characters felt appropriate to the setting, though they might grate a little harsh to the modern ear. Even so, I felt more grace coming from this novel than I did the occasional harshness from an outdated viewpoint which fit the characters. In this novel we get to see the growth of Latour and his diocese which he runs with a very hands on and honest approach...as befits a man of the cloth. We do see the examples of what a bad priest would be like.Overall, I think Death Comes for the Archbishop is an excellent book and now puts me two up on having read excellent Willa Cather novels.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"As an English major, I've read plenty of classics, and I must say that this one is in the top 10 for me. Cather's language is deceptively simple, and she weaves it almost magically into something deeply profound and delightfully inspiring. I found her story of service and trust in God to be one of the most faith-building I've ever read. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"A fantastic novel, but the CreateSpace (September 24, 2009) edition is terrible.

Nice story line."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This portrait of a great churchman, but also of a great early American hero. Archbishop Latour (Lamy in reality) brought the Gospel to New Mexico and also found it already alive in the nobility and traditions of the Mexican and Indian people there. It is a story of the building of America, and the vital and creative part that the Catholic Church played in it.

Moving easily between France, Rome, Cincinnati and Sandusky, Ohio and New Mexico in the mid 19th century, Willa Cather brings details, feelings, and events alive. The plot proceeds episodically, with large time and geographic gaps, but the work is held together by the vivid characters. When at last death comes to the archbishop, you feel part of the story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather speaks as though she were one of the characters in the book. Continuity of events flowed well.

KW"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"When someone in our book club suggested this book, I couldn't even remember when I had read it, but I think I was in high school. Even then, this book (written in 1927) was \\"old\\"! Anyhow, it was interesting to pick it up again and re-enter the world of the 19th century Southwest. Based on the life of Archbishop Lamy (Archbishop Latour in this novel) who came from France via Ohio to Santa Fe, New Mexico, this is fiction that reads more like biography. It provides fascinating insights into the many shades of good and evil that lurk in the hearts of men. There are \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" priests, soldiers, Yankees, Indians, and Mexicans. There is \\"adventure\\" in this story of missionary efforts to Christianize the local Natives, but this book is primarily a character study. I found myself continually amazed at the lengths to which these missioners would go and the deprivations they were willing to suffer in order to do the work they believed God had called them to do. The lifelong friendship between Latour and his idealistic priest friend, Fr. Vaillant, was beautiful and touching.Perhaps the \\"main character,\\" however, is Santa Fe itself. The locale, both stark and beautiful, haunts the entire book. I want to take a trip to Santa Fe now, having recently re-read this book. I want to see where Latour (Lamy) died. When death does finally come for the old Archbishop, Cather's poetic style reaches its crescendo: \\"Something soft and wild and free, something that whispered to the ear on the pillow, lightened the heart, softly softly picked the lock, slid the bolts, and released the prisoned spirit of the man into the wind, into the blue and gold, into the morning, into the morning!\\" This is the Santa Fe that was so beautiful that it was Latour's and Cather's heaven."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"When I first read \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" many years ago, I made a mental note to read it again some day. And so I did, a few decades later. If anything, it is even better than I remembered it. Published in 1927, it conveys Cather's love of the Southwest. Father Jean Latour, the protagonist, is loosely (but not exactly) based on the life of Archbishop Jean Baptiste Lamy, the first Bishop of New Mexico. His Vicar General in the novel, Father Joseph Vaillant, was drawn from an account Cather read of the life of a real priest, Father Joseph Machebeuf.Cather's biographer, James Woodress, compares the structure of the novel to those paintings where the life of a saint is rendered in panels. It's an apt description. The story is not told in linear fashion, but as a series of stories and of stories within stories. It spans the period from 1848, when New Mexico became an American territory, to the coming of the railroad in the 1880's.One of the things that makes this book a great one is Cather's ability to depict Santa Fe, the little Mexican villages, and the vast surrounding landscape with precision, economy, and beauty. Another is the way in which she creates the characters of the two priests; we see them as unusual men who possess saintly qualities but are also fully human. They sometimes long for France, the place of their birth. They must be clever, even sly, to work around the resistance to their authority put up by the resident Mexican clergy. And by way of contrast, some of the most amusing stories are those of reprobate priests whose sins include gluttony and lust.Cather sometimes shows up on high school reading lists, \\"My Antonia\\" being the chief example. It's hard to see how her spare, understated writing would appeal to many teenagers. (I speak from experience.) If high school is where you first encountered Willa Cather, pick up \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop,\\" a wonderful book. (\\"My Antonia\\" is worth reading again, too.)M.

Since I love Cather's writing this was very important to me."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"This novel begins with a high-level Vatican decision in the mid 1800's to establish a new archdiocese in what is now New Mexico. In deciding on an appropriate candidate for heading this archdiocese one official observes that Germans are famous for their efficiency. This observation, however, is balanced by the statement of another official that German efficiency only extends to record keeping--and that if you want to effect actual change you need to go with a Frenchman! And so the decision is made to send the Frenchman Latour to establish this new diocese. This decision proves to be a good one, as Latour is seen to be a fine choice for this position.I have to say that for years I was confused as to the nature of this novel. Due to the title I had the erroneous impression that this was a mystery novel in which somebody sought out the killer of the archbishop. This novel is nothing of the kind! The fine old gentleman who is the archbishop dies of natural causes!"},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Growing up in New Mexico, I often took for granted the many things that make the American Southwest remarkable. Willa Cather vividly explored the vast landscape in a simple tale of two lonely missionary vicars filling the void in their lives. As two unwelcomed priests, Fr. Latour and Fr. Joseph, as different as night and day, tame the unbridled Catholicism of New Mexico for Rome. While merely serving out their simple roles, they begin a new page in New Mexico's history that still plays a role in daily life in 1998."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"After reading this book, I would not name my Great Dane Willa Cather, but I did very much enjoy her portrait of the Bishop Lamy of Santa Fe. I am sympathetic with those who say that the Bishop is a harbinger of capitalism and out-of-touch with the Indians and Mexicans, and at first I was bothered by Cather's acceptance and relative lack of bias towards all groups. Although she seemed to occasionally stereotype, for the most part she didn't seem to take sides at all. I wanted her to be more critical and judgmental!It is a rather slowly told tale, but not difficult for any level of reader. And finally near the end she begins to achieve beauty. My favorite landscape line: &quot;Elsewhere the sky is the roof of the world; but here the earth was the floor of the sky&quot;. My favorite explanation of alone time: &quot;It was not a solitude of atrophy, of negation, but of perpetual flowering.&quot; And finally she hints at environmental destruction and the difference in how different people treat the planet, discusses the plight of the Navajo, and calls Kit Carson, who until nearly the last page has been a gentleman and a scholar, &quot;misguided&quot;. I was relieved. Go get 'em Willa.It may be slow going at first, but it's rewards are many especially if you are interested in history. In Stuart Udall's The Founding Fathers, you will also find some discussion of Bishop Lamy."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"I came to this book with enthusiasm. My Antonia is one of my all time favorites and O Pioneers right up there. This was a major disppointment. The characters (2) were not developed nearly as well as the characters in Cather's other books. The characters make the Ms Cather's other works. The Archbishop particularly is never filled out. I found him very unsympathic. I enjoyed his Vicar and wished there was more of him. In fact at one point I thought it would be a much better book had he been the primary charcacter.As I neared the end of the book I came to this site to see if there was any historical basis to the book. At first I was pleased to learn that it is based upon the lives of these two characters. Then I became disappointed again. As a history or biography it is truly lacking.I find it hard to classify this as a &quot;classic&quot;. I find it many grades below My Antonia and O Pioneers."},{"Title":"Death comes for the Archbishop","review":"Willa Cather is one of the great American writers of the 20th century, and this is perhaps her greatest book.

Burroughs contines his wonderful fantasy stories with the Pellucidar series and this work is one of the best. As one reviewer has already pointed out, Burroughs' observation on the human conditon can be quite acute and down right funny. As a old man, I recently reread this one (along with several others by this author) and found they have lost none of thier charm. The are \\"page turners\\" in every way and simply fun to read. Granted, some of the author's writing can indeed be a bit predictable, but somehow that is comforting for me. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Tanar of Pellucidar","review":"The third book in the Pellucidar series, 'Tanar of Pellucidar' concerns the exploits of of Tanar, and his adventures within the world lying under the \\"outer crust\\", Pellucidar.Burroughs doesn't deviate too far from his formula, nor would you want him to.Tanar is the honorable, fallible, romantically-driven hero, Stellara his love, and a whole host of bad guys interfere with them getting together. This time, they're from a place called Korsar, and look remarkably like pirates.Yup. Yo ho, yo ho pirates.Like the other books, there are set pieces aplenty, written in ERB's thrilling simple style. Jungles chases and oceanic clashes...dungeons, dinosaurs...oh it's all here as usual.This time, however, there is a bit more elegance and sophistication slipping in to his prose. First, Mr. Burroughs appears in the prologue/epilogue. The jarring anachronistic presence of the pirates is given a possible explanation, in a tantalizing fashion. He gives us enough information to put two and two together, but you still want to read more, and I think he's setting us up nicely for the subsequent novels.Which I now absolutely MUST read.One last humorous note: Some of the exotic locales, like Anoroc and Amiocap, I've just noticed to be cities in California spelled backwards..."},{"Title":"Tanar of Pellucidar","review":"Although Edgar Rice Burrough's style can get predictable at times, he can come up with some literary gems such as the first few Tarzan novels and (if he had just foregone the \\"sequals\\") \\"the Land that Time Forgot\\". \\"Tanar of Pellucidar\\", along with \\"Escape on Venus\\" stand out for their simple, straightforward observations (often humorous) of human nature as expressed through the practices of various societies. Even if you aren't a Burroughs fan, these two titles I recommend for any lover of good fiction."},{"Title":"Tanar of Pellucidar","review":"Two things amaze me about Burroughs's writing. The first is how he could keep telling the same story again and again, with just a few changes to names, places, and size of the monsters' teeth. The second is how he kept that repetitive sameness fresh and exciting, as he did here.This follows the usual pattern of ERBian storytelling: the mighty warrior (Tanar in this case), on the trail of the savaeable babe (Stellara in this case), as she gets captured by seemingly every mad horde and loathsome gang on (in, in this case) the planet. Even within this subterranean world, there are sub-subterranean troglodytes, prisons riddled with secret escape routes, and monsters that appear the moment after they come up in conversation. There's the usual chivalrous bafflement about a romantic interest, alternating hot and cold because of puerile jealousies and a nearly autistic inability to figure out what is so obviously going on in others' transparent minds. And, as usual, the romantic confusion resolves itself chastely in the end.Nearly 80 years old at this writing, this offers the same quaint charm as the Buck Rogers movies from around the same time - and the same improbable physics and manly questing to Do The Right Thing. If you want a relaxing read from before the age of irony, these Burroughs stories are sure to please, just as they have for most of a century now.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Tanar of Pellucidar","review":"\\"Tanar of Pellucidar\\" was the third pulp fiction novel Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote in his Pellucidar series, which was his third longest after the Tarzan and Barsoom series. Burorughs wrote the story as a six-part serial in late 1928 and it was first published in \\"The Blue Book Magazine\\" from March to August of 1929. \\"Tanar\\" was written after \\"Tarzan and the Lost Empire,\\" and after completing it Burroughs wrote a sequel to both works when his next novel presented his only book to be in two different series, \\"Tarzan at the Earth's Core.\\"Although the title for the novel is taken from a character native to the inner world of Pellucidar, the most interesting character in Burroughs' novel is Jason Gridley, who is introduced in the prologue as a friend of the author. An orphan, Gridley has graduated from Stanford and built a lab at Tarzana (ERB's home). There he discovers the \\"Gridley Wave,\\" which is the means by which Burroughs will receive his \\"true\\" stories from the Earth's core and Mars. That is the case with this story, which is sent by Abner Perry from Pellucidar, where he and David Innes have been living for fifteen years. Perry reports that Innes is being held a captive in the north of Pellucidar. Althought the Mahas and their Sagoths have been driven beyond the border of the Empire of Pellucidar, the Kingdom of Thuria in the Land of the Awful Shadow is now under attack by a savage race of men led by Goork.Tanar, son of Ghak, is who Innes sends to deal with the situation, along with 10,000 warriors armed with the \\"modern\\" firearms created by Innes and Perry. Tanar is captured by Korsar pirates who want to learn the secret of the strange weapons that control the balance of power in Pellucidar. Innes heads off to rescue Tanar, ordering that a fleet of 50 ships be built to follow him as soon as possible. Meanwhile, back on the Kosar ship Tanar and the lovely Stellara are busy ignoring each other, so the romantic interest of the novel has been established. That means that we can get on with the standard ERB adventure yarn, which is that Tanar and Stellara escape, get recaptured, get separated, so on and so forth. But ERB keeps the action moving at a brisk place and I always liked the way that the Pellucidar novels involved interjecting \\"modern\\" technology into the equation. Besides, in conquering this inner \\"New\\" world, Innes is much more beneficent than the European who arrived in this particular hemisphere.Be forewarned that the novel ends with David Innes still being held in the prison of the Cid, covered by snakes no less, so there is a cliffhanger ending.. Jason Gridley promies to help, thereby setting up the rescue effort by Tarzan in the next book. I have to admit, that given how redundant and repetitive the Tarzan books became that having Tarzan actually be in a strange new world and not just another uncharted part of the African continent was a decent little twist. Of course, Tarzan is always going to be the lord of whatever jungle he ends up in, so some things remain constant."},{"Title":"Tanar of Pellucidar","review":"45 years ago I read all ERB mars series books and the Pellucidar series.

The author of this book should win a Nobel for her superb writing skills and exceptional insight into humanity; more importantly, Oprah ought to celebrate it on her bookclub, and Ron Howard ought to make a movie out of it. It's a story that shows humanity in a clear light--what our expectations of each other are, what are stereotypes and preconceived notions consist of and how damanging they can be. Never have I ever run across a book that has gapped so many chasms as this book, such as blacks and whites, young and old, wealthy and poor, cultured and uncouth. This story just blew me away.

Because her mother worked two jobs, she was expected to be the caretaker to her younger siblings and the children of her mother's boyfriend.

Throughout Peggy's four years and beyond with the Ellens, she learns the true meaning of giving and accepting love.Told through the voice of Peg some twenty-seven years later, we the reader are able to capture the spirit of Peg, the Ellens and their extend families. The other characters that are sprinkled throughout add a flavor to this wonderful recipe that dabbles in race relations, joy and pain. 22 Friar Street is great coming of age story adequately examining the \\"Cycle of Life\\" and the \\"Ying and the Yang.\\" \\"It's all a cycle; the ultimate in life is giving, sacrificing for others.\\" 22 Friar Street will touch your soul and stay with you long afterwards."},{"Title":"22 Friar Street","review":"I am forever changed and inspired by this story so wonderfully captured in print. The issues of race, poverty, neglect, abuse, age-discrimination, betrayal, and vulnerability were all handled so skillfully . . .skillfully enough to allow any reader to consider the &quot;other side&quot; of any one of these problems.I read this book in three sittings, and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. For example, my heart leapt for joy when the Ellens went to Peg's house in Pittsburg to make sure she'd continue her education back in Bethesda. I found myself pulling for Mr. Ellen when he was forced into retirement. I held my breath with Peg and Mrs. Ellen when the neighbor and his wife brought over an apple pie for Mr. Ellen. I wept with Peg as she held Mr. Ellen in her arms and whispered, &quot;I love you, daddy!&quot;I could go on and on, but I won't. I want to be careful not to spoil the ending for those of you who will consider buying this book. I will go as far to say that you must experience this story, because I know that you won't be disappointed.

In addition to growing up living with that horrible memory, she is also forced to live with a guilt-producing, self-centered mother and a lazy, sexually-abusive stepfather.At age sixteen, Peggy finishes high school and leaves Pittsburgh to attend college in Maryland (against her mother's wishes). Because her family will be unable to assist her financially, Peggy attends college on a basketball scholarship. She also saves money by living with a local, older couple in their home at 22 FRIAR STREET.Not until Peggy arrives a the home of the couple, does she realize that they are African Americans. The differences in their racial backgrounds, predjudices and expectations are quickly surfaced.Yet each side learns from the other and thrives. This is an unusual story of deep caring, understanding and the puting aside of racial differences to become a family."},{"Title":"22 Friar Street","review":"What do you do when you're only 16 and you've received an athletic scholarship to the University of Maryland but college housing isn't available? You also have to content with the fact that your uncaring mother wants you to stay at home and attend the University of Pittsburgh because it's closer and you will still be able to help take care of your younger siblings as well as your mother's boyfriend's children. But not only do you want to get away from your mother and her demands you also want to leave behind her lazy, slothful, alcoholic and potentially abusive boyfriend who also has eyes for you. You would gladly run off to college to get away from this pathetic, unstructured and dysfunctional situation; the only one you've known thus far and it has lacked warmth, guidance, support or direction. But there's a slight problem because you applied and got accepted so late to the University of Maryland that their aren't any dorm spaces available on campus. So if you go away to school you will have to stay off-campus with an unfamiliar family that you don't even know. Well, even that sounds better than your current circumstances, except there's one catch. The family that you will be living with is Black and you're White and the year is 1970 when integration still isn't widely accepted or acknowledged.22 Friar Street is a touching and poignant coming of age story about a white, female student, Peggy Dana, who belatedly accepts a basketball scholarship to the University of Maryland. Because she accepts her scholarship at the last minute, there's no housing available on campus. So she must accept the only housing available to her which is with an older, childless black couple named the Ellens...who live in the community. Peggy moves in with them and her education quickly involves much more than her studies.The Ellens, a refined, educated, concerned and caring couple hold Peggy to a higher standard than she has ever had to face before. After, a few hiccups along the way and a rocky adjustment period, Peggy soon realizes that the Ellens sincerely care for her and she finally has the parents she spent all of her life searching for. What starts out as a one semester venture ends up as a life-long committment.22 Friar Street is a fast-paced tale with surprising twists and turns. It's a heartwarming story that tugs on your heart and should be a must read for teens as well as adults. Its a story that teaches important lessons regarding race relations, cultural and age differences as well as values such as integrity and responsibility. 22 Friar Street is a place of hope, love, redemption, family and acceptance. This is a book that brought out a lot of emotions...I felt like I was reading a true story rather than fiction. I laughed, I cried, I scolded, and I rejoiced. I empathized with some characters while I wanted to beat the crap out of other ones especially those who emotionally or physically abuse children. But in the end I felt satiated from the read and I felt that I was a better person for having read this book.

Peggy Dana is a brave modern-day (if one can still call the seventies &quot;modern&quot;) heroine who surmounts unbelievable obstacles to become a well educated, generous, ethical young women.Peggy Dana is born to a mother who succumbs to such despair after the death of her husband that she subjects herself and her children to an existence beneath mere poverty, a life without a shred of laughter or hope or affection lived under the same roof with George. The scene in which her live-in boyfriend nearly rapes 16-year-old Peggy is harrowing. The reader can feel the pain searing both Peggy's flesh &amp; her psyche.The maternal blessing Peg receives when she leaves for college to take advantage of her basketball scholarship is &quot;One less mouth to feed.&quot; Due to a dorm shortage Peg is &quot;forced&quot; to live with Martin and Missus Ellen, a black couple the reader will never forget. It's not a smooth start with the Ellens, especially with Martin who likes to goad Peg into learning more about black history by telling her that his still living father served in the Revolutionary War. Furious at being had, Peg &quot;gets even&quot; by reading up on black history and inviting the Ellens to a party where Margaret Garner will be speaking. Martin Ellen pretends to know exactly who Margaret Garner is until Missus calls him on it, telling him Margaret Garner has been dead for a couple of hundred year. Martin stops quizzing Peg, but he continues trying to prod her into learning the most she can and being the best she can be.The Missus is just the giving, empathetic, and classy person the reader feels Peg deserves as her surrogate mother. And Martin Ellen, although often coming across cantankerous, especially after being forced into early retirement, is constantly proving the meaning of integrity and self-sacrifice.Martin Ellen has a theory about the &quot;the cycle of life,&quot; something about everything one does coming back eventually, a theory that always guides him in what is right and what is wrong. Whether he's going out for pizza after attending one of Peg's basketball games or plunging into icy cold water to rescue a young neighbor girl, Martin is guided by his &quot;Cycle of Life.&quot;&quot;22 Friar Street&quot; put me in mind of my favorite Grateful Dead Song &quot;Wheel&quot; _ &quot;You can't go back and you can't stand still; if the thunder don't get you, then the lightning will.&quot; &quot;Big wheel turns by the grace of God. Every time that wheel goes round bound to cover just a little more ground.&quot; A thoroughly good humored song, it resounds with all the issues at the heart of life and death.

Wrong!In the midst of Peg's drama is her own mother; overbearing,manipulative and lost in despair because she's not quite over thedeath of her husband who died when Peg was a child. Because of this,Peg's Mom holds her children hostage to her feelings of resentment,offering them nothing in the form of emotional support and love.After much hesitation and even more strife from her Mom, Peg acceptsthe scholarship and heads off to college.Because of her delay in accepting the scholarship, there isn't roomavailable on campus, so she is housed off campus with Martin and Doris&quot;Missus&quot; Ellen, an elderly black couple thatlive near campus. This is where Peg finds her &quot;surrogate parents.&quot;Despite their different races and ages, they immediately bond witheach other creating a warm, loving relationship that enables Peg to crossover into adult life.

We also see that sometimes, though we are born to our parents, theydon't always have our best interests in mind, so we have to follow our heartsand do what our dreams outline for us.

This novel has layers and layers of messages and symbols not only on races but also on humanity. And one point well made through the story by the author is that memory isn't always reliable. What an ingenious point to make b/c we all live our lives based on our past memories and past experiences.

Of course there are the expected tensions and problems, but this is a story of love--a love of one human for another regardless of age, financial status, race, class, or educational level. I found myself laughing out loud, and then other times, I felt unexpected tears rolling down my cheeks. This is a book that shows what true literature is, a book that tells a story the way it was done years ago, with all the figurative language and symbolism, and layers.

I've always been faciniated by stories that involve the idea of reincarnation and past lives. Especially the idea that we have one soul mate that will be with us in other lives, through out all time. This is only the second book I've read that involves this idea. I think it is the most romantic concept ever concieved, and Lisa Kleypas does a wonderful job of turning this concept into an engrosing book. Once I hit the point that began dealing with past lives, I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it. This story is a wonderful addition to any romance collection. It is now an important part of mine."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Before I read this book, I read the reviews on Amazon and prepared for the worst. Undoubtedly they are the reviewers' opinions, and they are not unfounded. However, I thought it was a very good book. Maybe one could say it was a bit sci-fi-y with the two lives thing, but ultimately the story was supposed to be about how Nikolas's past shaped his present, and his and Emma's feelings, as well as the remarkably long way they had to journey to find love. I liked this one better than some of the other Kleypas novels, such as Stranger in My Arms. I think that the reason most to dislike this book (or the others depending on your opinion) is not her writing but the editing. Kleypas is realy good at inter looping people's emotions and motives into her novels, which is what makes them so good, but sometimes the final copy is a little lacking."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This was such a poignant story that it brought tears to my eyes. Prince Nicholas is a wonderful hero, even when he is at his worse and deffenetly un-heroic. I loved Emma's managerie, for I too love animals the way she does. It was an interesting twist about their past life together, but it certainly did not detract from the story, in fact it added to it. All in all this a novel with two love stories rolled into one wonderful novel. One that ended tragicly and the other that was happily ever after. Jake, Nicholas son was a perfect addition and helped Nicholas overcome his guilt over his brother's death. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Prince of Dreams by Lisa Kleypas made me laugh and cry. Emma marries Prince Nikolas who is exile from Russia. Prince Nikolas had a terrible life and does not trust anyone and therefore refuses to love Emma. Emma is strong willed women who refuses to give her heart to Nikolas. In the middle the feud Nikolas collapses and finds himself time traveling/dreaming back 100 plus years. He dreams about the his great great grandfather in Russia who marries a women who looks like Emma. When Prince Nikolas awakes he is a changed man and the books just gets better. I loved the history of Russia and the romance and evil plots were great. Off to find some more of Kleypas older novels...."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Firs of all I have to say that its one of the best romances ever, at least which I have read. Emma is a really great heroine, so beautiful, so charming. And Nikolas is absolutely stole my heart. Wonderful story."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This was a good book until I started to think about what was happening in the &quot;past.&quot; He marries his ancestor and has a child with her who will grow up to be another of the hero's ancestors. Am I supposed to think how romantic it is that when he comes back, he is nicer to his wife, who appears to be a reincarnation of his g grandmother?"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I was interested in the story until the supernatural took over and we switched to another time. It wasn't confusing so much as kind of boring. I knew enough about what was going to happen that after Nikolai decided he would go ahead and have a real marriage with Emelia I felt like I was marking time until the inevitable conclusion to that segment. It just didn't hold my interest.I felt like I wanted more clarity as far as Lord Milbank was concerned as well. He seemed like a complete victim -- too wimpy for our heroine to be sure -- but not a villain like everyone portrayed him up until the time he snapped. He had a legitimate grievance and I felt like Nikki got off easy without any proof or action on Milbank's part to make any of the heart-ache justified.When he snapped I just felt sorry for him (although I didn't want him to kill Nikki!).In the end I liked the two main characters and their chemistry together, which is why I gave it three instead of two.I like Kleypas but I'd recommend the Wallflower series over this."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!! It makes most other romance characters pale in comparison to Emma and Nikolas. I also don't usually like the past life/reincarnation story, but Lisa Kleypas pulled it off wonderfully.Some complained that Nikolas is cruel, and this is partly true but Kleypas also gives you a glimpse into the unresolved abuses and horrors Nikolas experienced and she shows you how it has affected him as a person. He is so bitter and miserable, and he does not know how to cope with his past experiences. When something happens to Nikolas, sending him into his past life, he gets a chance to come to terms with his past and see what he is missing by letting it rule his life.Emma is an awesome heroine. She is not like other women of her station. She is close to six feet tall and has different hobbies then most ladies like caring for animals. She stands up to Nikolas's cruelty and bitterness, and does not let him bully her.I just loved this story, it is so different from your average romance."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I loved the character in this story. His tortured personality adds a layer to the &#34;love&#34; story that other historical romance seems to jump into. Neither fanes unrequited love right away although it is obvious that they have deep feelings towards each other."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I agree with all the negative comments about Nikki loving Emelia and maybe not Emma. Emma doesn't feel as if it's from a love of long ago reincarnated, even though Nicolas does. How unfair to Emma. And if the vision of Nicolas is true, then did he sire a son who down the line will be him several generations later? Did any one think of that as really, really strange?"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I just didn't enjoy this book. Emma seemed spoiled and childish and Nickolas was your typical wounded mysterious alpha male and they didn't seem well suited at all, other than both wanting their own way. There really wasn't any character developement for either of them and it just became a painful, irritating read for me."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I know that people read this genre for different reasons. One reason I read it is because it is light reading. But I can't seem to struggle through the stories that are extremely trivial. Like the those who have miscommunication as the main complication. I like real problems!Prince of Dreams is one with viable problems. And the hero doesn't simply, magically overcome everything because he has met the right woman. Nikolas has some serious issues. And I like that he is typically male. I want the men to act like men. Nikolas wants Emma regardless of his problems. He thinks he can have her and make her happy without facing his own problems and he thinks she should stay out of it. Isn't that male of him?What is great about this book is that it strikes emotions in you. When he comes home and smells like another woman and the fact that there isn't the slightest bit of remorse in him, I couldn't help but think Emma is more of a woman than I am.I also like the fact that Emma displays the predisposed attributes from her character in Midnight Angel. She was a spoiled brat in that one and she stays true to form in this one. Until she actually begins to grow up, she portrays the typical only child image. I think it could only have been Nikolas' self-indulgent character to force her to grow up.The out-of-time sequences were odd. But didn't detract at all from the story. It was a great!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, and for the most part I was not at all let down. Nikolas was really a jerk at the beginning of the book. I mean, he loved Emma, he just didn't know it. But he behaved abysmally towards her. He locked her out of his life, and he treated his illegititmate son Jake like the worst kind of trash. I was shocked by his character, but I knew that Lisa Kleypas would find some way to bring him around, and she really did. His transformation was sudden, and sort of unbelievable, but it fit very well with the magical story that this book was interwoven with. I loved reading about Nikolai's transformation when he was back in Moscow in 1707. His Emelia really helped him to become a new man, and when this book entered its third part, I really loved Nikolas's character. He showed Emma how he cared, and became a good father to his son. The only part that really let me down with this book was the ending concerning Emma's former suitor. I just thought that it was kind of hashed together and didn't fit in very well with the rest of the story.All in all though, if you love a good romance, particulary one that involves a past romance that transcends all ages, you will love Prince of Dreams."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I am an avid reader of quite a few authors and very few books truly touch me but this is one of two that i can honestly say stole my heart. The tenderness of some of the characters along with the inner turmoil of others made this book one that i will never forget. The tragedy was written so well that i sat and sobbed. I will look forward to reading my next book by Lisa."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I disliked both characters and hated the story line. Why did he have to travel into the past to learn about love from a relative? Too much mumble jumble cluttering up the romance. Try her other book &quot;Someone To Watch over me.&quot;"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"A strange mix of &quot;gritty psychology&quot;, psychic babble, and a touch of mystery, this book was not fun to read. The hero was too extreme (too rich, too titled, too sneaky, too damaged from past life) and not at all likable. The heroine was more contrary than strong. Then the 'reincarnation' subplot is just silly. I don't know what Lisa was trying to do, but she missed Fun Reading. Skip this book."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I couldn't stop thinking that the hero was involved in an incestuous relationship with his ancestor. I am also not a big time travel romance reader."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"There was a lot that I loved about the beginning of this book. Nikolas is a gorgeous bad-boy type (my favorite kind of male character) and Emma is a strong minded confident woman. I wanted to see them together from the very beginning, and I was completely engrossed in their courtship. I didn't care that Nikolas was being a little shady in his pursuit of Emma because it seemed to clear that they were meant to be together, and I didn't want to see Emma settle for her other suitor.This story went wrong for me on two counts. First, the dream sequence (for lack of a better description) at the end was too far fetched for my taste. I might have bought into it if both Emma and Nikolas were experiencing the same out-of-body type of thing, but it seemed one-sided to me in the way in concluded. I think that if the point was for their two souls to have recognized each other, then there should have been more involvement from Emma's side of the story. With that said, I don't think I would have been too crazy about the reincarnation storyline even if it had been written better. I would have preferred that these two characters loved each other because of who they each were in current day, rather than having them driven together because of their pasts.The second item that really bothered me about this book was that Nikolas is unfaithful to Emma after they are married. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time a hero or heroine sinks this low in a Lisa Kleypas book. It broke my heart to read this section because I couldn't bring myself to fall back in love with Nikolas again after he crossed this line. I liked him so much at the beginning, but I couldn't forgive him for infidelity. With this being the case, I just wasn't as invested in the outcome as I normally am when I read LK's books. This may also have contributed to why the flashback scenes didn't work for me, because I just couldn't feel a connection to Nikolas anymore.I would not use this book as a basis for choosing to read other LK novels. This book is nothing like the books she typically writes. I highly recommend her as a romance novelist, but this is definitely not her best work in my opinion. Her Wallflower series and her Hathaway series are much better."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I do have to say that Nikolas is a very unique hero. He's dark and conflicted. He wants Emma but doesn't know what to do with her when he gets her. He does everything he can to destroy her love for him. But at the same time, he yearns for her love with all his heart. A romance novel, for certain. But I felt it was also a character study. Nikolas is a character that makes you want to keep reading to see if he'll get a clue and turn his life around. He almost waits too late, but a magical twist of fate sends him on the path to redemption. This is definitely one of Kleypas' more darker books, but it's worth the read. Just prepared to meet a character who will make you look very closely at your concept of what a romance novel hero is."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This is my all time favorite book. Ever.I think the title of this book is horrid and I'm sure it scares away more than a few potential readers. For me the title evokes the worst of the romance genre. When in fact, this story is incredibly gritty and dark.I adore Lisa Kleypas's writing. I think she absolutely shines in this book. I have read so many novels where the main male character is viewed as this vile, dark, menacing character and yet when you dig under the layers, you find his heart of gold. Not so much with Nicholas. You did under the layers and you find out he's even worse than you thought. But of course, if you keep digging, he will eventually redeem himself.I love that Kleypas didn't shy away from the darkness. She painted a portrait of a character shaped (warped) by an absent mother and a violently abusive, sadistic father. You really feel Nicholas's undying love for his brother, his guilt at not being able to protect him. You understand his bloodlust for his brother's murderer, even if you can't condone it. Kleypas doesn't just make vague allusions to their troubling childhood, she takes the reader into the horrors.But Nicholas isn't the only strong character in this book. Emma is more than a match for him. Gentle and kind, she has a center of steel and has no trouble going toe to toe with Nicholas. I particularly enjoyed that while Emma is the protector of wounded animals, it takes her quite a while to realize that Nicholas is exactly that at his core."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I don't really understand why this book was so poorly rated, but it wasn't really that bad. The only thing which I intensively disliked was the character Nicholas...in the beginning, where he did some very, ahem, un-herolike things. I found myself skimming over those parts in order to get to the end which truly had a HEA and I wound up enjoying both characters. The whole flashback, reincarnation thing could have been cut back on sharply because the way it stands it's like a small novella. If you have nothing else on your TBR pile, find this book, and give it a try. Kleypas at her worst (and this is not her worst) is ten times better than a lot of authors at their best anyways. And like I said, you'll love the ending. I just wish she could have extended the end a little bit and shown more of how tender Nicholas could be."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Shouldread both Stokehurst books,this one being the second. The Russian parts were particularly fun reading. Would recommend to those who like European history."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This is one of Lisa Kleypas best. Loved the detailsabout Russia and the intensity of the love they had foreach other was wonderful. Held my interest from start to finish."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I want to preface by saying that in general, I love Lisa Kleypas books. I don't really know what happened here. It started out fine, although the \\"hero\\" was a pretty terrible person, but I assumed he would be redeemed. Well. I was wrong. I'm pretty sure he slept with another woman to push Emma away--which they never actually discuss!!--and then he passes out and goes back in time as his great-great-grandfather? And sleeps with his great-great-grandmother?? Who might be Emma or just her doppelganger?? Whatever it was, it felt incestuous and adulterous and creepy. I ended up skipping most of the time-traveling part because it really felt like he was cheating on Emma. Anyway, back to the present. He wakes up and suddenly he's a changed man...and it's not Emma who changed him, it's that going back in time thing and falling in love with Emelia that did it. They never bring up the other woman he slept with, and Emma had nothing to do with changing him!! It just felt cheap and he wasn't redeemed for me. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was seriously disappointed with this book and honestly, I'm not really sure how it got published with such an ick factor."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I read a couple of Miss Kleypas's books and I have to say, I love the Wallflower series and the Hathaway series. In fact, all her other books are good but this one here has to be the worst book ever!! The Hero was nothing but a completely cruel hero to the very end!! At the beginning, he lures Emma into marrying him. Then when he realizes his feelings are too deep, he cheats on her to hurt her so that she can pull away from him. Middle of the book, he faints and goes back into time and becomes his great great grandpa (or something like that) and falls in love with a \\"Look a like\\" Emma: Emelia aka his great great grandma!! (sick) Then, towards the end of the book, he wakes up from that past and all the sudden wants to work things out with Emma JUST BECAUSE EMMA LOOKS LIKE EMELIA! I don't even think he loves Emma. Anyway, throughout the remaining of the book, he is obsessed with trying to find out what happened to Emelia, his WIFE. HE EVEN CALLS HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDMA HIS WIFE!! (sick) And all the while, here's Emma on the side, as good as ever, forgiving and all. I can't believe Lisa Kleypas can write such a horrible book. What happened? I can't believe she would let Nikolai off the hook so easily? He cheated on her!! Then, went back into time in his mind and fell in love with another woman! My heart was breaking throughout the whole book. I was feeling so bad for Emma but Lisa created Emma to be one of them easily forgiving woman who lets cheating slide like its nothing. I blame Lisa Kleypas for this horrible man in my mind. I can't even fall in love with him! I'm so upset and hurt. Nikolai!! You are a selfish SOB!! I have to go back and read another great book so my heart can heal from this horrible book. If there was ever a \\"worst written Hero award\\", it would definitely go to Nikolai. I've read many bad books in my life but this one beats them all!!! From the moment he cheated on Emma, I was already hating Nikolai.I have some questions for Lisa Kleypas: Why did you make Emma forgive him so easily? It was almost as if it was no big deal at all to her. It was mentioned only once in the book on how it affected Emma. The other reason why she didn't want to give Nikolai a chance was so insignificant compared to the cheating part. I just don't get it? And Is Nikolai even in love with Emma? Or does he only thinks he is because Emma looks like Emelia? He so torn up about Emelia, even to the very end! I can honestly say I don't care about Emelia and I would have been ok if you never brought up Emelia in the book. In fact, I wish Adam shot Nikolai so that Emma can go find someone who really loves her for HER and not because she looks like someone else. Urgh! Lisa, you wrote a horrible book! I hope you learned your lesson!!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I'm so disappointed with Lisa Kleypas. I'm a big fan but this book... I don't even know where to start!! I don't care what anyone says but this books sucks! Two different stories with the same character?? Really? I don't like it one bit!! Amelia and Emma are two different people!! I don't care if they look alike, taste alike, feel alike, ect!! They are still two different people! For Nikolas to have any kind of anything at all with Amelia is unfaithful to Emma! It might be a different Nikolas but they have the same MIND!!!! So in all, he knows that they are two different people with two different bodies no matter how much they look the same! I feel like crying because Nikolas didn't fall in love with Emma but only with Amelia. It's so unfair for Emma. I felt so betrayed. If I was Emma, I would be utterly hurt. How could Lisa write a story like this? IF it was her, is she seriously ok knowing her husband went back into the past and fell in love with a woman who looked like her? I'm so upset at Lisa Kleypas!! Besides all this, Nikolas is such an A$$. LISA, PLEASE DON'T WRITE ANOTHER STORY LIKE THIS AGAIN! It's breaking my heart!! I don't like Amelia at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want to hear about Emma and Nikolas, not the the PAST Nikolas with some chick named Amelia! And what's worst is when Nikolas came back into his present mind, HE HAD THE NERVE TO LOOK FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO AMELIA WHEN EMMA IS STANDING RIGHT ON FRONT OF HIM!!! HE EVEN CALLED AMELIA HIS WIFE! Well, what the hell is Emma? He can't have two wife!! Urgh!!!!!!!! What a waste of my time and my heart is hurting so badly now. Damn book!!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"So I am to the \\"dream\\" sequence, and I just got bored really fast. I don't know if I will finish the book or not.I did really like Nikolas and his dark side at first, a redemption storyline is one of my favorites. He really was heading for the big redemption. He is a super bad boy. All of the bad stuff he did I was okay with, until he cheated and that was a turn off. That, in my opinion, crosses the line and true trust can never be again.I read Because You're Mine (I have read this book twice and I very rarely ever read a book twice.) and I fell in love with Lisa's writing. I have read a lot of her books since, but this one doesn't hold a candle to the rest."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This is such a departure from the typical Lisa Kleypas book that I am glad that I have read so many of her books otherwise I probably would not buy another. There were a few things that I didn't like about the book. My major problem was the reincarnation/time travel story in the middle of the book. I only read about half of it before I skimmed to where Nikolas returns to the present. I just could not read any more! My other issue was with the complete turnaround the Nikolas character had. In the beginning he was so loving and attentive then without any real provocation does a 180 and becomes a villain then again back to coaxingly loving when he awakes from his time traveling. What really bothered me was that, for the most part, I can count on Lisa Kleypas books to have characters that I love and H that are worthy of being called H. Unfortunately with this story I really did not like the H or the h. The way the H infidelity was handled put the nail on the coffin for me. He does apologize and says it will not happen again but two weeks later they are back in each other's beds everything else a nonissue. What did he really do for Emma other than stop being a jerk and give her some pretty words? Ugh! I have read plenty of stories where the h character just forgives the H for whatever lame reason after in a short period of time after he has treated her so badly and I was SOOO surprised Lisa Klypas wrote one of \\"those\\" books. It didn't deal with whatever hurt or insecurity the infidelity would cause her character that was already so insecure about her appearance and her worth. So...in essence this is just another story of a h with low self esteem being treated badly by a H with too much self esteem and then easily forgiving him to fast forward to a predictable and unfulfilling HEA."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Seeing all the bad reviews on amazon, I had the impression that this book would be horrible, but it certainly wasnt. I do not think the book was wonderful, but I do not think it is as bad as some people made it seem. Prince Nicolas struck me as cold, but I think it was only because he was fighting with his feelings of regret and guilt. I do not think that he thought much of himself as a person and struggled with that often. In the book, the characters see him as cold and unfeeling, but the truth is he is exactly the opposite. He seemed to me to be a very emotional hero the was just misunderstood because he did not understand how to display or deal with his feelings effectively. He had many flaws, which made him real. For one, his guilt of not being able to help his brother when he was younger. He obviously blamed himself for something he could not really do anything about. He also struggled with his love for emma. He seemed to be aware that she was everything he wanted in a woman, but was unable to confront his feelings becuase he was afraid loving. After going through all he had gone through as a child he seemed to be twisted in the head and on guard of his true feelings. As for the time travel business, I think it was kind of weird, but understandable in a sense. The characters seemed to have been reincarnated (Meaning Emelia and Emma are the same person, but in different times and same characteristics) and after playing along with the events of the past nicolas seems gain an understanding of what love is and succumbs to it willingly. So really by falling in love with Emilia he also fell in love with Emma. One thing I truly did not understand was how Jacob had such a horrible accent before that seemed to vanished after two lines. That was strange to me. 2 weeks and he was suddenly speaking perfect English."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I actually love the first 2 parts of the book. I don't even mind the going back in time.However, when he went to a brothel, it just skeeved me out. and it still creeps me out (I read the book yesterday and I'm still disturbed). Also, the male character was a complete, selfish jerk. He practically broke the spirit of Emma. and turns a nice, innocent woman into someone capable of true hate.i guess in a way, the author did a good job in that she can get such emotion out of the readers. but we read to get a hero, not a betraying selfish man (not in a good way either)"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I won't review the entire plot because I think that Misuzmama, below, has done a great job. But suffice to say that Prince Nikolas is such a boorish person that 225 pages into it I have run out of patience for him to have his epiphany and become a proper hero. SPOILER: I jumped ahead a little and I agree with the reviewers who have said that it seems like Nikolas fell in love with Emmelia, not Emma. If they are supposed to be the same person then the romance probably could have occurred in the present time, rather than having the characters jump back several generations and playing essentially the same roles.The Russian setting does add a nice sense of eastern mysticism which is different from the typical Regency Romance and English customs. I almost wish the entire story could have taken place in Russia. I can picture Emma as this practical, sensible, English girl who travels to Russia to save a rare breed of fox (or something) and is swept up in a grand, romantic adventure in Russia with a handsome Prince."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I am a big fan of Kleypas and have read almost all her books. This one is not one of the best. The book was promising at the beginning. A tortured hero primed for redemption. But *SPOIL ALERT* the back in time part of the book destroyed the flow of the story. You can pretty much skip those 3 chapters with the following take away \\"Nicholas remembered what it was like to love someone\\" and move on to the last part of the book. The book would have been better had the \\"learning to love someone\\" part taken place in the present.Having said that, I still think this book is better and more engaging than your average romance."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"this book was good but in order to understand this book you will definitely have to read the book before it."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Prince of Dreams was one of Lisa Kleypas early novels. I absolutely love her books, but this one, I can't say is her best.The plot of the story is super, however, the character, especially the heroine Emma was not well developed and up to the point, was contradicted and not realistic. Emma was a sweet,passionate, strong spirit and stubborn Lady. She was the daughter of a Duke, but worked, out of passion, to care for sick and dying animals in her Estate. She had everything her her family fortune could afford, lived a very sheltered life under her very protective father, but labored like a peasant of the village to care for her animals. She was physically a big and fit woman. In my opinion, the interaction between her and her new husband Nicholas, the exile Russian Prince was full of flaws. Nicholas, who was haunted by his miserable past in Russia, brought his dark secret to the marriage. He surely had a strong attraction to Emma, but at the same time, he was very scared and annoyed of intimacy. He was described as a \\"gentle and skillful lover\\" but at the same time \\"cold, and emotionally distant\\". After they got married, he and Emma stayed in a different side of the mansion, which was OK, a common practice in Victorian England. However, he walked into her room whenever he wanted; didn't matter if she was sleeping or in the middle of the night. He came to her bed to satisfy his desire and immediately walked out of the room, leaving Emma in the cold dark room. To him\\" touching and caressing were good only if he initiated\\". If Emma wanted any affection, he felt angry, like \\"getting burnt\\" and walked away. However, Emma seemed very content with the marriage. She went on her life to care for the animals during the day and entertained Nicolas at night. Her marriage and Nicolas did seem to bother her at all. Don't forget, Emma was a rebel of her strong will father and his family when she decided to marry Nicola. She was a very independent woman, with her headstrong personality; I am wondering how she could stay in the marriage and actually enjoyed it. Even though she rebelled against her family, her father offered open- armly for her to go home\\"if things didn't work out\\". Therefore, I think the plot and the character of Emma was not well thought out. Nicolas on the other hand, was a very complicated and twisted character, just based on the facts of his tragic, brutal past, his Russian mysterious and superstitious heritages, his exile life, his wealth, his handsomeness, his charisma and business savvy in the aristocratic circle, Lisa actually did a not bad of job portraying him. I would say Nicolas was almost a Bryonic character, on the dark and mysterious side, but not quite on the passion side. If you like Bronte sisters' novels, you know what I mean.I am a big fan of Lisa Kleypas. She writes very fluently and her story is fast pace, full of surprises. The story lines and characters were much well developed in her later novels. I suggest if you are new to her novels, start with the \\"Devil in Winter\\", one of her Wallflower series and one of her best and \\"Lady Sophia's Lover\\". They are on my top list of her novels."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I was desparate for something to read on a trip and picked this up. I was under the impression that this was a time travel book and was not very excited about reading it. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this. Lisa Kleypas is one of my favorite authors. While this was a good book, my favorit book by her is still &quot;Dreaming of You&quot;."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I did not like this book at all, and I certainly tried to! An avid Kleypas fan, I was eagerly anticipating this novel, but found it hard to wade through, follow, and got completely confused during the flashback section. While Emma and Nikki are entertaining as the central characters, their relationship and dialogue was not enough to make this a positive experience for me. This novel certainly follows a different formula from Kleypas's other books and I would only recommend it to her devoted fans."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I absolutely loved the first 2 parts of this book, it was on it's way to becoming a classic in my eyes. Then the author had to go and do the whole travelling back in time junk and it just stunk after that. I was so sad that my wonderful book took a turn to the darkside. When he goes back in time it's almost like A Christmas Carol where he's shown his past and then wakes up reformed and wants to mend his ways. I didn't like that he slept with Emelia even though he thinks it is Emma several generations back...it's still not her. This is the first time I was dissapointed reading a Lisa Kleypas novel but it won't keep me from reading all of her other books."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This is the only book of Lisa that i don't like. i read it once and have not touched it since. I found the prince disappointing, you would think he would treat the heroine better but instead he almost broke her lively spirit. It only got better at the end with what you would expect of lisa Kleypas but I expected so much better of the prince that even though the end was good almost great it not make up for what he was at the beginning."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Depth of character development surpassed that of her other novels. Storyline involved some fantasy which at first I wasn't certain I cared for. But as I read on it pulled me in. Heroine's responses I found more true to life than Kleypas has otherwise written. This had some surprising depth. I think Kleypas has found something here and should continue on."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"The book was all right. I disliked the character of Nikolas from the very beginning and couldn't fathom how traveling back into the past could've manages to effect such change in him. But let's not forget Emma, who was too head-strong for her own good and was blind to many things.The back cover blurb reads: &quot;A wealthy and bitter exile, the most dangerous and desirable man in all England, he burns to possess a proud, headstrong beauty who is promised to another. But winning Emma Stokehurst's exquisite hand though threats and determination does nothing to fill the empty spaces in Nikolas's heart--until passion's magic carries the handsome, tormented prince back to a bygone era of splendor and romantic dreams. For there his destiny awaits him in a distant life. And in one remarkable woman's tender touch--achingly familiar but gloriously new--he must seek the elusive promise of ecstasy...and learn, at last, to love.&quot;PRINCE OF DREAMS is the story of Emma and Nikolas, who first appeared in MIDNIGHT ANGEL.S."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I believe this was the first historical romance i read where the gentleman doesn't stay faitful the whole book. Usually the men in romance novels stay faitful as soon as they meet the heroine. Not in this novel, though. But that is what made me love this book. The fact that the characters were more true to life than in other romance novels. Bravo to Lisa Kleypas for penning another unforgettable read."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Kleypas is one of my all time favorite romance writers. The hero's in 'Then Came You' and 'Devil in Winter' are in my top five. It pains me to do this, but Prince Nikolas from 'Prince of Dreams' is simply a horrible hero. No redeeming qualities what so ever.No summary here, but simply why I hate him. He doesn't care about ANYBODY but himself. Here come the SPOILERS so be warned: Nikolas wants Emma, so what does he do? Court her? No. He sneaks around and gets rid of any potential suitors. What happens when she claims to be in love with one of them? He threatens the man secretly and forces him to flee to the continent. She's heartbroken and believes that no one will love her. On top of that she blames her father due to his former objections. Aha! But who is waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces? Yes you guessed it! Neanderthal Nikolas.Emma's father hates Nikolas. The prince uses that knowledge to lead her into a seduction knowing that defying her father would give her great satisfaction. So they marry. He promises her that he will do everything in his power to make her happy. Does he? In a word -NO.He distances himself physically and mentally from her. He tends to business all day and she to her animals. At night they make 'love' -if you could call it that, but he never lingers afterward and never EVER does he want her to touch him in any affectionate way at ANY time. Yes I know he's been tortured and had a horribly abusive childhood -yada yada. You'd think that maybe he would crave love? No. So instead of wallowing in his wife's affections, what does he do? He goes to a brothel!!! And he doesn't see anything wrong with it!Then his ba*ta*d son shows up at his front door. Nikolas is simply mean to him and doesn't spare even a moment of thought about him. He's determined to get rid of him until Emma, outraged, swoops down and takes the boy under her wing.So after being such a jerk how does Nikolas turn into a loving hero? Now that's the kicker! He's -get this- warps back into the past. Into his previous life. I kid you not. To the outside world he has simply fainted after seeing a painting of one of his ancestors, but in his head he 'dreams' that he is back 150 years with the love of his life -Emelia. So when he comes 'out' and back to the 'real' world he's a changed man.So now (seemingly with the snap of the fingers) he's in love with Emma or is it really Emelia? And this is my biggest problem with the whole book. The reader never gets any indication that its really Emma that Nikolas loves and not Emelia from the 'past/dream'. This disturbs me.So maybe the book isn't 'horrible' compared to other historical romances but it stinks compared to other Kleypas works. I HIGHLY recommend 'Dreaming of You', 'Then Came You', 'Lady Sophia's Lover' and 'Devil in Winter'.Avoid this book. Hate me. I don't care. This one is just a bad egg amongst Kleypas's shining jewels."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"As I finished Midnight Angel, I knew that I would be reading Prince of Dreams immediately. How I yearned to see what kind of story Kleypas would weave for a compassionate, yet untamed woman (Emma) and a tortured, soulless Russian prince (Nikolas). The story began with great promise, yet somewhere a wrong turn was made. The visions that Nikolas had were my first tip-off to the bizarre \\"pre-life\\" that would predominate the second half of this novel.I was really impressed with what Nikolas went through to claim Emma. He manipulated her and those around her unceasingly as was his nature. I truly felt her despair when he turned away any affection that Emma tried to give him. How could she draw him into a loving relationship? You feel her anger when he becomes unfaithful in his attempts to push her and his feelings away because you just know that he can never outrun her love and compassion ... but another betrayal makes it evident that there is a long way to go. I really was wondering how this would all work out. Then comes the \\"pre-life\\" experience and Nikolas comes back from this time of unconsciousness and is so different and wants to start all over with Emma and his son (by an affair). It was so trite. I liked the old Nikki better! I felt sad because Emma was not loved for her unique self - only because she reminded him of the earlier Emilia. Silly ending to what could have been a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"The story of the union between the cynical Nikolas Angelovsky and with heastrong Emma Stokehurst -foreshadowed so intriguingly in Kleypas' earlier novel, Midnight Angel- ought to merit more than three stars on the strength of its main characters alone.Angelovsky -like some of Kleypas' recent heroes, including Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent- played the villain very effectively in Midnight Angel. With another author his misdeeds might render him irreemable, but Kleypas is talented enough to find, not a redemptive light, but a core of humanity, even in villains whose actions would normally put them beyond the pale of the reader's acceptance. Emma is an engaging and suitable answer to the problem of Prince Nikolai: vivid, compassionate, and imperially willful. Their story might have been -should have been- as powerful as its titan principles.As you might guess from the rating, it wasn't.Kleypas' failure in Prince of Dreams is, simply, a failure of plot. Where she might have written an honest and moving novel that relied on dialogue, discovery, and a slow give-and-take of trust to bring the lovers to terms, she has instead taken a short-cut. Halfway through the book, just as the couple's detente starts to stagnate, Angelovsky collapses. This collapse pitches him back in time, to live \\"freed\\" from his traumatic past. This liberation is itself dubious, since Angelovsky still remembers the events that scarred him. Nonetheless, while mired in the past, he meets and marries a woman who bears a startling similarity to Emma. Through the experience of loving her he somehow finds the courage to return to the modern Emma, a new man, and capable of love.Kleypas may have been looking for trandescence or profundity with her flashback, but the result feels dishonest. Rather than forcing the characters to work through their problems face to face, Kleypas sends Angelovsky back in time to somehow expunge his guilt and memories -and with them, the internal conflict that made him a worthwhile character. The man who returns doesn't seem much like the Angelovsky that left. And the suggestion that Angelovsky somehow learns to appreciate his wife by loving another woman -even one who seems to be Emma in an earlier incarnation-- cheats Emma of the opportunity to make a meaningful difference in his life and their relationship. The reader is left dissatisfied, unconvinced by the Prince's change of heart or the couple's eventual reconciliation.IN BRIEF:Recommended only for Kleypas fans, or readers able to take pleasure in the earlier characterizations without letting the later implausibility ruin their experience."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"This is a story not to be missed! Lisa Kleypas' gift for searching the emotional depths of the human heart is to be savored in the tale of Emma Stokehurst and Prince Nikolas. It is the tale of two people who loved in another lifetime and whose lives came to a tragic end. Suffering from the wounds of that cruel lifetime and his current one, Prince Nikolas has locked his heart away. But when he is transported back to the past - to remember their life and love as it had been (not to indulge in an incestuous relationship - he was remembering, not actually there) - he remembers the woman who taught him love and forgiveness. When he comes back to the same woman - in his current lifetime - he remembers her lessons and strives to start anew with her and the son he'd denied. But he must earn their love and trust and pray that Emma is not taken from him once again...An incredible story!!!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Is it hot in here or is it just me? :-&gt; I just finished reading Prince of Dreams, and it was wonderful. I'd say it's one of my three favorite romance novels. I normally don't care for the time travel theme, but I was so intrigued by the Emma and Nikolas characters in Midnight Angel that I had to read their love story in Prince of Dreams. I read an interview with Lisa Kleypas in which she (probably jokingly) recommended to other authors not to try Russian settings, as apparently these two books were not as well received as her others. That's a shame because this was a simply outstanding book. Both Emma's and Nikolas' characters were deftly drawn, and Kleypas managed to avoid all the possible pitfalls I could see coming in the story line. Mikolas remained a masterful and exciting character while he was becoming sensitive and romantic, and Emma developed and matured in a believable way. The love scenes were very sensual. I was not expecting to like the time travel (or dream) sequence but it fit perfectly with the story. In all, I thought it was one of Kleypas' best stories. I'm only sorry that I'm getting to the end of her back list, and will have to start waiting for each new one to come out!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Judging from the reviews below, people seem to either love or hate the book. Personally, I loved it. Nikolas' character is Kleypas at her best, a tortured hero bent on destroying himself. Emma also has her lessons to learn. Through understanding the truth about themselves and those around them, these two come to see life differently and love each other deeply. I don't like time travel, but it's not really time travel anyway- it's more of a past life. Yes, it is a bit long, but the emotional journey is worth the length. An enthraling read!"},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I was not sure what Kleypas was reaching for when she wrote this book. I have to agree with some of the previous comments about both characters. There was nothing likeable about either one. He was too everything to show any sort of vulnerability. She was too prissy to root for. I read about halfway through this book and decided to reread &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me.&quot; I have read all of Kleypas' work and I feel she is hit and miss with many of her books. I usually really love the book or hate it with a passion. Unfortunately this falls into the latter category. I recommend &quot;Dreaming of You,&quot; &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me, and &quot;Somewhere I Will Find You.&quot; Her first two - &quot;Where Passion Leads&quot; and &quot;Forever My Love&quot; are also quite good. Her other books fall into the so so or blah category."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"&quot;Prince of Dreams&quot; is an entire storyline derived from two lesser characters, Prince Nikolas and Emma Stokehurst from &quot;Midnight Angel.&quot; If you liked &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; then you will also like &quot;Prince of Dreams.&quot; The characters in this story are much more vivid than your usual romance novel characters...even Tasia and Stokehurst from &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; look stiff and artificial compared to Nikolas and Emma. Emma struggles with the fact that she is an untraditional woman and Nikolas struggles with the conflict between his desire to love Emma and his belief that he is incapable of love.This story makes use of a past life/time travel device that I normally do not enjoy in a romance. However, it is handled well in this story and is an essential plot device for the metamorphosis of Nikolas' character. The past life dream of tragic love of his grandparents serves as the catalyst that allows him to resolve his emotional struggle. &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; tells of Nikolas' arrest and torture. &quot;Prince of Dreams&quot; deals with the resultant emotional scars from both his torture and his torturous childhood. The story follows the inner thoughts, desires and motivation of Nikolas in a way that explains and enlightens his actions from &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; Emma and Nikolas have a much more &quot;modern&quot; relationship than is usual for a romance novel. The author has maintained the character integrity of Emma. She is exactly the woman that you would have expected Emma the child to grow into. You'll read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"Prince of Dreams was the first book by Lisa Kleypas that I read, and also the first time travel story as well. Although she freely incorporates fantasy into the plot, it is quite believable. I enjoyed the fact that Emma is portrayed as a strong, independent woman who is also not the stereotypical frail, helpless, perfect-looking heroine. Kleypas is wonderful in describing the opulent lifestyle of the Russian nobility. It is also wonderful to find that Nikolas, the antagonist in Midnight Angel, learns to love again by travelling to the past. The description on the back of the book is rather misleading and doesn't indicate clearly how enjoyable this book is."},{"Title":"Prince of Dreams","review":"I own all of Lisa Kleypas books and this one was the last one I purchased. I was actually looking forward to reading this. However,was extremely disappointed. I have to agree with some of the reviews that the dream and sudden turn-around in Nikki's behaviour were strange. Does he ever really love Emma or is it Emalia? His behaviour towards Emma and his son prior to the dream was disturbing to say the least. I had great expectations when I started reading the book but had great difficulty finishing it. These two books with the Russian characters were without a doubt my least favorite ones of all her books.That said I think Lisa Kleypas is a very talented writer and I truly enjoy her work. The wallflower series is great and I really loved Mine till Midnight. I am looking forward to her upcoming books."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Mastering the Guitar Book 1A: Spiral (Mastering the Guitar)","review":"Very informative book.

And this, the third in her series of \\"Blue Avenger\\" novels for young adults, provides plenty of thought-fodder. Reading this book doesn't necessarily force the reader into a contemplatative state... it entices it, teases it forth from that part of the reader's mind that is too often lulled into a stupor when reading books aimed at younger readers. Norma Howe will have none of that complacency, all while providing a captivating, thrilling story with amiable (if somewhat altriistic) characters you wish you knew in high school. Blue Avenger (a.k.a. David Bruce Schumacher) leads an ordinary - yet peculiarly exciting - teenaged life, lending credibility to even the most bizarre set of circumstances. Truly a challenging and enjoyable read, this book heightens the mythos surrounding our regular kid \\"superhero.\\" I received my copy as a gift - and I have yet to find a way to adequately thank the giver. Norma Howe will altar the way you see some of the most commonly-accepted (or even ignored) details we've all taken for granted."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Wind: A True Story of Zen in the Art of Windsurfing","review":"A psychologist, a wife (and former wife), a mother, a daugher, a reporter, a windsurfer and spiritual seeker are some of the roles that Dr. Nadel weaves in and out of in this courageous, funny, downright sad and insightful book. Windsurfing is the metaphor for the wild and treacherous ride we're all on. The lessons she learns and articulates to her fortunate readers are solid and sobering. This well written, fast-paced book is a must read."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Wind: A True Story of Zen in the Art of Windsurfing","review":"Laurie Nadel's DANCING WITH THE WIND A TRUE STORY OF ZEN IN THE ART OF WINDSURFING moved me to tears, laughter, joy, and feelings of triumph!

Her courage is inpsirational to us all. I cheered her on thoughout the entire book! I will share this with all of my friends.

The book contains so much truth - personal, social, spiriitual - that its very multidimensionality adds to the richness of the subject and magnifies it.Her meditations include visits with a wide range of thoughtful authors, including Jung, Camus, Matthiessen, and a bibliography at the end lets you follow up to continue the journey you began with her. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dancing with the Wind: A True Story of Zen in the Art of Windsurfing","review":"I was tremendously inspired by reading Laurie Nadel's autobiographical book, \\"Dancing with the Wind,\\" an uplifting true account of how she navigated her way through a debilitating illness with no medical cure. Nadel's writing is articulate, joyful, and consistently entertaining as she shares sparkling insights into the fast-paced world of major news reporting, where she worked with Dan Rather, ABC news, CBS news, Reuters and many others.Nadel's enthusiasm for the sport of windsurfing is contagious, and gives readers insights into this phenomenally challenging and rewarding sport. What touches me most profoundly about \\"Dancing with the Wind\\" is the way Nadel shows how her appreciation for life's mystery and magic deepens and unfolds, as she finds ways to surf the infinite eternal moment of \\"now\\" and gets back up on her windsurf board to ride again. Nadel reminds us that through life's uncertainties, even though our health may suffer, and even though our jobs and relationships may end... as long as life goes on, there exists opportunity for happiness, however fleeting each miraculous moment of total joy may be."},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"Amongst an oppresive sea of disturbingly violent crime novels, nauseating adolescent vampiric yearnings, endless same-old sporting memoires, and you'll-never-be-good-enough-as-yourself-but-you-can-pay-money-to-try self-help tomes, this is a true gem of a book: it won't ask too much of you, it will just entertain you.Let your mind's eye lose focus a little and slip into the absurdly hilarious world of John's sharehouse days.

But if you're not an Aussie, you'll still enjoy its strong narrative and sharp humour. He Died With A Felafel In His Hand depicts the darker side of living in a share house - a living arrangement that often creates all kinds of unusual situations, merely because complete strangers choose to live with one another.This book was originally given to me as a gift, and I was unsure if it would appeal to my particular literary tastes (I'm more into the romance/chick-lit genre), but I was pleasantly surprised. The story kept me occupied and laughing throughout my nine-hour flight from Australia to Japan (which was great because I couldn't see the cabin's movie-screen, anyway).Although the book deals with some pretty dark subjects (death, drugs, abortion, and homosexuality), it addresses these topics in a light-hearted way. This is not to say John Birmingham is insensitive to these issues. Rather, he writes in such a way that you are reminded to show a little more compassion towards those living on the fringe of society, and to say a silent \\"thank you\\" for your own, less tumultuous, existence.Zara Stevens (Author - Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories)Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"Too much in this book is probably true, even tho I'd like to believe these stories of hellish roommates are made up.

Birmingham's comically detailed and slightly skewed vignettes from his days as a &quot;flatmate&quot; are a riot to read regardless of their basis in fiction. The book begins with a story of a mysterious drug addict flatmate that was found dead with a falafel in hand and it just gets funnier from there. Birmingham's tone and joie de vivre makes for an enjoyable read. Because of the nature of the vignettes, reading this book in small doses is a great way to pass the time while waiting for the plane, or bus, or ferry, or just killing time between adventures. If you've ever lived with someone that was a less than desirable roomate/flatmate, you will undoubtedly enjoy Birmingham's twisted experiences and witty prose."},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"This book is somewhat astounding... I found it a few years ago in the non-fiction section of our local library, and I thought it was wonderful! It's not a novel, but it's writing style is a lot like one!With a funny spin on life and emphasizing immense differences between people, John Birmingham details his share house experiences from right across Australia, with tales about the lives of other individuals. And the people he talks about are certainly individuals, with lives that are so different to what you thought was normal...A lot of people would find this strange, but my teacher got our class to read an exerpt of this book as part of our year 9 classwork! It's a very honest look at group houses, I think is what she told us. This was about the same time that the movie came out, a couple of years ago.Written with flair and in such a way that each paragraph could be a new chapter, this book fascinates, and finds a new perspective for an everyday part of life for young people across Australia.

The book has a sequel called The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco.It's very light reading, very revealing and funny, and not for those easily shocked (if you get to the end and you're not just a LITTLE bit shocked, I'd worry though). Highly recommended"},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"Its been 10 years since this book was first written and for the people who read this book when it first come out (like myself) it feels like a very quick 10 years. To me I was flatting among the \\"chaos\\" documented in this book and while never anywhere near as bad, most of this book feels like it could have happened in a parallel universe somewhere.The style is very easy to read and random in its structure - the laughs and the acute observations are on every page, making it the type of book you can flip into randomly and find a description or passage to make you laugh out loud.There is no main plot as such and most characters are only around for a few pages. If anything you could say the book is about growing up and a celebration of that stage of peoples life where you only depend on your self and you are carefree enough to indulge in a dirty jeans wearing competition or throw parties which are spoken about for decades. But to put themes on a book like this is really over analysing what is really just a good read and full of laughs.For fans of this book there is a 10 year anniversary illustrated by cartoonist Ryan Vella now available (not yet on Amazon) which is well worth a look. The imagery is dark, gross, amusing, gothic, disturbing - all taking nothing away from the original reading. Being a comic book it can't fit so much in, but he does get the best parts, be warned though that the sequence with the crazy flatmate \\"Nena\\" in the bath is especially unsettling.The big question for me in this book is \\"How much of it is true ?\\". In interviews with the man himself he said that 99% of it was based at least partially factual. Whether this means it all happened to him or parts of it are based on storied of a friend of a friend and with a bit of artistic license added, I guess only the author and a few friends will ever know."},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"Depends what your looking for.

It's fine if the stories are entertaining and told well; if you see that person occasionally and if the stories don't go on for too long. In this case the stories are about weird house mates and filthy homes and there's a whole book full of them.There is no plot as endless characters come and go and the author moves from one disgusting house to another. Neither the homes nor characters are memorable and nothing happens in the entire book - well someone dies. We're never really sure which city he's living in or what he's doing for work. At the close of one chapter he decides to leave for London but the reader is left confused as in the next chapter he doesn't seem to be in London at all. Birmingham mentions his band in passing and we only get a few hints of this later on.If these stories formed a story arc or we saw some sort of character development there might be a point. Or maybe some insight into that part of society back then. But all we have is an huge cast of people we don't care about and who did nothing of interest. We get practically no insight into these people and their lives.Only in the last couple of pages does Birmingham try to summarise or put things into perspective, and then it's only that he's fed up and he's decided to sort himself out and get on with life."},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"This book is incredible... the author makes something as mundane as an average students living in shared accomodation into a unforgettable narration with a serious grip over non serious language!! The humour in this book is not cut and dried to suit the taste of most people in this earth who have an interst in students lives, but neverthless its wackyness was refreshing for me due to its originality and innocent appeal of not desiring or trying to be funny, in the first place."},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"quirky, British, complicated, and hilarious; this book is very hard to get in the us si it was wonderful to find it here"},{"Title":"He Died With a Felafel in His Hand","review":"I must say that I have not laughed so much for a long time! This book is completely addictive and I found it very hard to put down - i really want to know what strange people he will be living with next. I have really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"This book about recent PhDs' experiences on the job market calls attention to a tremendous problem: over-production of PhDs and universities' increasing use (some would say exploitation) of adjuct faculty. Excellent as the book is, I am not sure that I would recommend it to someone about to begin a job search, because it is so terrifying and potentially demoralizing. I would recommend it to anyone in any other stage of academic life, including professors, administrators, students considering getting a PhD, and especially to someone who has already been demoralized about the market and needs to know that (s)he isn't alone.The authors constitute a diverse group, with different writing styles and opinions. One particularly interesting difference was authors' conflicting claims to being members of groups discriminated against in the job search process. For example, one author lamented his position as a straight white (American) male, while other authors wrote about difficulties they faced for being queer, foreign, or female.There were some limits to the authors' diversity. Specifically, there was little racial diversity among the authors, and there was no information about engineering, not even an acknowledgment that the engineering market is better than those described in the book."},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"For those who are weary and sick at heart over the long, impoverishing, and brutal academic job hunt--for friends and family who are having a hard time understanding just what you are going through--for tenured faculty who need to know what is happening within their profession--this book is an important find. It reminds the frustrated academic job seeker that he or she is not alone, not a loser, and not doomed to failure. It also conveys a real sense of what the academic job search means on a personal, professional and political level; thus, even if you are not searching for a job as a professor, if you care about someone who is,or if you are already a professor who cares about what your students are experiencing on the market, you may want to read this book in order to better understand what they are going through. Oh yes, and it does INDEED contain hopeful, reflective and intelligent essays on job opportunities outside of academia."},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"A very well-edited collection of essays from various people in academia--those lucky enough to have full-time positions (yes, you learn just how lucky they are after reading this book), those part-timing, those still looking, and those who've given up. An enlightening, frightening, and at times comforting look at what lies in store for those of us &quot;on the market.&quot;"},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"There's something for everyone in this volume. Virtually every job search experience possible is found here -- everything from whether or not to establish a gender identity to whether a tweed skirt is appropriate attire. A must-read for ANYONE involved with the Academy, whether searching for a position or not."},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"This book reflects the worst of possible materials available regarding the current job market. Many essays painted a horrible picture of the job market. Yes, it is sad that some people work hard to get a Ph.D. and do not get a job. However, it seems that most of these essays tended to blame the system. In many cases, those in the book who did not obtain jobs have themselves to blame. Academia is a tough field to enter. It is not enough to just have a Ph.D. anymore. This seemed to elude one author who indicated that he/she didn't have the time to publish. Another author eschewed teaching in favor of devoting time to his/her dissertation. The rules of the game are different now. Without publications and teaching experience your qualifications for many positions are tenuous at best. Others admitted to having bad attitudes, sending form letters, and having geographic limitations. Again, the rules of the academic game are that you act right, spend time selling yourself to an institution (a form letter can hardly do this), and open yourself to the possibility of relocation. Too many of the authors violated these rules. I believe that several of the essays contain useful information. However, reading 350 pages to receive only a few pieces of useful, if not common sense, information (e.g., don't be pedantic and argue with interviewers) isn't worth the trouble."},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"As someone about to enter the job market next month, I found this book almost completely useless. I already know how tenuous the job market is and I don't need the editors and writers of this book to emphasize this point. Frankly, this book just depressed me and made me wonder about the true motives of the editors--are they trying to poison other academics with their own bitterness? It's surprising that so many PhDs are so naive in thinking that the job market has ever been good for anybody in any field. Jobs are never guaranteed, whether you're law school, graduate school, or business school. This book reflects the dangerous, and yes, sinful, implications of tying the value of the PhD to one's success in landing a job in one's field. How about more discussion of the opportunities outside of academia available to PhDs? How about encouraging PhDs to seek teaching posts in public and private high school? How about spending more time celebrating how much one's accomplished just by earning a PhD? For all those facing the job market, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"On the Market: Surviving the Academic Job Hunt","review":"Do not read this book. It's the worst sort of academic writing. I have a PhD and I know that the market is tough, but this book contains no helpful advice, no useful ideas. It's simply a collection of laments by self-absorbed academics."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Bloodshot Lens: America, Islam, and the War of Ideas","review":"The actions and reactions of the U.S. before and after 9/11 has done little to improve its standing in the world, especially in Muslim-populated nations around the world, and Reflections In A Bloodshot Lens: America, Islam And The War Of Ideas probes the basic differences between perceptions of Americans and Muslims around the world. It comes from a veteran CBS news correspondent with strong connections to these world communities, reflects his journalistic experience, and proves a strong survey of not only American and Islam ideas, but how misreporting has emphasized differences."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Bloodshot Lens: America, Islam, and the War of Ideas","review":"As far as I'm concerned there are far too many biased books on this important subject of US foreign policy and the impact that the mass media corportation have on public and especially US opinion. The author shows with concise logical arguments and insightful examples how \\"news reporting\\" is done in the USA, especially with regard to anything that's considered Arabic or Islamic. Its interesting to find out for example that ever since the clash of the US government with the Barbari pirates back in the 1820s that the images constructed of that region and its people were extremely biased. Later when the US became a world and Superpower after the 2nd World War, the mass media outlets virtually began a tacit conspiracy to construct a image of Arabs and Moslems as weired, backward and irrational people, that blindly followed their \\"aggressive, and expansionist\\" religion: Islam. The cultural biased disposition can be seen anywhere in the US or for that matter in the West, whether on TV, in newspapers or on the radio. Only the Internet provided a somewhat more balanced account, due to its decentralized natured.Pintak does an excellent job (especially as an American) who tells us vividly that the atmosphere and response to 9.11. was preprogrammed, since the US public has been conditioned, ever since the end of the Cold War to see everything islamic as alien, dangerous and subversive, if not downright terror bound. He calls this propensity and almost habitualized way of acting by Americans as referring to the Others. It was also thus, no coincidence that after the sudden demise of the Soviet Union, many government officials and especially the military industrial complex in the US was desperately looking for a new enemy to replace asap the former well serving enemy image of the S.U. and communism. It is also well known that the US economy ever since the 2nd World War has not only been dependent on the military industial complex (m.i.c.) but that it can actually no longer survive without it. Without the lucrative and massive orders that it places consistently every year, the economy would almost immediately spiral into a recession at the very least if not depression all together.This book does an excellent job of explaining how the false and deliberate misreporting has implanted a new type of enemy in the minds of the US public. Similar to what occured during the Cold War, when Americans saw Russians as the enemy, they are now seeing anything associated with Islam or Moslems as the enemy. 9.11. and the War on Terror has only made things far worse, and created an atmosphere of fear and suspiciousness in the US and the West. Where the Bush administration has severely curtailed civil liberties and turned the country into a big brother surveillance society. It has been said that if people give up their freedom for the promise of protection, they'll lose both. This is precisely what is happening in the US, where a worse big brother state has been errected than what had existed under the McCarthy years back in the early 1950s when the Russians were turned into enemies, that had been the World War II allies of the US. Interestingly enough the same pattern or relationship existed between the radical Moslems and their Jihad movement against the Soviet's during the Afghanistan war that lasted from 1979-1989 because the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan in late 1979. Here also the soon to become new enemy was the ally of the US that even helped significantly to bring down the Soviet Union, that to many was the last empire in the world.This book is very useful in showing how among other things a deliberate government and media policy has conditioned people in their views with regard to anything islamic. The successive US governments and the mass media have worked hand in hand to construct a false biased enemy image of the Others. This makes it on the one hand easier to surpress any dissent in the USA to the precarious US foreign policy that Washington has been following ever since the Cold War began with regard to the islamic countries. On the other hand it fuels the so called \\"War on Terror\\" that simply polarizes the world once again, as it had been during the Cold War, which benefits a few huge corporations of the big business establishment and the military industrial complex. If this \\"War on Terror\\" is not to become an \\"endless\\" war the US government as well as the mass media must change their dispositions toward the islamic countries considerably, or else in a worst case scenario we might really one day have something akin to the Crusades in the atomic age, that could lead to a disaster for humanity."},{"Title":"Surprises: 15 Great Stories with Surprise Endings with Exercises for Comprehension & Enrichment (Goodman's Five-Star Stories, Level D)","review":"I find the series of Goodman's Five Star Stories excellent.

That's not to say that this novel isn't good, it is -- but it is a fairly predictable story and the revelations at the end come as no surprise to any mystery reader. There are multiple things going on in the book but all eventually comes together to wrap up the various pieces. It's a story of family relationships including great love and loss and getting answers.I enjoyed the book well enough -- it's fast paced and the narrative draws the reader in with the topic -- torture and experimentation on patients at psychiatric facilities circa 1950s. It's hard to believe that many of those \\"treatments\\" were allowed and even encouraged!In another note, however, I must say that the sudden muteness experienced by the child, Emma, in the book was never fully explained and then mysteriously disappeared. I'm assuming it was some sort of traumatic guilt-like reaction.All in all, this is an easy read, an early work by an author who has since become more accomplished!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"My first book by Chamberlain and I was VERY impressed.

She was a pyschiatric nurse, working in a hospital where new methods of dealing with mentally ill patients were being tried, and where patients were subjected to the most horrific drugs and brain washing techniques. Laura has a five year old daughter Emma who was the result of a one night affair with a man whom she hasn't seen since then, so when a much older male friend offers to marry her, she accepts to give her child a father. Lauras husband Ray is a chronically depressed individual who suicides in view of Emma who becomes mute as a result of the shock and when a therapist suggests that Laura contacts Emmas birth father to try to help the situation, their love story begins. Lauras and Sarahs stories intertwine so much that we are watching two stories simultaneously. The love stories are well done but I must admit to finding the treatment of the mental patients distressing in the extreme and while not doubting that these practices took place, some of them even government sponsored, I found them to be unpleasant reading which left me shaken."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"I've read all of Diane Chamberlain's books and loved them all. Breaking the Silence is the best one since Fire and Rain. Chamberlain is definately much more than a romance writer. Her ability to write about contemporary relationships is way above average, as is her writing style. This book is top notch and will not disappoint. Chamberlain just keeps getting better and better. You won't be able to put this book down!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"*********************SPOILERS*************************The basic plot of the book has been mentioned over and over but in my opinion, only Sarah's history is interesting and involves truly good people, as well as monsters of course. Dr. P, Ray/Gilbert and Stuart all were monsters, and in her way, so was Laura, though not one review has even mentioned her actions, let alone had a problem with them, nor did Dylan. I thought it good of her at first to see Sarah, but when she forced Sarah, a woman not in control of her own faculties, to participate in Emma's therapy, I was enraged. She had no idea of the hurts and traumas Sarah may have suffered, didn't know her at all, yet dragged her unknowingly to the therapist's office, without her consent, since she couldn't give informed consent. This was abuse, plain and simple, additionally allowing Emma to be bossy and demanding with Sarah, as though Sarah wasn't a real person, just a tool. When Laura, as well as the therapist, sat there and allowed Emma to demand that Sarah take the toy gun and shoot someone, Laura became a monster to me. I don't care if Emma never spoke again the rest of her life, treating Sarah like an object, and caring nothing about how she would feel or react, was monstrously wrong. Even when Sarah and Emma were found, only Emma's response was noted, not the fact that Sarah was traumatized beyond belief. I got the idea that Emma was a brat and a half when she had spoken, demanding all the attention and talking room all the time, and Laura allowed it. It isn't cute or acceptable to me. I wondered why Laura allowed Stuart to tell her what and what not to do, and not tell him to go pound sand down a rathole. Also, while being there when Ray killed himself would traumatize any child, I thought that the therapist's telling Laura to find the birth father so that she would learn that \\"all men don't get angry and yell\\" was the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I am sure Emma knew other men who weren't shooting themselves or yelling, and Dylan had every right to react just as he did when Emma was opening the gun cabinet. I didn't think much of the therapist anyway since she participated in the abuse of Sarah.The experimenting on mental patients was very graphic but not surprising to anyone who has any knowledge at all of the history of mental health care, or of history at all.I have read other Chamberlain books that were better."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"An entertaining, multi-layered story. Five year old Emma has gone mute after witnessing her adoptive father's suicide. Her mother, Laura, enlists the help of Emma's biological father to help Emma through the trauma. Laura is also looking into a mystery: why did her own father make a deathbed request that Laura help an unknown elderly woman in an Alzheimer's care facililty? There are lots of flashbacks as the older woman tells of her past, and it is slowly revealed how she knew Laura's father. This novel includes a fairly predictable romance, but it's a sweet story."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"Diane Chamberlain's writing is very distinctive and unique and I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book.Breaking the Silence was almost impossible to put down. It's full of fascinating characters and tons of mystery. The whole time I was just so eager to know what the truth was and there was plenty to keep me entertained until the final truth came out- which I was pretty satisfied with, in the end.I'm not usually a fan of alternating narrators but I didn't mind it in this one- it worked and it was very easy to follow. Laura is a really likeable character though certainly not flawless or over the top. Emma was interesting, well developed, believable. Dylan was way more likeable than I expected him to be- and Ray and Stuart angered me a lot.The ending was great. Some bits were a bit predictable, but the rest I certainly did not see coming. I loved how it all came together and made sense after so many pages of being confused and wondering how it could all work out. Overall, it was an excellent book and I'm looking forward to reading more of Chamberlain's work."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"Diane Chamberlain never disappoints! I love all of her books and this one is no exception. I read this book in 3 days and did not want it to end!!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"I have heard about Diane Chamberlain for quite a while, but this is the first actual book that I have read by this author. I am not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was an amazing read from an author that I cannot wait to read more from.This book is actually two stories. The first is the story of Laura Brandon. At the beginning of the book Laura's father has just died and her husband commits suicide. As a result, her 5 year old daughter Emma quits speaking. Laura's story centers mostly around her resolve to help Emma get over the pain and trauma of the two deaths that come so close together. It is the story of a mother's love for her child, confusion over exactly how to help her, and the resulting feeling of hopelessness for not being able to \\"make it all better\\". Ms. Chamberlain crafts a good story in this regard that will have you hoping for Emma and Laura to get their lives back on track.The real story in the book, though, is the story of Sarah Tolley, a woman in her 70s who is suffering from Alzheimers. Laura promises her dying father that she will visit Sarah. A woman that she has never heard of before her father tells her his dying wish. Through Laura's visits to Sarah we begin to find out about Sarah's life story, and it is definitely a fascinating one. As the stories progress, we find out that all is not what it seems, until the final clue is revealed in the end.I loved Sarah's story. I found it compelling and at times I actually wanted to skip the Laura and Emma parts and just get back to Sarah. As Sarah revealed more and more about her life, I found myself trying hard to guess where her story was leading, which is a real plus in my book. The more the story engages me, the more I want to know about the characters, the more I enjoy. And Sarah was definitely someone I wanted to read more about. Not that Laura's story wasn't good. It was definitely engaging also. And as the book continued, both stories really got me involved.The best part of the book, I have to say, was the ending. The way that the author tied all the elements in the stories together to bring us to her conclusion was fascinating. In addition, she took the story in a direction that I never anticipated. In fact, at one point, certain elements of the story were revealed, and I actually pumped my fist and shouted, \\"Yes\\", much to the laughter of my son. Ms. Chamberlain is definitely a master at crafting a story and knows how to keep readers interested and engaged. I have several other books by her on my list and am anxiously awaiting a chance to read them."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"The book kept me captivated. I was up until 4:00am.

It combines the right balance of mystery and adventure - with all the characteristics of a perfect psychological thriller.

She confirms that the mind, truly, is both a wonderful as well as a terrible thing. And while physical injuries heal, psychological scars usually linger on."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"Because of the descriptions of the experiments performed on patients in Psychiatric hospitals this book was not easy to read. But the author left enough of a mystery that I had to finish it to solve the mystery.The ending had several unexpected twists to it. I was still left wondering why Emma talked for Sarah first though. To get more stars the author would have had to answer that question for me and she did not. That puzzled me because getting Emma to talk was the whole focus of the book.This book is definitely not for everyone, but well worth your time if medical 'experiments\\" don't bother you."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"This book was an easy read for me, a good mystery about a woman, Laura, who promises her dying father that she will visit with an older woman named Sarah, even though she doesn't know her at all.

A great read!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"Diane Chamberlain is a gifted author and this is a truly stellar book! I literally could not put it down.Set in 1998, Laura Brandon, 40 is coping with the death of her father, Carl Brandon who was a gifted astronomer. He leaves with her a deathbed request, which is to check in on a woman named Sarah Tolley. Ms Tolley is a widow in a nursing home and she has the beginning stages of Alzheimer's.Curious, Laura tries to figure out her father's connection to Sarah Tolley. Her husband Ray, champion for the rights of homeless people and her daughter Emma, 5 round out her current family. Laura's mother died in 1966 when she was 8.Ray is adamantly opposed to Laura visiting Sarah. She refuses to back down and goes out to meet the mysterious Sarah Tolley. They immediately form a bond and Laura learns a lot about Sarah's past. Sarah had been married to a lovely man named Joe Tolley and her late Aunt Jane had a crippling case of agoraphobia. As a nod to her aunt, Sarah becomes a psychiatric nurse and has many horrific tales to share about the hospital in which she worked in the late 1950s. She also had a daughter named Janie who was born in April of 1958 whom she is trying to locate.When Laura returns home, she is greeted by a mute and traumatized Emma. Ray had shot himself to death and left a very unsettling note. In dealing with the aftermath of the man's suicide, Laura has to help Emma work through her trauma. Emma stopped speaking when she found out what Ray had done.Eight months slog past and Emma still isn't speaking. Emma's therapist is very encouraging and even invites Sarah to join them for Emma's sessions, which turns out to be a good thing. Emma has developed a real terror of men and think all they do is scream and shoot themselves. She won't even play at a friend's summer house when the girl's father is present.Again, Sarah Tolley might have more insights as to what caused Emma's fears to segue into more fears. She and Emma bond.So does a man named Dylan Geer. He receives a call from Laura, literally out of the blue and denies the claim she makes. He has a successful hot air balloon touring business and he wants to keep his life attachment free. His current girlfriend is a selfish whinebag named Bethany. More than once I wanted to kick Bethany in the shins. Laura counters Dylan's anger by sending him a picture of Emma. Once he sees that picture, the world changes for him.\\"Breaking the Silence\\" is a masterpiece. Sarah's tales of horror about atrocities committed on psychiatric patients in the 1950s bleed over into 1998, which is when this story is set. She is the glue that binds Dylan, Laura and Emma as well as Emma's very astute therapist. Their stories are heartwarming and this book might make you cry. Just a warning.At the risk of sounding corny, I am going to miss these characters. This book gets nothing but accolades from me.The Fifth Dimension's 1967 classic \\"Up Up & Away\\" could be the soundtrack of this book."},{"Title":"Breaking the Silence","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!Um.

Having grown carnivorous plants off and on for 25 or so years and having acquired many of the more recent books on them I have seen this book referenced repeatedly in the others. Published in 1942, this was one of the first to specifically tackle the subject and to describe the plants in some detail. At that time the plants were not generally grown by many people and therefore this book is more of an attempt to describe the taxonomy of the many plants that supplement their growth by capturing insects. It describes items such as leaf and flower structure and some of the experiments that confirmed their carnivory. In some places it even briefly mentions the habitat in which the plants grow, but it is not a guide for cultivation of these plants. As such, general readers seeking advice on cultivation might be better served by Peter D'Amato's excellentThe Savage Gardenor perhaps Barry Rice'sGrowing Carnivorous Plants. On the other hand, botanists and those seeking a more primary source of information on the early studies of these plants may find this one useful. Another book which in some ways attempts to cover both areas, although on a more limited scope, is Donald Schnell'sCarnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada."},{"Title":"Je ne Sais What? A Guide to de rigueur Frenglish for Readers, Writers, and Speakers","review":"Any devotee of the French language will enjoy this book. There's an alphabetical list of French expressions that have crept into the English language. I can't say I had heard of all of them before reading the book but, in several cases, the author includes a blurb in which the expression has been used, often a rather esoteric review in the arts. There's an interesting piece on the opposite phenomenon, the dreaded fear of franglais and the attempts to eradicate all remnants of English in the French language (an impossible task). The book is very amusing...a quick read that you can come back to from time to time."},{"Title":"Je ne Sais What? A Guide to de rigueur Frenglish for Readers, Writers, and Speakers","review":"I did not know the word \\"gaffe,\\" which means a blunder or a tactless comment, is a French word. Did you?Every French word or phrase in this book is described phonetically and bold font is used to help the reader accent the syllable.Many words are used in a sentence so that the reader can better make sense of how the word or phrase is used, but not all words are so clarified.Some words or phrases are given historical contexts or backgrounds while some other words are humorously illustrated. I like this variegated and entertaining approach because Jon Winokur, the author, wants the reader to enjoy the book rather than be exposed to a textbook.Here and there, within the pages of this book, you will also find a short essay about \\"Franglais\\" or \\"Gallicisms in English.\\"This lovely collection of French sayings ranges from the low-brow to the high-brow, extending to the average reader that temporary frisson of comprehending French as the French speak it.I use this book as a reliable reference tool for French phrases I come across in my English/American reading.

The writing is approachable with a minimum of high-brow art jargon. Hibbard also refrains from diving too deep into speculation about fine points such as sexuality and politics. This book is suited for those desiring an end-to-end introduction to the man and his art, or for those who have forgotten 90% of art survey 101, like me."},{"Title":"Michelangelo","review":"If you were to read only one text dealing with the great Michelangelo and his art, this would be the book. It is a succinct biography in which one also finds clear and well chosen discussions of the artistic works of the great Florentine. It would be fair to say that Professor Hibbard is a graceful guide to these works--he shows us the key elements of the sculpture, painting and architecture that made Michelangelo the preeminent figure of the Renaissance. And he presents them to us as the artist's life unfolds, so that we can understand the challenges met and problems solved at various stages in Michelangelo's development.The book is filled with a large number of black and white photographs as well as plans and drawings which, together, help the reader understand each of the works being discussed. Indeed, the reader would be hard pressed to find more than a handful of opposing pages that do not have one or more illustrations. For those who are so inclined and long to see more of each work, they are titled so clearly that a quick search on line can bring plenty more to look at. But the illustrations provided in the book are more than sufficient for the reader's understanding.If you are looking for a shocking expose of Michelangelo the man, with all of his secrets revealed (warts and all!), then you do not want to read this book. Professor Hibbard discusses Michelangelo's personality and personal life in detail, but always in the context of his creations. He writes with a deft and gentlemanly reserve that allows the reader to accept the facts without drawing unreasonable conclusions.The conversations about the well-known works - the Pieta, the David, the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Last Judgment - are all clear and helpful. The on and off again relationships with various Medici and Popes provides a helpful understanding of how and why some of the artist's projects were unfinished, or completed in terms altogether different from their conception.The discussions of the architectural contributions of Michelangelo are very good, and provide the reader with an appreciation of the sculptural qualities of these larger than life sculptures. Indeed, Hibbard's discussion of the Bibliotheca Laurenziana stairway and St Peter's are the best sort of architectural criticism to be found anywhere.At the end of the book, but separate from the extensive bibliography, is a section called \\"Notes for Further Reading\\", which, if followed, could benefit the reader who wants to know more.If you find this review hepful, why not read some of my other reviews! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Michelangelo","review":"There is probably no greater art historian in the second half of the 20th century than Howard Hibbard and this book is one of his best. Professor Hibbard, who has also written books on Caravaggio and a study of Poussin turns his attention to Michelanglo. This is not a rehash of The Agony and Ecstasy, Professor Hibbard's interest is in the work and the artist and not a study of the outward events of this great artist's life. I found Professor Hibbord's criticism insightful and interesting. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the renaissance."},{"Title":"Michelangelo","review":"This book was suggested for a course I am taking on Michelangelo.

Set on the steamer the Komagatu Maru in 1914, the novel focuses on a group of Indian men who are seeking a new life in Canada. With little opportunity in the Punjab of British India, the desperate band of Punjabis are led by a Sikh contractor named Gurdit Singh. Their leader is based on a real-life character who chartered the Japanese steamer to challenge Canada's exclusionary laws. Mixed up with the Ghadr (Revolt) Movement in North America against British Imperialism in India, Gurdit is also a canny businessman. However, he is depicted as a caring father-figure to his flock on-board. The novel builds up the expectations of the passengers as they approach Canada and depicts how their hopes are cruelly dashed as they reach the cusp of their dreams. The land of opportunity and plenty blocks their approach and a tense stand-off ensues. Jessie Thind, the author, uses the literary device of a journal and records the story as seen through the eyes of a Sikh immigrant writing posthumously to his young son. I finished the novel immersed in some of the characters and enjoying their foible. I was drawn to the author's brisk style of recounting and his mini-fables woven into the broader tapestry of the novel. However, I do wish he had taken the time to expand the novel and some of its characters and given more depth to some of the historical figures like Gurdit Singh and the Canadian spy and immigration official Hopkinson. That's why I give it four instead of five stars.But overall I was very much impressed by this young writer and I do hope he's inspired to write a sequel to this."},{"Title":"Making History: Pukapukan and Anthropological Constructions of Knowledge","review":"In Robert Borofsky's, Making History, there is a fresh look into the lives of pacific islanders.

It can sit there quietly until you need to care for someone who is sick at home, then it becomes a gold mine of useful recipes and advice. I would also recommend Florence Nightingale, Notes on Nursing, for other practical sick care advice, A Soothing Broth, by Pat Willard, and the 1951 Red Cross Home Nursing book for its 'to the point' sensible advice and quaint but very useful illustrations. Newer editions of the Red Cross book are ok but the 1951 ed is my favorite for practical simple advice. Buy the Fannie Farmer book. Someday, when someone is ill, you'll be glad you have it. :-)"},{"Title":"The Revenge by Love","review":"Although often lumped with the so-called expansive poets (encompassing both new formalism and the new narrative), Dooley's work bears only superficial resemblance to the poems of these writers. One will scan The Revenge by Love in vain for iambic pentameter or rhyme schemes; instead, one will find predominantly long-lined free verse narratives and monologues, prose poems, and even brief haiku-like poems. Dooley's references, also, are not as exclusively popular as those employed by many of the expansive poets, nor are his subjects as urban, nor his stance as urbane, though he is as comfortable writing about the French composer Camille Saint-Saens as about a rural mother who has lost her son to AIDS. Regardless of subject, Dooley withholds judgment, presenting enough detail to allow us to reach our own judgments about his characters, who, like their flesh-and-blood counterparts are an infuriating mix of the admirable and the inane. In \\"Zoramel,\\" for instance, Dooley narrates the predicament of a student writer who has slept with his mentor's student girlfriend. Through the lens of the student's projected but, notably, unwritten fantasy novel set on the planet Zoramel, Dooley explores the student's confused feelings of guilt, denial, projection, and rationalization. In the end, we can neither condemn the student too harshly nor extend unqualified sympathy to the morose mentor.Humor occupies a prominent place in Dooley's poetic toolbox, from the wry suggestiveness of \\"Politics,\\" in which a speaker reminiscent of Gore Vidal flirts with a young man under the guise of discussing his aborted political career, to the broader humor of \\"Dirt,\\" a dramatic monologue whose apparent subject is the speaker's childhood and very messy friend; as with \\"Politics,\\" however, the true subject, emerging from subtext, is seduction. Similarly, \\"A Little Hunger\\" explores a woman's rationalizations surrounding her diet as she thinks about her boyfriend, conflating the pleasures in ways that reveal much about her character:She hadn't wanted to marry anyonebefore law school and in law school who had timeto do anything but order in pizza and read cases? Mushroomsand pepperoni with extra cheese. Yum. At workshe could exist on microwave popcorn (unsalted,unbuttered, as much as she wanted) and diet Pepsi.Eric said he loved her figure, which was sweet, butdid anyone really love cellulite thighs?As elsewhere in the volume, the humor does not exist to elicit a chuckle but to illuminate character and situation and to leaven the underlying pain.The sequence \\"O'Keeffe and Steiglitz,\\" which probes the relationship of the painter and photographer through poetic vignettes, comprises the second section of the book and marks Dooley's greatest accomplishment to date. Here, humor, objectivity, and facility with various forms allows Dooley to create fragments from which we can infer a greater whole. One of the strongest of these pieces is the prose poem, \\"Lake George at Winter,\\" which evokes the wind-swept cinematography of Doctor Zhivago as it presents O'Keeffe's romance with poet and novelist Jean Toomer:Deep snow drifted around the farmhouse.

The same material can be found elsewhere."},{"Title":"How to Double Your Sales by Asking a Few More Questions: Making More Sales by Helping People Get What They Really Want","review":"Let me first state that the concept of this book may not work for some sales people. I have been in the Financial Planning business since 1986 and have read more sales books, attended more trainings, conducted more seminars than I'd like to admit. In my experience there are different types of sales people. One size does not fit all, nor should it. The beauty of the sales process is that it can be customized to fit the personality of the sales individual. The concept of Sidney Walker's book is what he now calls \\"Selling Without Wrestling\\". I for one have never been a fan of the high pressure \\"close at all costs\\" techniques that prevail in the sales industry, so this book was a breath of fresh air for me.The good:Walker gives you straightforward techniques on how to open the conversation and how to close the conversation. He does this by employing questions that ensure the client gets to the state of emotion where the sale \\"feels\\" right. The best salespeople know that people buy on emotion and justify the purchase with logic. The problem has always been how to get prospects into that \\"state\\". Walker takes you step by step and shows you how the close should follow as a natural progression of the conversation by using \\"feeling\\" oriented questions. The result is a natural, unforced conversation that if done properly, sounds like a friendly chat rather than a sales pitch.The bad:With appendices the book is about 120 pages. The first 50 pages were mostly a waste of my time going over the history of different sales techniques, and why we buy on emotion etc. So in essence the book could be reduced to about 50 pages, but then it would be a Book-let; a hard sell at 30 bucks. Since the first 40 pages are available as a free download on his website, I would suggest Mr Walker give the book away as a freebie if you subscribe to his newsletter.Conclusion:The material won't work for everyone as I believe you can train technique, but you cannot train personality. If you are the ground and pound type of closer this book is not for you. The material is excellent for sales people who are tired of trying to wrestle their prospects into buying. The techniques work, but you must have the courage to want to change and to trust the results."},{"Title":"How to Double Your Sales by Asking a Few More Questions: Making More Sales by Helping People Get What They Really Want","review":"Sid Walker's book hits the mark when it comes to how agents/producers can increase their sales by asking a few, RIGHT questions.

Aren't the client's dreams worth the agent's effort and taking the risk to uncover the client's feelings?Getting at the heart of why a client would want the fulfillment of their dreams should not be something to avoid - quite the contrary - it is something to be embraced and used to its fullest potential.

I don't collect them but as a publication designer I have an interest in the visual aspects of popular culture so I got a set...despite the price!Open either book anywhere and start looking and it soon becomes apparent that this is a very comprehensive collection, I kept coming across comics that ran for a few issues, sometimes only one issue. Each cover has up to twenty-five pieces of information, essential for collectors. Many show a cover of the only copy known to exist. The first sixteen pages of each book has text about collecting comics and their values. I liked the page in book two that is devoted to ads that appeared on the back covers, strangely some collectors only go for these, if you do, go for a copy of 'Hey Skinny!' by Mike Beller and Jerry Leibowitz, surely the only book about the subject.Author Gerber says on the jacket flap...''if you spend one minute examining each picture, eight hours per day, five days a week, it would require an astounding NINE weeks to complete the job.''

I enjoyed all of it. Herbert makes it an interesting story, or set of stories about people and places you may not have heard of or read about in the standard history books. The Forgotten Heroes made an excellent gift for a merchant marine friend of mine."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"Billed on the cover as 'the heroic story of the United States Merchant Marine', this book, in reality, turns into a case for federal recognition of the heroism & service provided by Merchant Marine sailors during the major conflicts of the 20th century.There are ample stories of individual heroism, of suffering of captive crews in Axis POW camps, of the valor these sailors displayed in getting the job done. There is no doubt in my mind the Merchant Marine was a major reason why the Allies won WWII. Without their sacrifice, it is doubtful that the Allies would have survived the early stages of WWII in Europe, or retaken territory after territory in the island-hopping campaign of the Pacific.The principal character is Lt. Dean Beaumont, serving aboard a freighter with the Merchant Marine. Very intriguing personal story, one that chronicles his exploits on the high seas, with other Merchant Marine stories interwoven. These are rarely known stories due to the lack of narratives covering the Merchant Marine in WWII.I recommend the book as a supplement to your understanding of the overall WWII battlefield. The Merchant Marine made the Allied superiority in supply and material possible.I do caution that the author tends to push the cause for federal recognition of the Merchant Marine quite a bit, at times making it a tedious read - tiresome, almost. I found myself saying \\"I get the picture - now, tell me more about Dean Beaumont... what happened next?\\""},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"In the Introduction, the author, Brian Herbert, writes \\"Under precarious conditions these merchant seamen performed extraordinary acts of bravery, they were the lifeline of the Allied forces, making victory not only possible, but inevitable.\\" In a strict sense they were not members of the armed forces. However, in World War II, the Merchant Marine suffered 8,380 battle deaths or 3.899 % per-capita; that was greater than the Marine Corps that suffered 2.949% battle deaths per-capita.A brief account of the buildup of the American Merchant Marine is given. Starting in 1936 with a vigorous ship building program, of which the liberty ship designed for rapid construction, was a key design. The U.S. Merchant Marine grew rapidly. In 1942 the U.S. Navy attempted to take control of the Merchant Marine, which the ship owners and maritime unions successfully defeated only to pay a high post war price for winning.A somewhat disjointed text narrates the World War II perils and accomplishments of the U.S. Merchant Marine which suffered horrendous losses of men and materials. Several examples of wartime merchant marine engagements are given; many will be familiar to readers of WW-II maritime history. Merchant Marine officer, Dean Beaumont, purser on the liberty ship SS Brander Matthews is one of the WW-II narrative vehicles as the text follows his ship in the Pacific until Dean suffered a nervous break-down and was returned home.Upon returning home, Dean Beaumont found that he, along with all merchant seamen, was not eligible for any medical benefits nor for the educational and/or financial benefits of the GI Bill. Had they been under the control of the U.S. Navy as proposed in 1942, they would have been eligible. Regardless of their heavy losses and merchant marine participation in all the major invasions including Normandy, the merchant marines in the post war period were treated as noncombatants, not allowed to participate in parades with armed force members, provided no benefits and were often treated as second-class citizens. Consequently, some ex-merchant seamen became homeless and many could not participate in the postwar prosperity. This book is a plea for justice for these men who gave the county their full loyalty, often giving their life.The text also includes a brief outline of the Merchant Marine history dating back to the Revolutionary War when the Merchant Marine was also the Navy in the form of privateers.If the reader has access to the DVDs now available of the 1952 TV series titled \\"Victory at Sea\\", they will find that viewing the episodes \\"Sealing the Breach\\" and \\"Guadalcanal\\" while reading the book will make the text more meaningful. Regardless of its somewhat jumbled text, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"As I read the book I am disappointed with the minimal mention of the men of the USN who, after a delay in the early months of 1942,sailed on the merchant ships as Navy gunners and communications personnel as members of the USN Armed Guard. On most Liberty ships there were about 28 members of the USN. I served on four Liberty ships and had a very high admiration for the MM as shipmates in periods of tedium as well as in enemy action. The inability of the civilian sailors to get the post-war benefits enjoyed by their Navy crew members was unfortunate but they did not sail alone. The book is enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"Brian Herbert's motivation for writing this book is fine. The U S Government treated the merchant marine (which suffered a higher death rate than any military branch) shamefully during and after WW II. Second only to the way it treated the women pilots who were kicked out without even bus fare home. For that reason alone, I hope a lot of people read this book.But Herbert makes the argument over and over again - seemingly on every second or third page - until you get really sick of reading it. Also the book is an example of awful editing. With typos on nearly every page, the publisher should be ashamed for serving the author so poorly.And one final complaint: Any author who presumes to write about the sea should know better than to use the phrase \\"knots per hour.\\" A knot is a measure of nautical miles per hour. To say, \\"ten knots per hour,\\" is to say, \\"ten nautical miles per hour per hour.\\" Anyone who uses the term \\"knots per hour\\" is immediately and justifiably presumed to know absolutely nothing about the sea."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"How did all of those troops get to Normandy on D-Day? Who brought all of their supplies over for that momentous day? Some of the soldiers and their supplies were brought over by military transports, but much, much more made its way across the Atlantic in Liberty Ships: merchant vessels that navigated the treacherous wartime waters in ships that would later be called \\"Kaiser Coffins\\" (because of how often they were sunk by enemy attacks...and how easy they WERE to sink.)And who were the men that grabbed the helms of these tin-cans, risking life and limb time and again? They were (are) known as The Merchant Marines. Never officially inducted into the military, many men in The Merchant Marine failed the basic physical exams given by the Armed Services. Their only hope to help fight and win the war was The Merchant Marines. And they streamed in by the thousands, volunteering to help bring needed supplies over to Europe, Australia, the Pacific Theater, and places beyond.It wasn't just WW II in which we find the heroic deeds of The Merchant Mariner either. Oh no. When George Washington and his army were fighting the Brits, who helped transport his legions of men? Yep. The Merchant Marine. From the U.S.'s founding fathers, to the Persian Gulf War, The Merchant Marine has been there, hauling our sons, daughters, and their needed supplies across deadly seas. And they've died in numbers larger than any of those in the Armed Services.So one would think that The Merchant Marine deserved a little recognition, maybe a GI Bill style package to help out those returning from wartime service, right? Especially if they were wounded during the course of the war, right? Wrong. Since The Merchant Mariner is not an \\"official\\" member of the Armed Forces, they get none of that. No GI Bill. No war memorial. No medical benefits coming anywhere near those given to veterans. Where did America go wrong? Why were these men (and women) swept under the rug of our society?The answers are in this book, The Forgotten Heroes by Brian Herbert.******************************************************************************The book basically follows the history of Dean Beaumont, the son of Arthur Beaumont, the unofficial \\"Artist Laureate\\" of the U.S. Navy (many of Arthur Beaumont's paintings are hung in places such as The White House, the first nuclear submarine, and in private collections...often valued at over $100,000.) Dean is an asthmatic and he fails the Armed Forces medical exam, but he doesn't give up. He joins The Merchant Marines and travels the war-torn seas during WW II. And when he returns to the States, wounded and much more savvy in the ways of the world, he finds that The Merchant Marine is a disgrace. They don't qualify for anything, nothing at all.Although Mr. Herbert tells a story that needed to be told, his methods became a bit preachy and repetitive at times but, even so, that still didn't detract from the overall history lesson the author gives us. I'm sure most Americans had no idea of this bloody smear on our past that never made it into \\"High School History 101\\".This is a great book for those who wish to learn a greater depth of maritime history, and for those who'd like to remember The Forgotten Heroes."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"I admire Brian Herbert's attempt to fill a void in military history. I'm a cadet at one of the Maritime Academies in the U.S. training for my license as a 3rd Assistant Engineer, and no one knows better then I that the history of the U.S. Merchant Marine (USMM) is grossly overlooked. However He could of been well served by having a historian co-write his book. I normally have trouble putting down a history, but this one I struggled through. The chapters and stories are poorly organized. For example, less then half the the chapter on the Russian Gauntlet was actually about the Murmansk Run. He could of used to embellish or give extra detail to the individual narrative he writes, most are only a paragraph long and give the reader nothing more then a taste of what happened. No doubt there were many acts of uncommon bravery on the merchant ships plowing through the North Atlantic and Pacific; however, simply saying does little to validate that. He tells of how a merchant seaman rescued sailors from another ship, sunk by a German U-Boat or Japanese I-Boat, but doesn't tell what the man did to save the desperate sailors or give more information other then the rescue happened. Another time he tells about was a merchant ship ramming a French sub. He mentions essentially no more then that, he doesn't tell how or why the sub was rammed (was there fog, did the sub suddenly surface in front of the ship...), he simply mentions it happened and moves on. Additionally he tells the same story multiple times throughout the book. I constantly found it frustrating that he would begin telling about an incident and then direct the reader to a future or previous chapter where the actual narrative is contained. While it is obvious that he has passion for the story of the USMM, the book reminded me of a high school or college history student trying hastily a paper and give is some weight with few sources and poorly conducted research: rambling, ill-organized and incoherent.To me it seems that he let his passion cloud his work; good portions of the book are nothing more then rants about how the government hung the merchant sailors out to dry after the war and how merchant sailors were regarded as bums, drunks and draft dodgers. While the first part is true, merchant sailors were denied many of the benefits enjoyed by those serving in the armed forces, he could of easily dedicated the beginning chapter to this subject, and used the rest of the book to show why the sailors deserved them through the story of the USMM in WWII. Instead he keeps coming back to it, and using the same stories, or versions of those, chapter after chapter to try to prove his point. At times his opinion is so vehement that you can picture the frown on his face and feel his blood pressure rise.He seems so intent on making a connection with those merchant sailors that he gives the example of one, Dean Beaumont who's father was a noted painter of naval images, to his own life, where is father invented the Dune series set in \\"vast deserts with dunes like the waves of a great sea, and monsters beneath the sand that are worse than anything Ahab ever faced.\\" And says that \\"Frank Herbert even 'invented' containerized shipping; thus my family had a connection with the Merchant Marine long before I met Dean Beaumont.\\" Unfortunately it is obvious that that \\"connection,\\" as far stretched as it is, is not enough. His nautical knowledge is sorely lacking, he often refers to a ship's speed as \\"knots per hour,\\" redundant if nothing else.Finally, while I don't doubt the accuracy of his research, he notes very few sources throughout the book, such as the tale of the merchant ship noted above that rammed a French sub. Which, besides making it harder to uphold, also gives an interested reader no place to turn for more information on the skimpy narratives he offers.If your simply looking for a book with lots of small tales of men in the merchant marine, but not a lot of substance, this one would fit the bill. I would not recommend it however to someone looking for a history of the USMM in WWII, either interested persons, historians or students."},{"Title":"The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine","review":"My father was one of five sons my grandparents saw go off to fight for the USA in the Merchant Marine.

In the meantime, he ran for state legislator and lost. His sweetheart died in 1835, and he had a nervous breakdown the next year. He lost the nomination to Congress in 1843, was defeated again for Congress in 1848 and 1855 and lost the vice presidency of the United States in 1856. Then he ran for Senator in 1858 and lost. In 1860 Abe Lincoln was elected president of the United States. The rest is history.\\" (Mtn. Wings, 10-26-2004)This is a most interesting and researched history of a group of unsung United States' heroes. Called the 'forgotten heroes' because the government refused benefits, recognition, parades, medical and educational aid, simply because they were civilian seamen. Though they have been around since Revolutionary War days (they actually formed the first Navy of U.S. in colonial times when more seamen died during that war than did the soldiers of George Washington's Continental Army.), they received no compensation and had duties which put them in peril. During WWII, their casualties were so high it was kept a secret.And yet, the members of the U.S. Merchant Marines, civilian 'fighters', they were called, were vital to the Allies' victory. Using diaries, interviews with surviving 'veterans.' government records, and historical documents, they are shown to have performed innumerable 'feats of extraordinary bravery' as they delivered food, fuel, even the troops which were deployed -- every essential needed in wartime to assist in our victory. Many perished at Pearl Harbor where their transport ship was the first to be torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.They even performed rescues of British Royal Air force fliers from life rafts in the Mediterranean during WWII. The SS Martin Van Buren ship was torpedoed off the coast of Nova Scotia. There is an account of Merchant Marines actually freezing to death. They fought along with military servicemen over a period of more than 200 years. Their motto has always been \\"Deeds, Not Words.\\"The were called the lifeline of the Allied Forces and were sent into war zones to transport troops, bombs, tanks, planes and their fuel, torpedoes, munitions, and other dangerous war material. The photo section displays these activities. In 1936, the government declared the Merchant Marine ships as auxiliary military vessels. They suffered more deaths per capita in WWII than any of the American armed forces.Because of their cargo of delivering war supplies to our overseas troops and transporting the soldiers into battle zones, the Merchant Marine ships were targets of German U-boats and Japanese kamikaze planes. Their petroleum tankers were blown up, and the merchant ships carrying ammunition which were torpedoed had explosions so immense that no traces of the vessels or their crews were ever found.In 1984, Michael Pare starred in THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT which depicted this very thing. In it, he looked like my high school sweetheart, Jim Darling. Since then, he has made more than forty films. For me, though, this was his best!Written by the son of Frank Herbert, whose novels about DUNE influenced my son Zach to write science fiction, he is aided in this research by a Merchant Marine vet, Dean E. Beaumont of Arizona. They'd met by chance on the ocean liner, Queen Elizabeth II and he'd regaled Brian with incredible stories of the Merchant Marine exploits and bravery under fire. Stanley Hildbreth of Oregon was injured on a Liberty ship (photos and drawings of which are included in the photo section), in the invasion of Sicily, told how he went on to take part in the Normandy invasion directly from the hospital. \\"I didn't want to miss the big one,\\" he'd said.It was my good fortune to know an actual Merchant Marine who told fascinating accounts of all the places he'd been and things he'd seen, leaving out the dangers he'd been in. Robert Wrisley of Pulaski, TN, had led (in my opinion) a glamorous career and had many memories to share. Many times I encouraged him to write a book, but he seemed more interested in making up limericks to entertain his friends. Perhaps his glossing over the dangers he'd endured as a young man in the name of our country was his ploy to try to forget the actual happenings.This book is full of valiant heroic deeds and accounts of so many survivors and their families who had suffered immensely. The losers in the war, Germany and Japan, were treated better by the American government than the men of Merchant Marines. These vanquished foes received billions of dollars in reconstruction aid. The Merchant Marine vets were lucky to receive cardboard medals which they had to request by mail.They were treated similar to our Viet Nam vets (only without the monetary benefits) from a government who wanted to sweep them 'under the rug.' There were no victory parades or \\"welcome homes\\" for them, either. They were considered as 'disgraces' and treated as such.Finally, forty years after the end of that war, they were awarded minimal, extremely limited benefits -- which were of little use to most of the aged survivors. To this day, they have never received the recognition they deserve. What is wrong with American politics?

If you can't read the original Greek, the next best thing is to read the Loeb (Harvard U. Press) Classics edition with facing English and Greek text. However, even that format might be heavy going for the more casual, but curious, reader. The Penguin edition is far from a watered down popularized version of the Loeb. It is a condensed rendering without sacrificing essential detail. The liberties taken by Williamson largely consist of rearranging J's clumsy seven parts into 23 easily digested chapters. The most valuable part of this edition, however, is not Willliamson's lucid translation but E. Mary Smallwood's outstanding notes and appendices. Her historical asides provide a crash course in the then-current scholarship on the Josephus Problem.The narrator is a self-serving,wiley ex-Priest of the Jerusalem Temple who was a &quot;general&quot; on the crucial Galilee front, until he was taken captive under mysterious circumstances. He cleverly prophesized&quot; that his captor, Vespasian, would be the next emperor. Meanwhile, J served his former enemy as an intelligence analyst and intermediary. Eventually, after the fall of Judaea, he became a protege Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus, soon to be successor. Using his own notes and memory (quite selective and filtered) and the official field reports as well as the war diaries of Vespasian and Titus, Jewish expatriate Josephus wrote what amounts to the official Roman military history of the war against the Jews. Yet he did not totally sell out. He managed to portray his countrymen as mounting a valiant, though nherently futile, effort.This is no dry dusty &quot;classic&quot; -- it is an exciting, dramatic illustration of how Roman military power deals with an intractable and fanatic province. Apart from Julius Caesar's accounts of his military exploits, there are few such detailed expositions of imperial Rome at war.If you have any interest in the crisis of Judaism, the birth of Christianity, the Roman War Machine, or simply a cracking good adventure yarn...this book is for you. Josephus' story behind the history would make an excellent topic for a screenplay.Jim Bloom"},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"A Traitor's TaleImagine if the only account of the American Revolution was written by Benedict Arnold and you get a good idea of what Josephus' history is like. The Jewish War is a contemporary account of the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation in 66-73 AD. In terms of ancient history, The Jewish War is unusually detailed since the author was an active participant in events. Josephus was born in 37 AD, seven years after the crucifixion of Christ, and he was educated as a scholar and priest. Shortly after Judaea erupted in rebellion in May 66 AD, Josephus joined the insurgents and was tasked with organizing the military defense of Galilee. Although the initial Roman effort to suppress the rebellion in late 66 AD failed, the Roman Empire quickly responded to the Jewish revolt. A 50,000 man Roman army under the general Vespasian was assembled in Syria and invaded Galilee in Spring 67 AD. Although Josephus put up a stout defense of the province, Vespasian overran one town after another until Josephus' own stronghold of Jotapata fell in July 67 AD. While most of the Jewish defenders were killed in the final assault or committed mass suicide, Josephus decided to remain alive and collaborate with the all-conquering Romans. Initially Josephus was treated as a prisoner but after demonstrating himself as a willing collaborator, he was treated as a guest. For the remainder of the war, Josephus remained close to the Roman command headquarters and was able to gather insights that he would commit to his history of the war. However it is important to remember that Josephus was a traitor (after the war he settled in Italy), and his desire to flatter his former enemies and to rehabilitate his tarnished reputation are important bias factors that shape the account.The first six chapters (130 pages) deals mostly with the reign of Herod the Great and the internal power struggles in Judaea in the 1st Century BC. Although this third of the book is only intended to provide the background history of Judaea, it does hammer home the reality of constant struggles for dominance by various factions. Jew on Jew violence was endemic. The seventh chapter covers the period 6 - 58 AD when Judaea came under direct Roman rule due to anarchy in the province after Herod's death. Pontius Pilate, the famous Roman governor of 26-36 AD, is only mentioned in three paragraphs. Jesus Christ is not mentioned at all in this Penguin translation, but the Loeb translation does offer a short section on Christ and John the Baptist. Certainly these chapters are disappointing in the relative lack of detail provided on recent events prior to the revolt, as opposed to the highly-detailed accounts of events that occurred 100-200 years prior.Josephus' account of the outbreak of the war is a bit confusing. Whether they were revolting for political or religious reasons is unclear. The relative impact of Roman heavy-handedness versus nationalist aspirations is ambiguous. Josephus covers the period May 66 to July 67 AD in great detail, primarily because he was an active commander in Galilee in this period. Most of this account is probably factual, except to where it relates to the author's prowess or the incident in which he was captured.After Josephus capture, the account then focuses primarily on the rival Jewish factions which attempted to seize power in Jerusalem and the Roman siege of that city. Josephus covers the four-month siege of the capital (summer 70 AD) in great, bloody detail. While the author's claims that over one million Jews died in the siege are greatly exaggerated since the population was only 600,000, there is little doubt that the final capture of the city was a scene of great carnage. Josephus spends great effort to paint the Jewish defenders in the blackest light as impious gangsters, bent only on looting their own city and eliminating all rivals. On the other hand, the Romans are painted in a very favorable light. Both these portrayals are colored by Josephus' circumstances as a traitor (during the siege he repeatedly went to the walls and called on the defenders to surrender).The siege of Masada is covered in only the last fifteen pages, with little discussion of the Roman assault ramp. This overly-succinct section, which covers the dramatic ending of the war, is disappointing. As military history, The Jewish War does provide interesting lessons. The initial Roman punitive expedition to crush the rebellion failed due to poor planning and hasty execution. Vespasian's campaign was methodical and successful, particularly in eliminating all insurgent towns around Jerusalem before beginning a major siege. The Roman Army fought best in open, set-piece battle but was several times defeated in confused street fighting inside Jerusalem and other towns. Untrained but fanatical enemies can inflict losses on even well prepared regular troops, particularly when the fanatics are cornered and their situation is desperate.Despite omissions that were included in the Loeb translation, the Penguin editors are to be applauded for the excellent footnotes and appendices covering topics such as money, provincial administration and Jewish bandit factions. The map of Judaea is decent, but the map of Jerusalem does not show surrounding areas where the Romans camped. All in all, The Jewish War is valuable in covering a little-known war at a crucial time, but the author's veracity is often suspect."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"The Jewish War is a very valuable source in studying the Jewsih history under the Roman domination. The book covers the facts happened from the occupation of the Greek in Jews, to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. In other words, it is crossing from the Old Testament to the New Testament. However, most of the events it recorded are not covered in the Scripture. Such events as the domination of the Greek and the Macabee reovlt, a period between the two Testaments, are always missed by the Christian since it is not recorded in the Bible. Also, the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem, famous to most of the Christian, but only know little. So, this book supplies a lot of information for the background of the Old and New testaments. Herod, Flenix, King Agrippas, they were the names that are familiar with. Therefore, to better understand the New Testament, this book is a must. In imitating Herotodus's style in writing history, Josephus left a lot of other information when depicting the Jewish-Roman war. This book is thus a good source-book for the solidery system of the Roman. How the Roman soldiers matched, how they fought, how they used their battling machinery etc. , and also the geographic information of Palestine and Israel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"I bought this book to read before a trip to Israel in 1999. It's a very readable English translation. This gives Josephus' account of the war between the Romans and the Jews in the 1st century. Most fascinating (and horrible) are the accounts of the destruction of Gamla and Jerusalem and the final siege of Masada. Scholars are critical of Josephus because he puts too much of himself into the story and because it is probably biased in favor of his Roman benefactors. (Josephus began fighting against the Romans, but then came over to their side when he was captured and convinced of the hopelessness of the rebellion. He tried to convince the Jews not to fight, but to accept Roman rule. He wrote this history for the Romans' benefit after the war.) Nevertheless, there are very few good historical accounts of this place and time. Reading it gives you a taste of what life would have been like in that ancient land during this terrible period. It's well worth the time spent reading it, especially if you plan to visit the places described."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Part history, part memoir, Josephus' account of the events leading up to and during the Jewish revolt against Rome from A. D. 66 to A. D. 73 is still regarded by many historians as the primary account of the war. Admittedly, it is a heavily biased account, a mea culpea written to restore Josephus' tarnished reputation among his fellow Jews and to heap praise on his benefactors, the Roman emperors Vespasian and Titus. I commend Penguin Classics for issuing a very readable translation that was written in 20th Century English. Anyone interested in getting a glimpse into what Rome or ancient Judea was like during the first century before or after the birth of Christ will find this essential reading."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"What Penguin has done with this translation is take one of Josephus's two primary texts and make it into a readable source. They have done a commendable job. The work, Bellum Judaicum, is, according to the introduction, more reliable than Josephus's other account, the Antiquitates Judaicae. I lack the scholarship to verify this claim.The translation is, on the whole, excellent. It has attempted to use modern idioms in order to make the work more readable, and this occassionally is jarring (did Josephus REALLY use the word &quot;helter-skelter&quot; in his text?). Given that Josephus was clearly trying to appeal to the masses with his history, however, this choice can easily be forgiven.The introduction and footnotes are very helpful. The footnotes are especially good at pointing out the places where Josephus allowed his literary zeal to run amok.On the whole, this is a readable and enjoyable translation."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"For those of you who are interested in what the first Jewish revolt was like, this books if for you. It's an eyewitness account to the events as they happen. Consider it the \\"official history\\" of the conflict. However, like all official histories, it shows a definite political slant. Unlike other histories, however, this was written by the conquered. The work is in the tone of an apology for Jewish actions and motivations during the war. Still, there is a lot more information out there as Josephus wrote several books. It is a better idea to go ahead and get the Complete Works of Josephus. The reason being is that there is a lot of information in his other work Antiquities of the Jews that is very important to understanding the conflict. The Complete Works will also have The Jewish War in them."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"I found Josephus to be an excellent source of history because he was both an eyewitness and a participant. Though undoubtedly slanted toward his own personal opinion, I think the events Joseph described really happened. He, at first, was part of the rebellion against Rome, but it seems he had reservations about the wisdom of the rebellion. He did fight, however, but was defeated and captured.After his capture, he apparently realized the hopelessness of war against Rome and seemed to have been surprised and saddened by the civil wars, murders, and political infighting of the Judeans within Jerusalem. He tried many times to shame them out of their infighting, and he encouraged them to surrender undoubtedly because, due to their disunity, they faced certain defeat. He is sometimes referred to as a traitor because he did not support the rebellion to the end. I don't think this is fair to Josephus. Not every political movement in a country is righteous and justified. I wonder how I would act were I were a German citizen during the Nazi era or an Iraqi during Saddam Hussein's defiance of international law.I found Josephus to be a very rich source of information for \\"Revelation and the Fall of Judea.\\" I am very grateful that Josephus took the time to write such a detailed account of what he saw. He writes his history almost like a novel. This easy to understand translation makes for very interesting reading. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"If ever there was a history book that you couldn't put down , this is it .

It covers the following events: the outbreak of the war, campaign in Galilee, the isolation of Jerusalem, the fall of the city in the hands of Titus, destruction of the temple, the triumphal return of the conquerors to Rome, and the Massada episode. The first version was written in Aramaic but latter translated to an impeccable Greek, the narration covering many details concerning Roman war tactics (Flavius Josephus was himself a general, first for the Jewish rebels and later an advisor to Titus). It fails to our present concept of how history should be written in the sense that Flavius Josephus puts in too much of his personal life, with considerable self-adulation.There are controversies as to how reliable is Flavius Josephus account (destruction of the Temple, for example), to what extent facts where distorted in order to set Flavius favorably in the eyes of his fellow Jews and in the eyes of his Roman benefactors. Whatever the criticisms to his personal life or the fallacies in his historical account, the fact remains that his writing is a rich source of information of a war brought about by the religious tension between the Jewish populace who had become impoverished through high taxation and the Roman government. Much ironical it may sound, but Jospehus with his shrewdness and a strike of luck was destined to remain alive so that we may enjoy and gain knowledge of a specific time in history."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"The print in this edition is so teeny-tiny it should never have seen the light of day in this font.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"The Jewish War recorded by Josephus (not the second war; 132-135) but the first one is masterfully recorded in this edition.

His sources were an invaluable help to him in writing this account.And once again the Jewish people get short shrift. Yet this book is a necessary evil and should be read,not on its own,but with other sources for a rounded history. Everything we read can be put together like a jigsaw puzzle providing us with the insights needed to understand the Middle East today."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Josephus in effect holds modern readers hostage. On one hand, he produced several of the handful of extant texts about the Jewish rebellion against Rome in 66 CE, with plenty of background material on the political, military and religious of first century Judea (a.k.a., the time and place where Jesus lived). This means that anyone interested in Jewish history, the origins of Christianity or simply Antiquity is more or less compelled to read him. And to be sure, he can spin a decent yarn. One does get a sense of the tragedy of this time period, down to telling details. (I had never thought about what a battering ram must sound like from within the walls or the sickening feeling it must be to hear one. And the Romans cleaning out the sewers makes for an eerie comparison to the Nazis during the Warsaw Uprising.)On the other hand, this book is occasionally ludicrous to the point of funny, is of dubious accuracy, is arguably anti-Semitic, and, in the Penguin paperback at least, is in the most insanely small font you can imagine.One of the things that is amusing about this book is the sheer drollness of the introduction and endnotes. It's pretty clear that the editor does not have a fantasy of getting into a time machine with a six pack and going back and splitting some brewskies with Josephus. The editorial comments seem puzzling snide at first, but once Josephus writes about his own experiences, especially when you get to the point that he admits that the other Jews really, really want to kill him, it starts to make sense. I can't think of any other author who is able to portray themselves as simultaneously clueless, obnoxious, egotistical and self-aggrandizing. This is not simply my view: the editor clearly feels the same. (I have to say though that I don't agree with all of the criticisms of Josephus. His accounts of Herod's family's destruction is quite fascinating even if, as the editor notes, it is disproportionate by today's standards.)Josephus' less-than-glowing personality leads to another point. As the introduction and endnotes almost gleefully point out, he is prone to exaggerate and write in a propagandistic fashion. After awhile, I started dividing body counts from battles by ten -- and then by a hundred. Some of what Josephus says is likely true. There's probably little reason for him to distort his sociological asides, and the way he describes how thugs rose to the top at the beginning of the civil war is disconcertingly reminiscent of descriptions of conflicts like Bosnia in a modern book entitled _War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning_. But the things Josephus says about his enemies are likewise reminiscent of modern propaganda. His descriptions of the Zealots could be swapped with the \`Huns' of the First World War or the \`Japs' of the Second. Likewise, his relentless descriptions of the nobility of the \`good' caesars (that is, his patrons after he switched sides) are almost comical. You can almost imagine Vespasian smiling to the admiring throngs while muttering under his breath, \\"Josephus! I know it's your job to suck up, but must you make those disgusting slurping sounds!\\"This leads to the possible anti-Semitism. Josephus is in an awkward position. He says that his goal in writing this is to give the Jewish perspective, but since he became a dependent of the caesars, he's forced to make Rome look good (mostly) and the Jews look bad (mostly). As a result, you can see prototypes of what would become hostile stereotypes. It's not surprising then that it was Christians and not Jews who initially were most interested in preserving Josephus' works.And finally I mentioned the font size. I do think that the historical significance of this work means that it ought to be read, with a grain of salt, by many, many people, but I'd say wait until you own an ebook reader so you can increase the font size because... you know how footnotes are often smaller than the regular text? Imagine a footnote's footnote. Another book I own that has the same exterior dimensions has about 45 characters per line; this has 65.The introduction and appendices are quite helpful; the endnotes, less so."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"This book would appeal to anyone interested in the destruction of Jerusalem and Herod's Temple. Josephus was born around 37AD and was a commander in the Jewish army (if really that structured)at the early stages of the Jewish revolt that began in 66AD and lasted some 7 years. Josephus was captured by the Romans prior to the attack on Jerusalem. He provides what can be considered an eyewitness account of what took place there. However, as many other reviews have pointed out, his account has to be taken with a grain of salt. Overall, I think his depiction is accurate, but some figures or numbers given are probably exagerations. Josephus had to slant his writings due to the fact he was then living in Rome under the auspices of Titus and Vespasian. Josephus would not dare to write an account that was unflattering to the Roman rulers. If he had, the writings would not exist today and Josephus himself would most likely have perished earlier than he did.Josephus briefly mentions the three Jewish sects of the 1st century AD, the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes. Though he seems to hold the Essenes in high regard, he himself became a member of the Pharisees after a decision making process. One thing that stands out in my mind after reading this book and that is the description of the beliefs of the Pharisees. The Pharisees ascribed everything to Fate or God. This is imporant as far as the events of the book are concerned because Josephus states both Fate and God were on the side of the Romans.You can tell that Josephus knew the Romans would eventually win the battle. Josephus was more concerned with the saving of the Temple. Josephus describes the different factions that caused the revolt and how they were \\"ungodly.\\" These \\"terrorists\\" were gung-ho for a revolt against the Romans while the average citizen was terrified. Deserters were killed by the so-called Jewish terrorists and their partisans. Josephus claims to have tried to talk some sense into these rebels, but to no avail. It seems that Josephus blames the destruction more on the Jewish rebels or \\"terrorists\\" than he does the Romans. He goes into gruesome details of the infighting that took place inside of Jerusalem's walls even before the Romans arrived. It was due to the sins of these \\"bad\\" Jews that brought the wrath of God upon them. He even claims this was foretold in a prophecy. Josephus is ultimately unable to get these rebels to surrender and thus save the Temple. The Temple was used as a fortress and became the focal point of the war. These terrorists defiled the Sanctuary and the city of Jerusalem and would not give up their madness. The Romans had allowed the Jews to practice their faith and maintain their Temple pretty much as they willed. The rebels, being so eager to throw off the Roman yolk and to perhaps rule the country themselves, refused to give up their agenda. Thus the utter destruction of the Temple. Though you can imagine the Romans were a little less humane than was portrayed in this writing. Yet, you do get the feeling that Zealots or radical Jews were largely to blame. At the least, foolish for their attempt to defeat the Romans at that time. They probably should have listened to the reason of Josephus."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Today I ordered the Kindle version of the Josephus' Jewish War which is a reproduction of the Penguin edition. I have read the introduction and Josephus' own introduction. The text is full of typographical errors! The errors look like the kind one gets when just doing an OCR without proofreading. This edition needs serious attention!"},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"This tells the story of the terrible tragedy of the fall of Jerusalem, and the end of Jewish rule in the holy- land. It is written by the Jewish general and turncoat Josephus whose powerful skills as historian are compromised by his questionable behavior in regard to his own people.Josephus does sympathize with the Jewish people, and writes as their defender. But he is also the hireling of the Romans and is careful to present them in an overly sympathetic light.This is one of the great historical works of Antiquity. It is a classic.And yet what mixed feelings it arouses . Admiration at Josephus' skill as writer , admiration for his attempting to bring credit and praise to the Jewish people, or some part of it- and contempt for his treachery.This work contains too the scene of Masada's fall and the powerful speech of its last defenders before their collective suicide.This is a crucial historical document.But the tale it tells is a tale of horror for the Jewish people."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Unlike another reviewer, I can't say Josephus is impossible to put down -- too much dry military history for that. But nevertheless (and despite the author's biases) this is a very enlightening book. What I get out of Josephus is how different Temple-era Judaism must have been from rabbinic Judaism -- more violent, tougher, more riven by dissension, perhaps a bit more like today's Arabs than I would like to think. When I read Josephus's early chapters on the Hasmonean dynasty (the not-very-nice descendants of the Maccabees), I kept saying to myself &quot;You mean Jews did THAT? Egad!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Certainly much of the histories from Josephus have been criticized as self-serving. Some of that slant may be based in a misunderstanding of the times where acknowledgement of personal accomplishments was not viewed with the same distrust it is in our time. So whether the telling seems self-serving or not, the pathos and detail that Josephus brings to this telling brings the tale to life and puts us in the midst of the deprivation of ancient insurgency war. Love or hate Josephus, we are forced to acknowledge his gift for communicating the realities of politics and war around the ancient Mediterranean.A point must be made as well to commend Charlton Griffin's wonderful performance in the audio version of this book. It will be one worth listening to again and again."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Josephus' work is a great insight into the Jewish War. He had the rare experience of seeing both sides of combat and living to tell the tale. His descriptions are vivid and engaging. The English translation makes this book accessible even for those of us who are just beginning our Greek studies."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Josephus account of this event in history is worth your reading, especially if you're interested in Jewish history."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"Excellent translation. I loved the use of modern idioms by the translator as that gave a certain ease to the reading. Josephus's work, however, proves that the Victors write the history as he seemed to forget that he had been one of the rebels in his diatribes against the Zealots, the Scarii, and the other partisan factions."},{"Title":"The Jewish war","review":"The Jewish War by Flavious Josephus is an excellent read about the beginings of Roman rule in the Middle East to the Jewish War of 66-67 AD. The Penguin Classics edition is a well translated, lade out and well edited edition of Josephus's discription of events. It is a wealth of information for anyone who wants to learn about the First Jewish War."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I gained a priceless amount of wisdom and understanding by following the authors clear and rich writing style."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"loved the book. loved the easy interpretation of a complex subject. cant wait to read her other book from amazon."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"One of the most simplistic, practical and meaningful books I have read. It is thought provoking and so filled with warmth and love that I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"breaks down every thought and emotion we have. It will help you realize the wrongs and that all the wrongs aren't bad as long as we do see them for what they are."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Let me preface by saying I'm new to Buddhism. I found this book often hard to follow. The author seems to go on tangents and often does not expound on her thinking. She will start with one analogy and jump to another and then end with talking about something different. This is probably because these were talks given by the author. Talks sometimes don't transcribe well to written words, which is the case here. Take, for example the passage \\"True Suffering and False Suffering.\\" The authors starts by telling a story about her friend, then she moves on to a friend giving her an article about suffering, then on to Shakespeare, then to a Sufi story, all in just a few pages. This may work well as a talk, but in a book this is just painful to follow ramblings.There does seem to be interesting philosophical points that the author makes, but it's beneath a sea of (sorry to say) garbage."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"When I first started seeking, I began reading both books and enjoyed them tremendously. Everything we are searching for in life is right infront of us but we choose not to pay attention. I recommend both books for starters on there path. They will help open your mind and hopefully guide you in the right direction."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Like the reviewer Michael from Seattle below, I found this book ultimately dissapointing. Although it does have a lot of practical wisdom, in the end she basically says all we can hope for is a life of \\"hard work\\" and \\"practice\\", constantly navel gazing our issues \\"for years\\" in the hope of the final realization. She obviously has not stepped into \\"The Mystery\\" Itself and therefore isn't able to write about it. In the end she leaves the reader/seeker at a train station, watching from the sidelines as the train swishes by time after time. The seeker is never seemingly able to actually get on the train, reminding me of Harry Potter unable to find the portal into Reality. Dejected, the seeker is resigned to a life of \\"hard work\\" and \\"practice.\\" If this is what Zen is, no thank you... One would be served better by reading books like Adyashanti's Emptiness Dancing, Leo Hartong's Awakening to the Dream and Eli Jaxon-Bear's Sudden Awakening."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This item was given as a gift to a friend, who specifically requested it, and expressed great satisfaction on receiving it. Pricing, delivery and product integrity were all satisfactory. My rating it a 4 out of a possible 5 reflects only the fact that I lack first hand experience with the purchased item, and can only reflect the limited information conveyed to me by its recipient."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"In a nutshell, Zen is meaningless without meditation. It is the basis of Zen. Charlotte Joko Beck's books are not instruction books on how to meditate, nor are they an introduction to the basic ideas of Zen Buddhism. Her books are also, I think, not very conrete."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"In my opinion, this book is poorly written. It's author has fundamental misunderstandings regarding mind/body/spirit, and yet approaches the subject as though she has the truth in hand. The approach feels oddly like an elementary school teacher leading her students to the blessed truth. I don't know; it's just...too dogmatic, and from time to time there are concepts presented which will make you (as an intelligent reader) WINCE! I mean, actually WINCE! It's soooo poor, that I THREW it away rather than leave it for another reader to stumble upon at my local coffeehouse. Save your money. (THAT'S a concept you can take to the bank!)"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This is not an easy read for someone new to Zen....Maybe better suited to a seasoned practitioner. I'm looking for a more beginner friendly book."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Many people consider zen as some sort of high-brow philosophy. Undecipherble koans and austere living habits. This is a book that explains the essence of zen and how it is applicable to everyday life. It's really nothing more than \\"mindfulness\\" and the conscientious performance of the most trivial of daily acts. Charlotte Beck was instrumental in bringing zen out of it's foreign and exotic context and explaining it's true meaning to the american novice. These are informal talks given during the sesshins (meditation weekends) she conducted in various retreats throughout the world. They touch upon all aspects of life and are illuminating at times."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I bought this book nearly two years ago and read it all within days. After a few months I read exerpts here and there and always found something new and interesting. I agree with everything Charlotte says here. And since I began actually sitting 7 months ago, Zen makes even more sense. The different lingo won't go over your head here. This book is a classic because your Zen practice will be enriched every time you open the book."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This has been one of my favorite books on Zen since it came out. It has been a tremendous source of encouragement to me and a reliable guide when I feel my own practice waning. What I love most are her personal stories and the way she weaves them into the Zen teachings. As others have pointed out, she never presents herself as anything other than a fellow traveler with worries and troubles just like the rest of us. It's therefore very accessible.Another recommendation that fits this bill would be \\"Being Zen\\" by Ezra Bayda. From the same school of Zen, it's just as honest and the teachings are just as plain-spoken. Newer books on Zen I've enjoyed and have been recommending are \\"Hand Wash Cold\\" by Karen Maezen Miller and \\"Buddha in the Classroom\\" by Donna Quesada. Although the former applies her Zen practice and directs her writings to domestic life and the latter to her teaching life, in each case--as with \\"Everyday Zen\\"--there are no holds barred when it comes to personal stories of suffering and triumph, and the Zen teachings in each case are richly intertwined with those stories."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Charlotte Joko Beck has written a brilliant introduction for Westerners on the practice of Soto Zen. Soto is the Zen school that practices \\"just sitting\\", and is similar to (but less structured than) the mindfulness practices that are so popular today. This book illuminates the value of Soto Zen and offers invaluable instruction in the practice of meditation and the philosophy of Zen. Her approach seems influenced by the work of Krishnamurti, and this adds a helpful, contemporary feel to her teaching."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Timing is everything is life. When I was first given this book, I wasn't open to it's message. MY ego didn't want to be a no-thing. However, I found the book on the shelf after having a baby and it became alive to me. Each word spoke to me with practical applications to life. Perhaps I was more open to this philosophy after the baby. This book along with The Power of Now, gave me clear insight and became a practical guide for a more peaceful existance. It doesn't contradict any religious beliefs, it is more a matter of finding peace and contentement, in\\" Everyday Life.\\" Nothing magical, just reality. The time may be right for you to read this philosophy."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I've read many of these books and I find myself buying this one for friends and family. It's clearly written for beginners and I really like it."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I've read a bunch of books on Zen and on other lineages, and looked through a bunch more, and this is really the one that has spoken to me the most, by far. It's specific, wise, relevant, and somehow just generally brings things home in a way that others don't."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Great book!!Relates Zen to \\"day-to-day\\" American cultural attitudes. Not just some esoteric text (not that there is anything wrong with that!)."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"One of the best introductory book on Zen practice. Very practical, applicable guides to life-centered living. Joko helps the reader integrate Zen lessons into everyday living. She illustrates how meditation and practice are not only on the cushion but in our daily lives, that the real practice is not during sitting but involved with our actions. We sit not to be better at sitting but to be better at living."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This is one of my favorite books on Zen. Charlotte Joko Beck was the founder and resident Zen teacher of the Zen Center of San Diego, and \\"Everyday Zen\\" is a collection of her talks. Joko speaks about Zen in an ordinary, conversational, down-to-earth way--as opposed to the paradoxical, poetic, non-logical style often found in Zen--and she explicitly relates Zen to everyday life. For Joko, Zen is about being OK with everything, an OK-ness that does not imply fatalism, passivity, or an absence of feelings. She says: \\"For something to be OK, it doesn't mean that I don't scream or cry or protest or hate it. . . . What _is_ the enlightened state? When there is no longer any separation between myself and the circumstances of my life, whatever they may be, that is it.\\"While this book is a good one for newcomers to Zen--and for old-timers too--it does not include nitty-gritty beginning instruction in Zen meditation, so for that you'll need to look elsewhere. (I'd recommend the book \\"The Three Pillars of Zen,\\" the video \\"The Secret Is There Are No Secrets,\\" or a Zen center.)This is not the best Zen book for everyone. When you're in a swamp of existential angst, desperately wanting to know that peace and joy can be found within this fleeting life so full of suffering--exactly the issues Zen addresses--Joko's \\"everyday\\" approach can be exasperating and can seem not to address those issues, and you might prefer \\"The Three Pillars of Zen\\" or \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.\\" I appreciate Joko's wariness of leading us astray with images of \\"enlightenment,\\" which is so easily misunderstood as a thing we can achieve that will make our lives perfect at last, but sometimes I want more reminders than Joko offers that our life can be utterly transformed (while still being the same old, imperfect life)."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I've read quite a few books over the past few months in my search to &quot;understand Zen&quot; (yes, I *know* that's a contradiction in terms!). But &quot;Everyday Zen&quot; is really the first that helped me see how Zen can operate in the midst of my modern American life -- outside of a monastic environment, dealing with business and family and the other assorted miseries of the late 20th century. Her style is forthright and no-nonsense; excuse the sexism, but it's almost as if you had a plain-spoken old aunt who simply told you the truth about the birds and the bees when everyone else was hemming and hawing and quoting Robert Browning. I recommend this book HIGHLY to anyone new to Zen who struggles, as I do, with how to place it into a modern context"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Joko Beck's thesis is a simple one: That life, just as it is at any moment, is all that it can be and therefore is perfect. Pointing again and again to the troubles we cause ourselves by living life not in the moment, but out of a confused fog of fantasies and &quot;what ifs,&quot; Beck challenges us to divest ourselves of our mental defense mechanisms and dare to be OK with life as it is. Yet she is a compassionate teacher, intimately familiar with human weaknesses and struggles, and she extends one hand of comfort even as the other hand pulls the rug out from under our feet. Perhaps the only shortcoming of this book is that it is much more clear about the &quot;deconstructive&quot; aspect of Zen practice than about exploring the ultimate manifestations and benefits of enlightenment. Knowing her aversion to &quot;holding out cookies,&quot; however, this absence is understandable."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I purchased this book back in 1992, got half-way through it, couldn't understand it, and put it down to read other things and go on with my life of everyday living, thinking, worrying, etc. that we all do in our lives. Not until a crisis of sorts came up in my life did I pick it up again. This time, it all made sense. Living life in the present moment, right here, now. Working at being less judgemental. Not looking for 'happiness' and instead finding joy in everyday life. I know it sounds like a lot of BS, but something changed after the second reading of this book, and now mundane aspects of my job are just me doing my work. I haven't changed religions, haven't joined a cult, haven't even attended a 'zendo' or 'sesshin.' But something has changed since reading this book. It could be the thing that changes your life, too. I know I've got a long way to go, but what a start! The companion second book by Joko is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I remember buying \\"Everyday Zen\\" in 1990 because of Robert Aitken's recommendation on the back cover. Still, I was pretty overloaded with Zen books; this one collected dust for a few months. When I finally did open it I was amazed; this was the first time I had encountered the radical suggestion: OUR LIFE IS OUR PRACTICE!!! It was a real eye opener. I reread it three or four time in a row. My teachers in Rochester were pretty unimpressed; they thought that Joko was for people \\"who weren't ready for Zen.\\" (One of them really did say that!) I thought otherwise; her work addressed the disconnect between a practice created for those in monasteries and the \\"self-centered dream\\" of our lives. It baffled me that people would be having \\"openings\\" in the Zendo and then treat their family like dirt after a retreat. She taught that working with our family \\"issues\\" was not something separate than our practice on the cushions in the meditation hall. No duality.I ended up working with Joko for about five years. She was (and is) every bit as remarkable in real life as she was in her book. There isn't a lot of drama in this practice. Our life becomes less of a soap opera and becomes more mundane. From that ordinariness emerge joy, compassion, love and all of the other aspects of our true nature. You might have fewer of the kind of lightening bolts of a traditional practice. Instead, you will have a grounded life which brings peace rather than pain into this world."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I find the title of this book to be a bit misleading - it implies a sort of general applicability characteristic of perhaps the large majority of books on &quot;zen&quot; and &quot;Buddhism&quot; which have overwhelmed the market in recent years. Love and work, who wouldn't want to resolve these two koans. Joko Beck, in this book, gives us much more than a series of little chickensoup feel-good stories about love and work. In what is essentially a compilation of her talks for sesshin students, she tries to goad us into what really cannot be expressed, cannot be talked about - into the awareness of the moment. This book therefore cannot be *read*, it has to be *felt* with that mixture of gratitude, abandon, sensitivity and faith that one works on during the sesshin. One therefore cannot use it to &quot;learn&quot; something about zen. As a tool for zen practice, however, i have found it over the years to be invaluable. i come to this book again and again for inspiration and support - i 'd rank it, together with S. Suzuki's Beginner's Mind as the best book on zen practice available to us today. What (arguably) makes it even more valuable to us are its syncretic elements: Everyday Zen is written by a Westerner who sees her life from a perspective of an American, yet it also possesses the sensitivity to the workings of one's mind, the ferocity needed to face the mind's endless evasive maneouvers and a dedication to cultivation of awareness that matches that of any Japanese zen master, indeed, that of any spiritual master anywhere. In short, if you want to practice zen as opposed to &quot;studying&quot; it, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Dear readers, if you were drawn to this book as I was then you must also seek insight and a better quality of life. I have many books on Zen and books related to self-inquiry in general. Everything ranging from Thomas Cleary's translated classics to Allan Watts, D.T. Suzuki, Krishnamurti, to the mammoth book, Zen and the Brain. Not one of them spoke to me as intimately as this book did. This is wisdom for the people of our age. In some of the passages within this book, I found myself thinking &quot;of course!! that makes so much sense!!&quot; In summmarizing the book, its primary message is to just &quot;live your life and do not seek the truth anywhere else.&quot; I especially admire Joko Beck's groundedness. She is not an egomaniac guru who puts herself upon a pedestal and challenges the words of other teachers. Her attitude is something like &quot;Nothing to gain, nothing to lose. If you want to hear a little about the insight that I have then listen, if not, continue on to the next book. It's up to you.&quot; So if you have been searching as I have then please consider reading this book before spending another dollar on any Zen self-help book. I promise you that you will not be able to turn away from the priceless wisdom that are within these pages."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Good book by a real practitioner. It lightly touches every significant aspect of life. Very easy read. It also explains what Zen practice is and what isn't. There are too many books on as quazi-buddhism, unnecessarily complicating Zen with self-invented garbage. Zen is simply about being.It is written in simple language and may be read by anyone. Everyone is a beginner in Zen, anyway.Most importantly, the author does not present her writings as the absolute truth. Zen is about questioning, and Beck repeats it over and over again.If anything, the book requires an open mind. As it is said, \\"On a withered tree, a flower blooms\\"."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Back in the early 80's I read a few very scholarly volumes about Zen. They were great at giving a total novice some idea of the formation and history of Zen. They were full of very strict admonishments, you must live very austere existence, live off almost nothing, and be almost perfect before you even begin.Twenty years on and I am interested again in Zen. This book is such a contrast to those early volumes. It teaches you that none of us are perfect, and each of us needs to move at a suitable pace for where we are now. It might be helpful if before reading this book you have some theoretical knowledge of how Zen came to be and what it's about, but I don't feel that is essential. If you are like me you will have decided you want to know about Zen or wish to begin practicing and you will find someone (a teacher) to help start you on the path, and they will recommend this book to you.The writer seems to know EXACTLY how I'm feeling and writes in a style that speaks to the inner me, rather than talking to all the perfect people I envisaged would be the only ones to take up Zen practice...i.e. she de-esoteric-orises the subject. She also sounds like she must have experienced the doubts, the hopes, and all the other up's and downs that we all go through.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This book has changed my life. Suffering deconstructed effectively. No riddles, no koans. Incisive, tough, human, compassionate. It works.Also recommended: &quot;Thoughts without a Thinker&quot; by Mark Epstein, not as simple, but explains the link between Zen and therapy"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience. Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life. The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English. Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students. What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life. Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation. Quite useful!I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Once again we are fortunate to have the words and wisdom of one of the great voices in contemporary Buddhism-I highly recommend along with FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz and BEING ZEN by Ezra Bayda."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It was difficult for me to finish only because it's so profound. Every few pages I had to stop and spend a few days thinking about what I'd just read. I feel like buying this book for everyone I know. Buy it for yourself; you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I bought this book 7 years ago in 1993 and have dipped into it every few months ever since. It's a great roadmap for the difficult job of letting go of your self amongst the traffic of daily life. If you have some will to serve others in addition to serving your self, then this book may help you to increase that in your daily routine. It's written in a way that transcends Zen Buddhism enough to be very useful to people practicing other religions too, and even quotes parallel teachings from Christianity and Sufism(Islam). Direct, Simple, Honest."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This book will strike some people as too simple, but there is a lot of truth in what the author has to say. For many Western people, Zen is never going to be a monastic career, and none of the truths central to it, are lost by being lived out in the fruitful bathos of daily life. Indeed, it might be there that most of us are going to discover what's truly important in life - and, what's unimportant. Where else is there - to look?My only reservation about the book, is that it tends to play down peak experiences - born of Zen practice, which are,in a sense, akin to what you might experience in a Zendo. Still,if the great potentiality of Zen is to be found in 'chopping wood, carrying water' - why not begin in your own back yard?"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This \\"review\\" is not a reflection on Joko Beck's book.

The reader should know something of Buddhism and something of Zen practice in order to understand what she is talking about. This is a collection of talks that Joko Beck--who has impeccable credentials--gave to her students, followed by short question/answer sessions. As such, it covers a lot of ground, and not every talk will speak to your present concerns. Nonetheless, it is a gem which has now stood the test of time in a field littered with books on Zen, many of which do not bear reading. I believe that it will ultimately enter the American Buddhist cannon."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I read Everyday Zen whenever I need to slow down and reflect on life. Beck's message is about as simple (and important) as it gets. Stop. Sit. Reflect. And sit some more. I find her pragmatic approach to living a conscious and compassionate life inspiring.

Everyday Zen is the perfect intoduction to Zen Buddhist philosophy."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I found this to be a straightforward, clear, human account of zen as a practice of sitting and noticing your thoughts and moods as they arise, and the discipline and difficulties involved.

It is a very readable and enjoyable book. As the title suggests, the concepts are very practical, and Beck is always gently challenging you to look at how these concepts affect every day of your life.I highly recommend this book to everyone, including people just starting on the path to realizing their spirituality."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This is simply one of the best books I have ever read. I have an avid interest in Buddhism (all sects), and I came across the book in an eastern philosophy class I took at University. If you are interested in Zen Buddhism, this is a beautiful introduction although at some points not the easiest. However, I believe that a careful reader and practicioner will be able to unravel it. This book has certainly began a gradual change in my life for the positive, one which I hope I can keep up, and I believe that anyone who takes the time to really read and practice what she suggests, I think they will benefit you tremendously. Good luck and practice well!!"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Having read a few of the negative reviews of Beck's original introduction to the Ordinary Mind philosophy and practice, I have to say that I was one who had no previous exposure to zen nor do I have a zen teacher. The clarity of the subjects covered through lecture and teacher-student interaction at the zen hall made it quite understandable to me. Of course I am talking clearly about the text and its absorbility. Now understanding the way of life through zen, THAT is the challenge - not the author's teachablity through this work. Outstanding work by the author."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"For years, I've read books and taken classes about meditation. Most teachers speak in general terms, but this author is just a bit more helpful by giving some great examples.Namely, she discusses *why* we learn more about ourselves when we sit. She suggests labeling your thoughts (I know, I know - not very zen) to identify your patterns. Do you think about yourself, do you worry about the future, do you judge others? The thoughts that come up most frequently say a lot about you. And she suggests that after thousands of repetitions of labeling these thought patterns, they slowly fade. It's just like with any other skill, practice makes perfect! Excellent tip, and of course there's more."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I loved this book.

I like her style of writing, which is both concise and practical. In this book, she strips away all the artifice that Zen practice sometimes basks in, through no fault of its own, and gets to the core reason for undertaking such a discipline. In other words, there is nothing the least bit romanticized or esotericized about Zen here, and that is as it should be."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Joko Beck writes compellingly on practice and real life. These collected Dharma talks spell out beautifully why one might want to add traditional Zen practice to modern western life, therein bringing center and no-thought out into all aspects of being."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Charlotte Joko Beck tells us how we create ourselves our own suffering, and the solution that zen proposes.The reality of everyday life doesn't satisfy us, so we prefer the pursuit of ideals. We don't see any more reality as it is, which brings confusion, and then more suffering.Zen proposes to look inside oneself, instead of wanting de change reality. The practise of meditation makes clearer our difficulty to stay in the present, our selfishness and our desires. It develops the knowledge of oneself, our altruism and the detachment regarding our desires."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This is the book that brought Zen home to me, that made me see its meaning in practical, down-to-earth manifestations.

I did not expect much as i have never been to interested in Zen before, maybe just because of my ignorance on the subject. After reading a first couple of chapter i felt myself change. This book opened my eyes. It is written in a simple language, when i read it i felt like the author was talking to me and all i had to do was kick back and listen. It is really a great book if you want to know more about Zen and not feel like you have to struggle through every page to understand what the author is saying.It is pleasant, beautiful and inspiring, so i give it 5 stars and i could i'd give it more!"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I purchased \\"Everyday Zen: Love & Work\\" for my husband for Christmas (2006). He has enjoyed other Charlotte Joko Beck books in the past. So, I decided to buy another one of her books for him. This book is good, it has many interesting ideas and thoughts to convey but, my husband still favors \\"Nothing Special: Living Zen.\\" I believe he would recommend that book, if a reader is interested in introducing themselves to or wants to read another one of Charlotte Joko Beck writings. Although, \\"Everyday Zen: Love & Work\\" is readable and worth checking out. A notation: toreaders, you may just want to start with one of her other works first, before reading this one."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"Just the most influential author I have read. For a week I saw mountains as more than mountains and all my continued personal developement stem from her teachings."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"The book is organized in a series of talks where Joko shares her wisdom with her students. Unfortunately, I found that the tone of the talks lacked compassion and understanding for the complexity of the world. Thicht Nacht Han tells us not to create us/them dualities, but this book is replete with them. Further, the book overwhelmingly emphasizes the importance of sitting, but *ignores* the importance of everyday ethical practice in providing the groundwork for a joyful life of awareness. I find that it did not provide much help for ordinary people trying to deepen the practice of their everyday lives. Perhaps this is a problem with Zen Buddhism in general. A much better book is Sharon Salzberg's &quot;Lovingkindness&quot;."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"The author conveys some worthwhile information yet the book simply is not a joy to read. Her view is worth reading, but I found that the material takes such concentration. If you are expecting a lighthearted approach to Zen, I suggest you look for another author."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I have always been curious about Zen for a few reasons. But, it's mostly because many of the books I read refer to it. This is a good book to read if you're just plain curious like me. I thought that some topics in this book were easy to comprehend, but then there were others where I had to go back and reread paragraphs two or three times until it sunk in. Being a Christian, I enjoyed the parallel references to Christianity. And, it didn't seem like the author was trying to convert me to Buddhism. She writes in a tone that encourages understanding. I can't honestly say I completely understand all of Zen after reading this book. But, I can say that I'm enthusiastic about wanting to learn more. That's not because I'm interested in converting to Buddhism but because I am fascinated by the similarities between Zen and living a Christlike life. And, on a less serious note, I really enjoy baffling my friends and coworkers with the Buddhist parables mentioned in this book."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This was the first book recommended to me when I attended my first Zen Practice session, and I see now why. This book is actually a collection of dharma talks-loosely grouped within topics such as \\"Feelings,\\" \\"Relationships\\", or \\"Suffering.\\"Joko Beck has an engaging, chatty style which allows the beginning Zen student to really understand the concepts she's discussing. While often quoting the masters-Dogen Zenji, Jesus or Buddha-she places their comments in the context of daily zen practice. She also includes excerpts from several interviews with students, and these allow the reader to better engage the text. I, for one, certainly admired Joko Beck and her students in their grasping for answers!Although more advanced students may crave a text which is a little more \\"technical,\\" I think all Zen practicioners could benefit from reading at least parts of this book, and since the excerpts are only loosely-connected to each other, you really do not need to read this book cover-to-cover to get a good sense of Zen practice.Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"EVERYDAY ZEN is a fine book for the committed Zen practitioner. EVERYDAY ZEN eschews the paradoxical and sometimes glib-sounding tone of other Zen books. As such, it would seem to be a good introductory volume to Zen practice; yet, this reviewer found it not so.In relating Zen to such mundane experiences as washing the dishes, Joko Beck presumes her reader to be far enough along the path to intuitively grasp her meaning, and if in fact the reader does, EVERYDAY ZEN is a pleasure to read, a kind of colloquial version of Dogen Zenji'sHow to Cook Your Life: From the Zen Kitchen to Enlightenment. The experienced Zen practitioner (whether Novice or Roshi) should understand that Zen IS intimately related to the mundane.The newcomer, however, may find Joko Beck's \\"everyday\\" language to be even more impenetrable than the exotic phrasing of the Japanese masters. To say \\"Don't get angry\\" and \\"It's okay to get angry\\" in juxtaposition makes sense only if the reader is familiar with the shift in mental perception that Zen requires between the absolute and the relative. And if the newcomer is unfamiliar with the mechanics of zazen and the externals of practice (which this book does not address) then it all seems even more obscure.As Kim Boykin states in her Spotlight Review, EVERYDAY ZEN is not the book to turn to in an existential crisis---it's liable to do more harm than good, if only in being particularly frustrating. Joko Beck does not counsel passivity, but she does focus \\"on things as they are.\\" This approach might cause a reader in need of assurance to feel overwhelmed by life. Her teaching entitled \\"No Hope\\" sounds despairing to the lay ear, as do her editorial comments that, \\"No human being has ever been fully enlightened.\\" A careful reading of EVERYDAY ZEN shows that Joko Beck is nowhere as nihilistic as she seems. Still, the beginner may be turned off by Joko Beck's almost aggressive insistence that it's all nothing special. Suzuki-Roshi says it's nothing special once you realize you are already there. The trick is in the realization.EVERYDAY ZEN is a collection of Joko Beck's teisho (teachings) at the San Diego Zen Center, and she is definitely addressing a select audience as Master to Student. Despite it's \\"everyday\\" approach, it's undoubtedly geared for those of us who have already sat upon the cushion, not those of us who are considering it.Strongly recommended if you have already done some sitting. If so, this is an excellent and straightforward discussion of living Zen in modern America."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"This is simply my favorite zen book, and I have read a few. Granted, if you are a total newcomer to zen, you may experience some frustration. In fact, I did not appreciate this book after my first read. After additional study and reading - especially of Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now - I reread Everday Zen and now I cannot get enough of Charlotte Joko Beck's teaching. Her other book, Nothing Special, is equally beneficial. Her writing is straightforward, but profound. What a treasure she is!"},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"First book I purchased from Joko Beck, and it was wonderful! I just purchased her other book \\"Nothing Special\\" as well. There is a multitude of insightful chapters, passages and lessons about life captured within these pages. I found the book to be quite approachable for the common reader. On the other hand, this book, even though it was straightforward, is a little more comprehensive than other books I've read thus far (you may have to review some of the material a few times, but that's okay). Nevertheless, I think everyone can learn a little something about themselves and how to better conduct their lives moving forward.Usually on my reviews, I like to list a few key points that inspired me while reading the material. However, on this occasion there are just too many good points to list. With that said, I found myself writing little notes all over my copy. So, I've decided to ONLY include MY closing thoughts which the book left me with after the last few pages:\`We all start out looking for the next best thing in our life. No matter what it is - we keep searching for something better. However, what we don't realize is -- life is not only staring us right in the face, BUT it's also fleeing with each passing second. All we truly have in this world is the HERE/NOW. We need to stop planning and searching for \`who knows what'. Rather, we need to look at whatever our life IS, and simply do what needs to be done. We shouldn't have time for useless gossip (he said/she said) OR the labeling/judging of others - because we already have the most precious gift of all looking at us right now - LIFE. Do not waste another moment for this is all we have, and nothing else; not money, not possessions, nor attachments. All we really have is THIS MOMENT, this wonderful, beautiful, fleeing moment. EMBRACE IT !!!'."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I have been a practicing Zen student for 32 years, and I think this book is the best.If you think you are going to get enlightened and all your problems will be solved, you probably won't like this book, because it may shatter your dreams.

I like Joko's writing a lot, simple, direct to the points just as Zen should be simple. This book may be hard for people trying to understand Zen only (without practice) or beginners. But to people practicing sitting Zen daily I think it contains a lot of good advices which I can apply into living. I will read and read again both books by Joko.

Highly recommend both &quot;Everyday Zen&quot; and &quot;Nothing Special&quot;."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"A friend who is very involved in Zen suggested this would be a good introductory book for me (along with Joko Beck's Nothing Special). I found myself having to read this in small bites and then taking the time to reflect in order to get a meaningful read. The format is a lecture by Joko Beck followed by a Q/A with students - this was very helpful. Ideas and cocepts were discussed with an underlying assumption that the reader had some baseline knowledge of Zen. I didn't, but still felt I got a lot out of the book."},{"Title":"Everyday Zen - Love & Work","review":"I have read many books on Zen and eastern philosophy. Each page of this book can provide a bit of truth to reflect upon for the day. It is not intended to be so, there is just such a density of wisdom that it is.

I do not sit regularly, but I do practice reflection on a daily basis (using a journal), and with regular writing forays. Perhaps the most useful lesson here is Beck's discussion of the \\"witness\\" experience, becoming an observer of moment-by-moment thoughts, emotions and bodily reactions.

I have read them all my life and they are among my very favorite stories. With Tolkien and the Bible they are on my Top Ten list for sure.What I have to say about this edition is that it is the ONLY version so far where I have seen the story \\"In the Rukh,\\" which takes place when Mowgli is an adult. My copy of this book differs from that shown in the photos above in that mine does not have the illustrated cover (and I cannot find a publication date, just the copyrights of 1893, 1894 & 1895), but the inside pages are the same.Never mind the Disney version. Enjoy the catchy tunes if you like but make no mistake: Kipling's Mowgli stories are far more than silliness. Take some time to find and read them. And if you get a copy with \\"In the Rukh,\\" hold on to it."},{"Title":"All the Mowgli stories","review":"That's because the movies mostly either Disneyfied the stories into kids' films or turned Mowgli into yet another Tarzan while the Jungle Books left out the final Mowgli story \\"In the Rukh\\", a story of Mowgli as a grown man. Interestingly, though chronologically the last Mowgli story, \\"In the Rukh\\" was the earliest written; the later written but chronologically earlier stories tell how Mowgli got to that point. The Mowgli stories in the Jungle Books end with Mowgli driving Mowgli out of the Jungle and back to Man in order to seek out his place in Man's World; \\"In the Rukh\\" tells how Mowgli finally found his place, and IMHO is absolutely vital to a true understanding of the character and the stories, since all the rest were written in order to explain how Mowgli ended up \\"In the Rukh\\".The stories are helpfully arranged by internal chronology, except that the first story has two sections set 10 or 11 years apart and the next two stories actually take place between the two parts of the first story. In addition each story has an accompanying poem following it. Thus, I would suggest the following reading order:MOWGLI'S BROTHERS, Part 1 (Mowgli's origin)KAA'S HUNTING (Contrary to movies, Mowgli makes a great friend; 2nd best story)Road-Song of the Bandar-LogHOW FEAR CAME (Arguably a prototype for the Just So stories)The Law of the JungleMOWGLI'S BROTHERS, Part 2 (Mowgli is cast out of the Seeonee wolf pack)Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\"TIGER! TIGER!\\" (Mowgli and Shere Khan finally have it out)Mowgli's SongLETTING IN THE JUNGLE (Villagers attack his adoptive human mother; Mowgli responds)Mowgli's Song Against PeopleTHE KING'S ANKUS (Jungle detective work reveals a tale of man's greed)The Song of the Little HunterRED DOG (Mowgli vows to help Seeonee Pack fight off red dogs; best story)Chil's SongTHE SPRING RUNNING (Mowgli casts himself out; unsatisfying end to Mowgli's saga)The OutsongIN THE RUKH (Mowgli finds his place; satisfying end to Mowgli's saga)The Only SonNote: Most editions include a helpful pronunciation guide at the very end.Note: A couple of modern authors have attempted to add Mowgli stories to the canon with widely diverging degrees of success: from the sublimeThe Third Jungle Bookto the ridiculousHunting Mowgli."},{"Title":"The Wild Mammals of Missouri","review":"This book has been a valued, detailed reference on Midwestern mammals since its first edition in 1959. Many, many people own the revised edition, which came out in 1981, but this second revision, published in 2001, is well worth purchasing, for it provides important updates on population levels, management strategies, and economic importance, as well as revised taxonomies (skunks, for instance, are now in their own family and no longer grouped with the weasels). Additionally, this revision includes species that are now found in the state (most notably the armadillo--absent in the state when the 1981 version of this book was prepared, but now quite common in the state and thus included in this edition).The previous edition was the \\"bible\\" of Midwestern mammals; and this is its update.Of course, the best reason to purchase this book is the wealth of information the Schwartzes provide, in organized, incredibly detailed text. This is no cursory examination of the species, pared down to fit the constraints of an ADD culture; in complete sentences, it includes descriptions of the animals' gaits, daily and seasonal routines, modes of foraging and feeding, preferred foods during various seasons, details of reproduction and development . . . and much, much more. It also includes North American range maps for each species.Visually, the book is an absolute treasure, because of Charles Schwartz's illustrations. Each species includes a formal portrait including detailed drawings of front and rear feet and various views of the skull (important for serious mammalogists). But that is just the tip of the iceberg.Each species also includes several additional drawings that convey an amazing amount of instructive information, while also providing a sense of the \\"character\\" of the animals. Indeed, if you search the Internet on these various species, you routinely find illustrations (such as track patterns and the many brilliant, detailed vignettes) that have been lifted, outright, from this publication, with or without appropriate citation.Let me stress again: the illustrations provide serious information, but throughout, you can sense Schwartz's deep affection and respect for the mammals he depicts.I should also point out that although this book is about Missouri's mammals, other states in the region clearly benefit from the Schwartzes' masterpiece, too.Yes, it's expensive, and unfortunately only available in paperback, but it's a book you ought to have on your shelf--it's basically an encyclopedia of Midwestern mammals containing all the information you could possibly want to know. You'll find yourself consulting it often."},{"Title":"The Wild Mammals of Missouri","review":"As a college mammology student - this book is a great aid to my understanding the identification and natural history of many mammals found in the Midwest.

I don't expect too much from cozy mysteries, and this is a typical cozy mystery. The problem, I think, is that I simply didn't like the characters. I found them all a little abrasive, not very happy, and just rather unpleasant. I just can't imagine spending any time with them in real life. That might be okay for some books, but a cozy mystery should be an escape, and this was one I didn't want to escape to.

If only all mysteries were this good!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I had high expectations based on other reviews, but I thought the book was ... just okay. There was way too much internal dialogue (and all of it was repetetive to the point of redundancy), and way too few other characters. Even if others were introduced, they felt peripheral next to the main character's struggle to overcome her husband's betrayal. The mystery was also very predictable and also felt peripheral to Catherine's heartache. Now, she has a complete right to be heartbroken (her husband left her for another woman after 30 years of marriage), but this just isn't the type of book that has to flush out those feelings. In an English cozy mystery, I was expecting more interaction between the vicar, the village gossip, the sinister stranger, etc (a la Christie). Instead, it felt like for half the book, we are reading Catherine's internal struggle to overcome the memories of her ex-husband. However, the relationship between Catherine and her daughter was a great addition and provided some depth. Hopefully, the next book in the series focuses more on the village inhabitants and the mystery itself rather than Catherine's disloyal husband."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I read both of Patricia Harwins books and would love to see more...very disappointed that there are only going to be two in this series, hopefully she can find another publisher!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I had big difficulties getting into this story, as it was totally not what I was expecting of a sweet cozy mystery, taking place in England.Catherine is recently divorced, her husband fell in love with a very young woman, and ended their marriage. Of course Catherine is still full of resentment over that fact, as she never saw it coming. Her job at the library is no longer satisfying her, as she can't embrace the digital new time, with ebooks and such. She loves handling books, feeling them, smelling them, looking at them. As her only daughter lives in Oxford, England, she decides to leave New York with all the memories it has, and move to England herself. She bought a small cottage close by Oxford, sight unseen, packs her things, and emigrates. She wants to be near her daughter and her new grandson. As Emily wants to go back to her work as a psychologist, Catherine will be able to look after Archie.Catherine finds it very hard though, to adhere to Emily's wishes in how her son is to be raised. No excitement, no overstimulation, no t.v.. And he gets to do whatever he wants, without ever being told no. It all is educational of course. Well, unless he is going to harm himself doing stuff. Archie is a very busy child, and Catherine is afraid she is in over her head with him. Emily was such a quiet child; she had no troubles at all with her.And then there is the old neglected man with his cat in the cottage across the street from Catherine. He almost burns down the house on her first night in her new home, and Catherine is appalled that no one seems to care about that. Least of all the man's son, who wants nothing more than his father to die she he can finally inherit. Catherine loathes the man, and when George Crocker does die, a few nights later, she is convinced someone murdered him, and burned down the house to reveal that fact. She manages to drag the body outside before the fire gets them all. Evidence the police finds, confirms her story, but the murderer will not be found easy. Arthur, the son, has an alibi, and while most people in the village hated George, no one had a motive to kill him after all this time. But no one seems to mourn him either.Then there is the body find in the church yard, where the new vicar wants to remove an ancient stone cross to be able to build a youth hall. The whole village, and especially the local docter, are opposed, but the vicar is determined to do whatever he wants. He would like nothing better than to demolish the ancient church, the ancient cottages and build high rises and a new modern meeting hall. And the worst part is, he has the Bishop's blessings to do whatever he wants to help the young people in town. Like they are waiting for such a hall to be build for them to be preached to! But now the body is found, he will have to wait with his plans until the police are ready with their investigations.It takes a while for Catherine to make some friends amongst the villagers, and I liked the book better from that moment on.But well, Catherine is too impulsive for my tastes; I totally disliked Emily and her strange notions of how to raise her son. If a boy never gets to hear the word NO, how will he ever grow up to be a rational man, who knows good and evil? A spoiled brat will never be a good man. Emily was very hard on her mother, who did her best raising her herself.The old man's black cat is also an important secondary character in this book, and I especially liked him in the end of the book.The mystery was a good one, one I did not see coming at all. And of course, that makes the book better for me. But all in all, it took me a very long time to finish the book. The beginning was really dark and gloomy, which is not to my liking at all.If this author had written lots more books, I probably would stop reading with this one. As she has only written one other book, I will probably try to find it. I do wonder what more troubles Catherine can find in this little English village.6 stars2012 Reviews by AurianFull review on my blog, [...]"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"This is a great series to get hooked on. For a week or so, I think my fellow passengers on the train thought I was insane- I was laughing, squealing, and wincing just from this book. Please check it out and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I don't wish to give offense, but frankly I am astonished at the reviews of this book. As one who has read well over 1,000 English mysteries by female authors -- including all of the Christie, Sayers, Allingham, and Tey classics, and English mysteries by those who are almost English (e.g., Ngaio Marsh) or American (e.g., Elizabeth George), first-rate writers and plot-spinners -- I found that this one falls flat by any standard. There is, for one thing, entirely too much of the \\"poor woman dumped by her no-good husband\\" theme, and not just for the protagonist, though even that wears out its welcome in a hurry. Not knowing anything about the author, I have no idea whether this is autobiographical or merely a plot device; either way, it's dull and cliched. Secondly, few of the village characters get any development, which detracts from the plot by telegraphing to the reader that these folks cannot possibly be on the suspect list. Thirdly, a lot more could have been done with the body discovered when the churchyard cross is being excavated. This could have been used to create all sorts of red herrings and to point at various villagers as potential murderers -- a great opportunity sadly squandered. In squandering it, moreover, the solution to the murder is all but given away. INDIRECT SPOILER AHEAD: One need only think for a few minutes about why this person was murdered years before and the person with whom he is linked was not until considerably more recently, and then the motives, the true nature of the antecedent (pseudo-)crime, and the identity of the murderer become readily apparent.In terms of the writing, it's decent enough. That's why I give it two stars instead of only one. One of my pet peeves, however, is an author showing off some knowledge and getting it all wrong. Page 187 of the paperback version refers to \\"Robert Gray's 'Elegy in a Country Churchyard.'\\" That magisterial and justly famous poem was, as most people know, written by Thomas Gray, not Robert Gray, and the title is \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.\\" The gaffe is all the more inexcusable as the author is, like her protagonist, a librarian!Caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"Well, this is a tough one.

But, although Ms. Harwin writes well, I just never felt comfortable with Catherine...she was just too abrasive and pushy. Her relationship with her daughter made me feel twitchy, too. I think she was extremely thoughtless and careless in her care of her grandson, despite the wishes of her daughter (which repeatedly put the child in danger). I've known people in real life who showed these characteristics and I didn't really care for them either. I think some of Ms. Harwin's secondary characters were much more palatable. I was also really amazed at the ease by which Catherine was accepted into the village and brought into the lives of the villagers. It served the story, but wasn't very realistic. I didn't really care for the way the author treated the subject of Wicca, either. From what I've read, the people who practice this religion do not believe in harming others. Perhaps a prejudice on the part of the author, which does not bode well for a series set in Far \\"Wych\\"wood."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I was initially delighted to stumble upon this new series. I love the premise of an older protagonist and the Cotswold setting; I even loved the cover. Imagine my shock when I got to page 158 and read the following dialogue as spoken by one of the characters:\\".... the circumstances perfectly obeyed the rites of Wicca. He had been impaled by a pitchfork through the throat, pinned to the ground so his blood would flow into the soil, to nourish it -\\"I don't know what sources Ms. Harwin utilized in her writing of this novel, but as a practitioner of Wicca myself for 15 years, I can attest to the fact that nowhere in our religion does impaling - or ANY kind of bloodletting - \\"obey the rites of Wicca\\". In fact it is quite the opposite, as the first and foremost rule of Wicca is \`Harm None'. Wicca is a defined, well-documented religion with very specific principles and practices, with strict rules against harming anyone, EVER.Before I reached that page I'd actually been in Barnes and Noble earlier that day looking for a copy of the next in the series. They didn't have it, and now I'm glad they didn't.Harwin's careless, uneducated passing comments in this book are not only offensive but extremely irresponsible. I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a writer. I'm sorry that this promising series has now been ruined for me."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"this is a novel that was obviously planned to appeal to a certain demographic and to capitalize on the popularity of another series with an american woman protagonist living in england. i like cosies, and this is not badly written, except for a few minor points that ruined it for me.the motivation is about three generations out of date. please, england not only entered the 20th century some time ago, there are signs that the english are aware that we are now in the 21st century. i would make other comments about this, but i hate people who give away plot details, and won't be one.the slang is not quite as out-dated, but is certainly 40 years or so old.the characters are unattractive to me, though the american characters are based on fairly common types. their relationships are well drawn. the dialogue is usually good, in that it reveals character. the descriptions and plot development are well handled. and though some might find this point unimportant, the writing is grammatical. it's nice to know that there are still americans who can handle verb tenses and know an adjective from an adverb.the author is clearly talented. and maybe writing this book was her break into publication. but i think she is capable of better."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"The author is a Maryland librarian; though the book is set in England, the lead character is an American.

After her divorce, she quit her job as a librarian and decided to start anew in this English village. She wants to be near their daughter Emily and her family. She especially wants to spend some time with her grandson Archie.Right after moving into her cottage, she finds her neighbor George, a hermit-like man, accidentally setting his kitchen on fire in his decrepit cottage across the street. She decides then and there to cook for him until she can get him help. She is quite concerned about him and contacts his son.A body is discovered buried next to the cross that is being moved, against the wishes of many of the town folk. This delays the movement of the cross. There is a lot of heated debate about his issue. The body appears to have been buried for some time and police are not certain they'll be able to identify it.Then George is killed. Catherine finds it difficult to convince anyone that it was murder. Murder doesn't happen in their village.She sets off to find the killer. Since she has agreed to stay with her toddler grandson three days a week, she takes him along on some of her adventures. Emily is beside herself as she wants him to be kept indoors. He is definitely a handful and Catherine finds it almost more than she can handle. Plus she and Emily are often at odds about his care, as well as other things.After putting Archie in harms way, she has to re-evaluate things and so does her daughter.I really enjoyed this book.

It seems that Ms. Harwin had to go out of her way to make the daughter seem crazy (expecting ANYONE to stay INDOORS all day with a very active two year-old without turning on the TV)just so that her older, \\"wiser\\" character could criticize.

I gave it three stars on the strength of that."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"That's high prize given that she's only published this one book, but this book was excellent. After 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down.I suspect that the author was writing with her tongue firmly in cheek -- having fun with all the conventions of the English Cozy Mystery (including the rustic gardener whose English is almost incomprehensible because of a heavy rural accent and the manor house), and yet she has a vicar who confounds all the conventions of the &quot;cozy&quot; -- he's young, abrasive, and doesn't fit in. He wants to tear down the old church and build a modern worship center!The plot involves an older American woman, Catherine Penny, who has moved to a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds following her divorce. She has a daughter and grandchild in England, and after her husband's betrayal, feels the need to start over somewhere new. The picturesque cottage is marred only by a decrepit cottage across the road, inhabited by the hermit-like and cantankerous George Crocker -- who Catherine insists upon trying to help. Meanwhile, she gets to know all the stock characters of the English cozy, including the people who live in the manor house and the woman who runs the village shop.She has hardly begun to settle in before there is a murder -- she has difficulty convincing anyone that murder has taken place because murders aren't supposed to happen in this little village. She sets out (driven by a sense of justice?) to discover who the killer is. Meanwhile, she's trying to care for her daughter's toddler, and butting heads with her daughter in the process -- so Catherine's personal life is intertwined with her detective work. I also was surprised by the ending -- totally -- something that doesn't happen very often -- and yet it all made sense (no holes in this plot!)This book quickly developed into a real page turner, because it is well written and carefully plotted -- and because you care for and like Catherine. I can hardly wait until the next book to come out, but will have to wait for over a year!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It has all the best aspects of an English cozy: a good mystery that keeps you guessing, very enjoyable characters living in a quaint village setting, and of course wonderful descriptions of the beautiful English countryside. I felt like I was taking a trip to the Cotswolds everytime I picked it up. I also enjoyed how the author wrapped everything up nicely in the end. I look forward to reading many more books in this series. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next one!"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"This is the first installment in a brand new series by a new authour (Patricia Harwin), and what a thoroughly enjoyable read &quot;Arson and Old Lace&quot; proved to be! Set in a small little village just outside Oxford (Far Wychwood), &quot;Arson and Old Lace&quot; fits comfortably within the parameters of what an English &quot;cozy&quot; should be. Patricia Harwin obviously knows exactly what ingredients should go into an English &quot;cozy,&quot; as well as what to add/change so that &quot;Arson and Old Lace&quot; manages (and rightly so) to come across as something fresh and vibrant. I enjoyed reading this mystery novel immensely and am feeling really both disappointed and impatient since I will have to wait a whole year in order to be able to read the next Catherine Penny mystery novel.Bitter, angry and saddened by her sudden divorce, sixty-something Catherine Penny has decided to leave her old life in New York City behind her and move into a charming little 17th century cottage at Far Wychwood, near Oxford. Of course Catherine won't be really all alone since her daughter, Emily, and her family lives there as well. Determined to put the memory of her failed marriage and her ex-husband, Quinn, behind her, the very notion of moving to another country definitely had its appeal. But Catherine is little prepared for the odd characters that she encountered in her new home. People like her immediate neighbour, senile old George Crocker, who seems to have been left to cope with things all by himself by both his family and the village; or the zealot-like new vicar, Ian Laribee, who seems intent on removing all signs of the village church's historical past. Fortunately most of the villagers seem to be nice and welcoming, and Catherine soon begins to feel that her decision to immigrate was the right one.That is until old George Crocker is found dead in his burning cottage. Thanks to Catherine, the police quickly discover enough evidence to conclude that George was murdered. You'd think that having convinced the police that old George had been murdered would have been enough for Catherine, but Catherine finds that she has a burning urge to discover for herself who had murdered George and why. But in a village that goes back hundreds of years and where the villagers all seem to have roots that also go back as long, Catherine just might dig up more than she has bargained for...I love English &quot;cozies&quot; and it was a real treat to discover &quot;Arson and Old Lace.&quot; The story was a good one, dealing evenly with how Catherine tries to cope with her hurt over the breakup of her marriage; the difficulties she faces with her daughter, Emily; how she adapts to life in Far Wychwood, and how she keeps finding herself deeply involved in trying to unmask George's murderer. The pacing was even and fairly swift -- nothing got bogged down -- and there was enough plot twists and red herring suspects so that mystery buffs shouldn't feel too shortchanged. &quot;Arson and Old Lace&quot; is wonderful first installment in a brand new series that is worth recommending that everyone buy/read and keep an eye out for future installments. This truly was an excellent buy and read."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"Patricia Harwin's &quot;Arson and Old Lace&quot; is more than a nice cozy Cotswold mystery. The 60-something heroine, Catherine Penny, is dealing with her feelings of being dumped by her husband, her attempts to settle into her new home and new lifestyle, while being barely &quot;tolerated&quot; by her daughter, snarled and grumped at by some of her new neighbors, and finding that living in a small English village is like living under a microscope.Penny does prevail in making herself a new home, bravely meets most of the challenges (although personally, I would have liked her to be less meek around her daughter), and determinedly fumbles around trying to figure out the mystery of her curmudgeonly neighbor's death until she succeeds.The book's ending was not predictable - a pleasant surprise, thanks to some neat little twists and turns of plot. Thank you Ms. Harwin!However I could only give the book 4 stars since I was still disgusted that by the end of the book Penny was still trying to conform to the &quot;ideal&quot; grandmother image her daughter has - one where apparently emotions are to be kept under tight control ala Queen Victoria. humpf"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"After more than two decades of marriage, Catherine Perry had no idea that her husband was seeing another woman or that he wanted a divorce so he can cohabitate with his new Barbie doll. After the divorce was finalized, Catherine could no longer live in New York City with the memories all around her. She moves to the quaint English village of Far Wychwood so she could spend quality time with her daughter, her English son-in-law, and especially her grandson.Her cottage is lovely if isolated and her nearest neighbor is irascible George Crocker an irritating old man who Catherine rescued when his curtains caught on fire. She becomes immersed in village life and is upset that the vicar is having the historic cross in the cemetery moved so a youth center can be built. When the digging starts, the buried skeleton of a murdered man is found and a few days later, George's house catches fire. Catherine drags the body out and sees that it was arson to cover up a murder. Her inquisitiveness brings her to the attention of a murderer who has killed twice and will not hesitate to kill again.ARSON AND OLD LACE is the first installment in an exciting new English cozy series that is an enthralling mystery. The delightful way the sleuth brings the doings of the villagers to life is absorbing and colorful. Readers get a real feel for the intimacy inherent in such a lifestyle while also adoring the sixty year old heroine, dumped by her husband for a younger model. Patricia Harwin is a gifted storyteller and readers will want to continue reading this colorful series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"After reading the first few pages online, I couldn't wait to buy the book.

By the second chapter, I realized this was a jewel of writing, put it down, and bought Arson and Old Lace--first things first.As to why I like the series:First, the author does not waste words. Verbosity is a pet peeve of mine.Second, the dialogue is witty and believable. The main character has been dumped by her husband of many years and decides to move to England, near her daughter. She gifts her friends with her possessions, keeping only \\"a modicum of clothing, and the books, CDs, and the photo albums\\"--my kind of person. In short, she is a charming eccentric.Third, with titles like Arson and Old Lace and Slaying Is Such Sweet Sorrow, the books deserve to be read."},{"Title":"Arson and Old Lace (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 1)","review":"The constant theme in the favorable reviews of \\"Arson and Old Lace\\" is that readers can't wait for the next book, \\"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow\\" in this brand new series by Patricia Harwin.The writing is superb and the plot and outcome take some unexpected twists. Moreover, I found the main character, Catherine Penny, to be so realistic and indicative of older women in our society today. After a long, successful marriage, she has abruptly been left by her attorney husband for a younger woman. She is angry and bitter, but is also determined to get on with her life and start anew. Moving to England to live in a small English village that she fell in love with when they visited their daughter, Catherine has wiped the slate clean. She looks forward to being near her daughter and grandson and is charmed by her new village cottage. What she isn't prepared for are the memories that sometimes overwhelm her of the times that she spent with her husband there. She isn't expecting the murder and mayhem that the sleepy, tranquil village awakens either!I personally loved how her daughter Emily was portrayed. Her daughter has always kept her emotions in check and cannot fathom why her mother cannot do the same. Emily is a new mother and a take-charge psychotherapist who has very definite ideas on child rearing. Many of these ideas are \\"unrealistic,\\" but so true of some new mothers! Especially since Emily is assertive and maybe a little bit of a control freak. She is totally consumed with her new son and is pretty uptight about how he should be raised. The one area that made me dislike Emily, somewhat though, was her totally disregard when her mother was almost killed. However, I can also understand that many people mask their fear with anger instead. So even though it didn't make me fond of her, I found it to be very realistic.I think that Catherine Penny is in a niche that would appeal to all readers, but especially readers in their 20's and up. If you have to read about beautiful, young heroines with torrid love interests in each chapter, this is not the book for you. If you enjoy reading about a mature woman with realistic dialogue and plot, as well as a clever and enjoyable mystery - you will join the ranks of Patricia Harwin's fans.Ms. Harwin: Write faster! Take care of your health! If you smoke - please stop! Eat your veggies and get plenty of exercise because I want you to write novels for many years to come! An excellent, excellent first novel!"},{"Title":"Dutch-English/English-Dutch Standard Dictionary (Hippocrene Standard Dictionary) (Dutch Edition)","review":"Rijckaert, Arseen,Hippocrene Standard Dictionary: Dutch: New York, NY, Hippocrene Books, Inc., 1997 (Originally published as Nederlands-Engels/Engels-Nederlands Zakwoordenboek, Antwerpen, Standaard Uitgeverij (c) 1979, 1993.)I give this dictionary a 1 rather than a 2. First, it is not up-to-date. The publication date by Hippocrene books is 1997, which would make you think it is reasonably contemporary. It turns out that this is a reprint of a Belgian publication, copyright 1979, 1993, the 1993 being obviously merely a copyright renewal. Effectively, nothing in this dictionary could be after the 1970s. This means that locutions that have come into use since that time, such as ''diss\`\`, or ''loonytunes\`\`, or ''internet\`\`, do not appear in this book. Second, it is incomplete. Even expressions that became common in the 1950s, such as ''far out\`\` , or ''disco\`\` and ''discotheque\`\` , are not there. There is NOTHING about computers, not even the word ''computer\`\`. Forget about ''byte\`\` or ''database\`\`. ''Data\`\` appears in the Dutch-English section, but not in the English-Dutch section. The same is true of Dutch words. There are words that would have been considered vulgar when I was a young man, but that are now in such common use that they appear without comment in The Netherlands' most prestigious newspaper, NRC Handelsblad. These are words like ''oudehoeren\`\` as in the expression, ''Zij stonden te oudehoeren (They were standing around shooting the breeze)\`\`, or ''belazerd\`\`, as in ''Ben je belazerd? (What! Are you crazy?)\`\`.I quote Dr. Johnson: ''Dictionaries are like watches: the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true.\`\` He was talking about 18th Century watches, of course, not the quartz crystal wonders of today.

Other than that, the book is helpful, a quick read, and provides some plans for simple coops."},{"Title":"ABC of poultry raising: A complete guide for the beginner or expert","review":"Yes, some of the information in this book is dated. Tho, this is one of the most through chicken books I own (and I own them all!!). It was first written in 1944, my version is the 2nd revised book which was printed in 1977.In the 'How to get Started' chapter 2, this book covers for the novice: where to get supplies, it also covers started chicks and ready-to-lay pullets and the other ABC's for the total novice. Also included were several black and white photos of equipment, homemade brooders and battery pens.This book is one of the most through books when it comes to plans for chicken coops & feeders. It includes plans for a 6x8, 10x12 & 20x40ft coop and the author includes a bill of materials needed for each plan listed. There are also plans for nesting boxes, homemade mash feeder, range shelter, feed bin and a range feeder. Definitely, it is one of the most through chicken books I own on the included building plans.Also the book covers butchering, preserving eggs and surplus chicken meat. It also has a decent health section with a few black & white photos. The health section covers probably the few most common chicken ailments at that time (ie bumblefoot, cholera, etc.). The common chicken breeds of the era are covered a bit, but not much.Keep in mind when reading that this book wasn't really written when chickens were kept as well-loved pets. If you keep chickens for pure pleasure and profit as I do... you may be a bit offended when the author discusses comb-dubbing and states that chickens don't feel much pain. I totally disagree. Chickens are just good at hiding their symptoms or pain, but they DO feel pain.Overall, a good, but obviously a bit dated book that anyone would learn from.

It was helpful to have the seasons and preferred exposure of the plants included in their description. There are also several good sample garden plans. My only disappointment (if it can be so considered) was that many of the featured plants are not hardy in my zone 4 garden (Ms. Raven's garden is in Britain).For anyone who loves contrast in their gardens, this is the book to inspire you!"},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"I LOVED this book. Ms. Raven is a woman after my own heart. We have the same color sensibilites and I naturally gravitated towards this book. She is a proponent of using bright,saturated colors and deep,rich colors in the garden,in contrasting groups as opposed to soft pastels and whites-the \\"wedding colors\\" as she calls them. She also is fond of using bold,architectural foliage. I couldn't agree with her more. I loved the two page layout of the \\"floral pallette\\" she uses,they are all of the colors I love(and I love color). The photographs are beautiful and I really liked how they took photographs of flowers,with their colors and blended the pages into a kind of pallete. I do share the dissapointment of one reviewer-that Ms. Raven's garden is in another zone from mine,and so therefore many of the plants she grows will not survive in my zone 5 Chicago garden. And I don't even think I have ever seen a wallflower here in my life! The text on plant culture is informative and helpful,but not casual reading-it can get a little boring. Use it as reference. The strongest point in this book is the photographs,as it should be. This book is about color in the garden so visual strength would be the only way to go. This book is a great combination fo informative and practical and visual and inspirational. This book really inspired me and I highly reccomend it-now on to order some spring bulbs!"},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"I have found this book very inspiring. The pictures are great and the text is full of practical knowledge. Although I am from another zone (Zone 9) I found that the guidelines, the concept in the designs, are so well described that is easy for anyone to adapt them to their own zone. It is not a book for &quot;just copying designs&quot; but to learn how to manage color, texture, scale and develop you own creativity."},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"Are you afraid of too much color in your garden? Do you fall into the trap of conventional landscaping rules of lumping similar colors with each other? Then, take a bold step and challenge your visual senses. The Bold and Brilliant Garden is an invaluable addition to any gardening library. Sarah Raven presents the use of beautiful color combinations in a very naturalistic manner. She outlines the use of different types of plants and color combinations, and she supplies us with a wealth of vibrant color photographs."},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"The Bold and Brilliant GardenBy Sarah RavenPhotographs by Jonathan BuckleyFrancis Lincoln, PublisherISBN 13: 978 0 7112 1752 2A book arrived by post this morning, on the shortest day of the year, when the sky was dreary, the temperature had dipped below minus twelve degrees centigrade and fifteen centimeters of snow were predicted to fall. The unwrapping of the book was the equivalent of lighting a bonfire in my living room. It arrived at the best moment to warm and illuminate the day.This publication is about color; not about any color and not about the colors we traditionally associate with polite flower gardens. This is a book about sizzling color that sets a flower garden ablaze. In the introduction, the author declares that the use of bold and brilliant color is the result of a need to redefine the palette of her own garden. Having tired of \\"delicate\\" color schemes, she was ready for \\"passionate\\". However, when these strong colors were introduced into her garden, they turned out to be either too rich or too dark and needed brightening up in order to set them off. To achieve the desired color saturation, the author began to mix tomato-soup red flowers with purples, orange with magentas and crimsons with gold. As a background for these intense combinations, she used acid green and silver plants to achieve the most eye popping results.The introduction of the book ends with a double page montage of the twenty four vivid flowers that the author relies upon to create brilliance. Sorted into an eye catching color sequence, they range from blue Meconopsis to red Allium, from purple Salvia to scarlet Poppy, from ruby Clematis to tangerine Arctotis and from gold Helianthus to acid green Euphorbia. Never heard of some of these plants? Never mind! By the time you've finished reading this book, these flowers will have seared themselves into memory and you will never again look at a garden in the same way.Readers with an appreciation for music will enjoy the author's metaphors. Traditional gardens with delicate coloring are compared to the string section of an orchestra, while richly colored gardens are referred to as the brass section. The deep red flowers that give a garden its overall structure are called base notes, while the adjective \\"jazzy\\" is used to describe any vivid colored flower.The main body of the book is an exposition on how to use intensely colored plants in each of the growing seasons. And, within a season, the plants are sub divided into those suitable for damp grounds and into those that require sun, shade or partial shade. Sprinkled through out the book, are care instructions for high maintenance plants such as Roses and Dahlias, as well as advice on staking flowers and soil preparation. Each page is brimming with detailed information about recommended flowers, suitable companion plants to create vividness, anecdotal details about the personalities of the suggested flowers and intensely colored photos.Another helpful feature of the book is the use of colored blueprints to help the reader plan gardens similar to those illustrated in the book. These suggested layouts include a list and quantity of the plants required, as well as a guide to where they should be planted in relation to other flowers. The essence of the author's advice is that bright colors need strongly shaped flowers to showcase their vividness; and that dramatic foliage, texture and fragrance are also required to create a sensory balance.A gardening publication needs beautiful pictures, as well; this book takes garden illustration to such a higher level that it is necessary to acknowledge the photographer, Jonathan Buckley. His brilliant colored photos are imbued with finely textured details that allow us to touch the flowers with our eyes."},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"a wonderful book, a great help for the novice gardener and an inspiration for the experienced"},{"Title":"The Bold and Brilliant Garden","review":"Arrived in wonderful condition in a timely fashion. Brand new."},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"In the Sherlock Holmes stories, Conan Doyle gave us just a taste of espionage, those stories that took him to his brother's club, involving naval treaties and submarine plans. Chesterton gave us one really good spy novel- The Man Who Was Thursday, then went on to produce his famous Father Brown. In both cases, Espionage's loss was Mystery's gain. But for those who love foreign intrique and the Victorian Era, there's no place like Holmes...when it's Mycroft Holmes, and his assistant, Guthrie. In this, the third in the series, Holmes and Guthrie must guard the royal heir to the Swedish throne, or allow England to lose face in international circles. But the Brotherhood is back, and noone is certain just how many assassins are trying to kill the young prince. Mycroft arranges for decoys, and he and Guthrie accompany the heir aboard England's most elegant train. It isn't long before the bodies fall, and Guthrie receives the first of many cuts and scrapes. Spies, trains, and Victorian elegance. What more could a reader want?"},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"Unlike his more famous younger brother Sherlock, Mycroft Holmes prefers to work in the shadows where no public acclaim occurs. He enjoys working for His Majesty's government insuring the welfare of the empire. Countless times he has saved his country from a loss of power and influence, and from needless embarrassments. His most formidable opponent is The Brotherhood whose vision is to insure Germany becomes the most powerful European nation.Mycroft loathes his current assignment because it places him under public scrutiny. He and his assistant must attend the wedding of the Duke of Marlborough to Queen Victoria,s grand niece. All of Europe's noble class will attend. Mycroft sees the gathering as an opportunity to negotiate a treaty with guest Prince Oscar of Sweden and Norway. Britain will help develop the Scandinavian nation,s rail system in exchange for access to North Sea ports. If agreed, Germany's control of North Sea would shrink. Germany, led by the Brotherhood prefer Oscar,s brother to rule Sweden and Norway as he seems more sympathetic to their needs. Assassination attempts of Prince Oscar leaves Mycroft and Guthrie risking their lives to insure his safe passage home.THE FLYING SCOTSMAN will have appeal to a broad band of fans. Readers who enjoy a historical mystery or espionage thriller will relish this tale. Quinn Fawcett, author of two previous Mycroft tales (see AGAINST THE BROTHERHOOD and EMBASSY ROAD) keeps his story line within the wonderful world described by Doyle. Yet, the depth of detail adds to the overall authentic feel of the late Victorian age. The pompous Mycroft handles the weight of the British Empire on his shoulders with aplomb that makes him a fantastic character and his novels very entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"Unlike many who have &quot;reviewed&quot; this book prior - this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes novel. It is, however, a great piece of work, painstakingly documenting period England and quite entertaining. Shame so many think because Mycroft appears so stodgy and sedentary in the canon that there can't be more than meets the eye.

And fester on it does, if edited from novel to a short story, it would still be poor, just less tedious to plow through."},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"This is one of the many books that seeks to cash in on the popularity of Sherlock Homes by another author weaving a tale using one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' ancillary characters. It is a tries very hard to be period but is at times rather a plodding tale - the problems of booking a train ticket and whether the timetables are well organised is not scintillating reading. However there are murders, some suspense, and plenty of period detail for the enthusiast of this genre. This story uses the character of Sherlock Homes' genius brother, Mycroft Holmes, as the agent of investigation as told by his amanuensis. The story is of a plot to assassinate a Swedish nobleman and much of the action takes place on a train (a scenario rather better exploited by Agatha Christie and Graham Greene)- the train being the eponymous Flying Scotsman; there is not much genius demonstrated by Mycroft - in fact he seems at the mercy of events. The story does use some characters and organisations from a previous book of Fawcett's but it is possible to read this novel quite well without the knowledge from previous books. There is some romantic interest towards the end of the novel and this does make the story a little more amusing in the latter half. It is not as good as a Conan Doyle tale and, for a Sherlock Holmes spin-off, I preferred the Professor Moraity books of Michael Kurland."},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"Elegant whodunit against a colorful background.

This is one of the only books in my life which I have stopped reading IN THE MIDDLE. Thats how bad it is. The situations are preposterous, and, to true Holmes fans, the character of Mycroft is nothing like the all knowing, all powerful, but never moving figure from the Canon. Avoid at all costs - life's too short!!"},{"Title":"The Flying Scotsman","review":"This seems to be the fourth in a series about someone called Mycroft Holmes (but having no real relation to the character created by Conan Doyle) as &quot;edited&quot; by Quinn Fawcett and as told by Mycroft's colorless assistant Guthrie. It is the only book in the series I have read and will certainly forevermore remain the one and only. Had I the inductive skills of Conan Doyle's Sherlock and Mycroft, I would have put the book back on the bookstore shelves as soon as I noticed that all the reviewers' blurbs on the flyleaf and back cover are from publications of the Western East Podunk Grain and Corn Bulletin sort.Well, what we have is an almost completely plotless 320 pages, in which the author carefully describes every scrap of food and sip of liquid that goes into Mycoft's mouth, but never finds time to create characters, situations or developments that would be of any interest to the long-suffering reader. The books most similar to this one that I have seen are the Irene Adler novels of Carol Nelson Douglas, in which there are 50 pages of descriptions of Irene's outfits for every paragraph in which Irene wonders idly who killed the little Paris seamstress about 200 pages back, and why.Mycroft himself seems to have no real job, and spends his time eating, fretting in a distant, avuncular way, and sending and receiving telegrams which never amount to anything. In this particular novel, someone of questionable judgement has chosen Mycroft to organize getting the friendly Scandinavian Prince Oscar safely out of England, before an international incident is created by having him assassinated on English soil. The novel takes place in a completely imaginary and relentlessly superficial world, connected in no way to the sociopolitical realities of 1890. Instead, we have two gigantic, global and preposterously efficient forces for evil, the Brotherhood and the Golden Lodge. Unlike vaguely similar organizations in our real world, whose members have trouble finding their shoes, pistols and computers in the morning, the organizations Mycroft faces here are always 30 steps ahead of him, even when he has only just decided what to do. Thus he and his two aides, Guthrie and Tyers, are always reacting, never acting. Not that much happens that they need to react to, as there is virtually no action.I got the feeling that the book is a first draft, and that the author never had time to go back and decide what to do with certain sequences. For example, there is an interminable early chapter in which Mycroft gets Chief Inspector Somerford drunk over dinner, and questions him apparently to some point, but no point ever develops and the Inspector in fact never appears in the novel again! On the Flying Scotsman, Mycroft identifies a passenger as being crudely disguised to appear to be a printer, though there would be absolutely no point to such an impersonation, but later the passenger is (correctly) found to be a bookie, and the ink and chalk stains Mycroft referred to earlier are not part of a disguise, but rather the normal appearance of a bookie who has boarded the train in haste without time to clean up. Or, again, the assassin aboard the train is the one person who could not possibly be the assassin, and the only murder he does commit has no point and is never explained. In fact, the novel ends as if the author had simply reached the proper page count. It is fair to say that 80% of the questions raised during the novel's course, uninteresting as they may be, are not answered, or even brought up again. They are just there to expend ink and pages.So I wouldn't advise expending your hard-earned funds in this particular case."},{"Title":"Mastering and Using Microsoft Office XP: Introductory Course","review":"They delivered quickly and gave be the book I ordered.

The eight people he chose for his soiree have a history of unpleasant association among themselves, and are forced to endure each other's company during a tremendous snow storm. With their emotions unchecked a murder and suicide occur."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"This was the first Ngaio Marsh novel I read, and it has lead me to purchase two more of her works. Many people compare Marsh to Christie, for such apparently obvious reasons as they are both British women who wrote a plethora of mystery stories during the same time period. Marsh's writing is a little more &quot;involved&quot;, however. Christie's writing has always been more simplistc, &quot;easy-to-read&quot;, though still very good. 'Death and the Dancing Footman' is your cozy little murder mystery, idyllicaly transpiring with a set of suspects invited to a vast mansion in the middle of the countrside during a terrible snowstorm. The host, a most despicable man, is of course murdered, in a quite interesting way. Due to the pacing of the story, and the heavy snowfall, the star/detective, Roderick Alleyn, doesn't appear until the book is halfway through. But his travails of reaching the mansion are quite tedious and humorous in their own right. There is good writing here, prime suspects, very nice atmosphere, and even an attempted murder, on top of the obligatory premature death. I will admit that though I absolutely love mysteries, I only average a %40 - %50 score of successfully solving it by book's end. But this novel, while still quite enjoyable, was a blatantly easy solve. I had the entire murder worked out even before it was commited. If that loses the fun for you, then I don't recommend this to you. But if you enjoy a cozy English mystery novel, set in a claustrophobic atmosphere, with a nice pace and a functional detective, then this is for you."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"Seven guests are chosen by their fiend-like host by reason of their mutual enmity and are imprisoned in a snow-bound country house to see what results from their tension and mounting hysteria; which is, of course, murder. Throughout, one is conscious of straining for effect, and, until the murder, the reader will find this one of the author's most tedious and uninspired jobs since the early books. The matter is not helped by a particularly irritating hero, a snobbish and precious aesthete, nor by Alleyn's late appearance, after which he does little except talk to witnesses. After the murder, if one can accept the large doses of hysteria, both masculine and feminine, the book becomes quite solid, and there is a novel twist on the alibi by wireless gimmick."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"This is one of Mash's books that I consider a &quot;comfort book.&quot; When I don't know what else to read, I reach for this one. The story begins with a house party and a clutch of very unique individuals... of course, murder can't be far behind. It is true that Inspector Alleyn doesn't enter the story until halfway through the book, but that is really incidental. The characters are fascinating studies of human folly and they more than carry the story until Alleyn shows up. Aubrey Mandrake, a guest at the house party, plays a &quot;Dr. Watson&quot;-ish character and is himself quite engaging. This book is a must read for its quirkiness and it's wit. A great Marsh mystery."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"Wealthy, self-indulgent Jonathan Royal has decided to amuse himself by hosting a houseparty--but not so much for the pleasure of his visitors as for the satisfaction of his own sense of mischief: his guests have been selected for their antagonism toward each other!

And murder is the result!Well read mystery fans will probably spot the killer on the basis of previous experience, but DEATH AND THE DANCING FOOTMAN offers one of Marsh's better plots--and as usual she creates a vividly drawn cast of characters and presents her tale with considerable style and plenty of wit.

However, at times, Marsh becomes so enthralled with ridiculing some of her characters that she spends entirely too much time on the backstory and her writing veers into tiresome parody. Such was the case in \\"Overture to Death,\\" first published in 1939. So, too, with \\"Death and the Dancing Footman,\\" published two years later.The flamboyant Jonathan Royal cruelly invites six guests who are mortal enemies to a house party, counting on an upcoming wintry storm to keep them housebound and at each other's throats. Such is the twisted Royal's idea of fine entertainment. So far, so good. However, some of the other characters never transcend into three-dimensional characters: the Complines, Francis Hart, and Madame Lisse descend into exaggerated archetypes rather than real people. By the time of the murder, halfway through the book, I was ready to chuck it in, and I very nearly didn't finish the book! I never thought I'd say that about a Ngaio Marsh book! Additionally, as others have mentioned, Inspector Roderick Alleyn doesn't put in an appearance until two-thirds of the way through the book. The book could have easily be trimmed by 50 pages and have been vastly improved.If you're looking to skip a Ngaio Marsh book, make it this one."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"In _Death and the Dancing Footman_, Jonathan Royal, an eccentric gentleman (in the old sense of the word) decides to amuse himself by inviting a group of guests who antagonize each other.

While I almost always enjoy the plot, writing style, etc., of Ngaio Marsh, I really love Chief Inspector Alleyn. Therefore, I was disappointed when he didn't appear until the last third of this book. Yes, he solves the murder, but you don't really get to see him interacting very much with the other characters, which is part of the charm of these novels."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"The book started off well and I had high hopes for it, but the ending was predictable. This does not seem like an Inspector Alleyn book because he is barely a part of the book. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"I am an absolute sucker for the old fashioned English whodunnit murder mystery style. I have read all of Christie's works and thought never would I read her equal. I still haven't but Marsh makes the closet bid I've seen yet in this novel.The stage for murder is set when a bored and mischevious rich Englishmen invites several guests with dangerous secrets and obvious dislike for each other to his house for the weekend.Tempers fly when the characters are thrown together and the result is attempted murder. Snowbound, the characters are unable to leave the situation even after the the murderer finally succeeds.I really kind of chuckled at the host as he got far more than he bargined for out of his little psychological soiree'. The book was very amusing and kept me guessing up until the very end. I narrowed my list of suspects to two but still wasn't sure which one it was when the story ended. The detective doesn't play a large role here so don't expect Poirot. Alleyn comes in late in the novel and just wraps things up. The book was a little too long...I think that's one of the things I found that seperated her from Christie was that she tended to ramble and stall a bit. I grew quite inpatient to find out who the killer was as the book really had a lull in between the last murder and the solution. Otherwise though it was really a fun little romp. If you're a Christie fan give it a shot...you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"I love the countryside that Marsh describes in this book and Overture to Death (set in the same town). However, I found the bizarre nature of the host almost unbelievable and somewhat antagonizing. The character interaction is excellent and the whodunnit portion satisfying. FYI, the host is not murdered, as is implied in the first review. Who is murdered is part of the suspense, so you are better left not knowing this detail."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"Jonathan Royal decides on a little mischief making and hold a house party in which all the guests have quarrels or enmities with each other. The party starts during a snow storm with all the guests snowed in and unable to go anywhere for the duration. Two apparent practical jokes make the company uneasy and it starts to seem that maybe someone could end up dead. Nicholas Compline feels he is the intended victim and at least some of the guests think the perpetrator is a plastic surgeon - Dr Francis Hart.When a murder finally takes place it leaves the guests shocked and chastened - and for a while without the police to investigate. Roderick Alleyn does not appear on the scene until two thirds of the way through the book - thanks to the snow. When he does appear, he and his team very quickly sort the wheat from the chaff and solve the murder. Another guest has died before the murderer is unmasked and the guests sent home.I enjoyed this book and thought the relationships between the house party guests were well done. There are plenty of clues scattered around for the observant reader to pick up but it is all too easy to become mired in the detail and completely fail to spot the murderer. In my opinion you can't beat Ngaio Marsh's plotting skills or her ability to create believable characters."},{"Title":"Death and the Dancing Footman","review":"Really not her best novel: kind of slow and somewhat artificial.Of Human Bondage (Signet Classics)is about a fellow with a club foot,so the playwright here isn't alone.

To sum up, this a memorable short novel written in elegant style composed by delightful prose, where Mishima paid great homage to the strange and mysterious nature of beauty.Yasunari Kawabata (Mishima's former mentor), 1968 Noble Prize, once said that he did not deserve to be awarded with the aforementioned prize if Mishima was still alive, by reading this book anyone can agree with his honorable judgment."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"This book is really not lacking very much. Perhaps some other reviewers came into it with high expectations for some sort of pinnacle of Japanese literature, but I only wanted a story and the story that was delivered was overwhelmingly engaging. As a story of obsession and tragedies of the heart it is certainly comparable to Nabokov. I am not a fan of stories that are just depressing or a mountain of uncomfortable drudgery, but Mishima keeps you out of that pit with his tell-all intellectual writing style, simultaneously mocking all the follies of human existence and pitying himself for being so analytical. The story has its rough edges but you really feel that he focuses on all the right details and nothing is left out, which is the hallmark of a superior writer. This is absolutely a great gift for a gay friend. I am not gay but I felt a very close sympathy for the main character's predicament. It seems to be a thin veil over Mishima's own experience, and perhaps the story is semi-autobiographical.The translation is pretty good and the Japanese experience shines through, although the setting of the story definitely lends a hand to that."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Mishima's beautiful, shimmmering prose is evident in this buildingsroman tale, but the story itself is trite and only occassionally interesting.

In chapter three (the longest chapter in the whole book), he suddenly fell in love with a sister of his classmate, called Sonoko. At this point, a heterosexual desire is developing. The narrator tries his very best to distinguish the passion of love from the lust of sex. It is very clear that the narrator's relationship with Sonoko is purely platonic, and later in the book, the narrator tries to lose his virginity by calling a prostitute. Yet, this casual sex encounter proves to fail. The whole story continues towards the last chapter, in which the narrator meets Sonoko on several occasion even though the female has been married to a man.As a reader, especially a reader reading this book as gay literature, I am very disappointed in the way that book should be better categorised as a heterosexual literature in which the narrator has a defect in sexuality. The same-sex desire of the narrator is purely based on sex, and the physical attraction of male's bodies. What is superior to this is the undying love between Sonoko and the narrator. The author uses over half of the book, clumsily, telling the readers where the heterosexual love goes, and in fact, it goes to no end. The heterosexual plot is the only part which tells the story continuously. The description on same-sex desire, in the first part of the book, is fragmented and the gay narrative lacks coherence and therefore also lacks unity in convincing me that this is a gay fiction.The narrator cherishes the male's bodies and also does not want to let go his passion of Sonoko, but at the same time, it is obvious that he is sexually incompetent in copulation with a female. Should he be seen as a homosexual or heterosexual? The book does not really tell. Maybe he is a bisexual. However, if this book is read as an autobiographical work of Yukio Mishima, then this argument is defeated, as it is clear that Mishima is a homosexual, though he was married and had two children in his lifetime. What perplexes me apart from the sexuality of the narrator is the matter of the queer propaganda. Should the narrator be regarded as a traitor of homosexuality or heterosexuality? Is this book about a gay man who has a heterosexual tendency or about a straight man who has a hidden homosexual interest? Is the author celebrating gay love or heterosexual relationship? After reading the book, there are still lots of questions unanswered.If you have time and intend to read truly gay fiction, go for the first 19 books before picking up Confessions of a Mask.For further reading, I would recommend the following secondary source:Mark Lily, Gay Men's Literature in the Twentieth Century. 1993.

It is an examination of identity formation that explores all of the idiosyncrasies that help one forge an identity--from philosophical notions and social awareness to purely physical attraction and the painful process of trying to understand the body as an identity. The style is very metropolitan in that it is informed by writers like Nietzsche and Wilde in addition to Japanese social conventions, customs, and ideologies. The pastiche element of the novel not only shows how \\"quilted\\" individual identity truly is but also acknowledges the many contradictions that exist in the making of \\"self-hood.\\" Mishima's primary thematic exploration, and, subsequently, his most profound ability, is the rendering of pain and exploring what pain means. It is certainly a classic of gay literature, and I'd go so far as to call it a world-class novel. Mishima's brilliance is apparent on every page."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"I haven't read a Japanese book in awhile, but I picked this one up. I'm strangely glad I did. Mishima is a very strong author, uncompromising, thoughtful but without falling into the trap of over-thinking his book.Kochan, the protagonist, also the narrator, is a strange, intellectual creature. He studies himself, turns himself on all sides, then shows the results to his audience, not asking for any reaction at all. He doesn't complain, he isn't proud. He seems to be alone, talking to himself from somewhere just outside of a society that he acts for in order to exist. Having the double misfortune of being both a homosexual and perverted - associating sex with violence and death - there's no chance of even confessing himself to anyone but the silent reader.This inner monologue, this honesty, are even more emphasized by his starting to explain how this passion came by, describing the strange reactions he had as a child in seeing torn princes in fairy tales, Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows and other such art, and then subtly moving off to remember the women in his life. Two. The second of which he tried very much to be straight with, hoping that he would become so with the first kiss - and failing.A very lonely book, very honest, suffering quietly and doing nothing to ask for help. It left me at the end with a feeling of emptiness, loneliness, of a quiet resignation.I loved it, even if I didn't expect to.Odd."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"This is a first person fictional narrative describing the development of the sexual identity and personality of Kochan, a homosexual male. It was written at a time when such an orientation was secret, and when open was reviled. It was written in Japan where even today revealing personal information of much less import is still off limits.The first part is mostly interior, dealing the narrator's childhood and his pre-sexual observations. He is fascinated with the night-soil man, with art work dealing with death and suffering of males such as knights and St. Sebastian and with a classmate, Omi. He shows how he develops a mask so that no one will know what he really thinks and feels. One particularly clever ruse is shown in talking with friends about a female bus driver. His schoolmates come away with the feeling that he is not only a heterosexual, but an experienced one.In the second part, \\"the mask\\" attempts to love a female as both a function of preserving itself and Kochan's more genuine attempt to be heterosexual. While the character is seamless, the narrative is stylistically different. It is more descriptive of events and has more dialog. Here, the fascination with death takes a different turn. Kochan, at first, does not consider where this relationship will lead since the war, or his own suicide, will probably end it.It's been a while since I've read John Nathan'sMishima: A Biography, but as I remember it, the events of Kochan's life match those of Mishima's. He was raised by domineering grandmother who separated him from other boys, went to an exclusive school and used his rural residency as a draft strategy. Mishima's father beat him for writing which is not only parallel with Kochan's father, it is noteworthy on its own, since this is Mishima's first novel.After over 60 years this novel is still fresh and relevant. I believe it will continue to stand the test of time."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Mishima's sadomasochistic homosexuality asserted itself early. While still a tiny child he responded instantly to certain kinds of masculine beauty and found a mysterious fascination in images and narratives of heroic men being tortured and, ideally, killed. The supreme example was a picture of the martyred St. Sebastian, bound and riddled with arrows, which the child Mishima experienced as the world's heaviest turn-on. Naive as he was, the young author still knew somehow that his interests were unusual and disgraceful, so he kept them secret. The story of his early inner life, with its crushes and fantasies, takes up the first half or so of the book and is fascinating.But then, during young manhood, Mishima tries to become \\"normal\\" and fall in love with a girl. Though he likes her very much, he isn't attracted to her physically. The story of this doomed relationship takes up the second half of the book. Being more or less devoid of incident, and (obviously) lacking in erotic passion, it's much less interesting than the foregoing chapters.Confessions of a Mask ends disappointingly but the earlier section of the book gives a candid, moving, and memorable account of a child's confused and troubled emerging sexuality."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"The book is amazing.

He finds himself homosexual, and to survive he hides behind a mask of social propriety, while secretly learning what he can about homosexuals in the world. Like Christopher Isherwood stated, Mishima could be compared to Andr&eacute; Gide for similarities in style, but there are differences as well. The story is spare and clear, with some moments of offbeat humor in the midst of painful situations. It's a bit challenging for modern American audiences, but well worth the time."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Above all, I love Yukio Mishima's incredible storytelling voice. In Confessions of a Mask, he creates a character so rich and realistic you can feel him in the room with you. And the protagonist of Confessions is so wonderfully CANDID. He knows that he make mistakes but also score triumphs, he admits his guilty pleasures to us sheepishly, he feels shame and remorse. And he sees everything with a clear eye, and speaks with the voice of a man who has stepped so far away from his life that he know himself better but feels his own feelings less. Mishima's prose is menacing and fast-paced, but it's the creation of this unique personality, and the time he takes to let us get to know him, that makes this Confessions of a Mask Mishima's best."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"As a student of the history of homosexuality, Yukio Mishima's Confessions of a Mask is one of the seminal pieces of twentieth century gay literature and a wonderful primary source for historians. It is also an easy read and incredibly insightful and powerful book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"From what I can tell, Yukio Mishima was not a very happy man.Granted, the only works that I have read of this very prolific author are this and Kinkakuji, but I'm seeing a pattern already, and it doesn't point towards Mishima being a cheerful, laid-back guy. Of course, his suicide by seppuku is also a good indicator that he took things way too seriously.Published in 1948, Confessions of a Mask addresses a subject that would have been taboo anywhere, not just Japan. The main character, whose name is only given as Kochan, is a young man dealing with the fact that he is homosexual. He begins with one of his earliest memories, seeing a night-soil man and finding him beautiful, which he believes is what set his preferences for life. As he gets older, he doesn't yet realize that he's different from other boys, except in that he's small and thin and gets sick a lot more often. He finds himself entranced by men, especially laborers, and not knowing if this is what he's supposed to be feeling.His sexual maturity is a sad and stunted thing. The pleasure and rapture that he sees in paintings of St. Sebastian hide dark urges of violence and despair. His boyhood love of a classmate is a secret that gnaws at him until he finally convinces himself that he was never actually in love at all. And his attempts to become \\"normal\\" end with nothing by emptiness and sorrow. Kochan has no friends to talk to, no family to lean on, and no way to know if what he's feeling is good or bad. All he knows is that the other boys are fascinated by women, and he's fascinated by other boys. In darkness and isolation, Kochan grows. What he grows into, however, is a pale, lonely and barren man.Like many gay kids, especially in the pre-internet era, Kochan believes that he is unique. An aberration, a deviation from the norm. As far as he knows, no other boy has felt the way he did, and the only other one he hears of - Oscar Wilde - is long dead. His desire to fit in with the rest of the world leads him to play an elaborate game, to wear a mask so convincing that it nearly convinces himself. Being able to hide who he really is and what he really wants becomes a matter of hiding from himself. And as anyone who's tried that will know, hiding from yourself only works for so long....Such is the life of a young gay man in wartime Japan. While I'm sure what Mishima has presented here is not the average, it is a depressing picture of what it's like to live in a society where such a deviation from the norm is punishable by societal exile. While I can't claim to know what would have happened to a young man in that era who came out of the closet, the narrator doesn't even seem to consider that as an option, good or bad. Thus I can only assume that the consequences would be dire.There's no doubt that this book is at least semi-autobiographical. A look at &lt;a href=\\"[...] shows a number of parallels, especially in the early days. Both he and Kochan were raised by grandparents and separated from their families. Mishima stared writing as a boy, an activity that his father deplored and which earned him beatings by other students in school. He knew what it was like to be different, and that probably fed into this novel.Whether or not Mishima was actually gay is, it seems, debatable. He did marry, and had two children, which would seem to indicate against it, but if, like the character in this book, he fought against his own nature, such an arrangement could be understandable.One of the things that I found difficult about this book - and Kinkakuji - was how very introspective it was. The narrator tells the story of his life from his older point of view, and dissects every thought and every memory in exacting detail. It creates a picture of a person who lives entirely in his own head, and attributes modes of thinking that one wouldn't normally associate with, say, a twelve-year old. He appears to be very analytical, even from his earliest days. Though he tells us that he is not letting his adult mind get in the way of his memories of childhood, this great attention to detail proves him wrong.The depiction of Kochan's attempts to hide himself is yet another mask - the mask of purposefulness. The narrator would like us to believe that he made every decision with purpose, as part of a plan. That he really did choose this life of self-deception. Perhaps because the idea that all of this was beyond his control is just too terrible to contemplate. Perhaps because it is better to own a bad decision than to admit that it was an accident. The narrator shows us quite clearly how adept he is at hiding from himself, and so he cannot be trusted to tell us truthfully about how he thought when he was a young man.This makes reading the book a challenge - the reader must evaluate every statement and judge every event for its possible veracity. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing how much is true and how much is falsehood. In the end, we just have to take Kochan at his word, all the while accepting that he's probably lying - and doing it without being aware of what he's doing.Reading Confessions of a Mask today, sixty years after it was first published, is illuminating. In the US, we're involved in a great societal discussion over whether or not gays should get married, and while being homosexual certainly isn't something that is universally accepted, the prospects for young gays and lesbians in the modern age are much better than they would have been for someone coming of age in the 1940s. Even in Japan, where coming out to one's family is still as hard as it ever was, there are gays and lesbians on television and the matter is open to discussion. A homosexual in Japan may not be as willing to kick down the closet door as his or her American counterparts, but the abject horror of being utterly rejected by society is probably much less than it was.When you consider what happens in this book, the horrible mental contortions that the main character must make in order to hide his true nature from the world - and himself - you can appreciate how far we've come."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"I waded carefully into this book, not knowing what the writing would be like. From the opening of the book the imagery and use of language were fantastic and captivating (some credit/blame may go to the translator).The story itself - specifically the main voice, a young man (Mishima himself?) - never progresses. The same lack of form and function persists in the telling of the story, start to finish. Mishima muses and postulates about love and sexuality. The voice explores its secrets and thoughts carefully and meticulously. And while the explorations are clever for their language and style - they are not fresh and grow stale as they are reviewed cyclically.Does he love a woman, does he not. Does he feel sexually attracted to women? No - but certainly aroused by men. But - nothing ever happens. His arousal for men is only truly brought to life in vivid fantasies of pain and suffering inflicted on the men in his mind.And - still - at the close of the book - the character continues to avoid himself and chase after a girl he has used as his foil and who is now married to another man. He is the same person despite his years and experiences. This book has a potential for power - but feels sad and hollow.Per Mishima, \\"It was like being given a gift of damp fireworks.\\""},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Reading other reviews of Confessions of a Mask, I see that many readers are looking at it from a perspective of \\"gay literature\\" and seem disappointed that Mishima is not really a supporter of the cause. But from my perspective, as someone interested in Mishima as a giant in Japanese literature, Confessions of a Mask is a great introduction into the literary world of Mishima Yukio.Without giving away too much, the main forces that propel the protagonist in this semi-autobiographical work, are a secret lust for masculine beauty and an attempt at heterosexual \\"normalcy\\" attempted mainly through a painfully flawed try at loving a sister of his friend. Other reviewers have commented that the second half of the story flags a bit, but for me, the frustration and concealed emotion that is tangible in the conversations between the protagonist and Sonoko is both convincing and intriguing.However, I would agree that the first half of the book is probably more interesting. Mishima's work is less about homosexuality (with the emphasis on sex) and more about an almost reverent approach toward masculine virtue and beauty. These ideas and the struggle within the protagonist start to flag as the war draws to an end and he becomes involved with Sonoko.I have yet to read many of Mishima's works, but the two main things that appeal to me are his staunch commitment to an ideal or perfection of some sort, and also the amazing penmanship that his stories exhibit. As with most Japanese literature, this sort of subtle detail is lost in translation, so I encourage all who have the ability and time to read the originals!Although I have a feeling this book will be hard-pressed to please everyone, as it is a bit too extreme for the mainstream reader but perhaps not strong enough for the alternative audience, for me at least it seems like a great insight into the mind and the works of Mishima. No study of modern Japanese literature would be complete without a look at Mishima, and although Confessions of a Mask may not be his greatest work, it is unquestionably an excellent starting point."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"This book operates on several levels, as an existential novel, portrait of war-time Japan, and as a coming of age story. I will leave it to others to comment on the other aspects of the book. As a gay story, the author confronts his present and future as a homosexual in a society that hardly recognized the existence of such persons. It is a tragic, but surprisingly not depressing, story written in direct, occasionally dark, prose.As a gay man, I have given this book to several of my straight friends to help them understand the complex feelings gays, especially those coming out, have about their identity and place in society."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Here in Japan, a lot in life is kept behind closed sliding doors and emotions rarely surface in public. Private and public are clearly delineated. The narrator courageously allows us into his complex private world of tangled emotions. Complicated sexual desire, an artistic sensibility, wit and intelligence create a picture of a precocious teenager that will remind you of Salinger's and Joyce's jaded teens. The narrator is intensely introspective, sympathetic, and has an active imagination fixated on death, sex, and workingclass muscular male bodies. Gay and straight readers alike will find this novel engaging and full of meaning about growing up behind a mask."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"--those words only begin to describe this claustrophobic, asphyxiating novel which is really an exercise in language as torture, prose as death sentence. Confessions of a Mask is a remarkable revelation of self and affirmation.

It is an excellent book for someone doubting themselves right now or for friends or family to know exactly what their loved one had to struggle with for many years and in some ways may still be struggling with."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"If one is looking for a book with a mood for eerie rituals of introspection, this is a good stuff. If one has a knack for being buttonholed with confessions, this is a good stuff too. If one likes finding the so-called absolute answers between the real and unreal, Mishima can articulate this dichotomy with his charming details and weird allegories in this novel. However this book is a great deal of a burden of tedious repetitions of his tales of perversion and guilt, while the dialogues are poorly blended to suit the whole narrative fabric.Mishima exotically expresses the surrealism of the feelings of a homosexual man, and his confessions of self-deception, and his obssession with blood, death, beauty and tragedy. Even when this novel is originally a Mishima version of one kind of love, his work is also a sort of an amalgam among aesthetes and sensualists like Oscar Wilde and Dostoevski as reflected by this sharp passage:&quot;I was one of those savage marauders who, not knowing how to express their love, mistakenly kill the persons they love. I would kiss the lips of those who had fallen to the ground and were still moving spasmodically.&quot;This is the first Mishima tale I have experienced, yet I feel that this work reveals a lot of his personality hook line and sinker."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"It tells the discovering of Mishima's gay identity, during the second world war and after.

The sadomasochist fantasies/feelings that accompany the narrator's sexuality are disturbing, yes - but at the same time, the narrator is so honest, so totally frank with the reader about everything he's experiencing, from his young boyhood to manhood, that I developed a respect for him I would never have thought, on first reading, that I'd have. At the same time, I was filled with compassion for the narrator because he's suffering so acutely -concealing his true self within himself; setting up mental walls... The narrator never asks for pity, but my heart is moved by what he's doing to himself.This is a riveting novel. The juxtaposition of the narrator's outward \\"normal\\" life and the ferocity of his \\"inner\\", emotional/sexual feelings, is just brilliant - unnerving, but brilliant."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"Yukio Mishima is one of Japan's most famous modern writers, having written over twenty books, forty plays, ninety short stories, and numerous poems, and having earned three nominations for the Nobel Prize before he committed seppuku (ritualistic suicide) in 1970 at the age of forty-five. Confessions of a Mask was his very first novel (arguably semi-autobiographical), but it is still considered one of his classics. The story is about a nameless homosexual narrator and his attempts throughout his life, from a young child to a grown man, to try to understand himself, his desires, and why exactly he feels so different from everyone else. He comes to the conclusion that he can fit easily into society if he just hides his true self behind a \\"mask\\", but he soon finds out it isn't that simple, and before long he begins to lose his firm grip on who exactly his \\"true self\\" really is.The book begins with the narrator describing certain instances from his childhood, memories that he feels have had a significant effect on who he is now. I thought this was just the story's introduction, Mishima's way of introducing the character and letting us get to know him better, but after many pages of these memories, I began to realize that this was the story. It doesn't have a clear beginning, middle, and end as much as it is just a series of events. After all, isn't that closer to the way real life is? Some of the events might seem random at first, but they are all strung together by the highly precise and articulate narrative.However, even though I thoroughly enjoyed Confessions of Mask, it is definitely not for everyone. There is not very much action in the narrator's life compared to what is going on in his head. And every time something exciting or dramatic does happen, the intensity is constantly being cut down by the narrator's analysis of exactly what psychological or philosophical importance the event has, and occasionally he goes off on tangents that lead to another event entirely before making his way back to where he started. This type of narrative style could easily have been botched by a less skilled writer, making the story sound messy and awkward, but Mishima knows from the beginning where he is going, and he arrives there successfully, detours and all. His psychoanalysis of himself comprises a lot of the book, but he keeps himself from sounding too self-centered by also offering his philosophical insight into human nature in general, not just his own.There are still a few times when his psychology begins to get tiresome or repetitive, but the beauty of Mishima's writing and the yearning to know what happens next still kept me reading without many complaints. Confessions of a Mask is depressing in how negatively the narrator views himself, but unfortunately the feeling of not fitting in is something that most everyone can relate to. The ending might not seem completely satisfying or conclusive at first, but it fits fairly well with the style of the rest of the novel. I recommend this fascinating and psychologically complex story to anyone who prefers reading books where there's more happening internally than externally, or to anyone else who is interested in trying something different."},{"Title":"CONFESSIONS OF A MASK [KAMEN NO KOKUHAKU]","review":"A fascinating read for all with an interest in the works of Yukio Mishima. \`Confessions' is Mishima's tortured autobiography, laying his life and mind bare, from his earliest memories through to the immediate post war period. Mishima touches on vivisection in his extraordinary \`The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea'; \`Confessions' established the groundwork for this through a gruelling vivisection of his own life. The deep and murky elements of his personality are exposed - the constant theme of desire for death, a particular kind of death, which he awaited impatiently \`with a sweet expectation' (only to run from it with abandon/relief when his army enlistment drew him close), his morbid sadomasochistic/homo-erotic sexual fantasies, his life echoing man's desire to play with fire and more, and more.

Most of the kids my age were into Jack Kerouac and \\"On the Road.\\"\\"Journal of Albion Moonlight\\" is not \\"On The Road.\\" The only other novel I have read that compares to it in any way is Frank Stanford's \\"The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You.\\"I admit that two or three decades of experience do make The Journal more intelligible, and I will probably always have a bookmark or two in this novel--because sometimes I am just in the mood for it."},{"Title":"Journal of Albion Moonlight.","review":"Recently came across a copy of Albion's Journal, signed and dated by his wife Miriam. So this made the re-reading more personal, somehow. I work as a bookpricer for a Friends of the Library group; someone donated the book to us.I'd read Albion Moonlight once or twice before, never in its entirety (an intriguing impossibility -- unless you are fond of lists, and outlines of possible books, and marginalia to the max).The journal as a journal pretty much disappears as a structure after about 50 pages -- but then later comes back -- and goes away -- and the dates proceed for a while, then sort of recycle. May to June and on, but you never get past August. And then you're back, somehow, to May again.Taken as a whole, the work seems more an artifact, or art object -- even a stunning one -- but also then something to look at and admire for its conception, rather than read. That's true of the last half or possibly as much as two-thirds of the work.Yet, all in all, I enjoyed meeting again with Albion and his rag-tag gang. The book is probably more over-hyped than any other \\"literary\\" title I've ever come across -- nonetheless, it remains engaging.I've read plenty of other \\"odd\\" novels, not always with pleasure. (OK, I'll confess, I seek them out.) I didn't care much for Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\" -- but loved many of Julio Cortazar's parables and novels, including \\"Hopscotch.\\" Gunter Grass' \\"Dog Years\\" remains an all-time favorite. Neither of those have much to do with traditional, progressive narrative time-lines. Yet that's very much part of what makes each one, in very different ways, effective.However, Patchen's rejection of narrative, or distaste for it, a love and hate affair working through the journal -- for me, this got very wearying.Moonlight is hilarious, did I say that? It has parts which are uproarious, and at places it is shockingly funny -- disturbingly so. These often very brief sections may be where it's most effective.But there's plenty of vile stuff, too. And and and ... is he preaching against murder or advocating it? Again and again he explains how he seeks to murder \\"murder.\\" Then he says he lied. Or that God (Roivas) made him lie when he said that. And so on.Patchen plays with making as many contradictory statements as possible, then makes contradictory statements about contradiction itself. This same sort of perverse persistence goes on with other themes and literary tropes. Often what makes the work live is the wild inventiveness present, but the invention then dies away with this tedious repetitiveness.So -- read with caution, but do read."},{"Title":"Journal of Albion Moonlight.","review":"A wide variety of material is in this book. The interview between Christ and Hitler should not be missed. Much play of typography. Entire short novels are written in the margins. The book is discontinuous but always picks you up and takes you in a new direction. Don't miss Chrystal,( the girl-Christ) or H. Roivas. (Roivas is Savior spelled backward.) A lot of semi-religious outcries in a basically secular book. It is as if the author can't shake off the religiosity of his culture and so gestures through it.

The heroine is a court reporter. Get it? The transcript format works fine on the printed page, but if you're reading on a Kindle and change the typeface size, you can wind up with a jumble of lines that break at weird places and numbers that don't serve any useful purpose.

I am a current breast cancer patient that was looking for a complimentary therapy to help me reduce my stress level while I was going through chemotherapy.My doctor recommended that I explore a method that focused on mind, body and spirit. I stumbled upon Steve's dvd series and was amazed at how it put me in a calm state almost immediately. The guided imagery sections were so soothing and relaxing that I felt completely at peace and any tension that I was holding was one. As a result I have not had any of the side effects that most people have with chemotherapy. The visual images are absolutely beautiful and vibrant. During one of the segments, I was convinced that the images leapt off of the screen and surrounded me with healing light. Everytime I watch the dvd, I am further empowered to be able to fight this disease.My oncology staff at UCLA's Cancer Center acknowledge the effective support the mind/body connection have as an aide in fighting this disease and Steve had perfected the tried and true art of visualization.

Few series get off to a stronger start than Mr. Crais did with The Monkey's Raincoat, which won both the Anthony and Macavity awards for best novel while being nominated for the Edgar and Shamus awards as well. And the books just keep getting better from there in their characterizations, action, story-telling and excitement.Elvis Cole is the star attraction, the co-owner of The Elvis Cole Detective Agency. He's 35ish, ex-Army, served in Vietnam, ex-security guard, has two years of college, learned to be a detective by working under George Feider, a licensed P.I. for over 40 years, does martial arts as enthusiastically as most people do lunch, and is fearless but not foolish. He's out to right the wrongs of the world as much as he is to earn a living. Elvis has a thing for Disney characters (including a Pinocchio clock), kids, cats, scared clients and rapid fire repartee. He drives a Jamaica yellow 1966 Corvette Stingray convertible, and usually carries a .38 Special Dan Wesson.His main foil is partner, Joe Pike, an ex-Marine, ex-cop who moves quietly and mysteriously wearing shades even in the dark . . . when he's not scaring the bad guys with the red arrows tattooed on his deltoids, which are usually bare in sleeveless shirts. Although he's got an office with Elvis, Pike spends all of his time at his gun shop when not routing the bad guys with martial arts while carrying and often using enough firepower to stop a tank. Pike rarely speaks . . . and never smiles. A standing gag is trying to catch Pike with a little twitch of his lips indicating he might possibly be amused. But he's there when you need him. He drives a red Jeep.Robert Parker's Spenser is the obvious character parallel for Elvis, but Spenser and Elvis are different in some ways. Cole is more solitary, usually being alone when he's not working. Cole is very much L.A. and Spenser is ultra blue collar Boston. Cole is martial arts while Spenser boxes and jogs. What they have in common is that they're both out to do the right thing, with money being unimportant. They both love to crack wise as they take on the bad guys. The bad guys hate the &quot;humor&quot; in both cases, and can't do much about it. The dialogue written for each is intensely rich.Mr. Crais has a special talent for making you care about his characters, especially the clients and their kids. You'll want to know what happens to them. With a lot of experience in script writing, Mr. Crais also knows how to set the scene physically and make you feel it. He may be out finest fiction writer about physical movement. He gives you all the clues to picture what's going on . . . but draws back from giving so much detail that you can?t use your own imagination to make things better.I grew up near Los Angeles, and get a special pleasure out of reading his descriptions of the differences in cities, neighborhoods, and buildings in the area. He gets in right . . . and in detail. It's a nice touch!On to Stalking the Angel, the second book in the series:&quot;I love to hear the storywhich angel voices tell.&quot;--The Little CorporalEmily Miller&quot;When the truth is found to be lies,and all the joy within you dies,don't you want somebody to love?&quot;--Jefferson AirplaneWhen Jillian Becker walks into his office, Elvis Cole thinks she's &quot;the best looking woman I'd seen in three weeks&quot; despite being dressed as a &quot;Serious Businesswoman.&quot; She introduces her boss, Bradley Warren, and within three pages Elvis is being asked to find the Hagakure, an 18th century manuscript outlining all proper forms of samurai behavior. The Hagakure has disappeared from Warren's home safe, where it was being stored temporarily while on loan from the influential Tashiro family in Kyoto, before a planned exhibition in Warren's new hotel located in L.A.'s Little Tokyo district. Although the manuscript is insured for three million dollars, the insurance won't begin to cover the losses that Warren will suffer from the Tashiro family taking their business elsewhere.As the predicament is being explained, Elvis is wisecracking away. Warren doesn't like his attitude and tells him so. Elvis recommends Pinkerton's. Elvis tells Warren that he won't take the case, and that he doesn't like Warren. Warren tells Jillian to leave a blank check. Jillian calms both men down and Elvis has a new client.The trail of the Hagakure brings Elvis and Joe into some of the most unappetizing situations I remember reading about in hard-boiled fiction. There are Japanese gangsters (the infamous Yakuza), vicious killings, gruesome family secrets, horrible betrayals and dangerous sexual obsessions to deal with.The story develops in small segments from quite different perspectives, usually in chapters of 4-5 pages in length, like a scene in a drama. Each change adds to a mosaic portrait of the characters and the overall situation. So the story moves fast . . . but without leaving you behind. There is enough material in this book to make three or four novels.Pay particular attention to the evolution of your perceptions of Jillian and Mimi. Mr. Crais does a nice job of helping you realize all sides of their characters. That's one quality that takes this book above the best of the Spenser books.After you finish the book, you might find it interesting to think about the dangers that can come from reaching for more than we can handle.What can you do to resist harmful temptation?Donald MitchellCo-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"A good rule for writers is, write what you know about. Stalking the Angel is a good example of what can go wrong when you ignore that rule. The author blows hard to convince us that he is a real tough guy who knows all about real tough things like martial arts, and ends up convincing us that he doesn't. (The note About the Author specifies that he lives with an Akita guard dog. What's he afraid of?) It seems that he researched his background by reading \\"Shogun\\" and eating in a bunch of Asian restaurants.I do not expect a detective story writer to be an Orientalist, but the author screws up the background so often that it is distracting. Tang is a Chinese name. Naming your Japanese villain Eddie Tang is like having a Gestapo general named Paddie O'Brian. Maybe to the author, these Orientals all look alike, like waiters in a Chinese restaurant. Thus the sentence in which Elvis performs the \\"dragon kata from the taekwondo.\\" Dragon is a Chinese martial art element, not a kata, which is a Japanese term; adding a 'the' to Korea's tae kwon do is as annoying an affectation as his \\"the Nam\\". Maybe he's trying to show how macho he is, as in the scene -- which drags on for page after page -- in which the hero heroically eats all the pepper the sinister, ungrammatical Oriental cook puts in his food.During and since the war, I have traveled all over Viet Nam, sometimes the only foreigner to set foot in a vicinity for years, and when I ate with these people, we all used chopsticks. Even in the boonies. Don't they know better? If they learned English and read American detective novels, they would discover the error of their ways. Crais informs us that people in Viet Nam don't use chopsticks. Either my friends were all mixed up, or the author was thinking of Burma, or maybe Indonesia. Can't tell all those pesky Orientals apart, can you, sir?Belief must be suspended, credibility given wide leeway. If you kick someone in the side of the head with a reverse spin kick and he appears a few minutes later with a swollen cheek, either you didn't connect or your leg is made of cotton candy. Okay, one guard goes down, so the bad guys just walk away and let the hero sort of roam about at leisure in their stronghold. I did not realize California law was so lenient to PI's. Elvis and Joe go kill half a dozen bad guys, and go home: no inquest, no trial, just go home. Not even OJ got such a good deal.Frankly, I thought the characters were paper-thin, especially Bradely Warren and Joe Pike.The only part of the book that really comes to life is the description of Traci Louise Fishman, a scared, lonely teenager. Here the author is dealing in territory he knows. The rest of it is like a Jet Lee movie: lots of posturing, but it's not the real stuff."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I started reading the Elvis Cole books after amazon-based research-\\"other customers who bought this liked\\", etc. I thoroughly enjoy mystery novels, especially the recurring private detective variety. Robert B. Parker's Spenser novels are my favorite-I have read all 30+ at least twice. Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike remind me a lot of Spenser and Hawk, though of course there are differences. Thus far (2 books in) Cole is like Spenser in that he's a tough guy who follows his moral compass above all other things and relies on humor as a defense mechanism. Pike and Hawk are the toughest-emotionless criminals who do the necessary bad things; but they really rely on their friends and help them, I think, to give them a sense of humanity.This story is very well done and still holds up 24 years after its initial release. The concept of answering machines and the older cars like a Merkur or an Alfa Romeo Spyder made me chuckle but did not distract from the story.If you like PI mystery novels you will like this book. If you are a fan of Spenser I'd be surprised if you didn't consider reading the series as I plan to do."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"The Elvis Cole series written by Robert Crais is turning out to be one of those multi-volume series where I'm going to want to read each book. This is the second in the series so now I've read three of the books and think I understand the characters pretty well. I especially liked having Joe Pike present during so much of this novel. He is such an enigmatic character when compared to the ebullient nature of Elvis Cole and the two opposite characters work very well together. Robert Crais did a very good job of filling this novel with characters who had depth and dimension. As seems to be the case in these novels, there is a lot of driving around the streets of LA and it's surroundings with detailed descriptions of where everything is located. Maybe a little bit on the long winded side for me, but at least I get a good feel for the neighborhoods and countryside.Perhaps what intrigued me most about this plot is that the reader is left not quite sure of why certain things happened. Not that the threads of the plot were not finished up, that's not what I mean. The motivation and truth of why something happened, that's what you are unsure of. And, quite frankly, I think it makes for a much better book because it was left that way. Cole starts off looking for an extremely valuable Japanese book, but the case rapidly moves into other areas because what he encounters is a completely dysfunctional family, a totally self-absorbed billionaire, a kidnapping and a murder. And questions, many, many questions.This second book in the series follows along in the same direction as the others I've read and I will continue to work my way through the Robert Crais canon. And I'm sincerely looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"First Line: I was standing on my head in the middle of my office when the door opened and the best looking woman I'd seen in three weeks walked in.When Bradley Warren and his assistant, Jillian Becker, try to hire Elvis Cole to find a stolen (and priceless) Japanese manuscript, Cole isn't all that eager to accept the case. Warren rubs his fur completely the wrong way. But when Warren's young daughter is kidnapped, the P.I. puts aside his differences and starts tracking down the bad guys.When I read the first Elvis Cole mystery, The Monkey's Raincoat, I fell head over heels for Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike. Unfortunately, while reading this second book in the series, the bloom was off the rose. The plot, the pacing, the writing are just as good, and I still love Elvis and Joe, but reading Stalking the Angel made me realize something:The reason why I don't read many mysteries featuring the hard-boiled types of private investigators is because I have a very low tolerance for the plots.The plots all seem to be the same. Some drop dead gorgeous broad clacks her way into the P.I.'s seedy office, bats her eyelashes, and persuades the manly investigator to do something he really doesn't want to do. There's usually an obnoxious male cretin on hand as a foil for the P.I. and his wisecracks. At least 30% of the characters are pond scum, and the P.I. hero has to have the crap beaten out of him at least once. Preferably twice.Unfortunately (for me) the plot and the formula went hand in hand in this book. I still love Elvis and Joe, but I think this love affair just has no room for growth. And before any of you die hard fans gang up on me, let me say once more that these books are well-written and the two main characters are fantastic. Even though the story lines aren't my cup of tea and I seriously doubt that I will read any more books in the series......if you give me an ELVIS AND JOE 4EVER!!!! bumper sticker, I'll cherish (and use) it with pride."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Wisecracking private investigator Elvis Cole and his enigmatic partner Joe Pike are back in \\"Stalking The Angel\\", the second novel in the Elvis Cole series. This time Elvis and Joe get involved with the Japanese yakuza when hired by a local businessman to find a priceless Japanese historical artifact. When Elvis gets too close to the truth, the businessman's teenage daughter is kidnapped for leverage.While the idea of the plot is novel, I found it to be somewhat less interesting than his previous novel. Don't get me wrong - it's still a good read, but at times a bit disjointed, and a couple of little things bugged me. For instance, I found the idea that a Japanese thug would have the Chinese name \\"Tang\\" to be somewhat doubtful. While still a smartass, the one-liners Cole drops are a little less funny than in the previous installment. On the plus side Robert Crais keeps on developing the two main characters, allowing little glimpses inside their psyche that made me want to come back for more."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"This was much better than the first one of the series (The Monkey's Raincoat). Elvis Cole is hired to find this sacred Japanese book that has been stolen from a business man who had it on loan from a group of respected Japanese. His job becomes more than just a hunt for a book.This is the type of book you could read in one sitting. I like Elvis much better in this book than the first one. He isn't as sleezy. The humor is witty and well timed. Joe Pike, the silent and sleek partner, is a class act. Highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole is a wisecracking laidback dude who seems intent on annoying everyone who crosses his path with his whimsical humour. The only person who seems to laugh at his jokes is me.This time, Elvis is hunting down a priceless book called the Hagakure for a very wealthy businessman. As usual, the man Elvis is working for annoys Elvis and so he goads him mercilessly with witty repartee and cornball humour (impressing his client no end). Once the investigation begins the trail leads to the Japanese mafia, also known as the Yakuza. Joe Pike makes his appearance from this point on (what Elvis Cole mystery would be complete without him?) and together they try to track down the missing book.As far as detective novels go, the Elvis Cole series continues to entertain. The humour of Elvis' narration mixed with the action and drama ensures that the story breezes along and never fails to entertain. There are some twists and turns toward the end of the book that help add some spice to the mystery and gave it an ending that I wasn't really expecting."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I read &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat&quot; over a year ago and was so underwhelmed that I only just now read &quot;Stalking the Angel.&quot; There's been so much acclaim for this series I figured it deserved a second chance. I'm glad I gave it that chance.I won't rehash the plot - there are other good reviews of it. It's an ok story though I felt the second half of the book was a rather weak resolution to a promising premise.It's Elvis that makes this book sing. He's growing into an intriguing, complicated personality without the dark side (i.e. alcoholism, smoking, anger) seen so often in PI fiction. His quirks are fun (all the cartoon references). More than that, this man knows and loves his food. Even better, he shares more than a few terrific meals with us. I was salivating for all the wonderful Asian food more than once.Bottom-line: I'll be reading the next book in this series soon. For new readers, this is the second book in the series. It's probably not critical to read the first book to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Freakin awesome read. To cool.

Sweet!!!!!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Stalking the Angel, by Robert Crais, is the second entry in the Elvis Cole Los Angeles Private Investigator series. I guess this should be more appropriately referred to as the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series. I read an interview by the author in which he stated that he didn't suggest reading the books in order, as the recent books are much more indicative of his style and the characters. In spite of that, I have elected to read the books in order, and I am glad that I have. This novel dwelves even further into the odd relationship between Pike and Cole. Pike is at ease killing bad guys, or making Cole breakfast.The mystery here, or case, involves the Japanese mafia, and one very dysfunctional family that hires Cole to locate a missing Japanese treasure. The story was enjoyable and the characters are outstanding. The wise-cracking Cole had me laughing at several times as I read. While Pike in all his stoic glory is a delight. This book really focues on the true ambiguity that sometimes exists between right and wrong and the good guys and the bad guys.I highly recommend this book and would encourage any potential Crais readers to jump right in.

When I found another crime / mystery novel series set in LA, I was hooked. You've got the smartass, charming, darning detective in Elvis Cole. You've got the serious, mysterious character of Joe Pike. It's a great team.This novel deals with a missing book, a screwed up family and lots of adventuring. I found that I couldn't put this novel down. The chapters were fairly short and the action was fast and furious. And if you live/lived/visited Los Angeles, it's even more fun as there's a lot of good geography contributing to the story.Thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Stalking the Angel wasn't he best Elvis Cole novel I ever read. Actually, it wasn't even up in the top five. It's good, mind you, but not as good as the rest of the Crais books that I've read. I've been trying to put my finger on it while I read it just why I didn't love it as much as I usually love his books. I came to a few conclusions: the plot is forced sometimes, taking directions that seem to have been designed and not grown naturally. Characterization seems almost sparse here and some of the characters just aren't as fully-realized as his characters usually were.All in all, it's still a good book. Crais on a bad day is ten-times better than half the people writing \\"bestsellers\\" these days however as an Elvis Cole novel, it's a little low on my list. I recommend it as a good thriller and if you are an Elvis Cole fan, read it of course. Elvis is still king."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole has been hired to retrieve an ancient Japanese manuscript stolen from a prominent LA businessman. It soon turns into a rescue of the businessman's daughter who has apparently been kidnapped by the yakuza, the Japanese Mafia. Things are not as they appear and Elvis and Joe Pike do battle with some pretty tough guys. The humor that Crais uses liberally, makes it easy to get into the heart of the story. The action fell a little short of other Crais novels I've read, but overall it was an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Now...I wonder why I didn't enjoy this book as much as his previous work. Troubled teenager was a bit too confusing in actions and words and never could figure out why Elvis was so extremely drawn to helping the teen. Much of the plot was muffled to me. Mind you, I really like Crais' style--thus my disappointment."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Another Elvis Cole story. I read this book simply because I like the Elvis Cole character very much. In this story, he was righteous as usual, but what made him humane and loveable was that, like every human being, he was not perfect. He could get emotionally carried away, he was also prone to making wrong deductions and judgment. Beneath his tough ways, he had a vulnerable side too. We were shown these side of his character amidst a plot that appeared complex enough to make me stay interested in the book from beginning till the end. In this story, Cole was tasked to find a valuable Japanese manuscript. Soon after, the threats made to his client and his family, the disappearance of his client's daughter, the involvement of a Japanese cult and the Japanese mafia made the assignment appeared more dangerous and complex than it really was. I found myself on an exciting ride as Cole and his partner, Pike, took it upon themselves to rescue the missing daughter, and at the same time, unravel the riddles that were puzzling them (as well as me). A thoroughly enjoyable, hard to put down book."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole is a charming, sharp witted, wise-cracking private investigator who is teamed up with a Clint Eastwood type partner, Joe Pike.His novels are fast paced, and entertaining enough to make me laugh out loud.My favorite Elvis Cole novel is L. A. Requiem. It focuses on Joe Pike. Crais' writing is on a completely different level in this one. I highly recommend his books. I have read all but his newest: Demolition Angel. I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"The realist in me feels like it is all a little too far fetched, and way beyond what most people can relate to however for those who enjoy a rollicking good ride, well, why not? Make believe can produce all sorts of wild and wonderful experiences, so I would have to recommend highly for those who like to step outside the straight and narrow. A real page turner!!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"In this second, and probably the weakest Elvis Cole novel, Crais seemed to spew a book out without any thought. Instead of a well thought out novel, Crais spends needless time on pointless details and intermingles random sarcastic thoughts that only seem to slow down the book to a crawl.The book starts off well with Elvis in charge of finding a priceless Japanese book. Then the book just moves to the absurd, with a flashy nightclub, family incest, and a strange cult spliced together to form some sore of plot. The worst part is the detail that takes away from the weak plot. A prime example is a four-page interlude where Crais describes a man drinking coffee and how a room is arranged. Worst of all, the coffee and the room mean absolutely nothing to the book. Approximately ten percent of the book is devoted to what the detectives eat.Crais tries to save this book with sarcasm. Of course when every other page contains a supposedly witty remark, the lines get tired and old after a while.Unless you plan to read all the Elvis Cole novels, it'd be best to skip this one."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Hard-boiled and always wisecracking private detective, Elvis Cole and his ever silent partner, Joe Pike are back and better than ever in Stalking the Angel. This time out, he's hired by hotel magnate, Bradley Warren, to find the Hagakure, a priceless Japanese manuscript, that's been stolen from Warren's personal safe in his Holmby Hills mansion. As he and Pike begin their investigation, Warren's daughter is first threatened and then kidnapped from right under their noses and Elvis and Joe are now on a mission to find both the manuscript and the girl, unharmed..... Robert Crais has done it again! Stalking the Angel is a fast paced mystery/thriller, you'll have to finish in one sitting. This is a story that has it all...writing that's smart and spare, with never a wasted word; crisp, irreverent dialogue and suspenseful, riveting scenes. And, as Pike and Cole circle closer and closer to the truth, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, turning pages to the story's shocking and satisfying conclusion. Stalking the Angel is a book mystery fans shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole is a modern day PI who lives and works in Los Angeles and has the same kind of cheeky, rather smart arsed dialogue as the Mickey Spillane hero of a generation ago. Elvis is engaged by a wealthy businessman to recover a valuable, old Japanese book which was stolen from his house. Elvis and his muscular side kick, Joe Pike, both Vietnam vets, become embroiled in a series of violent events which are centered in Little Tokyo, the Japanese section of LA.When the businessman's daughter is kidnapped, Elvis is summarily fired but continues to look for the girl as he had promised to look after her and feels a sense of guilt about this lonely, strange girl. He locates her in a commune for homeless teenagers, led by a formerly famous martial arts hero who wants the world to live by the standards of the Japanese code of honour, Bushido. Things go from bad to worse for Elvis and Joe, resulting in a shootout and a very violent martial arts fight to the death. I liked the story, especially the sassy way Elvis deals with danger, but was saddened by the plight of the children of the rich and famous who seem to be lost souls, for all their affluence."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"This is the second entry in the Elvis Cole series. It is not quite as good as &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat&quot;, but it is still very entertaining. Elvis is deeply involved in martial arts and yoga and Mr. Crais has him mixing it up with the Japanese mafia, whose members also follow the discipline. Elvis is hired by the assistant to a high profile hotel magnate who has aligned himself with the Asian community in L.A. An ancient manuscript in the magnate's care has disappeared and Elvis is brought on to find it. Mr. Crais suffers a little bit of a sophomore slump with &quot;Stalking The Angel&quot;. He uses some tired mystery novels cliches, many of the charcters are stock profiles. Despite some of these shortcomings, this is still an above average story and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"As a huge fan of detective fiction, especially books with a sense of humor, I don't know why I waited so long to read the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais. His main character is both tough and quirky, the stereotypical wisecracking PI who knows how to use his fists as well as his rapier-sharp wit. It seems like a formula that should be successful every time out.Stalking the Angel, the second book in the series, is not, however, the best. The jokes and puns that seemed fresh and witty in the first novel, The Monkey's Raincoat, now read like they were taken out of a huge volume titled \\"101 Jokes for Public Speakers.\\" In plain terms, much of the humor is simply lame. The plot also seems like something that was hastily thrown together after an evening of watching kung fu movies on television; an ancient Japanese manuscript is stolen by the asian mafia and Elvis Cole is hired to get it back. It's a premise that's just too hackneyed to get very excited about.What does earn the book three stars, however, is the set of characters who remain likeable even when the book fails in other areas. Stalking the Angel is also a fast read, so once you've breezed through the 260 pages you'll feel a bit excited but not overwhelmed. An entertaining if not fantastic read, this book is essential for those reading the Elvis Cole series in order."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"When Bradley Warren saunters into Elvis's office, the two men clash from the beginning. But Elvis still takes his case. Seems a rare and valuable manuscript from Japan that Bradley borrowed has gone missing and Bradley feels the police aren't doing enough to find it. Elvis soon picks up a trail that leads him to the underside of Little Tokyo. But when the Warren family begins receiving threatening phone calls, the heat really picks up. Can Elvis keep the family safe and find the manuscript?Ok, I admit, I'm not much of a hardboiled fan. But something about this series intrigues me. Probably the fact that the main character is more passionate about Disney then I am. And I really do love Elvis. His sarcasm and quips had me laughing throughout the entire book. However, it's not all fun and games. The further you go, the darker it gets. That's probably my big complaint; it just got too dark for my personal tastes. On the whole, it's a great storyline that keeps you reading until the final page with a couple nice twists. And all the characters are interesting and very real.I certainly recommend this book to fans of hardboiled PI's. It's very well written and engaging. Frankly, even though I'm not a fan of this sub-genre, I'm thinking I may need to continue with these characters myself. They're that intriguing."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"The development of the characters (Elvis Cole and Joe Pike) continues in this the second book of his series. It is excellent. Mr. Crais weaves a fine mystery - with lots of plot twists. Cole is very human, often mistaken in his perceptions of what he considers damsels-in-distress! This makes him a more interesting character than most PI's, who for some reason are always presented as omniscient!An excellent read, I would recommend it to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"This is the second book in this series. I liked it better than &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat.&quot; Elvis is hired by Bradley Warren to find a book that has been stolen. As he begins his search, Mimi Warren, his daughter, is kidnapped. Or, is she. Elvis and Pike get involved with Japanese bad men. Can the book be found, can they bring the daughter back alive? Makes for a pretty good book. Hate to say so but is a little like a Parker book where Spencer would not take a young man back to his parents because he did not want to go. Elvis is a wisecracking PI, a whole lot like Spencer. However, I do believe Hawk can take Pike. All in all if you like a good mystery that is fast moving and as some surprising twists, I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Yep, Elvis Cole tackles the scary, heartless Japanese Mafia, the Yakuza, as he attempts to find an ancient, priceless manuscript that has been stolen from the world's worst human being, a businessman probably as heartless as the dread Yakuza. That Elvis! Does he get great clients, or what? Protecting himself from the businessman's sexual predator wife and trying to protect their vulnerable, at times almost catatonic, teenaged daughter, while trying to hunt down the elusive Japanese manuscript, keeps Elvis on his toes and readers on the edge of their seats. Joe Pike, his silent (but deadly) partner, brings all the big guns into this explosive---and surprising!---finale. Excellent! Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Another wonderful entry in this great series! I love the way Mr. Crais uses detective novels to write about serious issues. When he describes the loneliness of an outcast teenaged girl, I was in tears. A few pages later I was ROTFLMAO when a stubborn parking attendant confronts Elvis Cole. This is a fast, funny, thoughtful book. I REALLY enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole, the wise-cracking L.A. Detective is back and still the same. Crais proves again he can give the right mixture of suspense, mystery, and humor. Get in on the Elvis Cole books before they're not around anymore."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Of course I'm reading this series backwards (sort of), but I like them all as Elvis is a great character along with his stoic and hard partner Joe Pike. This one did not have the usual clever comic relief I've found it every book I've read thus far.However, he did give it the old college try and got a couple chuckles at least.And obviously, you do not have to read the series in order, although I wish I could have."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"\\"Angel\\" is one of the earlier Elvis Cole PI stories, with, as frequently is the case, his partner Joe Pike providing some \\"muscle\\" later in the tale. Elvis is hired to find a rare Japanese book about samurai culture, the \\"Hagakure\\", which is crucial for the well-being and reputation of the investment firm from which it has been purloined - from the home safe of principal Bradley Warren to be specific. After Cole's hiring, Warren's wife and daughter receive threatening phone calls about calling off the search, and soon enough daughter Mimi is kidnapped. What then follows is all manner of intrigue and mayhem involving LA's \\"Little Japan\\", the Japanese mafia, and a bunch of thugs intent upon hanging on to the book and the daughter. Perversely, Elvis gets fired off the case, but decides to see it through on his own dime, feeling he owes it to Mimi.To be direct, while we found Cole's typical wise-guy attitude as much fun as usual, the plot developments, almost all involving somewhat improbable stakeouts, got a little hard to follow and harder still to swallow. But as with most of these tales, a satisfying ending caps off a relatively entertaining storyline, providing enough incentive to proceed to finish out with the one book in the set to date we have yet to devour. While we sometimes complain about the inconsistency of the various Cole and Pike outings, they are all good enough to warrant our continued audience."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Another wonderful Elvis Cole story. Terrific plot development. Beautifully written. Crais is a master. I just wish that all of his stuff was available on my Kindle. You can't go wrong with Elvis and Joe."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"The first few chapters just crack with great writing and good character development. The rest of the novel -- and the mystery itself -- is pretty flat. Fortunately, the overall series is consistently good."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I had a lot of trouble finding this book...am glad I did! This is one of my favorite authors and I have read everything else in the series and finally found a copy of this and Moneys Raincoat (both were hard finds). Never a disapointment from Crais!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Funny, fast-paced, and nearly impossible to put down. I'm attempting to read the Elvis Cole series in order. The Monkey's Raincoat was great. This one is even better. On to #3."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"6 discs.7 hours.Synopsis: Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike are hired by a Los Angeles businessman to find a missing copy of the \\"Hagakure\\", a book that details Bushido, or the way of the Samurai. Along the way, they discover hidden family secrets, connection to the Yakuza (Japan's ultra-violent mafia) and deal with a kidnapping and modern followers of the Bushido.Written in 1989, \\"Stalking the Angel\\" is an early Elvis Cole book. Crais is still doing a bit of casting about to find his rhythm with the characters of Joe Pike, Elvis and even his irascible cat. The plot doesn't flow as well as later books but it still a very nice listen.It is narrated by Patrick G. Lawlor who does a solid job of catching Cole's wisecracking side but overall does not catch on to Elvis as well as the narrators of his later books do."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"So far, this is one of my favorites because I use to work in downtown L.A. and I live in West L.A. and everytime Elvis make a turn on the street, I know exactly where he is and can't help but laugh because he describes it to vividly, it's almost like I am in the car with him, thinking his thoughts, seeing through his eyes. I love this series!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"STALKING THE ANGEL is the second novel in Robert Crais' \\"Elvis Cole\\" series, about a private detective in Los Angeles. I though it was a pretty enjoyable read, although a bit too derviative of Robert Parker's Spenser novels.Elvis Cole is like Spenser in a variety of ways: he's a non-stop comedian, he's a war vet with a code of honor, he has an ultra-tough sidekick (named \\"Pike\\" instead of \\"Hawk\\"), he has a love-hate relationship with the cops, and his clients are typically rich, privileged, oversexed, and insufferably arrogant.The plot of STALKING THE ANGEL, which involves a missing Japanese manuscript, reminds me of the first Spenser novel, which also involves a missing manuscript. Elvis Cole also tries to \\"save\\" a young girl from her dysfunctional family, which reminds me of Spenser novels like EARLY AUTUMN and CEREMONY. In other words, there is very little here that struck me as fresh and original.Still, Crais is a highly skilled writer, and STALKING THE ANGEL is a funny and entertaining diversion. If you like Robert Parker's work, this book is definitely worth a try. My understanding is that the Elvis Cole series gets better with time, so I will definitely try some of the later installments in the near future."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I'm happy to say that I'm hooked on Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. I know I'm late to the party, but hey, better to be late then to not show up at all. I started the series from the beginning with \\"The Monkey's Raincoat.\\", and immediately after reading that, I grabbed \\"Stalking the Angel\\" The first book was great, and this book, no exception.Robert Crais has created some of my new favorite characters to date, I love the always witty and wisecracking Elvis \\"Hound Dog\\" Cole, and the quiet Joe Pike.The plots are very intriguing, but for me it's the characters that I enjoy the most. Each time I read them, it's like being with a friend. I don't find that very often in a book. Props to Mr. Crais.I plan to read the whole series. (12 so far and counting)As long as Robert Crais keeps them coming, I will keep reading them.Do yourself a favor and get hooked with me...it feels good!Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I'm a big fan of Crais' work, including the early novels, but Stalking the Angel lacks the energy and sparkle of the others. The plot holds few surprises and the wisecracks seem forced. There's a flatness to this work, despite some good moments, and the key character, a 16 year old girl, never really comes to life. If you haven't read any of the early Elvis Coles, don't start here -- I'd suggest beginning with the first one, The Monkey's Raincoat, then moving on to Lullaby Town."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I have read several Elvis Cole novels and really enjoyed them all... until this one. The plot was just SO unbelievable!!! He goes out on a limb (not unusual for Elvis) but for such a teeny, tiny reason, then, there's a ton of violence and posturing (OK, so that's not unusual for him, either). It was the assumptions he made and the unwelcome \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" schtick that really got to me. Maybe I've just read one too many of his, or something.Also, I must say, that I rely heavily on Publisher's Weekly Reviews to help me determine which books to read (so many books, so little time...), and I feel the review for this book was way off base.And, honestly, how does Elvis pay his mortgage and power bills? I've yet to see him take money for a case, isn't he supposed to be a 'professional' private eye?? I just could NOT suspend disbelief while reading this book."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Shades of Mikky Spillane. Very cliche. The wife of the rich man supposedly works very hard and makes lots of sacificies to become the wife of a rich man and she has no other marketable skills. Yet when she learns her daughter had been molested by the father she supposedly attacks and condems the father. HaHa. After so-o-o-o much work and sacificie to win the position and with no markable skills it is not likely this would occur. Most likely she would declare the daughter a lier, kick her out of the home, defend the husband and father. IS SHE REALLY GOING TO DESTROY HER ONLY MEANS OF LIVELY HOOD?? Get real, do you think she wants to be homeless and starve over alittle bit of incest? You don't know women."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Not half the book its predecessor was. Friends tell me the next book is not very good, either, but that the more recent books are as return to form. Sure hope so: &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat&quot; whetted my appetite for more."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"This novel has all the gritty realism of a late 70s network cop show: TJ Hooker meets Starsky &amp; Hutch. The plot was painfully predictable, the characters laughably cliched and the dialog stupid, forced and irritating. Toward the end of the book, after heroes Elvis and Pike, easily blow away a half dozen oriental villans, they proceed to voluntarily and inexplicably put down their weaponry in order to engage in hand to hand combat with one final bad guy...just like on tv. I, for one, expect more from a detective novel and won't waste my time with the other Crais books."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"When Cole walks into the room you say, \\"What will happen now?\\" This is the best thing you can say about a popular novel. So I like to read Robert Crais.RUN FOR IT!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I love this author...or at least I love his three most recent novels, L.A. Requiem, (the best Elvis Cole novel so far), Demolition Angel and Hostage. Because I read those later efforts first, I am having some problems with the earlier Elvis novels which are heavy on wise cracking by Cole, big into martial arts and thin in the story line. If you find yourself in an airport and you forgot to bring something to read in line and on the plane, these will do, but I don't recommend going back to these earlier efforts to find the level of writing Crais is putting out now. Most authors burst on the scene and over time find it harder and harder to maintain their edge. Not so here. These early novels are Creative Writing 101 products."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"This is my first Robert Crais book, after I had seen all of his work rate so highly on Amazon.com, and I had to say that it is brilliant!Crais introduces us to ex-cop, now PI, Elvis Cole - who is very much into martial arts (with baddies) and witty one-liners with potential clients. Along with his psycho friend, they out to the streets and fight crime (along probably making &amp; breaking their own rules as they go along).Stalking the Angel brings us into the world of the Japanese Mafia and kidnapping. Although this can be a heavy subject, it is dealt with in an extremely amusing &amp; entertaining storyline and you will be laughing along with Cole's antics and razorsharp dialogue.If you are looking for a good crime/thriller novel with alot of humour and entertainment, then don't pass up Stalking the Angel!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Go...Elvis .... one of my favorite new characters and new series...looking forward to all of the books ahead.... thank you Crais"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"All of Crais's novels are worth 5 stars.

He has very humorous dialogue in his books that make me laugh out loud. He is on my list now and I intend to read all his books."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Now, if you're wondering how a hardboiled mystery could ever make you laugh, you obviously haven't met Elvis Cole. This is a series I resisted at first - I guess I was put off by the thought of a detective named Elvis. But I'm hooked and I think you will be too! Stalking the Angel hits the ground running on page one and I didn't put it down until the last page was read. Wise cracking Cole adheres to no one's standards and doesn't much seem to care who hires him. When he's approached by Bradley Warren, a pompous executive, to investigate the theft of a priceless manuscript, he takes the job even though the two clash from the first word. Meeting Warren's exhibitionistic wife and troubled daughter dampens what little enthusiasm he has for the case, but when the daughter is kidnapped after Cole promised her he'd watch out for her, it becomes personal. When suspects start dying torturous, violent deaths, Cole enlists the aid of partner Joe Pike and the two leave no stone unturned in bringing the case to a climactic end. Robert Crais presents us with a lovable hero with a smart mouth and eyes that don't miss much. But don't be deceived - this is no cozy. Violence is real, but not unjustified. Ethical lines are understandably blurred and happily ever after isn't part of the deal. Still, it's a highly enjoyable read and we can all look forward to Elvis' latest adventure - LA Requiem, due out in June."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Robert Crais is one of the rare authors of private detective novels to succeed in making me laugh as well as making me biting my nails. The plot is intense. Pike is at the same time hard and tender, and Cole is as much funny as eager to solve the mystery. Always a good reading. You are lucky, you who have not still read any the novels of Crais!"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole is a wisecracking private investigator who likes Falstaff beer, Mickey Mouse, and can tell you exactly which designer made the clothes and accessories the villains wear. A Viet Nam vet who came back determined to preserve what was left of his childhood, a man with a strong hero complex, and, when need be, a stone killer. Now he is working a case for financier Bradley Warren, trying to find a stolen copy of the Hagakure, the ancient Japanese code of behavior for the Samurai.Elvis' clue gathering style is to keep stirring the pot of likely sources and suspects until something floats to the top. This time what comes up is trouble. Warren's family receives several threats, which he chooses to ignore. Suddenly the worst happens and Mimi Warren is kidnapped, leaving no trace. Incensed, Warren fires Cole and the detective decides to continue the case on his own. He promised Mimi he would protect her, and he's not about to let the Yakuza of two countries get in his way.Robert Crais' tactic is to lure the reader in with Elvis Cole's humorous attitude and hard-boiled attitude, and then follow through with a series of severe hammer blows. Even when you know that there is a nightmare waiting to happen, its onset is a shock. Perhaps this is formula writing, but few authors can shift gears as smoothly as Crais can. One moment you are listening in on some sarcastic dialog between Cole and his partner Joe Pike, the next minute they are dealing out badness - and you are liking it.In addition, Crais' characters are never one sided. If anything, they defy the common stereotypes. Cole and Pike don't simply hunt villains and right wrongs; they hold intelligent conversations and understand the issues they must deal with. Good plot, great characters and a fine eye for detail makes 'Stalking the Angel' a memorable story. One that will drive you back to the bookshelves looking for more."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"In this second book of the series, Elvis Cole is back, spouting witty dialogue, trying to save the girl, and eliminate the bad guys. Sound pretty much appropriate for a detective story? Not when it involves a Disney-figurine-loving guy driving a yellow corvette.A priceless Japanese manuscript is stolen and snappy private investigator Elvis Cole is hired to find it. Bradley Warren and the best looking woman he has seen in weeks, Jillian Becker, need Elvis to find the Hagakure, and money is no object thanks to the blank check they left him. In the process, Warren's daughter, Mimi, is kidnapped by the Japanese mafia, making Elvis' work that much harder. Elvis' trail runs cold several times, as the storyline takes several unexpected twists.Elvis is once again, complimented by his sociopathic, always-wearing-shades partner, Joe Pike. Straight-faced cop Lou Poitras is also back in a minor background role, but always adding a dry humor to the novel. Mimi, the kidnapped daughter, is a very interesting character in this book, as she is the focal point of the investigation, and it is her that brings out Elvis' human side. If anything, STALKING THE ANGEL, opens the readers eyes to Cole's serious, yet sensitive feelings. This human element made for a much more complete novel.This was a very good book, that reads exceptionally well. The flow is quite nice, with the amusing hero in Elvis taking center stage. This is another solid effort from Robert Crais."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I've read this book as well as the rest of the Elvis Cole series. They are witty and entertaining. It is very easy to become involved with the characters. Elvis Cole is a caring individual who has a witty way of looking at things. Even his cat is funny. Joe Pike, his partner in the detective agency, is straight as an arrow. He can't even smile, his lip just quivers. Each Elvis Cole book in the series seems to be a little better then the one before. I'm totaly hooked on this series. I also recommend Harlan Coben and his Myron Bolitar series. I have read all of Harlan Coben's books. In the process of ordering his books, Robert Crais was recommended to me as an alternative to Harlan Coben and the Myron Bolitar series. This is why I'm reading Robert Crais and I'm hooked. Buy the whole Elvis Cole series. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"I like smart-aleck detectives. People like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, Rex Stout's Archie Goodwin, Robert Parker's Spenser, and Robert Crais' Elvis Cole. As you probably can tell from seeing my reading list, I'm pretty much a sucker for humor in any of its manifestations (okay, maybe not puns). Crais' style is close to Parker, yet Crais' competant detective doesn't have the macho baggage that Spenser carries. (To digress, that macho baggage is actually what marks the Spenser books above the crowd, as Parker forces he \\"independent, macho cowboy\\" type to interact with the modern, touchy-feely world. You can bet that Spenser is a \\"sensitive, new age guy.\\") Cole may not be as macho as Spenser, but he is still fearless--he is a Vietnam vet, after all--but most of the strong, silent type of detective stuff is handled by the secretive partner, Joe Pike, while Cole gets to zing all those one-liners with abandon at anyone who crosses his threshold.The mystery here is one that Parker would have taken to as well. Cole is hired by a wealthy businessman to retrieve on of the last remaining copies of the Hagakure, the book that defines Japanese feudal culture. Along the way, we get to meet the Yakuza (Japan's version of the mafia), some serious dysfunctional families, a cult, and thow in a bit of true love and a nice look at ethics, and you've got a Spenser novel (if you replaced Cole with Spenser and Pike with Hawk).(...)"},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Elvis Cole, a quirky LA detective is recruited by a wealthy business man, Bradley Warren, to retrieve an important Japanese manuscript, called the \\"Hagakure\\" which was stolen from Warren's safe. While Elvis is reluctant to take the case he soon discovers that there is more to the story, so decides to uncover the truth. Warren's wife Sheila is a sex starved alcoholic and his daugter Mimi is a deeply unhappy and ignored teenager.The second installment of Robert Crais' Elvis Cole series Stalking The Angel is a good quick read. It is hard boiled mystery, which takes the reader on a journey through seedy sections of Little Tokyo to the wealthy mansions of southern California. Crais' Elvis Cole is a quirky detective who has a fondness for Mickey memorabilia. Cole is both skeptical observer and kind-hearted helper. He partners with Joe Pike, who is in charge of the security part of there business.Uncovering a mystery is always an interesting challenge and Crais provides enough twists and turns to challenge even the most astute mystery reader. In fact, the end leaves the reader to decide the answer for one untied thread.A rainy afternoon, a day for relaxation or any excuse for a quick light read pick up Stalking the Angel and enjoy."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Robert Crais has created an appealing and humorous protagonist for his Los Angeles-set crime novels in private investigator Elvis Cole. Cole is a fascinating combination of post-Viet Nam hardboiled cynicism and golden-hearted idealism, a wisecracking, Corvette-driving master of martial arts who is also a first-rate detective. Crais makes Cole's adventures all the more appealing through his lively and witty writing style; his stories are carried along by his colorful descriptions of places and people, and he punctuates his narrative with clever verbal &quot;zingers&quot; through which Crais demonstrates considerable insight into human beings and their foibles.In this, the second of the Elvis Cole novels, Crais focuses upon a crime scenario involving the *yakuza*, the so-called &quot;Japanese Mafia.&quot; The first part of the book sets out the elements of a potentially intricate mystery involving the stealing of a precious Japanese sacred text; this leads to murder, kidnapping, and a fascinating foray into the Japanese-American underworld by Cole and his gun-toting associate, Joe Pike.The promise that is presented by the first part of the book, however, goes largely unrealized in the second. The &quot;mystery&quot; proves to be fairly easily solved, and the last portion of the story mainly involve a lot of chasing, fighting, and ultimately shooting of stereotyped Asian bad guys by Cole and Pike. Cole actually has a heart of gold (of course), and ends up doing much of his crime-solving work for free, because it is the &quot;right thing to do.&quot; To a point, this is reasonable as part of the author's strategy for creating a hero appropriate to the genre. However, by the end of the book, the highly risky course of action followed by our heroes simply out of the goodness of their hearts seems way too implausible, and their methods for righting wrongs way too violent. The story actually impressed me as akin to something one might see in a private eye television series, i.e., light on intricacy of plot, heavy on &quot;fightin' and shootin',&quot; and with a highly simplistic differentiation between the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; characters.Crais is an indisputably skillful writer who can turn a phrase as well as any of the best crime story writers around today. However, *Stalking The Angel* is lightweight fare when compared to the deeper, more substantial work of say, Michael Connelly. Having now read Crais' first two Cole novels, I am curious to read one or more of his more recent works. I want to see whether as Crais has developed his mystery writing acumen he has shown himself capable of developing books in which the appeal to readers is based not just upon private eye wisecracks, alluring locales, and a socko series of action-packed sequences, but also upon a more highly-crafted plot structure."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"After enjoying Demolition Angel, I made the commitment to go back and read all the Elvis Cole books in order. I love to read a series in the correct order to watch the growth of the author (who by Demolition Angel, a stand alone, was a great writer) and his characters. The leap from the Monkey's Raincoat to STalking the Angel was pretty big. Characters have more depth--esp. Elvis. Instead of sleeping around, drinking, and wisecracking, we get a glimpse (and just a glimpse) into Elvis' soul. The book is fast paced and funny, but also sad. Crais has created a terrific series and I plan to read all of them even if takes me years."},{"Title":"Stalking the Angel","review":"Gifted actor, playwright, and voice artist David Stuart gives authentic reading to the further adventures of Elvis Cole, the shrewd L.

With so many clever defense lawyers out there, and so many cases thrown out because the information was somehow tainted because a detective or policeman didn't follow the proper protocol, would a police detective so freely divulge the facts of a case to a PI just because they know him and like him? Also, how is it that Elvis and Pike can break into a house and rummage through people's things without leaving fingerprints?

Another approach is to design the PCB so that it has low EMI and does not require very much shielding from the enclosure. Mark Montroses' book provides lots of detailed information on just how to design PCBs with low EMI. Unlike many books that give general coverage of EMI and EMC problems, this book focuses exclusively on PCB layout and design techniques for EMC.Chapter 5 (Bypassing and Decoupling) is especially interesting. It used to be enough to simply place one 0.1uF capacitor next to each IC on a PCB. But with todays high speed circuits, this doesn't always work anymore. In fact, simply putting .1uF caps next to each chip can actually cause the system to fail if the resonant frequency of the bypass network happens to match the system clock frequency (or a harmonic of it).Instead, you must consider the resonant frequency of the bypass capacitors and build a network of different valued capacitors for an effective bypass network. Marks book does a good job of explaining why this is true and what to do about it.Chapter 4 (Image Planes) is also interesting. Understanding what image planes are and how they work is one of the keys to designing a PCB for low EMI.This is a good reference book that should be in every high speed PCB designers library."},{"Title":"EMC and the Printed Circuit Board: Design, Theory, and Layout Made Simple: 1st (First) Edition","review":"If you are a circuit designer building a commercial product, then it is necessary to minimise the RF emissions. But many texts on circuitry gloss over the details of how to do this. Perhaps considered too uninteresting.Montrose offers a detailed contrast. But readily accessible to anyone with an electrical engineering degree. Hence you can read tips on how to reduce the loop area on a PCB. Indeed, he suggests that you can use surface mount components, since they usually possess smaller loop area.There are also recent innovations. Like grounding a heatsink for a microprocessor. The latest CPUs often dissipate enormous amounts of heat. But hitherto, little attention was often paid to actually grounding the requisite heatsink.The book also devotes an entire chapter to the crucial idea of an image plane. It points out possible problems with an implementation, and how to solve these."},{"Title":"EMC and the Printed Circuit Board: Design, Theory, and Layout Made Simple: 1st (First) Edition","review":"This book is well oganized and easy to use, but the information is often incorrect.

Sound different? It is.Lionel Essrog is just the very best protagonist ever. It's fun to watch him - fun not knowing what he'll say. And it's fun to read a story which can hold him without turning into a literary freak show.In fact, that's one of Lionel's many nicknames: freakshow. Yet the novel is not about mockery; it's about strength and loyalty and self discovery, just like so many really great novels.So many contemporary novels are about beating up the protagonist and showing us just how ugly our world is. And that's fine. I love some of those novels. But sometimes - sometimes someone like Lethem writes a book that's about people who have beating hearts and ambitions which we can laugh at and cherish at the same time. And when that happens, you see that the real skill is showing us just how complex and beautiful our silly little worlds are."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It's been a week since I read this book, and I still flinch every time I pass a big sign reading BAILEY on my way to work. Luckily, the rest of my symptoms seem to be fading and I think I can get back to something like a normal life. This is not an option for Lionel Essrog, the shattered hero of this book: he has Tourette's Syndrome, and he is forced to count, rap, bark, and curse his way through a deadly minefield of aging mobsters, Zen Buddhism, and indifference. Lionel's one of the four orphans that wiseguy Frank Minna recruited out of all motherless Brooklyn to be his helpers; now Lionel is compelled to unravel the messy case that ended with Frank stabbed in a dumpster. Hampered by his tendency to introduce himself as 'Vinyl Bullfrog,' poor Lionel searches for clues, completely confusing a homicide detective into adding Tourette to his suspect list and woos a pretty girl while discovering the incompatibility of Zen meditation and violent verbal expostulations. As he dodges a gigantic kumquat-munching hit man and wonders what his fellow orphans know that he doesn't, Lionel doggedly defends the center of his chaotic life: Frank and the other orphan 'Minna Men,' who accept his tics and serve as his family. And he rises to the challenge like a true hero, descending into the underworld for information and slaying his dragons, public and private, avenging his father-figure, and winning a space for his 'family' to endure. Lethem's got hold of a live wire here; this is a story that twitches off the pages and demands your attention. If you pay attention you can also learn about Tourette's Cat and the connection between Tourette's, The Artist Chronically Known as Prince, and Don Martin cartoons. There's a mystery here, rolled up in a crime novel and cross-indexed with a medical case history, and narrated by one of the most engaging nuts in recent fiction. The Fickle Muse was sitting in Lethem's lap when he wrote this one."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In \\"Motherless Brooklyn,\\" Jonathan Lethem melds several genres, among them the bildungsroman, psychological novel, literary parody--all in the occasionally transparent framework of a detective story. The most famous aspect of the book is its hero's Tourette syndrome (the influence of Oliver Sacks's work is quite apparent), but the neurological condition itself takes on a life of its own, simultaneously moving and comic--and an opportunity for Lethem to indulge in some freakishly inventive wordplay that owes as much to James Joyce as to Mad magazine and the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.The opening scene is on a par with the best of pulp fiction. Eating White Castle sliders daintily arrayed in a row of six (a compulsive aspect of his neurosis), Lionel Essrog stakes out an Upper East Side Zen studio with his associate Gilbert Coney, with the two of them standing guard as their boss Frank Minna is inside, wired for sound and exchanging cryptic arguments with some unknown heavy. It's at this point that everything goes wrong, and the ensuing chase scene through Queens and murder in Brooklyn provide one of the novel's highlights.Lionel and Gilbert are just two of the four orphans hired (adopted, really) by Minna for a detective agency masquerading as a car service. (One of the recurrent gags is the group's supply of creative explanations to prospective customers for the lack of cars.) As a Minna Man, Lionel finds a father figure and a family where his Tourette's is not ignored but nevertheless accepted; Tony's pet name for him, \\"the free human freak show,\\" serves more as a term of endearment than as a slur and indicates Minna's moderately disguised understanding that Lionel is the savviest of the bunch (Minna's estranged wife tells Lionel the reason Minna finds him useful is because everyone thought he was \\"stupid\\").It's the interplay of the characters and Lionel's bumbling entry into adulthood that provide most of the novel's interest. As for the noir-inspired plot: there's hardly a cliche that Lethem doesn't send up--Italian mobsters and an evil corporation, the intrusively clueless police officer and a traitorous colleague, a sequence of red-herring clues and an offstage murder. (\\"Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of having a character murdered before he can step onto the page and burden you with his actual existence? Detective stories have too many characters anyway.\\")Yet the crime story itself never lives up the dizzying pursuit of the opening scene, and Lethem faces the difficulty of writing a parody of authors who themselves wrote masterful parodies (e.g., \\"The Thin Man,\\" \\"The High Window\\"). Instead, the potboiler elements play shotgun both to Lethem's neurological-intellectual wordplay and to the emotional growth of his lead character. Lethem's novel has \\"too many characters anyway,\\" and he resists the temptation to let the mystery gum up the works.That's not necessarily a bad thing--unless you're expecting an old-fashioned whodunit or keystone caper. But Lethem's novel is less a whodunit than a howdunit--or, in this case, how the author does it: creating an affecting protagonist whose tongue twitches with the pulse of the cultural zeitgeist."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"We're all familiar with the conventions of the hard-boiled detective genre: men of few words, fisticuffs in back alleys, rougue cops, mysterious women with long legs and dark secrets, and so forth. In this brilliant novel, Lethem has turned all of these conventions on their ear. Instead of a man of few words, our protagonist (Lionel Essrog) is a man of too many words... he has Tourette's Syndrome.The ordinary detective slowly uncovers clues through a mixture of intimidation and verbal trickery. Lionel, on the other hand, is ridiculed or roughed up by nearly everyone he meets. And still he brilliantly tracks down leads and uses his apparent weaknesses to his advantage. All other conventions are also reversed. Dark secrets turn out to be less dark than we imagined. Instead of being coy and mysterious, the women practice Zen and say what they mean.Lethem has done an excellent job of replicating the tension, pace, and intrique of the very best detective novels, but he has done so in a way that no one else has before. And the brilliant writing and masterful descriptions of New York City make it easy to see why this novel has garnered so much praise from people and publications that ordinarily don't care much for genre writing.Fans of the genre, read this book to get a taste of something wonderfully different. Fans of literature, read this book to experience the very best of the detective genre. Also, if you liked this book, try Martin Amis's NightTrain."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I loved reading every word of Jonathan Letham's Motherless Brooklyn. First, I must confess that I'm biased because a good portion of the story takes place in my neighborhood, however, with that said, Brooklyn is merely the backdrop for this mystery that unfolds, twists and turns with every page.The story is seen through the eyes of Lionel Essrog, an orphan with tourettes, who works for a low level Brooklyn Mobster. Lionel, gets caught up in the murder of his boss and takes it upon himself to solve the crime...which is the work of some old time Brooklyn mobsters.Throughout the novel, Letham is brilliant at creating a world where the reader understands Lionel's tourettes and is able to quickly understand his actions yet sympathize as a victim. Letham also does a teriffic job of developing all of the supportint characters as well. All of which, are uniquely pathetic.This novel, is one of the liveliest reads I've had in some time and is strongly recommended if you're looking for a great whodunnit, that is also a great study in character."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"From the prose, you know right away Lethem is no mere genre writer. In this book, he subverts the hard-boiled genre while tipping his hat to it - what results is a delightful modern book that is as intensely gripping as it is witty. In taking on the hard-boiled genre, Lethem takes on the burden of (*gasp*) actually working out a plot. It's refreshing to see a literary writer who is unscrupulous about shaping a plot.And the story is a good one. Lionel Essrog, a 'disciple' of Frank Minna who leads him and three others in a hapless detective agency, has to solve the murder of his mentor which he only witnessed through a wire tap. The story structure follows the hard-boiled structure of Chandler. But the characters and situations themselves are ingenious and hilariously modern.Lionel Essrog, in my mind, is one of the most memorable characters in contemporary fiction. The Tourette's Syndrome he has is not just a gimmick, but a vent for Lethem to deploy narrative pyrotechnics. The subconscious rants and tangents of thought are made transparent in this book. It's a brilliant move on the part of Lethem.One of the more lasting strengths of \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is its sweetness and earnestness. Lionel is as honest and emotional character as any we have had in recent fiction. As he remembers and yearns for (and to be like) his mentor Frank Minna, his release of emotion is straightforward and even, sentimental. It parallels Lethem's nostalgia for the old hard-boiled characters in Chandler's books and the style of writing itself (he directly quotes him a couple of times.) It's a beautiful tribute to a bygone era, a different time."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I am truly amazed with Jonathan Lethem's growth and exceptional range as a writer; his broad literary canvas covers genetically engineered futures, colonizing other worlds, and Brooklyn, as seen through the eyes of a Tourette's Syndrome sufferer. Along with Rick Moody, Lethem has to be regarded as my generation's finest, most lyrical, writer of fiction.Here in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, Lethem shows his love, and mastery of the English language. In his protagonist Lionel Essrog, we have a flawed, yet sympathetic figure whose Tourette's Syndrome affliction ultimately becomes one of Essrog's most endearing virtues. Lethem has written a stylishly hip murder mystery as compelling as his literary debut &quot;Gun, With Occasional Music&quot;, yet one which digs deeper and goes further into examing the human condition. Seen through Lionel Essrog's eyes, Brooklyn becomes a vividly fresh landscape as he joins his fellow Minna Men in solving a crime; a place where time-worn crime novel motifs are turned upside down for the sake of strong, lyrical prose. Truly this is one magnificient novel that transcends its crime novel origins."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog cracked me up. My husband woke up in the middle of the night saying, &quot;Earthquake!&quot; but it was just me laughing silently and shaking the bed.Lionel has Tourrette's Syndrome and his tics lead him to burst out the funniest lines in the book. One of his standbys is &quot;Eatmebailey&quot;. We never find out who Bailey is. That would have been a much better plot line than the detective story Lethem came up with.I agree with some other reviewers that this should not have been a detective novel. As soon as the flashback to his childhood is over and Lionel starts looking for the killer, whatever literary genius Lethem had rolling came to a screeching halt. It was stock, with a twist; but not enough of a twist to warrant the overblown heraldings of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; as the newest installment in American literature.If Lethem had just left out the detective story and found a better plot for Lionel to come into his own, then it would warrant all of the high praise it has received. Maybe next time, but I will definitely keep my eye on Jonathan Lethem.Read this book for the sheer of enjoyment of listening to Lionel, and try not to let the plot get in your way."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a great book. It sounds gimmicky but it's a great read and a very interesting, thought-provoking story. The setting is dead-on and captures not just Brooklyn but neighborhoods in Brooklyn perfectly. I was continually surprised by the twisting plot and the characters' growth. It's nice to read an author who doesn't feel he's stooping to the mystery genre but sees it as an opportunity to explore his creativity in a new direction. A sequel would appear to be unlikely but I'd really love to read it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is just a terrific book. Lethem's evocation of the unforgettable, Tourette's-suffering narrator, Lionel Essrog, is just amazing. Lethem takes you right into the mind of a Tourette's sufferer with emotionally compelling and often hilarious results. The story of Lionel and his fellow &quot;Minna Men&quot; and what happens after the murder of their mentor and psuedo-father, Frank Minna, is entertaining in its own right. Though I wouldn't change a thing, I was sorry this book was only 300 pages, because I would've liked to spend a lot more time with it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I normally don't read detective novels, but this wasn't a typical who-done-it. The murder mystery was a mere backdrop for a compelling portrait of a man living with Tourette's Syndrome. I personally live with two people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it was helpful to be reminded how ever-present these types of conditions are, and how hard one must work just to stand still. I enjoyed a positive portrayal of a man who found a place in the world where he can function and even thrive, despite the epithet of \\"freakshow.\\" The only part that seemed unrealistic is the lack of embarrassment Lionel Essrog seemed to experience. Even the most stoic of individuals with Tourette's go through moments of exteme embarrassment and feelings of shame, and frustration at their lack of control over their ticcing behaviors."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a detective/small-time mobster who has turrette's. The dialogue is fresh and fast-paced, as is the action. The only flaw with the book - it ends."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem has to be the most frustrating writer around. His novels seem to be either brilliant (Motherless Brooklyn, Gun with Occasional Music) or truly awful (Girl in Landscape, Amnesia Moon).Blessed with any extraordinary imagination and a deft and persuasive writing voice, his better novels have the potential to be true iconoclastic masterpieces. All have fallen frustratingly short of that mark however, though Motherless Brooklyn comes close to that status.The flaws are generally the same-too many major story elements that don't always mesh well, secondary characters that are a bit too much off the wall, too much dedication to the concept of the story as opposed to dedication to the story itself.Nevertheless, when he's close to on his mark-as he is here-it can be compelling reading.Motherless Brooklyn takes the concept of the \\"misfit\\" detective to an extreme.Lionel Essrog is a detective in name only. The \\"agency\\" he works for is in actuality a \\"gofer\\" shop owned by a man with loose mob connections that essentially runs errands for mobsters who want to keep things at arms length. And Lionel's status within the shop is marginal indeed-he's the gofer for the gofers, largely because his Tourette's syndrome undermines his \\"usefulness\\" as others see it. However, when his boss is killed Lionel becomes a detective in fact and seeks to track down the killer.The story revolves around the workings on the fringe of the mob, religious cults and internecine family warfare, major story elements that at times are a bit out of joint with one another. However, the characters are well developed, and while this is not a true \\"detective\\" or \\"suspense\\" novel in the traditional sense, the thread of the story is compelling and the suspense sufficient to the task, for the true object here is to see how a man with Tourette's syndrome, congenitally conditioned by both his disease and those around him to see himself as marginalized, overcomes all that to blossom into true, mature, fully engaged adulthood. It is a fascinating and well-crafted exposition.I can only hope that one day Lethem can put it all together and reach his ultimate potential-I have no doubt such an effort could only be described as a masterpiece. I hope I get to read it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In my opinion, good mysteries offer vivid prose, memorable characters, and intriguing plots, which together hold the reader to the last pages. By these standards, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is an outstanding mystery, since it features exceptional writing by Jonathon Lethem, a weird but memorable Tourettic detective who solves the crime, and an interesting plot that carries the reader to the end of the book.Among these genre elements, Lethem's writing is my favorite. Here's his paean to \\"Mad\\" magazine's Don Martin: \\"I used to pore over his drawings, trying to find what it was about his characters, drawn with riotously bulging eyes, noses, chins, Adam's apples and knees, elongated tongues and fingers and feet that flapped like banners ...that stirred such a deep chord in me. His image of life was garish and explosive, heads being stretched and shrunk, surgeons lopping off noses and dropping brains and sewing hands on backward, falling safes and metal presses squashing men flat or into boxlike packages, children swallowing coat hangers and pogo sticks and taking their shapes. His agonized characters moved through their panels with geeky physicality...\\" First rate work!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Esrog, a young man with Tourette's syndrome, is one of a group of youngsters hand-picked by Frank Minna from St. Vincent's Home for Boys to eventually become part of his \\"Minna Men\\".

On one of their jobs, Esrog and a partner suddenly realize realize that their boss has been taken captive and is being sped away by car through the streets of New York city. They must rush after him and not allow him to be lost from view. The race is on!Lethem gives his readers a wonderfully creative and somewhat unusual novel. Throughout the story, Lionel displays the aberrant behavior of a person afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome. Since Lionel is the protagonist, the reader not only experiences Lionel's verbal outbursts and physical tics, but is also given some insight into their manifestation . The story is a mystery, and at times almost becomes a satire of life in New York city. It is fast-paced and funny, with creative word-play, occasional amusing situation descriptions, and even a few (good) jokes. The writing is done so well that, once this story has begun, the book is often hard to put down. As the novel draws to a close, the plot tends to become a bit more complicated and confusing. Nevertheless, it's an exciting, entertaining story and one that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem writes a fascinating character study of a man, Essrog, with Tourette's syndrome. Growing up in a gritty yet somehow surrealistic Brooklyn, he struggles to survive in an orphanage. With the onset of adolescence Essrog's tics become more pronounced and run the full gamut of potential symptoms, all of which are resistant to medication. These oddities of brain chemistry which cause uncontrollable movements, sounds and compulsive behavior interfere with his relationships but cause him to take a different perspective on life. His one solace is the library where he spends years reading in isolation.Despite the disabling effects of the tics, Essrog manages to get work as a small-time hood and escape the orphanage. He works for Frank Minna, the first person to understand Essrog's symptoms and name them. Essrog becomes a \\"Minna Man\\" along with several other boys from the orphanage. They live with strict rules of behavior and a structured life-style and worship their charismatic boss. When their boss is killed Essrog is compelled to investigate the murder.Motherless Brooklyn is more than anything a fascinating look into a difficult world of a man haunted by his tics. The details of his life and thinking are relentlessly yet charmingly portrayed. While reading this I was so much inside Essrog's psyche that I felt like I had Tourette's too. Lethem has a talented and idiosyncratic way with language, a facility with words that is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I am a physician who treats a great number of children/adolescents with Tourette's syndrome.

However, it is also a heartening fictional account of a story of overcoming those difficulties, and the protagonist is portrayed as a smart, insightful and hard-working individual who achieves success. The detective story is almost secondary to the primary neuropsychological plot line, but it is a wonderful twist on an old stand-by. The story works, and I recommend it for people living with Tourette's, as well as for those who might encounter others with the illness (all of us!). Although treatments for this disorder exist, the protagonist refuses to take them, as he has experienced (like so many of our patients) undue side-effects that don't seem to be worth the results. New medications and treatment modalities need to be developed, and perhaps this story and others will help raise awareness of the need for safer, more effective interventions."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"While I'll concede that there is an original premise to this novel (specifically the condition of the narrator) overall it didn't seem all that remarkable. The writing was serviceable, nothing spectacular, and the story moved along and kept me interested--but that's about it. I didn't care much about the characters, and I read the entire book just wondering what the big deal was about. Maybe if it hadn't been so talked up I would have had lower expectations and appreciated this fairly entertaining novel for what it is."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"\\"Motherless Brooklyn\\", by author Jonathan Lethem, is a detective story with a twist ... the protagonist, Lionel Essrog, has Tourette's syndrome, a disorder with barely controllable physical tics and inadvertant vocal components, where the sufferer touches repeatedly things or imitates others, and may blurt out anything ... obscenities, secrets, or nonsense. Essrog is an orphan, who along with three other orphans, now work for Frank Minna, a small-time crook who employs them in a variety of legal and semi-legal endeavors. After Minna is murdered, Essrog searches to find Minna's killer. As I don't give plot spoilers (the above info is pretty much from the advertising blurbs and first chapter of the book), below are my impressions of the novel.Essrog is the narrator of the story, and it's told from his perspective, in first person. For the first chapter or so, I was annoyed and discomfited by the structure and pacing of the narrative ... it was too \\"jerky\\" and disjointed, primarily because of the symptoms of Essrog's Tourette syndrome, but once I grew used to the pacing and flow, it largely ceased to bother me. Although afflicted by Tourette's syndrome, and appearing to others as somewhat less than sane or normal, there is nothing wrong with Essrog's powers of intellect, so you get a sense of someone peering keenly out from behind a damaged exterior.While nominally a detective story (and a very good one at that), this is also somewhat of a character study, where the flawed Essrog lives among others who are damaged in other ways, and his struggles to find Minna's killer moves him beyond both his own comfort zone and involves him in complex situations where little is as it first appears. As it is difficult to fully develop many of the individuals within the context of a single novel, many are slight caricatures and stereotypes rather than thoroughly developed. But Essrog himself is tremendously appealing, and his disorder only adds to his humanity, and you find yourself rooting for him as the story progresses.Overall, this is a very good novel, and once you get past its eccentricities, it will suck you in. This book would serve as a good basis for a series of sequels featuring Essrog and his friends, but given that \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" was published in 1999 and there have been no reported efforts by the author toward a sequel, it isn't likely to ever happen. Four stars."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"For this reader, the novel's strong points were the language related to the main character's growth, and the humor caused by his speech problem. Lionel started as a bit naive and in the dark about everything -- Frank, Frank's girlfriend, the gangsters -- but by the end had uncovered the secrets, acted heroically and seemed more in control. The combination of naivety, a sharp mind and uncontrolled language was good, and much in his character was believable and sympathetic. His speech due to Tourette's was creatively shown and some of the monologues and dialogue with others -- like the black cop -- provided many of the novel's high points.On the other hand, for this reader, if you took away the Tourette's element the book was much less interesting. The detective story wasn't for me a terrific page turner and compared unfavorably with, say, the best work of Raymond Chandler. Most of the other characters weren't developed very far, the women, the giant and the Japanese characters were clich&eacute;s. The book's humor diminished in its second half. The shift in narration toward the end -- to tie up the loose ends -- was jarring.Lionel appeared to be seeking the killer of a father figure through much of the novel, yet the book's title was motherless. Motherless Brooklyn does sound better, though."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I have read some of Lethem's other works and found them to be unsatisfying, but Motherless Brooklyn is a one-of-a-kind novel, with a main character that turned out to be even more sympathetic that I expected. The whodunit detective story that is the background of this work is only OK, but Lethem's writing and his protagonist Lionel Essrog leave a major impression. Touching without being sentimental, this is the story of a physically flawed yet three-dimensional human being, and I only wish that the author would write a sequel so I could be assured that Lionel gets the happy ending he deserves. An unusual literary treat that had a remarkable effect on this reader!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A great character can carry nearly any book and this is not just any book. Lionel Essrog, the main character/detective who has Tourette's Syndrome, is a fantastic character out of dream. What can you say about a book that puts a character like this -- one who is apt utter a string of vile curses mixed with tough guy Brooklynese -- inside a Zendo!!! Brilliant and that's what this book is. Loved it. My only quibble would be that it loses some steam as it goes along but, since it started out so powerfully, that is a small quibble indeed."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Every day I drive past a big sign that says BAILEYS LIQUOR. I'm beginning to overcome the compulsion to scream &quot;Lick her, Bailey,&quot; as I pass, but only after a lot of psychotherapy. What have you done to my head, Lethem? I never paid any attention to the voices before I read this book; now I am uncomfortably aware that lots of things go on in our heads that we aren't paying attention to. Luckily, I don't have Tourette's like poor Lionel, or an unsolved murder to obsess about, but this book has given me plenty of, well, stuff to obsess about. The kind that keeps you awake at night and makes you wonder where the line between normal and nuts is these days. Who's the most normal person in this whole book? Freakshow himself, and the fact that we accept the wiseguys and buddhaheads as normal is disturbing. Whoops, gotta go; time for the nurse to bring my medication."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem is a master of dialogue. Every character has a unique speech pattern. Essrog's ticcing deservedly gets most of the critical attention, but don't overlook the distinguishable speech quirks of the other characters (ie. Rockaforte and Matricardi). I'm not a big fan of either mobster plots or sci-fi, yet I couldn't put down Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn or his Girl in Landscape (sci-fi, sort of.)Aspiring writers (prose or especially plays) should definitely read this to see how a master handles dialogue.Thank you Mr. Lethem!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Well I've never reviewed a book before but I just had to say how much I enjoyed readin this book. Without giving the plot away all I can say is do yourself a favor and read this book, I mean this actually ranks right up there with Salinger's 'Catcher in the rye' or Brauner's 'Love songs of the tone deaf' for lyrical, poignant, and honest writing. This is a heck of a good book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Wow...what a stunning piece of work. Lethem has surpassed himself once again, giving us his most compelling lead character yet in the Tourettes-afflicted yet brave and decent Lionel Essrog.And it looks like Lethem's star will finally explode in the way it was always destined to: Ed Norton has optioned the book and will be playing Lionel in the film version. One of today's most interesting authors coupled with one of our most dynamic young actors - sounds like a match made in heaven to me."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Though not as philosophical and brooding as &quot;Amnesia Moon&quot;, nor as rapid and cranky as &quot;Gun With Occasional Music&quot;, &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; manages to come out on top or very close to the top of Lethem's impressive heap. In portraying a would-be detective with Tourettes syndrome, Lethem has created a whole new rhythm and syncopation to his prose, a truly brilliant way to write a novel that comes from the viewpoint of man who cannot be still. The characters are unavoidably beautiful mirrors, fascinating character studies in a wonderful world of nostalgia and crime. But for one 7-page lull that dropped the otherwise breakneck pace of the prose, it was truly a book that I COULD NOT put down; rarely do I read books in one sitting. What can I say that has not been said before? Lethem is THE American original."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Forget about the plot. The characters are what matters here. William Gibson can build a world you can wander around, but Lethem brings you people whose heads you get into to see through their eyes and feel with their emotions. Wow"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I used to live in Brooklyn, right in Carroll Gardens, where most of this book is set. I had heard such great things, and it had gotten such great reviews, but in the end it really disappointed. The main character has Tourette's as we are CONSTANTLY reminded. It seems that the author was using the Tourettes as a crutch in developing the story or even to pad the book with endless lines of drivel. Didn't add a heck of a lot to the story. Actually, nothing added a heck of a lot to the story. The story wanders, rather aimlessly, through three or four days of misadventure for some small time thugs. There were glimmers of an interesting love story, but it is abandoned. Too much, really, is wrapped up too quickly and unimpressively at the end. You're waiting for the big kick, but it never comes.I read quickly. A book this size is usually a weekend's work. Here it was three weeks. And it was work. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Burned by some much-hyped misfires by young lions, I waited until \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" came out in paperback to pick it up, and even then it sat around for a while as I prepared myself for another disappointment. Was I wrong! Jonathan Lethem does a great job creating a fascinating character in Lionel Essrog, and he has a real talent for plot and pacing as well. But the best part of the book are Lionel's riffs on language, prompted by Tourette's syndrome and often erupting from him at the worst times. It never feels exploitative (unlike parts of \\"Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time\\") and Lionel's character remains complex and his actions unpredictable in a good way. Great book by an inspired writer whose work I'll start seeking out in earnest."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog's self driven attempt at detective work is only secondary to the real interest MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN holds. Lethem's writing is so smooth! The story itself is enjoyable and a bit different, but I found myself enthralled most of all with the manner in which words are woven to create the tale."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a wonderful book. The readers who found the storyline wanting are missing the point. This is what the lit. teachers call a &quot;character study&quot;, a novel in which the most important element is the author's ability to create a believable, enduring character. After a long drought, I've found two fantastic character studies this year -- Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf being the other -- and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both of them. Both novelists show that an understanding of the human heart is the most important thing readers look for in a novel.

I recommend it highly.Boyd Lemon-Amazon Author"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"How about a thriller set in Brooklyn featuring a protagonist with Tourette syndrome, a couple of gangster brothers, some Zen intrigue and a subplot involving the Japanese sea urchin egg industry? If this sounds intriguing, you will enjoy this highly contrived, yet entertaining tale featuring cartoon-like characters. The plot involves two brothers in over their heads in crime in Brooklyn. One brother goes to a home for boys (\\"motherless\\" boys) and selects a few to help out with his crime capers. One of the boys, Loinel Essrog, suffers from Tourette Syndrome. He narrates the story starting with a murder and ending with him solving it. I won't say more than that.It is interesting to get some insight into Tourettes (assuming this novel is accurate in its portrayal). I appreciate that the author tried something different. If you want something a little different from the average detective story, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"....hated the book. I guess it's a genre thing. I don't care for detective stories, but decided to give it a try after I read a few of positive customer reviews. The author did raise the stakes by the &quot;added touch&quot; of having the protagonist have Tourette's Syndrome. I found this very interesting and was drawn to these scenes but the detective stuff bored me mostly and really couldn't wait for it to end."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book had more about Tourette's syndrome than the mystery. In one of the last chapters, the story was summarized. I wish I had skipped the rest and just read the summary. If you want to know about Tourette's, then you might like this book, otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you have not read any of Jonathan Lethem's other books, this one might turn you off to his Science Fiction abilities. Amnesia Moon is what essentially dragged me into his other books, including this one. This book has less of a twisted plotline than some of his others (for instance, Girl in Landscape); however, the Tourettes is a beautiful touch and I applaud him for it. I gave Motherless Brooklyn three stars for two reasons: One: I much prefer the Sci-Fi touch of his other books, and Two: I have not finished this yet and thus far feel the need for only three stars.It's a good book if your not expecting him to be in outer space or anything, and it's wonderful if you're into psychology. I wouldn't recommend it if you haven't loved his other books, for the talent would go unnoticed in this one."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Highly recommended.

The verbal tics - perturbingshticks! - served as no more than distractions, certainly had no point in the plot. Speaking of plot, there wasn't a single development that I didn't foresee (well OK, the Julia part), and the pieces that might actually have been interesting (like whether the Polish guy existed and what Bailey represented) were never resolved. Took Lethem about 70 pages to get going, and petered out about 50 pages before the end, when he simply uncovered all the \\"mystery\\" in one long narrative chapter. How dull. What serious writer ends a book with \\"Make like a tree and leave. Tell your story walking.\\"? Lethem is supposedly an accomplished writer. If so, he can do better than this - Betterwish!

The book, our matter of discussion here, rules, it's very good, but it's not a mistery, I warn you, even if it has most of the elements, mostly the dialogue and language. It's not &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; not &quot;King Suckerman&quot; although it's as enjoyable as any of them."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I am not sure why this book has received so much hype. The plot was confusing and convoluted. It was difficult to understand what compelled the characters to take the actions that they did. The main character's struggle to keep his Touretts under control was entertaining, but was difficult to relate to. All in all, this book resembles more a work of detective fiction than it does a great literary work."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Watching a man having her words slit by his mirror image is an odd way to create a story world. Not least because of the characters intellectual borders are clearly a redundant side issue. Letham's story world is bigger than his players 'standart day breaks-in, their perspective into the easy imagination and academic language that guiding the readers behind the main characters mind; easily Essrog's back ground much more loaded by the \\"f\\" words- in \\"Clockwork Orange\\" Burgess was avoided easy cultural referances and creates much-needed language of it's own world. \\"Naked Lunch\\" has a griping -word based ideas- which filled the spaces between words and worlds. \\"American Psycho\\" simply referances Betaman's point of view with dark light of brand-obsessed/ state of mind. But in \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" Tourette as a pixie who draw the concept within; sadly missed-direct the ideas above the style itself. It is structurally weak and too self-consciously multitalker/thinker. It's style over content novel. And it hasn't got Brautigan or Vian kind of style value in it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The hero and portrait of the Tourette's world are captivating. The plot is sub-standard, the secondary characters all one dimensional."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I read this critically acclaimed novel for a book club, and I was less than impressed. I don't plan to read other Lethem novels after reading this. I seem to be in the minority among Amazon.com reviewers, however.The whole book takes place in a remarkably short time--two days, with flashbacks interspersed. The narrator runs into a lot of dead ends and puzzling clues in his search for his mentor's killer. I found this frustrating, but then I had to stop to remember that this makes the book more true to life than some of the snazzier mass market detective stories. Real life crime solving is tedious and full of dead ends.The real genius in Lionel's detective work lies in his Tourette's syndrome. People don't see him as a threat and are therefore less guarded with their words.I found the book tough to read, but then again, it is probably tough to live with Tourette's, too. Read this for something true-to-life and gritty, and unlike anything else on the bookshelf today. I admire the book for stepping out of the norm, but it is not the kind of journey I usually take with my reading."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Didn't care for book (story) after I received it. Was used for a book club read. We are picky readers."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This story gives a great insight into people who suffer from turrets syndrome. I wasn't thrilled with the story line but thought the main character troubled in trying so hard not to tic. I liked the book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Courtesy 1980s LA Law, that glossy, technicolor descendent of Miami Vice and Dynasty, full of soap opera and courtroom intrigue, a response, perhaps, to the gritty reality of another show, another 80s icon, Hill Street Blues.I don't remember the character, although I think he may have been a lawyer. I just remember him screaming, loudly, randomly, and bewilderingly.I was just a teenager, an adolescent who hadn't yet seen enough of life to understand the infinite diversities within it. I was self-centered and assured as an insecure teenager could possibly be. So I saw that lawyer character on LA Law, that character with Tourette's syndrome, and decided he was one of the most annoying TV characters I'd ever come across.I despised him. It may have been because I'm a naturally tense, jumpy individual. The percussive expletives, the random, disturbing tics those afflicted with the syndrome often exhibit, just a little too grating on my naturally raw nerves. Freaks. That's what I thought. Maybe still do.Jonathan Lethem's narrator does, too. Even though he also happens to be one of them.So here I am, a fan of Lethem, having read and loved with all my heart his \\"The Fortress of Solitude\\", that when I saw this earlier novel, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\", well I had to pick it up.Only to find the first person narrator madly afflicted with Tourette's. But this was Lethem, and \\"Fortress\\" was my favorite book of 2010.Through and through a noirish detective novel (I've read far darker), with a narrator who you certainly *can't* just say only *happens* to be afflicted with Tourette's (since it's the central conflict of many conflicts within the novel, wheels within wheels, you might say), I fully expected to be a profoundly put off reader. I never expected to finish the book, let alone like it.But darn it, not only did I come to care for the narrator profoundly, but I managed to make peace with his distractions: expletives (almost never word-wise obscene) and gestures and shoulder tapping and collar straightening and finger tapping and neck craning and obsessive counting (and I could go on and on). Yep, I got used to them. Read past them, really, set out as they were in italics. And I think that's how Lethem wanted me to react.By the end of the novel, Lionel was another guy with Tourette's, a reluctant hero type, trying to solve mysteries within mysteries.All in all, Lethem crafts a crackling good story filled with interesting, engaging characters. I never grew bored. The story has its share of twists. And it's so obvious, after a couple books now, just how justifiably in love Lethem is with NYC. It shows through his writing. His writing makes its mark.How he could make a truly sympathetic character, when symptoms of Tourette's interrupt the narrative on just about every single page is, simply, quite a trick. Lethem has so much talent.\\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The book starts well -- the author obviously loves his Brooklyn and its characters -- but the plot is overconvoluted, and if you want a pulp thriller, go to the masters (Chandler, or, for a euro-trashy version, Voris Vian'sI Spit on Your GravesSort of like many recent movies -- great production values, weak plot."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"From the simplest perspective, this novel delivers a feeling akin to riding a roller-coaster from the '50s. What I mean by that analogy, is that although this is a roller-coaster ride of a tale, which has a likeable central character, well-drawn supporting characters, a reasonable plot-line, it suffers (like an ageing roller-coaster) from a lack of pace and umff, which means it loses momentum in parts and ultimately ends up coasting to the finish.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading for either style and or content, although it has to be said that the reader for style will enjoy this more that the once searching for content. The story is quite mediocre, the plot a little dull in parts and many of the characters are quite predictable. From a narrative perspective then, it doesn't really offer the reader anything new. Where this book does excel, is in the central character and how he perceived the world and conversely how the world perceives him. In that regard the thin 'murder-plot' is largely irrelevant, it is simply a vehicle through which to present this quite extraordinary rendering of a man afflicted with Tourette's and how that man navigates the world around him.Of course having stated the above, I should now reveal to the more advanced reader, that it is not a detective story at all. There is no crime, the crime is in the mind of the central character (like the illusive 'giant') and Brooklyn is simply a metaphor for his affliction. Towards the end when he ventures out into Maine and experiences the absence of physical walls and the opportunity for new experiences, this again represents a shift from his movement away from dependence on his tics (Brooklyn) to a more tic-free existence.As the author hints at early on in the text. Suffers of any lengthy disorder or disease come to embody themselves in that affliction. If the disease or disorder is cured or treated and they are left tic free, addiction free, illness free, then it is as if their Self, their identity too has been removed and erased. That is really the central thesis of this novel."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Great concept but a bit too gritty/gangsta for me. I felt the interruption of the sentences with his tics and syndrome blurts were a bit much.

I can see how some might lack the flavors necessary to appreciate this book, but for those of us with that special wiring, this book is a classic. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I think this book was a very unique approach to the typical detective novel. A main character that you could get behind, and root for. The only reason this book didnt get 5 stars is due to the fact that the book had a rather typical plot, and relied on the main character to get the reader to remain interested in the book. Still a recommended read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book was very hard for me to keep in my hands and I only finished it because it was recomended by a friend. It may be the fact that I am not from NY and don't understand the neighborhood references or just I am too compasionate for the main character. I thought this was a really a bad book. I would not reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Sorry to disagree with all that hyper-praise, but this is just another run-of-the-mill detective story parroting Raymond Chandler, James Cain, Mickey Spillane and God knows who else. The Tourette business is just a gimmick, adding nothing to the plot. Hard to believe that this is classified as serious literature."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"As one strolls through the prose of this fine novel, they are enraptured in an accessible and engaging story. This novel holds the interest of even A.D.D.-ish readers, but still manages to entertain and impress the snooty literati. Lethem's style is so very different from anyone else's writing these days, and his content is so contemporary and intimate that once started, this novel is hard to put down. Part gumshoe, part comedy, part commentary, Motherless Brooklyn represents the crossover of one of America's great writers from 'scifi' to 'this new thing', and who knows where he will next take his growing following."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It isn't just that critics have seen something Chandleresque in Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn, the book itself quotes from the old master ('About the only part of California you can't put your foot through is the front door - Marlowe, The Big Sleep'). And Lethem's modern-day crime-cracker, in an utterly different and unique style, has all the polish of the noir genre. Lionel, the Tourette-afflicted hero, is a kind of anti-Marlowe at the same time as he is Marlowe: damaged but brilliant, relentless in fooling everybody else through sheer wit. His verbal tics - disturb-a-stick! feral shtick! - lend the narrative a quirky, darkly humorous spin and are indeed good for quite a few guffaws. But Motherless Brooklyn is slow to get into. The plot isn't quite there, danger not as pressing as in Chandler, the characters not quite as grabbing. And in spite of an impressive ending, the story lacks a sufficiently fast pace. This is good, but to be read for its weird elegance more than as a thriller. And, by the way, if you haven't read any Chandler, then please, please do."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Fantastic writing. I read this book on the recommendation of someone who read my novel, Aberrations. Since I'd written about a character with narcolepsy, this person thought I might enjoy reading a novel about a character with Tourette's Syndrome. And I certainly did!

It kept me guessing, it was unique, funny, sad and disturbing all at the same time and the pages turned quickly, plus it had one of the funniest scenes I've ever encountered in a book when, while shopping, the main character who has Tourette's Syndrome comes upon a magazine with Prince on the cover and he tries to pronounce the symbol out loud."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Jonathan Lethem is a gifted writer. His prose is crisp, a little crazy, and often a lot of fun to read. I was intrigued by his idea of a detective with Tourette's syndrom, which makes him compulsive (actually, a fairly useful trait for a detective) and also given to quirky flights of language. The reviews of the book led me to expect something with the page-turning qualities of a good murder mystery combined with an unusual, and more poetic, use of language than you generally find in genre fiction.The book seemed to live up to that description for the first fifty pages or so, but I seriously question whether many reviewers read the entire novel, because by the middle the plot bogs down, it becomes clear that the characters are never going to develop into anything more complicated than you'd find in a B movie, and the language, at first intriguing, becomes just plain eccentric.Lethem has talent, but he wasted it on this novel."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you liked the boring mystery novel that was the Da Vinci Code and if you thought writing a novel from the perspective of an autistic child was clever, then this is the book for you.On the first page Mr. Lethem compares subvocalizing to tickling reality like piano keys (whatever that means), an army, and replacing divots. His similes are too diverse to create any sort of impression on the reader.Read Lolita instead."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A friend gave me this book when I moved to Brooklyn (the area of Bklyn where the book takes place) and as he handed it over said \\"It's not very good, but you will appreciate it.\\"Later that week, I mentioned that I had gotten Motherless Brooklyn to another friend (both of which have great literary taste in my opinion) and she said essentially the same thing. Now that I have read it I can safely say that the plot was weak and the end was even worse. I decided to give him another chance with \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" and som far so good... but this one is a stinker."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a great book. Lionel tells his story, complete with Tourette's interruptions, of how he tracks down the killers of his mentor and father-figure. The Tourette's alone makes the story fascinating, as you watch Lionel struggle with his syndrome during conversations with people who do not understand why he does what he does (tics). The murder and intrigue top it off. Great read, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Wonderful storyteller, great story, unusual plot...but I must admit the end was only so-so compared to the rest which is wonderful. For that reason I can't give it a higher rating. I look forward to Jonathan Lethem's next novel to seee how he develops as a writer."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you're one of these dull-witted readers that wants the same thing over and over again -- Private eyes with slick catch phrases and a trenchcoat, smooth with the ladies and quick with a rod -- then this isn't the book for you. But if you're an intelligent reader who cares about inovavative characters in a good work of fiction, then you want MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN. Lethem's novel turns the hardboiled private eye conventions on their collective head. This is a great read about a strange and charming character who just happens to be a private eye"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I learned more about Tourette's Syndrome than I ever wanted to know. Sure, the character of Lionel Essrog is sympathetic in his struggle to overcome his disability. And the book is well written. But it does come in two parts: The Tourette's Syndrome, and the murder mystery. It can not stand alone on either. The mystery is rather shallow. My impression is that Tourette is a gag to keep the thing going."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It's a very good read - a good entrance into the mind of a character with Tourette's syndrome - very believable in that capacity and thought provoking. Some of the characters were a little too fictional - but very entertaining on the whole."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It's just a really great read. It was very interesting to go through a mystery through the eyes of someone suffering from tourette's. Although, upon finishing the book, I really don't know if Lionel actually &quot;suffered&quot;, it kinda helped him along. Anyway, get it. Read it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"By now you've read the other reviews about this novel and you are well aware of the hook that the narrator Essrog suffers from turrettes syndrome. This works in a slapstick kind of way, but Lethem knows better than to keep it as a joke. The reader is placed pretty fully into Essrog's world, and we understand and feel his history, his development as a person as well as have fun reading his bizarre ramblings. This is probably Lethem's best example of deft character development to date. On top of this, the turettes functions in a way that allows Lethem lots of room for fun and pretty inventive word play. A lot to accomplish in a novel framed as a standard hard-boiled mystery. My only main complain comes in the last chapter, when much of the background manipulations come forward and are explained away almost too quickly."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I read this on a recommendation because of my love for Fight Club. I don't think the comparison is fair and I found myself bored from start to finish. The prose is dense and colorful, which is why I gave it two stars, but it is too cumbersome for a story and a lead character such as this. The plot never twisted, I was never surprised, and I didn't relate to any characters nor learn anything from the whole book. The Tourette's theme, in my opinion, seemed wedged into the story at times, and would only amuse the most simple-humored. Maybe Edward Norton will make something out of this, but I sure couldn't."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a very clever book, the best mystery I've read in years. And despite what you read in the other reviews here, it *is* a mystery.Original detective stories were the first interactive fiction, based on a contest of logic between reader and writer, between watcher and speaker as it were -- playing with the abstract dissonance between the two. Never mind that the characters were cartoons and the writing was plain. That's just background to the real drama. (That is until we stumbled into the corrective mannerisms of the current gloomy crop of deep pschological characterizations in so-called mysteries.)The essence of literature (at least me) is whether and how you can create ambiguities between your own conscious eye and that/those which the author creates. Here, we have a work where that ambiguity is built in to the narrator. Brilliant, much more orignal than Fowles. And it restores the game of woven logics in a new way, more within the page, which of course has the effect of bringing it deeper into the readers mind.This isn't a novel -- it's better, a reinvention of the mystery."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Narrator Lionel Essrog's observations are so sensitively drawn, that I became sincerely attached to him AND to the neighborhoods that he knows as well as his manic mind. \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is the name that Frank Minna, the godfather character, gives to his group of scrawny \\"Minna Men\\" when he first hires them out of an orphanage to work as his moving team/chauffeurs/go-to boys. Lethem's portrayal of the relationship between Minna and Lionel -- replete with classic dialogue, and a postmortem poignance -- is empty of any condescension, as is the narrative itself from Lionel's perspective. Because of this leveling of all distracting judgment (the same tough-loving straightforwardness that Lionel appreciates in Frank Minna) I think this book teaches the basic, golden-rule lesson that everyone deserves a little respect and a chance in life.Lionel's independence is something he's had to maintain all along as an orphan and as a freak in others' eyes, and it's rewarding to see him beating out the other characters in smarts as he becomes a real detective. He plays his disorder to his advantage because everyone underestimates him or regards him as a nuisance. Lethem's achievement is not the detective plotline, but his portrayal of Lionel from Lionel's own point of view -- he never wallows in self-pity, and the reader sees him as a savvy upstart with an independent, secret angle on everything. I especially liked the abbreviated relationship with the girl at the Zendo.This is all not to mention the whirlwind wordplay that peppers the whole book, and makes Tourette's syndrome seem like a symptom of genius that more people should manifest in this life we take too seriously.As someone new to Brooklyn, I loved the geography (street names, intersections) that gave a real flavor to every scene."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"im conflicted. this novel, had had its heart something amazing, original, and tempting; but it faltered. A far as setting, accuracy, and writing style this author has written a five star book, but the novel's energy and originality sputters towards the end. I ended up skipping three pages in total, not a lot, but enough to downgrade the book from a five to a four. I also hesitate to give it a three, but the descriptions and approach warrant a higher grade. So many reviews give away too much. This book is about a boy, who through his own Buddha retreat inward finds himself, or better clarifies himself, his life, his intents, his values. it is a detective story shrouded in something larger. In that i follows along side Ishmael and on the road. these novels are strikingly different, but their essence offers a crisp realization that we are each alone, but also connected by a delicate fiber. It is a complex novel, and each word carries double if not triple meaning. It is with this that i shake my head to other reviewers who claim that the book divulged answers only in the last two chapters. this is not true. Subtle, if not large facts and pieces of evidence are displayed before you, urging the reader to unfold the answers before even approaching these last few chapters. This book straddles between a 3.5 for delivery and a 4.5 for originality and writing style."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I came to this a bit late I must admit, the only one to suffer was myself. Oh how I wish I'd read this sooner. It's brilliant. It's Lethem's fifth novel and for me it shows him at the top of his game. He's exploring what seems like new territory for him, a brave move and a challenge he's risen to like no other. I honestly don't think that's an exaggeration. He's found his feet with the sentence, and moves you through this story with master strokes, with humour, and uncanny insight. Working with a detective has suited him well, working through the clues, at times uncovering, at others teasing out - and handling Tourette's inside a novel in such depth - a highly skilled author. Edgy.I also recommend this one by Jayne Joso:Soothing Music for Stray Cats"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is a riff on the hard-boiled noir detective novel (a la Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane, Ross MacDonald, etc.) as told by a thirty-year-old with Tourette's Syndrome, Lionel Essrog by name. Lionel and three other orphans at the St. Vincent Home for Boys in Brooklyn were commandeered by a petty but charismatic criminal, Frank Minna (thus becoming the Minna Men), to carry out various and sundry jobs in support of Minna's criminal exploits. By so doing, Frank gave Lionel a life and a modicum of respectability and self-esteem. After Frank is murdered (at the end of an absolutely brilliant first chapter -- the high point of the novel), Lionel sets out on his own investigation to discover the killer(s) and wreak vengeance.The plot is a little strained at times -- like many of the plots of the classic American detective novels that author Lethem is both honoring and parodying -- but it is good enough to provide a plausible vehicle for the novel's real strengths. They are twofold: one, the character of Lionel Essrog (one of the more unusual and memorable protagonists I have encountered) and his omnipresent struggles with his Tourette's; and two, a crackling and edgy hyperenergetic narrative, rife with imaginative wordplay, that is frequently punctuated with Lionel's own Tourettic and explosive verbal variations. I found the wordplay highly engaging, a sort of American's (or Brooklynite's) \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", although much less recondite. (What a challenge the novel must pose for a prospective translator! How would one render, for example, \\"the Kumquat Sasquatch\\"?)I had read nothing by Jonathan Lethem and knew very little about him before I bought MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN while on a recent trip, having consumed the books I had brought with me. I am quite pleased with my discovery. While not a great novel, MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is literate and very entertaining. If Lethem's other works are on the same plane, I have stumbled upon a worthwhile author."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog is a character for all time. In a world where many would be disgusted or annoyed by his traits (a sufferer of tourette's syndrome) he is a man who is dog loyal, and a man content to be who he is. I found his voice to be a refreshing burst of honesty in a literary world rife with soulless characters.Jonathan Lethem has written a novel that has two great characters. The tourettic protagonist Lionel Essrog, and the low budget mobster Frank Minna. Although Minna departs the novel by the end of the first chapter his character and influence reverberate up to the very last page. Lionel and his mentor / father figure are not ideals or even profoundly likable people, but their little eccentricities and behaviors allow the reader to identify with them despite the fact that most of us will have little to nothing in common with either of them. As in real life we will see the humanity come through the mask and then of course, we will see bits of ourselves.Some reviewers have hailed this as a detective story. The mystery plot is really only meant to be used as a vehicle for the much more interesting character study. Pick it up to be blown away by good writing and a couple of great characters. Not to read a literary car chase.Mr. Lethem refuses to tie up this tale with a pretty bow, and the ending is pleasant, but not movie ending pleasant. Rather, the type of pleasant ending that decent people can create for themselves in this world when they are content with who they are."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I began reading this book on the day I started the worst job of my life. I found its Tourettic main character Lionel Essrog, so compelling, that my mood was instantly elevated, and I stayed at that job probably far longer than I should have. Now I have a much better job, so I went back for a second read, and was happy to find the book held up so well.Lionel, the detective and narrator of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, is prone to sudden verbal tics -- he'll start rhyming his own name, for example -- or to adjusting people's collars. This makes him perhaps the most unsuited detective in the history of the genre. He would certainly not be out of place in a Coen Brothers movie (I'm thinking John Turturro here, or maybe Steve Buscemi, who read the audiobook).Indeed the whole plot is Coen-esque. Lionel and three other characters are runners for a very small-time Brooklyn mob associate named Frank Minna, in the decidedly unglamorous Boerum Hill neighborhood. When Minna is found dead in a dumpster by the Pulaski Bridge (a horribly prosaic fate), his men are hunted one by one, and it's up to Lionel to find out who done it, and why. Jonathan Lethem populates the story with oddly-named characters such as Kimmery and Mr. Foible and Detective Seminole. With a world full of names such as these, it's easy to see why Lionel tics as much as he does.Along the way are fascinating asides into how Lionel's mind works. He notes that Prince is perhaps the first Tourettic singer, and there's a glorious two page essay on the MAD Magazine art of Don Martin. Lethem also throws in some great New York-specific baseball references (Lee Mazzilli, Bucky Dent), and has Lionel think, while eating soup, &quot;Tinker to Evers to chicken&quot;.The mystery held less of my attention on the second read-through; for some reason, I was more confused than I was the first time. I think the two New Jersey gangsters, Matricardi and Rockaforte (or &quot;Bricco and Stuckface&quot;) are a little off-key, but perhaps that's because they both have the overly-precise speech patterns of Joe Mantegna (&quot;We wish to comfort you on this day of pain and misunderstanding...&quot;).On the whole, &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; is a very inventive spin on language, and uses its New York setting extremely well, hitting everything from the pattern of Upper East Side traffic lights, to the solitude of the G train. I dare you read it, and then not have Lionel-esque verbal tics for days afterward. Liable Guessfrog!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Why can't more authors write like Lethem? He's that rare combination of storyteller and prose turner that keeps us coming back for more. We laugh and cry. This is one of my desert island books, along with Klim's Jesus Lives in Trenton and Palahniuk's Fight Club. Take them if you will."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is an incredible work of hardboiled fiction featuring an ambitious, but wildly successful characteristic that allows it to stand out from the crowd of private investigator mysteries. As fascinating as it is sobering, Tourette's Syndrome is spotlighted as we view the world from Tourette's suffering Lionel Essrog's perspective as he carries out an investigation into the murder of his boss and mentor while held under the spell of his illness.Although the book features an engrossing murder investigation complete with mob-ties and conspiracy theories, it's the battle going on inside Lionel's head that holds the most interest. At times his outbursts are presented humorously, but we are always reminded how hard he's working just to appear normal.It's a book full of stark reminders of the frailty of the human condition and how things and, in particular people, aren't always as they seem on the surface. This is a book that will stay with you long after you close the cover on the last page."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"of words, Lionel Essrog is a prisoner of the obsessiveness that binds those with Tourette's Syndrome. Jonathan Lethem introduces us to one of the most interesting characters I have come across in some time in his novel Motherless Brooklyn.As an orphan in Brooklyn, Lionel has no idea what causes his own strange behavior until Frank Minna, a local mobster takes Lionel and some of his buddies from the orphanage under his wing. Minna frees Lionel, by not only giving him some purpose in life but by identifying the cause for his strange behavior. Lionel is no longer just a \\"freak show\\" as he is affectionately called, he is one of Frank Minna's, Minna Men or detectives for want of a better word.All is going well for Lionel until the day Frank Minna disappears into the building called Zendo and is later retrieved by Lionel from a dumpster. At that point Lionel's life as a Minna Man is forever changed. He finds the world he has built coming under assault.It is great fun for the reader to bounce around Brooklyn with Lionel hunting for clues. We are immersed in his strange sea of words, an uncontrollable stream of consciousness which refuses to be shut down.\\"Alibi hullabaloo gullible bellyflop smellafish, sang my brain, obliterating speech.\\"This is a sampling of the steady river of words flowing through in Essrog's brain and spalshing off the pages of Motherless Brooklyn. He is an entertaining character that can go nowhere quietly or unobtrusively, but some how he manages to find his way to the depth of the mystery that destroyed his mentor.Jonathan Lethem skilled writing, entertaining storytelling and engaging characterizations make Motherless Brooklyn an excellent mystery and one that is truly hard to put down. I just couldn't get enough of Lionel and when I finished the book I sadly and reluctantly said goodbye to him."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A small life in a big place doesn't mean it isn't a fascinating life. Lethem knows his tics and puts them in your head. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem's writing seems to be totally hit or miss for me: I loved &quot;Gun, With Occasional Music,&quot; I hated &quot;Amnesia Moon&quot; and had similar reactions to stories in his collection &quot;Wall of the Sky, Wall of the Eye.&quot; Fortunately, this falls on the love side of my Lethem fence. Lethem's protagonist, Lionel Essrog, was raised in an orphanage in Brooklyn and suffers from Tourette's syndrome. Since becoming a teenager he has been a &quot;Minna Man,&quot; part of a group of orphans turned into wanna-be wiseguys operated by a low-level hood. Things get going with a bang as Minna is murdered right off the bat, leaving the four Minna Men to try and figure out what happened and if they can trust each other. The mystery isn't all that special in it's own right and the climax spins a little out of control-but Lethem's deft humanization of a Tourette's sufferer is brilliant and affecting, more than making up for any plot deficiencies. Lethem is a writer who fires off literary pyrotechnics which sometimes blow up in his face, fortunately here they light up the page in a most delightfully unexpected way."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Pleased to see Lethem's novel won the critic's circle award. Lethem's masterstroke is his narrator; Essrog is utterly believable. Often I wished hard he would just shut up and get on with solving the case, but there was no way I was going to stop reading. A very human reaction to a fictional character. Once you accept the Tourette's as part of the rhythm of the book it becomes a fascinating element of the character. As a former Brooklynite, I found Lethem's depiction of that area dead-on accurate (down to Rusty Staub and &quot;half a fag&quot;) and beautifully realized without going over the top. Wonderful choice of words without overdoing it. Brooklyn becomes a main character with as valuable and intimate role in the story as any of the people. By the end I had a hard time believing Lethem was not a Brooklyn raised orphan with Tourette's. An entertaining, compelling and intelligent work. The defintion of excellent fiction."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel is one of four orphans from St. Vincent's who are recruited by a small-time New York hood for grunt work. Afflicted by Tourette's, Lionel drives most people crazy, but he tickles his mentor's sense of humor. All four orphans (the &quot;motherless Brooklyn&quot; of the title) look up to their leader, but Lionel's admiration includes a large component of unstated love.When his father figure is murdered in the street, Lionel is the only one of the four no-longer-boys with the intellect, loyalty, and determination to find out what really happened.Previously a science fiction author, in this book, Lethem takes off into reality like a rocket. The only alien landscape we view here is the inside of the Tourette-inflicted mind, and Lionel is as alien as it gets. But his tics and hollers are the fuller realizations of our own small compulsions and fascinations. They bring the reader right into his mind and body. Despite the pace of the action, and constant plot twists and developments (he tells this story walking, alright) his is an internal journey, and very human.This is an absolutely riveting good book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog, aka &quot;Freakshow&quot; to his fellow constituents at the L&amp;L Car Service, a front for the L&amp;L Detective Agency, is the Holden Caulfield of this century--if &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; had been told by Raymond Chandler instead of Salinger. This Tourette-riddled narrator guides the reader, albeit in a loopy and rapid-fire free association, through his life in Brooklyn. An orphan boy, though we're really not certain if even that is true, he is &quot;adopted&quot; by Frank Minna, an errand runner for unsavory crime figures, and taken under Minna's wing, despite his &quot;freakshow&quot; qualities. When Minna is murdered, Lionel takes it upon himself to find his friends killer. The journey will be one not soon forgotten. Lethem ably and aptly deploys his amazing writing skills once again in his fifth fiction outing. After three consecutive readings, I have chosen this novel as the most important and best novel I have ever had the (repeated) pleasure of laying my eyes and hands on. If you don't read this book, give up reading!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem is a true original. His latest, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" manages to spin a tale of orphan misfits, detectives, gangsters and a main character that suffers from Tourette Syndrome into an impressive, rapid paced melee. The descriptions of the Brooklyn area, the characters and all the necessary sensory perceptions needed come through in snappy prose. Lethem's description of the 'impulses' and 'partly contollable' symptoms of Tourette are dead-on. Never has this reviewer read anything that so accurately captures the essence of Tourette and the personality in a novel. The reader can feel the symptoms of Tourette welling up in themselves as strongly as the character does on the page.Half detective story and half a case study of a young man with Tourette, Lethem intertwines the two deftly, giving the reader little time to breathe between events.The detective story may be slightly hackneyed and the closeness of the orphans and thier Fagan-like detective mentor could have been more intimately detailed, but Lionel Essrog and his Tourette's make fantastic fodder. Lethem goes for broke. This novel describes Tourette and real life on the streets like no other author has before."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"There I was, reading happily along, totally enthralled by the history of the Minna Men, Lionel's fantastic verbal riffs, the mystery and sadness of Frank's death, Lionel's reaction to it, thinking: man, this book is an instant classic, when BAM! Enter Julia on page 99, and ppppfffft, the air went out of the story for me. She answers the door in a slip and stockings like a Chandler dame, complete with cigarette, gun and &quot;dusty suitcase&quot; full of lingerie. She's a stock character from Central Casting, an anachronistic cliche not worthy of the expectations Lethem has set up, the wonderful idiosyncrasies of Essrog, the individual, distinctive personalities of the male characters. We also leave behind the fantastic descriptions of Brooklyn, the strong sense of place that's part of the magic of the earlier part of the book -- it turns into a straight detective story and plays with genre conventions without adding much in the way of new archetypes or ideas -- the wildly original language continues, but that isn't enough, at least, not for me. Damn. The first 98 pages are BRILLIANT. Next time out, I hope Lethem sustains that level of inventive originality for an entire book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Like the Balloon Man in Central Park, Jonathan Lethem has taken the straightforward noir detective genre and twisted up a tail, turned out a neck, puffed up a chest and pulled out a pair of wings until it has become a fable for our times. Lionel Essrog is the quintessential Ugly Duckling. Abandoned by his parents, who in all probability could not deal with his Tourette's Syndrome, Lionel grows up in an orphanage. In typical &quot;boys will be boys&quot; fashion, he is dubbed &quot;Freakshow&quot; and denigrated at every turn. Then along comes Frank Minna, a small-time Brooklyn mobster, who become's Lionel's surrogate father. Lionel and his orphan friends become The Minna Men, running errands for the mob, but Lionel remains oblivious to being used. When Frank is fatally shot, even he abandons Lionel to the Code of Omerta, a concept completely alien to a Touretter. With fierce loyalty and a mission to do what is right, Lionel sets out to find Frank's killers. When Minna Men abandon him for other agendas, he simply redoubles his efforts. And just when you think he has found a love interest, one as uncontrolled in her naivete as he is in his speech, even she abandons him. Lionel navigates this sea of human cruelty simply by defining everything in terms of himself. This is raw survival - a novel totally absorbed in the self-consciousness of its protagonist. His jackhammer epithets are at first funny, then discomforting, then annoying, until Lionel brings you full circle into how utterly uncontrollable it all is. You begin to feel devastated when he blurts out secrets that will do him harm. You try to esp insights to him, knowing he knows exactly what to do but just can't help himself. In the end, Lionel has won you over totally and completely. Lethem probably began this novel on a dare - can a writer exhibit the technical wizardry necessary to pull off a protagonist with Tourette's Syndrome. By the end of the book, you can tell that Lionel has won over Lethem as well. Lionel Essrog is a fully realized and achingly human character, a swan, no less."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This was the first thing I've read by Jonathan Lethem. I have heard that some of his other novels are &quot;hard to get into,&quot; but that is definitely NOT the case with Motherless Brooklyn. Lethem's portrait of his protagonist -- a 30-something year old orphan with Tourette's Syndrome, is in-depth, peppered with nuances, and a joy to imagine.Lethem is an adroit writer. Almost every sentence is a gem. I rarely feel this way about authors -- probably the last time I did was when I read Michael Cunningham's The Hours -- but I savored Lethem's paragraphs. This is not a book to skim.Of course, the book held other fascination for me as well: I grew up in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn that Lethem did (his sister and I went to the same grammar school) and seeing the neighborhood through his eyes is a treat. But you needn't be from South Brooklyn (or New York at all) to enjoy this novel. The mystery itself -- and the antagonists in the plot -- are reminiscent of Raymond Chandler or Daschiell Hammett: drawn in bold, black strokes with a surrounding aura of cigarette smoke and the smell of whiskey."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog, the central character in Jonathan Lethem's highly entertaining &quot;Motherless Brooklyn,&quot; is not your average detective. Lionel is an orphan with Tourette's syndrome. He's a relatively gentle young man whose condition causes him to obsess on small details, gobble down one sandwich after another, tap people on the shoulder five times or yell things at inopportune moments. Lionel is one of four young men from a Brooklyn orphanage employed as drivers and detectives by the mysterious Frank Minna. Minna is a smalltime Brooklyn wise guy worshipped by the four orphans. When Frank winds up dead, Lionel goes on a mission to find his mentor's killer. Lionel may sound crazy, but his condition masks an intelligence few recognize. Frank kept dangerous company, including a nasty brother who practices Zen Buddhism, and two old, decrepit mobsters who worship their long dead mother. Lionel's investigation puts him at odds with his fellow &quot;Minna Men&quot; and endangers his life. By the end of his unorthodox investigation (during which he gets attacked by Zen Buddhists), Lionel has suffers more loss and discovers difficult truths about his friends. Lionel is wonderfully original character - simultaneously likeable and annoying. When he finds love briefly, a reader can't help but be happy for him. But it's just as easy to understand when he gets dumped. &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; succeeds beautifully as a noir novel, but it's more than that. Using Lionel's condition, as well as the colorful speech of Minna, Lethem has a ball with language. Lethem's word play, humor and genre bending - not to mention the use he makes of the Brooklyn milieu - make &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; a great, memorable book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Like Paul Auster and very few others, Jonathan Lethem is a writer of literary fiction who dramatically alters his chops between novels and, with seemingly little effort, creates, again and again, works that ensnare readers delighting in oddly angled worlds, where a tilted plausibility replaces the stable statistics of everyday expectation. Motherless Brooklyn is delirious, overabundant, delightful creativity, with a strong, supple spine of research on Tourette's Syndrome to render palpably the faux detective Lionel Essrog, an unforgettable creation. This is literary jazz of the highest caliber: Lethem blows twelve bars of melody and takes off on soaring feats of improvisation, but always--whether carefully, or harrowingly, or softly, or howlingly humorously--bringing his daring rhetorical flights back home with great (and intuitively &quot;fitting&quot;) imagination.Some reviewers have invoked the name &quot;Nabokov&quot; with reference to Motherless Brooklyn, praise that is not misplaced. Yes, this novel is squarely in the crime noir genre. Yes, Lethem might have situated his protogonist in any of half a dozen other genres. And, yes, locating a germ of &quot;difference&quot; and building standard materials around it is precisely what makes a &quot;genre.&quot; But Lethem's language--and his principal deployer of language, the Tourettic Lionel--is, like Nabokov's in Lolita and Pale Fire, literally miraculous. And the Tourette's difference is, as it must be, integral to the story (which, considered as crime fiction, by the way, is good: populated with believable characters and dialogue, a suitably tangled plot, and honest, satisfying resolutions).Read this novel. Tell your friends. Make Jonathan Lethem's name familiar in their mouths as household words. His is a gifted new voice that should be widely supported."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you're going to open up Lethem's most recent offering, Motherless Brooklyn, you'd better make sure you're comfortable. You're not going to be going anywhere for awhile. I can almost guarantee you'll read the first chapter at least twice in a row before moving on. The story itself is more reality based than many of Lethem's other works, but in no way is it any less original. Motherless Brooklyn revolves around a group of unofficial private detectives, quasi-tough guys who have been working together since they were fourteen when they were plucked out of a Brooklyn orphanage by a crime Lord wannabe. The main character, Lionel Essrog, has an unlikely affliction for a private detective: he suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. He is obsessed with words, numbers, touching, and often finds it difficult to control himself. I don't know if it's a natural progression of writing about someone with Tourette's or premeditated, just another stroke of Lethem's usual genius, but the entire novel is written with just the kind of snappy and bouncy rhythym that would please Lionel greatly. It teases you into re-reading sentences and taunts you into peeking at pages you shouldn't be peeking at yet. The action will make you bite your nails and the mystery will render you incapable of putting the book down, but the real beauty lies in Lethem's characterization. Each character is multi-faceted and so human you can see them. You will miss them you're finished. It's been awhile since I've added to my list of favorite literary figures, but I have a new hero now, and his name is Lionel Essrog."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A truely outstanding novel. The writing is exceptionally sharp and very funny. You can't help but feel sorry for Lionel because of his sickness, even though Lionel himself shows no self pity. As a first time reader of his novels, I am very impressed and am looking forward to buying his previous works. Wonderful"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Motherless Brooklyn is one of the most skillfully written and original books I have read in a long time. I found myself laughing hysterically one moment, and feeling my stomach twist into knots the next. Lethem is a masterful writer, and I am eager to read his other books after thoroughly enjoying his latest"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"An amazing tour-de-force; Tourette's as a wildly successful literary and literal device. A wonderful tour of the seamy side of Brooklyn as well; sort of Paul Auster meets James Joyce. A great read. Read it slowly to savor the language play."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"First off, I've read the novel as well, and it's easily Lethem's best. I worked for five years for a guy with Tourette's, and Lethem did is homework. The thing you don't get on the printed page is the abruptness, the change of tempo, that a verbal tick, especially an unsuccesful suppression of one, can come out with such lightning speed in the midst of an otherwise normal conversation.Which is where Frank Muller comes in. I listen to audiobooks at work, usually 40 or 50 hours a week. I rarely revisit one, but in the case of Motherless Brooklyn, I can't stop going back to the library and getting it for another listen.There are some other good audiobooks out there, to be sure, and some other gifted narrators, but this combination of book and narrator is the ultimate."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I was in awe reading this wonderful book. Lethem has captured the life of the Tourettic and somehow enmeshed it into a fine mystery and adventure.When I first read about this book I thought I would be frustrated reading about a star with a handicap, that the hero woould be phony but brave, pitiful but admired...all that contradictory stuff that is used to glamorize a weakness. But Lethem made this character real. He is no martyr, just an everyday Tourettes guy going about his private detective business.I actually learned a bunch about Tourettes and the inner feelings of its victims. I learned that they are frustrated as hell but they surge through life anyway. The story is much deeper though. It deals with heros, frustration, love and most of all how dependent some people can get on others.Hero Lionel Essrog is an orphan who has been 'adopted' by a local small time crook. Lionel and some fellow orphans do some odd jobs for this guy and become way too attached to him. He becomes their father figure, their, hero, their role model. Lionel ends up showing he has more character than his role model ever had. Other characters just add to the enjoyment.I had fun reading Motherless Brooklyn. How much you want to bet this book shows up on Oprah's list pretty soon. Just remember I said it first."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Not a detective story in the conventional sense, Motherless Brooklyn is as much the story of Lionel Essrog as it is the story of a murder, and in this sense it is particularly appealing. Essrog is doubly removed from the mainstream-he has grown up in an orphanage without the kind of nurturing which gives humans their ability to empathize with each other, and he has Tourette's Syndrome, which makes him involuntarily touch and pat objects, count or repeat actions, and, most annoyingly for him, blurt out nonsense, rhymes, and sometimes obscenities at oftentimes inappropriate moments. He is not an easy character to identify with.Yet Jonathan Lethem, the author, is not using the Tourette's symptoms as a literary trick. He makes the reader care about Lionel without pitying him. Lionel is trying to find the murderer of Frank Minna, a somewhat shady character who has mentored Lionel and three others from the orphanage since they were young teenagers. Lionel comes to believe that he may be the only one who cares enough about Frank to be able to solve his murder, and he begins to think that Frank counted on him to do this by the statements and actions he made in the moments immediately before and after he received his fatal wounds. As Lionel works to find Frank's killer, as he tries to attract a woman and sustain a relationship, and as he evaluates the relationships he has had with the other orphans, Lionel becomes more mature and more aware of his unusual relationships with the outside world.The author's recreation of the Tourette world is so vivid and realistic that I (like other readers, perhaps) looked up information about the author himself experienced this syndrome. (No.) His imaginative descriptions, especially those presented from Lionel's point of view, are often both humorous and uniquely offbeat. And his ability to keep the reader fascinated with this character and his story is absolutely dazzling."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Mysteries, particularly those of Chandler and Hammett, have always been about language. Listen to Spade or Marlowe talk and you're more afraid of their mouths than their guns. Lethem seems to understand this intuitively and his new novel is a terrific subversion/inversion/reinvention (pick your poison) of the genre. That Essrog is saddled with Tourette's opens wonderful avenues for Lethem to explore. I've rarely seen a book in which every choice the novelist makes is so dead on. This is going on the eye-level shelf on my bookcase at home."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The first 100 pages of this book were terrific. Great voice... great character development, of both the main character and the 3 other Minna men. But then, the first 100 pages were all flashback. Once we returned to the main thread of the story, I felt the narrative thrust slowed down, and even came to a halt. A strange series of events began unfolding, none of which really helped the reader understand the crime which had been committed. The crime was unraveled in the final 30 pages in which Lionel finds out what happened through Julia's explanation, not really through his own sleuthing. This section, by the way, felt like a return to the beautiful prose from the beginning of the book. Gripping narrative in and of itself, although unsatisfying since the solution is being handed to us. It's not a solution we could have arrived at by ourselves through clues dropped within the body of the work. So... is this the neo-detective story, one in which plotline is secondary to character development? Fine, I'll buy it, but why bother making it a detective story? For beautiful writing and memorable characters, I would have graded it 5 stars. But for a detective story, and all the baggage and expectations that encompass that genre, I would have given it 2 stars. Average it out at 3 stars."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem has cratfed a book that transcends the crime fiction genre! He has created a colorful cast of characters that hold your interest from page one to the last word. Lionel Essrog, the Turetic lead character, is at times master sleuth and at other times, bumbling detective! Grab an egg cream, sit out on the stoop and enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Not being a fan of plot-driven stories, I would have tossed this book after the opening section were it not for the captivating hero, Lionel \\"Freakshow\\" Essrog. The plot is nothing more than a dressed-up episode of \\"Law and Order: Wiseguy Division\\" and the reader is supposed to care if the amateur detective can solve the mystery of who killed his friend/mentor. That type of melodrama bores me to tears.But I didn't stop reading it. In fact, I couldn't stop. I've never been so captivated, so mesmerized as I was with this wonderfully enlightening description of someone with Tourettes Syndrome. No, the plot isn't for me, but I found the lead character to be irresistible.An essential element for a book/movie to be satisfying for me is that I learn something. In its description of someone with Tourettes, Motherless Brooklyn informs on the level of a medical journal expos&eacute; masquerading as a Dashiell Hammett piece. What I found most educational about the description of Lionel's condition was the internal dialogue of the echoes in his mind. Words become like taffy, as his mind stretches and twists them to almost unrecognizable forms of their original shape and then blurts them out to his confused listener.He also can't keep his thoughts hidden, as any word on his mind builds up pressure in his brain and mouth until he lets it out. This makes him tell his jokes' punch lines before they are appropriate, comment on the titillating aspects of a woman's body he should keep to himself and use taboo words when speaking to an African-American cop.Although these scenarios create uncomfortable and laugh-out-loud moments, they also shed light on the horror of someone not having control over their own speech. The reader suffers with Lionel as he comes to terms with the affliction that forever haunts and limits him.Yes, there is a plot and he tries to solve a mystery. Without Lionel's condition, this book would not have been published, as it is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill murder mystery. It also would have remained unread on my nightstand. But because of Lionel, I sped through its pages, and honestly feel like it has added something to my life."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book had fabulous characters, a suspenseful, complicated plot, and wonderful writing. I often laughed aloud and read sections aloud to my husband. So imaginative, creative, and compelling. I'd give it another star if I could!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a great book and very original. It blends together originality, an insight into Tourette's syndrome and a detective novel without losing anything on the way.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\", Lethem created a world of small time. Small time mobsters employ much smaller time Frank Minna who employs tiny time Minna Men, of whom Lionel Essrog is the star. His star status is not obvious to everyone. To most around him he officially is a freak, with outbursts of verbal gobbledygook and repetitive jerky motions which scare and befuddle people. Minna, his one real friend, has known him for a smart guy all along, but this is only revealed by the end of the book. And it is at the end of the book that Minna's wife sees Lionel the way Minna saw him and that Lionel ends up earning respectful treatment even from the mobsters.The readers are in a much better position. We see Lionel as a star from the very first pages: we would much rather listen to him than to any other character in the book. His Tourette's tics are hilarious, and his irony, borne out of inability to suppress them, no less amusing (\\"You are Lionel Essrog, aren't you? - 'Unreliable Cheesegrub', I corrected\\"). This freaky schlemiel, this giant fly on the wall turns out to be the star student of Minna's and acts as a veritable wise guy: he takes matters into his hands, figures out interests and roles of a clandestine organization and 5-6 individuals involved, avenges the death of his friend and negotiates a saner life for him and his friends.The spirited portrait of Lionel is fresh and memorable. The supporting characters are cast in vivid colors: take the colossal Polish hit man squeezing the juices out of kumquats or a flock of nervous doormen playing mafia...A beautiful portrait in a fetching frame."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"When I heard of an upcoming movie with Edward Norton (one of my favorite actors), and discovered it would be based on a Jonathan Lethem novel, I was compelled to read \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" for myself. I'm new to Lethem's work, and so it was with great relish that I found myself swept into the rich and strange world of a man with Tourette's.Lionel Essrog is a masterful creation, one of those fictional characters that can carry, even overwhelm, a story--as he does here. He's an orphan, a kid growing into a man on the streets of Brooklyn. Lethem opens his story with a stake-out and then the untimely--and by no means natural--passing of a fatherly figure in Essrog's life. From there, Lethem leads us through the rabbit warrens of Essrog's thinking processes, while Essrog tries to deduce the perpetrator of the crime. Essrog's character and his interactions with others, not to mention his own internal struggles, elevate this average mystery plot into something more.Essrog is alternately funny, wise, and eccentric. At times, I found myself simply weary of being in his presence. This underlines Lethem's ability to capture the ticcing personality of his protagonist, but it also led to occasional distractions for me. Or maybe I was simply mirroring. Without Essrog's rants and rambles, the book would be cut in half, leaving a bare-bones mystery.If you enjoy memorable and quirky characters in your novels, this book is one not to be missed. I can't wait to see Ed Norton's portrayal of Essrog, and I can only hope they capture Lethem's magic on the screen."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem is in a rare class of contemporary writers. His work enfolds you into a time period in Brooklyn, NY exploring all that makes the boro unique. This work is fascinating for the NY reader and the non NY reader alike. His characters are well crafted and his plot line solid. The book does explore themes of mafia and deceit which are always entertaining."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The writing is excellent and original, but the story and plot isn't all that inspired. Sweet main character with few chances in life who makes good. It's hard not to like Lionel Essrog, but Lethem didn't go deep enough. We're teased. I was a little disappointed."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A very nice book that requires some patience at points, but is definitely worth the read. For hard boiled detective fans it has all the elements with a very unique main character."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem has outdone himself with this work. While at points going overboard on the description and the picture-painting, one cannot help but play out their own movie-type setting in Brooklyn and in Lionel's head. This was one book that I could hardly put down and when I did put it down, it wasn't more than an hour that I was back to it, pulled in, enthralled by this elaborate Murder She Wrote vs. Wiseguy vs. Medical Journal....Lionel's ecstaticism in his own mind and how he dealt with the events served as a story within a story within a story. The running commentary is enough for even the novice reader to keep up with the estranged plot. This book is entertaining to begin with; Lethem makes sure the reader is paying attention with his gross use of \\"Eatme\\"-isms. Then it becomes captivating as the reader tries to understand a very misunderstood man and sympathize with his affliction yet admire his will and sense of mind to piece this crooked puzzle together. Finally, it comes together like a symphony, everything in unison, most everything making sense and the reader being left with a strong sense of satisfaction after flipping to the last page. But the book's strong subtext to not take anything for face value can deliver a powerful message to everyone. Thank You Mr. Lethem for making this such a readable piece of work that I can assure you will be read over and over."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a work of pure genius, one of my all-time favorites.Rarely have I come across such originality, in both character development and story. I'm inspired to read more of Lethem's work; his voice is powerful.Read this for a lead character who is brilliantly crafted and uniquely sympathetic, and for a mystery whose pace keeps you involved but not aching for the end. Familiarity with the Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill area vibe is helpful."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"'Motherless Brooklyn' is certainly a refreshing novel. It's about young (and likeable) juvenile deliquents who grow up under the care of a gangster (..who calls himself a private investigator). When this gangster gets murdered these kids (now young men) need to finally do some real investigation work of their own. The reader is taken on a bizarre, and funny, journey involving Zen buddhism and murder. Great stuff.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this book is that the narrator, one of the juvenile deliquents, has Tourette's Syndrome. This poor fellow has the uncontrollable urge to shout out (often rude and very funny) nonsense at absolutely the wrong moments. The author actually treats him with compassion rather than ridicule; I don't think sufferers of this condition will feel exploited.Bottom line: a thoroughly engaging read. Good story, great characterizations."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I'm surprised to see that this book has generally gotten such positive reviews. I was excited to read it after hearing the author discuss his new book on the radio, but I found it to be ... not very good at all. The writing is fine, and the Tourettes thing is kind of well done, but the plot is absolutely terrible - a sophomoric pastiche of hard-boiled detective stories. I read the whole thing only because it was a quick read and I hate to put down a book, but I really didn't care what happened in the end, and then the ending turned out to be the worst part of the book. Not sure why this author is getting such hype. Perhaps his new book is better."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem's \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is an excellent innovative tale of intrigue based primarily on the daily streetlife of Brooklyn and Manhattan. The narrator and main character Lionel Essrog suffers from Tourette's syndrome complete with word spews and tics. Lethem boldly and impressively creates dialogue throughout the book littered with Tourette's based utterancesEssrog is employed by small time Brooklyn street hustler Frank Minna. Essrog along with three other orphaned teenagers Tony, Danny and Gilbert were recruited by Minna from the St. Vincent Home for Boys in downtown Brooklyn. At first under the guidance of Minna and his older brother Gerard, they were told that they were working for a moving company and they transported and moved sealed boxes to various locations. After a few months, the boys were introduced to two aged Italian wiseguys Matricardi and Rockaforte and told to forget about the encounter. Shortly thereafter the van used to move the boxes was vandalized, This lead to the fleeing from Brooklyn by both Frank and Gerard Minnato parts unknown, leaving the boys in the lurch.Two years pass and Minna returns with a wife, Julia. Lionel and the rest of the Minna Men, as they like to call themselves resume operations this time as a bogus detective agency and car service. They in reality are following Minna's orders as he serves as a liason for the business dealings of Matricardi and Rockaforte.Lionel and Gilbert are assigned to drive Frank to an elegant apartment on the upper east side of Manhattan. A brass plaque on the door read Yorkville Zendo, a Japanese church teaching Zen Buddhism. Lionel was wearing a headset listening to a microphone planted on Frank. Gilbert waited in the lobby of the building. Minna enterred and was escorted into the Zendo when suddenly an apparent conflict ensued. A gargantuan giant of a man spirited Frank out of the building leading them on a wild car chase. The pursuit ended in an industrial area of Brooklyn and the microphone allowed Lionel to hone in on Minna's wherabouts. They found him thrown into a dumpster with an ultimately fatal abdominal stab wound.Minna's murder created the crux of the plot, the investigation by Lionel Essrog of the killing of his boss and mentor. Essrog, while afflicted with the sometimes crippling effects of Tourette's nonetheless possesses a quick and analytical mind. He eventually uncovers a creatively crafted set of circumstances in which Lethem tells his captivating tale."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Actually, unlike other reviewers, I think the plot is fine. Perhaps not the most griping who-done-it ever written, but good enough.Because plot is not the point - don't buy 'Motherless Brooklyn' if you're looking for a normal detective novel. Instead, buy this novel to delve into the world of Lionel Essrog, a Tourettic hulk of a man who is closer to being a low-rung mafioso than the private eye he believes himself to be. Physical tics and counting compulsions abound, but what Lethem stresses is Lionel's obsession with language - an obsession Lethem obviously shares. Lionel's verbal tic goes for beyond the stereotypical uncontrolled shout of a profanity. We're also treated to Lionel's internal monologue of wordplay. Certain words and phrases have a resonance that his Tourette's mind latches onto, and as readers we come to recognize the sheer joy to be had in playing with the sounds found in English. No other prose has ever done so for me.But this is not just a cold language game - there is substantial character development. You come to know Lionel as the novel unfolds, and you observe him finally knowing himself."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Probably the best book I have ever read. Great story, excellent use of language, fantastic metaphors and similes, not to mention a look inside the psyche of a person who would otherwise be ignored. I can't say enough."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog is a great narrator. Lethem could not choose better - putting the Tourette's syndrome aside (although it is significant and obviously also deliberate choice of a handicap, with the word-flow and uncontrolled baroque cursing), the story of his life is very unusual and interesting, so that -for me- the recalling of his childhood and selection of the group by Frank Minna, a local - Brooklyn - small scale mafioso and hochstapler, are probably better than the mystery plot itself.Lionel and his friends from the orphanage are \\"Minna's men\\" - mostly employed in some background searches and bodyguarding, calling themselves detectives, but working under the cover of the limousine rental. Their real detective work starts in fact only when Minna is killed - and the plot develops somewhat imperfectly, the reader may be lost a few times and the ending is not so great - but the personality and adventures of Lionel and the possibility of entering his mind make up for it. The writing is like Lionels' mind could be - chaotic, with numerous interruptions, taking some detours...Worth mentioning, for New Your City fans, are also descriptions and captured pictures of Brooklyn and Manhattan!It is a good book and an encouragement to try more of Jonathan Lethem's novels."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem's \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is a classic mystery with a twist. Its narrator has Tourette's syndrome, and his condition emerges on the page in the form of a jerking, twitching narrative.While the story itself is undistinguished - it's a P.I. book, no more, no less - the main character, Lionel Essrog, has one of the most distinct and memorable voices in contemporary literature. His brain is like another character, a comic genius who always does the unexpected. And it's this character, the Tourettic madman, that makes the story so enjoyable. The fool, the jester, the clown acting up in a mob-run Brooklyn neighborhood, tracking down criminals, and meeting girls.A great summer read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book screams READ ME! Why? Because Lethem is a god! Really! Seriously! No kidding! He creates a world that is dark and moody like a good crime noir. Then he tosses in Lionel, a man prone to ripping apart words, meshing them together, and creating a whole new language. Then he populates it with distinctive characters like Mina and Kimmery. Toss in a little Zen, White Castle hamburgers, and Maine and you have the makings of a fantastic novel. What I loved the most (other than Lionel's narrative) was that it was a detective novel elevated to a contemperary fiction level. When handled deftly by such an artist, it can be magnificant.NOW DO WHAT IT SAYS AND READ IT!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Sorry but i couldn't wait to get this novel over with. I wanted to finish it, and had to force myself till the scattered ending. the book seems to me to have been dramatically overrated and was hard for me to concentrate on. Perhaps it just isn't my cup o' tea. However, like everyone else, it really gave the reader a greater perpective of what it may be like to live in the scattered mind of Tourette's."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"For those of you looking for a great mystery book, this isn't the one. While there is some detective work going on and a murder to be solved, this is just the background to a bigger and better story. Lionel Essrog, the narrator of the story, has suffered with Tourette's Syndrome his whole life. Not that it has been much of a life....when we meet him he is an orphan living in the St. Vincent's Home for Boys in Brooklyn. He and three other orphans become Minna's Boys, running errands for Frank Minna a local crime boss. Essrog's Tourette's tics become endearing to the reader and when he is ticcing off the names of the people in the group and is trying to come up with a total of 6 (his tic number for the day), he is unable to do so. With Frank Minna and the 4 orphans it only adds up to 5. But Lionel hasn't added in the biggest character in the group -- BROOKLYN. Lethem's descriptions of Brooklyn are unparalleled. Everything takes place at the foot of a bridge or in a storefront or at 5AM when the merchants are just waking up. As he's driving over the Pulaski Bridge, I'm right behind him. I'm not sure if someone who isn't familiar with Brooklyn would like this book as much as someone who has strong ties to this borough. Jonathan Lethem describes these orphans as part of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn,&quot; children living in Brooklyn without mothers. I'm sure it's intentional on his part that after finishing this book, the reader gets the feeling that it is Brooklyn who really needs a mother -- it's a city without nurturing or love. It's screaming out not to be motherless any longer."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN was my favorite book of 1999 and I read an average of book and a half a week (give or take). I hope Jonathan Lethem gets every award due him in addition to the National Book Critics Circle award. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The lead character is a fascinating look at Tourettes in the genre of a mystery novel. This is the kind of book you want when you want something with a great character, but you really don't care too much if the plot isn't the strongest."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem has created a sympathetic, intriguing, and wonderfully whimsical alternative to the hard-boiled detective. Lionel Essrog, the tourettic narrator of this short but rich caper is immesenly human, and though most of us will have little in common with his experience or his illness, let alone his predicament in this story, I found a little of myself in all of his foibles and follies.Wonderful, witty, well-crafted. Wobbly, weegly, wear witchess."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is simply one of the best novels I have ever read. It is sweet, exciting, sad, and very funny. I was completely taken by the lead character and his Tourette's -- there are a couple of hilarious scenes I can still recall though I read it at least a year ago. In one, he's being patted down by a cop, and his Tourette's gets the better of him and he starts patting down the cop. &quot;Now stop that!&quot; the cop says. In another, someone puts into his mind the task of deciding by taste in which factories the Oreos in a package were made -- Tourette's is off to the races. And all along, the guy is trying to live a life and find love and do the best he can despite an extremely difficult start in life. I fell in love with Essrog."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is a great book. BUY IT.I can also offer some side advice for specific genre lovers: The mystery side of this is good, but if you are strict mystery buff, this book will be enjoyable but may not knock your socks right off. It stands as a perfectly middle of the road mystery on its own right.Lethem lovers will adore this book for its use of language and odd pace, that moves along in the frame of Lionel, the Touretic hero. This is his strongest book yet, and shows Lethem's true range. If you are a fan of his early work, particularly the harder SF stuff, don't be discouraged-- although less murky and mysterious, this book is so offbeat, the language-warping is so charming, and the protagonist so different, you can't help but be sucked in.Book lovers in general should find this book unusual, but extremely readable. If you are unfamiliar with Lethem, and unsure if this is for you, then at least be aware this is probably your best &quot;entry&quot; to his non-science-fiction works. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Total gibberish, literally and figureativly. How can this book be rated so highly by so many people. the author is so involved in what he thinks is his own genius that half the time I don't understand what the hell he is talking about.

It is up there among my favorites."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This was a great book. I reccommend it to anyone who enjoys a good whodunit, or has an interest in Tourettes syndrome.

I thought I was going to have trouble reading it but I found that reading it (aloud even) just rolled and I felt like a character in the story! Our book group read it and all 8 of us thought it was marvelous. I hear the movie has already been cast!!!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Detective novels aren't usually my favorite genre of books. About one every year or two is usually enough to remind me of the limited plot lines available and usually curbs my appetite for more quite nicely. However, that is not to say that such novels can't be entertaining, engaging and well-written, as is the case with Motherless Brooklyn.By bringing Tourette's Syndrome into the mix, Jonathan Lethem has added a welcome wrinkle to the classic style of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, whose Philip Marlowe is a noted inspiration. The story of Lionel Essrog's life as a small-time Brooklyn mook and his search to find the killer of his mentor and boss is eclipsed by Lionel's Tourettic ticcing and makes the book an extremely enjoyable read. I have no idea whether Lethem has the syndrome pegged perfectly, but he writes Lionel's character very convincingly, with both the humor and the pity Essrog deserves and needs to be the book's true hero. Lionel has a line near the end of the book, &quot;It's a Tourette's thing, you wouldn't understand.&quot; While that may be true at the beginning of the book, Lethem makes us understand, and care, before it's all over.I enjoyed Motherless Brooklyn more than I like most detective novels. Were I any kind of fan of the genre, I'd have given it four stars. I'm just not sure I should have to read about double-crosses, late night stakeouts, car chases and lipsticked women to enjoy the good writing and interesting characters (not because of what they are, but who the are) this book offers."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem did an excellent job with defining his characters and justifies the reason why the main character, Lionel Essrog, would risk his neck to find out who killed his friend, Frank Minna. Motherless Brooklyn was humorous and I found myself charmed by Essrog! The book was rich with information without weighing me down with too many unnecessary details (I've read stories that took an entire page to describe a run down building). The story read smoothly even when the narrator starts one of his &quot;tics&quot;, I couldn't bring myself to skip any pages. The only faults with this book is that it starts off with a bang...continues giving off heat...and then lets me down with a wimper of an ending. From page 263, I grew bored with the so called climax as it lingered for quite a few pages and I wished that the situation didn't resolve in such a dull way. Nevertheless, 85% of the book was just too much fun to allow the last 48 pages to spoil it. I simply loved it!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The narrator, Lionel Essrog, is a character you won't soon forget. I finished the book several months ago and am still thinking about it and about this character. No, it's not much of a detective story, although Lethem does a good job at using those stereotypes, but that's not the point. It's really about getting into Lionel's world and walking around in it for awhile. Fascinating, engrossing, yes, and endearing. You can't help but come to love \\"freakboy.\\"The book is so well-written, it's admirable. Lethem's use of language to both depict Lionel and describe the events is truly brilliant. It's also clever--many of Lionel's seemingly uncontrollable utterances are actually quite meaningful and poignant.Loved it from an emotional level and appreciated it on an intellectual level too--the best of both worlds!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem uses the English language with such adroitness, you will not only read his books, you will live them. &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; is a clever, comical romp with some of the quirkiest characters I've come across in a long time. (If you liked John Kennedy Toole's &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, you'll enjoy this one too)The Tourette's stricken protagonist, the endearing Lionel, is portrayed with such realism that you wonder if Mr. Lethem himself may be obsessive/compulsive to some extent. Lionel's overwhelming need to repeat sounds and touch everything within reach was not only entertaining but educational. I felt true compassion for his his affliction, and a better understanding of those who suffer from it...although I guiltily admit it was hysterical at times! But this was Lethem's objective, and he succeeded well enough to have me laughing alound at least once per chapter. I gave it only 4 stars, because it was slow reading at times..but perhaps that was because I reread some of the more eloquent descriptions of the mundane.Thoroughly entertaining. Well written. A must read! Now, on to the next &quot;Lethem&quot;..."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Jonathan Lethem is a gifted writer. His prose is crisp, a little crazy, and often a lot of fun to read. I was intrigued by his idea of a detective with Tourette's syndrom, which makes him compulsive (actually, a fairly useful trait for a detective) and also given to quirky flights of language. The reviews of the book led me to expect something with the page-turning qualities of a good murder mystery combined with an unusual, and more poetic, use of language than you generally find in genre fiction.The book seemed to live up to that description for the first fifty pages or so, but I seriously question whether many reviewers read the entire novel, because by the middle the plot bogs down, it becomes clear that the characters are never going to develop into anything more complicated than you'd find in a B movie, and the language, at first intriguing, becomes just plain eccentric.Lethem has talent, but he wasted it on this novel."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I, too, was drawn in to the story immediately, charmed by Lionel, impressed with Lethem's wordplay, intrigued by the mystery itself and enjoyed myself for 2/3 of the book.It bogs down when Lethem's homage to Chandler/Hammett/Ross MacDonald becomes more like a Chandler novel and less like life. The dichotomy between the world of this novel and the world of Chanlder give the book its &quot;omph&quot; but when the novel apes the noir masters (updating them, of course, for the PC nineties i.e. instead of the detective being an alcoholic, he has Tourette's; instead of say, a gypsty fortune teller as a front for an opium ring,it's a Buddhist temple as a front for a hifalutin NYC building) it becomes more like a book you've read before.When this book is at it's best, it's funny and sadall at once because it feels true and messy and life-like and very &quot;un-Chandler&quot;. Whenever it crosses the line into the grim world of the Hardboiled, it falters."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"As I'm sure you've heard or read, this book's protagnonist and narrator suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, and his verbal tics seem to require the spontaneous creation of Joycean wordplay.This *sounds* like a recipe for a psuedointellectual disaster of a mystery novel, complete with unnecessary MFA-level artsy flourishes, but Lethem is a very fine writer and he not only makes it work, it works very well indeed.While the plot didn't quite have me on the edge of my seat, the loving, finely drawn characterizations of Lionel, the narrator, and his struggle with the crossed wires in his head, kept me captivated to the very end."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Yet, Jonathan Lethem makes us understand. This is a brilliant work, filled with completely fleshed out characters, a crazy, creative plot, and a murder mystery wrapped in a sense of the absurd. Lionel Essrog is the central character with Tourette's syndrome, and I cannot say enough superlatives about his characterization and dialogue. I found myself thinking about Lionel long after I finished the book; the tics, the words, the creativity, I can't say enough good things about this work. What a great book that balances prose, plot, characters, and originality. This book is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"the book is a wonderful surprise and delightful read. it (or i) kind of had a slow start, i must admit, but somewhere along the 2nd chapter it began to take off--and never came back down again. lethem's use of language is precise while beguilingly casual, much of the imagery simply brilliant, and the chapters' titles perfectly echoing their content and making even greater impact when you've read them through. and he captures the world of lionel's (that's the main character and the narrator) tourette's in such fine and imaginative details that it in turn captures our imagination. among other things, i'll never listen to prince's &quot;kiss&quot; (or look at a don martin cartoon) again without thinking of lionel's interpretation of it... although the whole book relates mainly what happened in only 3 days, the plot develops quickly, full of scenes and twists with more than a touch of dark comicality. with exception perhaps for the last chapter (which i think is a little bit weak, especially compared to the preceeding &amp; so powerfully written ones), i've enjoyed most of the book immensely, and would gladly recommend this richly original novel."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is an usual book, well worth reading, very innovative, and lots of fun. The story concerns Lionel Essrog, an orphan taken in by a low-level Mafia type. Essrog suffers from Tourett's disease, which causes him to have verbal tics and engage in compulsive behavior. The Mafia guy, a father figure, employs Essrog and his orphan buddies as private eyes, but when the Mafia guy is killed, Essrog takes on his first serious case: finding who murdered his best friend.So far, so good. We have a classic genre opening, and a fine literary twist. A P.I. with Tourett's may seem absurd, and I found it a bit over-the-top when I started reading, but it actually makes more and more sense as the plot unfolds. And ultimately, the Tourett's element is the creative heart of this very entertaining novel and precisely what makes it so much fun. The bits that have nothing to do with the mystery plot (most notably Essrog's recollections of his childhood and early involvement with his Mafia patron) prove to be the most absorbing and moving sequences. The narrator's verbal tics are relentlessly clever, and quite frequently hilarious. As a literary novel, then, the book is entirely successful and a wonderful read.It loses a star (really a half star, but Amazon doesn't allow for that nuance) for the mystery element, which I found undercooked. I never really cared who did it, and I never really cared about the mystery itself. What makes this book remarkable is the fact that I didn't especially care that I didn't care. The writing and characters, especially Essrog, were enough to keep me turning the pages."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Excuse the above. Couldn't hold it in any longer...&quot;Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step onto the page and burden you with his actual existence?&quot; Lionel Essrog, the narrator, asks about a third of the way through this book. Up to that point, it was reasonable to assume that Lethem would play his detective story straight. But this question ups the ante a touch. It was at this point that I worried Lethem would take the path worn by Paul Auster (see his brilliant 'New York Trilogy') where the elements of the hard-boiled detective novel would be used purely for the sake of post-modernism. Auster's detectives never solve their crimes, and frankly, it doesn't matter. His ideas are bountiful enough for the reader to hold on to. Lethem, on the other hand, needs his narrative resolution. His ideas aren't in Auster's league. Sure, he sprinkles some Zen Buddhism over here, and questions of identity over there, and his main character has a disease that borders on the stream of consciousness style that contemporary literati find so intriguing (I don't). But they just don't have the same weight. Thankfully -- and I worry here that I'm giving away too much of the ending -- he follows the genre's conventions just enough to keep the reader happy.There's a great line near the middle of the book, when a patron in a restaurant, complaining of Lionel's use of a cell phone in a public place, says: &quot;people talking to themselves in a public place like they got some kind of illness!&quot; Lionel, narrator and protagonist, is a wonderful creation. His Tourette's Syndrome, which at first came off as a hackneyed device, actually serves to elevate the entire book. It was wonderful to hear the series of Tourettic thoughts going through his head, and what the final culmination of those thoughts were when they would eventually escape through his mouth. I often thought that if the people he was speaking too were any brighter, then Lionel's cover would be consistently blown because you always knew what his hidden thoughts were. Luckily, the &quot;Minna Men&quot; he hung with were as low rent as the detective agency they worked for.Lethem does a good job creating his world, his seedy little section of Brooklyn (and its outskirts, and even a sidetrip to Maine) for his characters to roam around in. The details seem just right, if a little self-conscious at times (a minor character is named &quot;Welcome&quot;, a byproduct of her hippie parents but really of no use to the story). He takes the classic detective genre, and adds elements from the '90's to make it more relevant (like a &quot;soundtrack&quot; peppered with Funkadelic, Boyz II Men, and most tellingly, Prince). And you've got to admire an author who has the confidence to begin a chapter: &quot;There once was a girl from Nantucket. No, really, that's where she was from.&quot;"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"While this book has many features with which to recommend it, the true beauty lies in the dichotomy between Lionel's interior world (the first person narrative) and his inability to communicate witht he world around him (the dialogue.) Letham writes wonderfully, and this book contains some of the most awe-inspiring sentences I've ever read. A real stunner for lovers of the written word (and crime fiction too.)"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I loved Jonathan Lethem's writing, full of great turns of phrase and lots of imagery. The odd, painful yet often comic symptoms of Tourette Syndrome made for a fascinating and rich character, Lionel Essrog. The great writing and interesting character and plot developments assured that Tourette's did not just play as a gimmick in this novel . I not only enjoyed the murder mystery itself and the flavor of New York city and small-time wise guys but the language and essence of the characters kept me involved from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Right from the first few paragraphs this book drew me into another world. I was afraid that Letham's New York story would be full of cliches, but that is definitely not the case here because it's told through the filter of its Tourette's Syndrome hero - an unforgettable guy who is funny, charming and smart, dealing with way more than you think he can handle. Letham never goes beyond the possible though, and leaves you feeling that if you traveled to this Brooklyn neighborhood, you might actually meet his characters on the street. A very memorable and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"At first glance should this book be this good? The story is not that complex compared to many other mysteries and the main revelation is not earthshaking. Yet it is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of opening. The reason it is such a wonderful read is that all of the characters are deeply textured and wonderfully written. The Obsessive Compulsive/Turetts smitten protagonist is the ultimate loser hero. From page one you want to root for him. The superb back story gives you a perfect understanding of the personalities of everyone in the novel and the dialog is both hilarious and credible. Quirky had no definition until this book came out. But the keeper for me was the wonderful picture of NY painted with Lethem's wonderfully adroit brush. I grew up in the Bronx and have lived here for 18 years and no single writter has captured the pulse of not just Manhattan but the boroughs as well as Lethem. The time has come, Elmore Leonard has met his match."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I am extremely lucky to have received an advanced copy of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;. It has thus far been the best book I have read this summer. Lethem combines the two virtues of being the most readable and most imaginative American writer of his generation. His latest reads like his debut &quot;Gun w/ Occasional Music&quot; stripped of the surreal elements (ie. no talking kangaroos or 'babyheads') but still retaining the awesome prose and mindbending twists. Lethem really puts you in to the mind of a thirty-something wiseguy suffering from Torrette's who happens to be a lot smarter than anyone realizes. If you have ever wondered how a Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett novel would read if Haruki Murakami did the editing, then you really need this book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I was given this book as a gift from a friend and it was every bit as good and as forward-looking as she said.It is told from the perspective of an obviously intelligent yet oh-so-socially-compromised lead character, Lionel Essrog, who is \\"raised\\" by a member of the mob out of an orphanage in Brooklyn, and who suffers from pronounced Tourette's syndrome. The plot is a simplistic gotta-find-my-benefactor's-killer-before-I-rest, but its own level of obsession serves as a tool to mirror the compulsive nature of Lionel's syndrome, in turn creating a stronger, more identifiable lead character to boot.This book was not only fun to read but a learning experience as well as it delves deep into Lionel's internal chatter and describes the feelings and idiosyncracies that are attached to his syndrome, and suffice it to say the languaging used by author Lethem opened up a few new grooves in my brain that were previously untapped.It takes something that moves in an entirely different direction to get me to believe that it is anything new, but Motherless Brooklyn is the real deal."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I have to admire authors who refuse to repeat themselves from novel to novel. The style might be recognizably the same but they tackle different subjects each time out, approaching them from different angles. While some of Lethem's other novels tend to have a more science-fictional aspect to them, or at least a shard of the fantastic, this one is set in the gritty real-life locale of Brooklyn, New York. But it's not all hard bitten mobsters and tough men with gritted teeth and smoking guns. Our protagonist here, and narrator, is Lionel, a man who works for small time hood Frank Minna, who rescued him and his three partners from the same orphanage twenty years before. Early on, Minna gets stabbed to death and out of curiousity and a desire to see the killer of a man who was decent to him brought to justice, he takes the case, becoming a bit of a detective. Sounds routine? Lethem tweaks things a bit by giving Lionel Tourette's Syndrome, leaving the man a mass of twiching compulsions, shouting odd things at inappropriate times. Is it a gimmick? Sure, but he plays it straight, not playing the man for laughs or even for sympathy, the syndrome is what he has and there's nothing he can do about it. So he and everyone else just kind of goes with it. But it gives the novel a strange, subtle rhythm, since Lionel is the narrator, his tics seem to leak into the narrative itself, so it twitches and glides it way down the streets of Brooklyn, past Zen houses and old mobsters, as he tries to find the killer. It can said that the mystery aspect of the story is probably the least interesting part of it, since it's not real easy to solve from the clues that are given in the novel itself, but I don't think that's the point here. The best detective novels, as opposed to mysteries, had a certain feel and swagger to them. The Marlowe novels, while out to piece a crime together, were also about creating a noir feel, of grey areas and tough choices, of guys who spoke in clipped sentences, if they even bothered to talk to you at all before hitting you with a blackjack. It's not like the mystery in The Big Sleep made any sense to Chandler, and he wrote the book. And Lethem does capture the feel of New York City, at least the Brooklyn portion of it, how it felt back in the day, when the orphans first encounter Minna, and its present-day feel, the little people scurrying to make a living, legally or otherwise, in the shadows of people who could crush them if they bothered to notice what they were doing. Lionel tries to puzzle it all out, in twitches and fits and tics, finding clues within clues, but the solution itself isn't as important as how we get there. He takes people who could be cliches and makes them, if not totally real, at least a little more realistic. Which in itself, is hard enough."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"\\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" starts off with a bang, as the narrator Lionel Essrog desperately tries to trail his boss, Frank Minna, a small-time Brooklyn hood, when he is strong-armed into a car and driven across the city. The action is relentless, but then Lethem turns around and develops Essrog's back story: a man with Tourette's, prone to inappropriate barks and touching, a sensitive, stranded orphan who is \\"adopted\\" by Minna for some low-cost labor. The orphans become the \\"Minna Men,\\" and the tic-ridden Essrog strangely becomes the man who must find his boss' killer.Maybe \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" isn't as plot-oriented as the stalwarts of the genre, but I love how Lethem paints Brooklyn through Essrog's eyes, accurately rendering his symptoms and syndrome without undue interference in the story itself. Lethem is juggling a lot of elements here, from the open questions of the plot to Essrog and the other characters, and pulls it all off with panache.This is the best book by Lethem I've come across, and I highly recommend it for those new to his work."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It takes some time and energy to get started with Jonathan Lethem's \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\". It is not an easy book -- at least in the first few pages. Once the reader gets the hang of it, the reading becomes less complicated -- but never really easy. This is one of the best pleasures this detective novel can give to an avid reader.Not only is \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" a mind bending work with its twist and language, but it is also a genre bending narrative. Think of the classic noir narrative done in first person -- add to it a late Twentieth Century pop culture and the Tourette's Syndrome tics and you may have a slight idea of what the book is about. From all of it, what surfaces is Lethem's sensibility to build a main character, namely Lionel Essrog, who is not only believable but also sympathetic.He is the narrator and belongs to a group of detectives known as Minna Men, former orphans, which were taken under Frank Minna's wings. But early in the novel, their protector is brutally murdered and in a course of a couple of days, Lionel will try to find the killer.As all good detective novels, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" is a roller coaster of twists and unpredictability. Near the end readers may start trying to recap with the is-this-really-it feeling. This is not a flaw in the book, but another hook. As is common in the genre both narrator and reader are deceived. The former may not like it, but readers certainly find more pleasure when they cannot guess what is going to happen. And this novel has plenty of surprises.With a less brilliant writer, \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" would have been an unreadable mess. Lionel's tics would have been pathetic and unreal -- but Lethem seems to love his creation and that gives the character human dimensions that are very beautiful and appreciated throughout the reading. This is one of those books that remind us that living is not easy."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This novel is something of a departure for Lethem, all of whose previous work has been experimental and occasionally bizarre in structure, theme, and characterization. It's nearly a traditional straight narrative -- and a good one, too. Four somewhat inept orphans from St. Vincent's Home for Boys in Brooklyn -- the \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" of the title -- are taken under the wing of Frank Minna, local fixer and small-time hood, who becomes the center of their universe. And fifteen years later, the \\"Minna Men\\" are still in thrall, carrying out shady errands under cover of being operatives of a detective agency. One of the four is Lionel Esrog, the narrator, who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. His uncontrollable outbursts and tics are tolerated by his peers and by his acquaintances in the neighborhood from long habit, but everyone seems to equate his behaviors with a lack of intelligence. Lionel, mostly self-educated and far from stupid, is in fact a very perceptive and self-aware person. Then Frank is murdered almost under Lionel's nose and he must try to find the killer and exact vengeance while struggling to control his Tourette's. His quest through the web of unexpected relationships and parts of Brooklyn he never knew make for a riveting story. But the real star here is Lionel's own interior self, his painfully developed coping skills, his constant self-observation. Lethem is always masterful in his use of the English language but he excels in letting Lionel's syndrome reveal his thoughts. This is a highly original author's most mature work to date."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem has more than a way with words, as many reviews state, because he has a way with plot, character, and theme as well. Lionel Essrog, his main character, has Tourette's Syndrome, but it's not a gimmick ... it's an integral characteristic of an interesting man.As Lionel attempts to unravel the central mystery, it becomes clear that he is more than he appears, both to the readers and the people around him. I came to like him very much, and better, I came to understand him. There is no higher praise to an author than that he opened a new world to his readers, and Motherless Brooklyn is one of those rare books that does just that.Lethem has gotten rave reviews for his new novel, Fortress of Solitude, but you should start here. Now that he's getting recognition, Lethem will be a literary force for the near future."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem did a masterful job writing this book. The reader is really able to enter the mind of the main character, who has Tourette's, and identify with him.While a good read, its not perfect. I never felt compelled by the mystery of \\"who dunnit\\" in the book. It felt more like a brief character study of Lionel, which was a good thing, but never felt the suspense the author tried to create about who murdered his friend.The verdict: definitely worth reading, recommended. I have bought three other books by the same author since I read this one, and there is no higher vote of confidence than that."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"the place, the characters are all clear.

This is certainly movie material, but must be treated by the Author himself to bring the realism of this story to screen."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I've been meaning to read something by Jonathan Lethem for a while so when a reading companion thrust Motherless Brooklyn into my hands, I knew it was meant to be.I first opened this book at around 3 in the morning one night, after finishing up a book that I didn't particularly care for (and drinking several tumblers of whiskey). I intended to just read a few pages and call it a night. 25 pages later, I was captivated by the book and had to force myself to crawl into bed.I've heard Lethem described as a unique voice and if this book is anything to go by, that's certainly true. There was quite a motley cast of characters and I was introduced to many memorable fictional folks that I won't soon be forgetting. Most notable, of course, is the protagonist, one Lionel Essrog, who witnesses the murder of his boss / mentor / father figure within the first 10 pages of the book. He spends our remaining time together trying to track down the killer, all while ridiculous hijinks ensue.When I discovered a few pages in that Essrog has Tourette's, I was a little concerned about how that would be handled. I'm not one who finds it particularly funny to ridicule or sensationalize the disorder of another. My concern was mostly that Mr. Lethem would use Essrog's disorder as a punchline and would simplify his condition into some stupid cliche. Luckily, I was wrong, and while there were plenty of humorous situations that came as a result of his disorder, it did not define him and I felt it was handled in an honest way.While I did very much enjoy this book and found it to be a fun and fast read, it fell short of being excellent because I never felt completely immersed in the lives of the motherless in Brooklyn, nor was I particularly moved or touched by some of the more emotional scenes.I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in a unique spin on the classic detective novel and someone who doesn't require an emotional connection in order to love a book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Motherless Brooklyn, is a 1st person narrative in which the protagonist suffers from Tourette syndrome. When Lionel Essrog's (the main character) boss and mentor Frank Minna is murdered, Lionel goes on an adventure trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of who killed Minna. Throughout the play you are trapped inside Lionel's head. Not only face problems from the external environment, but also internally. The reader is presented with vivid descriptions of scenarios that interconnect with Lionel's struggle with Tourette Syndrome.The plot of the novel is subpar compared to the ever engaging 1st person view of Lionel Essrog. His descriptions of Brooklyn, to his regular jobs under Frank Minna. Lionel Essrog portrays Brooklyn in a safe haven, a home, a shelter that eventually he must leave to seek the truth behind his boss' killing. Jonathan Lethem style of writing greatly complements Lionel's personal issues. This is an interesting read, that may capture you due to the style of writing and Lionel Essrog's personal problems."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a brilliant author. The main character has Tourette's syndrome, the story told from his point of view. The writing reflects this in more than meets the eye at first. Four orphans from a local home work for Frank Minna, a small-time gangster, and they mature under his influence. Readers with no experience with the condition will learn quite a bit about Tourette's. The story is realistic with wonderful details. It's about city kids learning more than they already know about the streets, learning to be something more than they thought they could be, becoming adults and trusting in things unseen, trusting in each other, and what happens to them along the way. It's about how other people affect our lives.I'd suggest reading anything by this author, which I will now do myself.This book is a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Seller said it was like new and it was! He had a protective book cover as well as wrapped in plastic. The person who I gave it to for Christmas loved it! thanks!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The novel \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" by Jonathan Lethem is both familiar and original. Lethem took a familiar genre, a traditional detective novel, and added an unlikely twist - the protagonist of this novel, Lionel Essrog, has Tourette syndrome. The result is an unusual and original book that has won numerous awards.Lionel fancies himself a detective and, when his boss Frank Minna is murdered, Essrog is determined to discover who killed him. This part of the story is a rather predictable hard boiled who-done-it. Add to that the fact that Lionel has Tourette's and the book takes on a new dimension.Lethem effortlessly pulls the reader into Lionel's world, which is haunting. Lionel has tics, both physical and vocal. His vocal tics are often shouted profanity. Other times he conjoins words or parts of words, creating sounds that burst out of him. The result is unsettling, though at times the word combinations are humorous.Reading this novel, the detective story faded as I focused on Lionel's life with Tourette syndrome. I'm not sure if that was the effect that Lethem hoped to achieve, but it's probably the reason this book won awards. Regardless, it's an interesting book and the character Lionel is especially intriguing."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In his treatise On Writing, Stephen King says the spark for many of the best novels is when a writer combines two or more disparate ideas/topics/themes and then figures out how they can complement each other in interesting or unexpected ways. Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn is one of the best examples you'll ever find of this theory in action.To explain why, let's try to follow (an absurdly abbreviated version of) what must've been Lethem's thought process before actually sitting down to write: \\"What I want to write is a literary detective novel that pays tribute to the masters like Raymond Chandler. I like that. But I need something more. What if one of the characters has Tourette's Syndrome? Yeah, that'll add intrigue. But he can't be a punchline, he has to be sympathetic. And his relationship with language is how I'll make him sympathetic. Boom, novel.\\"Then, he sat down to write, and the book he produced (in 1999) won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction, turned out to be one of the most-read novels of the aughts, and is often cited as a favorite novel of all time.The plot is pretty simple: Gangster Frank Minna is murdered, and the four wise guys he's nurtured since orphan-hood (Tourrette's-afflicted Lionel Essrog being one of them) try to find out who killed him and why. Lionel tells us the the story in first person, as he wanders around New York City and then coastal Maine looking for clues and doing his best to manage his disease.In my mind, Motherless Brooklyn succeeds spectacularly for two reasons: 1) The novel is incredibly inventive, and avoids cliche, when cliche would've been easy, and 2) It's very clear how much fun Lethem must've had writing this novel, which makes it fun to read.First, how easy would it have been to make Lionel and his Tourette's a silly source of comic relief? Instead, Lethem uses Lionel's Tourette's in an unexpected way: He uses the disease to show us how intricate and clever language can be. Lionel must use the \\"wall of langauge\\" as a way to protect himself from his disease-addled brain's attempts to destroy him. For Lionel, language isn't what sets him apart from what's normal, it's what helps him be normal himself. If he didn't have language, even nonsensical strings of language, as an outlet to oppose his other physical tics, his disease would get the better of him, rendering him useless. This is part of Lethem's trick to make Lionel a sympathetic and incredibly self-aware character, as opposed to a source of cheap laughs. He also has Lionel continuously explain Tourette's to us so that we not only understand it (see below for an amazingly written passage explaining Tourette's), but we also understand how his unconventional thinking is actually helping him solve the mystery.Secondly, if we understand #1, then we can also understand that when Lethem has Lionel let loose with a string of language (Franksbook! forkspook! finksblood, i.e.), the effect is not meant to be comic relief. It's just Lionel being Lionel. But, those Tourette's word explosions (ghostradish! pepperpony! kaiserphone!), which appear frequently, sure had to be helluva lot of fun to write! If Lethem wants to be funny, he'll have his characters tell a joke, use a pun (i.e., soon after Frank's dead: \\"my mourning brain had decided renaming itself was the evening's assignment\\"), or toss in a word like \\"chucklehead\\" -- which cracked me up every time. It wasn't until about two-thirds of the way through the novel when this notion of how much fun the novel had to be to write dawned on me. And that's the moment the novel really clicked for me. Lethem's not showing off or being superfluous, he's having a blast! And therefore, as a reader, you can't help but have a blast also."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Outstanding book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of quirky literature. It is a great murder mystery. It is a great illustration of a man living with Tourette syndrome. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog must rank as one of the most original narrators of a novel in contemporary fiction. He deals in good faith with his Tourette's syndrome, gently educating us, amid the harsh and brutal reality of Brooklyn. Essrog is a kind of existential orphan in a motherless city. He is consumed with finding order, patterns, balance, symmetry and controlling urges to scream his innermost sensibilities in public. His friends call him &quot;Freak Show&quot; and yet he has one of the most endearing narrative voices in modern fiction -- gentle, highly intelligent, vulnerable and humane, like Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five. Essrog rides through New York's subways noting how they offer a structure and canvass for irrepressible, subterranean human expressions like his. The protagonist seeks and finds the hidden gems of beauty that lie well hidden in the harsh starkness of the city. The characters like the city are original and real with freakish overtones which stop short of stereotypes. The novel is steeped in the language, street culture and underground economy that is Brooklyn. The plot is entertaining, the dialogue is authentic and the octopus joke is hilarious. The author does a great job weaving an intricate plot structure of apparently unconnected forces that come together naturally and masterfully. The word play through Essrog's Tourettic sensibilities were lyrical, poetic and even Joycean in places. I really enjoyed this novel's gritty urban realism and its flashes of real comic wit from a highly talented and inventive writer. This is a great piece of contemporary literature that's a genuine pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"While As She Climbed Across the Table kept Lethem pigeonholed as a science fiction writer, Motherless Brooklyn, his latest outing, has proven to critics and bookstore owners what Lethem fans have known for a long time - he belongs on the literature shelf. Motherless Brooklyn is, for many people, Lethem's first &quot;real&quot; book because it deals with real-life situations. However, a true Lethem reader will find a common thread, a singular voice that has been around since he wrote Gun with Occasional Music."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Motherless Brooklyn has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. Not only does it have a great plot, but the sheer depth of the characters is astounding. The main character Lionel Essrog is so vivid and real that you feel like you could practically reach out and touch him. A beautiful, moving portrait of a man with tourettes, in a world full of crime and conspiracy. What an amazing achievemnt!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is the quintessential American detective novel and, therefore, reveals itself like an Odyssey epic. A pageant of life passes before the sleuth and the audience in dubious sounds, sights, and motives. Anyone who loved the oddball humor and pathos of the NBC drama &quot;Homicide&quot; will definitely feel at home in this tale of Lionel Essrog, a detective with Tourette's syndrome on the trail of a murderer.There's a gimmicky Raymond Chandler language at play in the novel. Detectives are referred to as the Minna Men, &quot;tugging the boat&quot; is pushing your luck, and &quot;telling your story walking&quot; is the preferred method of succinctly putting words to work.Dostoevsky's Idiot also resonates throughout the novel. The ridiculed simpleton is drawn into a world that deems him a lightweight . Nevertheless, he gains access and becomes the figure who knows the score better than its original players.Lethem's writing is crazy-grin-and-laugh-out-loud funny, unsentimentally poignant, and hugely rewarding. He gets maximum effect out of his central character, and there's nothing lost in the translation of Tourette's syndrome to the reader."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Unlike typical mysteries, you'll want to read this one slowly. The mystery itself is a lot less interesting than the characters and relationships. A rich, fascinating book. This is the first Lethem book I've read -- I can't wait to read his others."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Kudos to Lethem for creating Lionel, one of the most captivating and provocative narrators to hit the shelves in a long time.Part of Lethem's genius is to allow Lionel to be more than a one-trick pony--Lionel's struggle with his Tourettic self is less a punchline than an insightful exploration of a debilitating condition that informs both Lionel's view of the world, and his unique position in it.One part mystery and two parts memoir, Motherless Brooklyn is filled with memorable one-liners and anecdotes conveyed with the frenetic energy that radiates from its narrator. With his unlikely hero, Lethem puts a new spin on the hardboiled detectives of old."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"My partial review rated 5 stars as does my final review. Lionel Essrog has become one of my most favorite characters. A detective/driver with Tourette's made me love him til my heart ached and laugh so hard my stomach ached. I was glad my neighbors were away for Thanksgiving weekend... they might have called the comic police! Lionel has to crawl out of his little comfort zone of those who grew up with him in the orphanage. His mentor has been murdered, and Lionel wants to solve this case. Because of his Tourette's syndrome, his acquaintances look down on him. He must prove his worth. Enter a giant, Zendo, a brother, Julia, and the usual suspects. If you don't laugh hysterically during some of his echolalia, you might need to get a sense of humor. If you don't shed a tear about his pathetic love life, put yourself in his shoes...miscues...fish news. Yikes! I've become him. By the way, Edward Norton has procured the rights to this book and from what I hear will play Lionel in the movie. A great actor playing a great character!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I've been a fan of Lethem's writing since I found a hardback copy of Amnesia Moon in a clearance catalog for a few dollars. I devoured it on a long bus ride, then sped through Gun, With Occassional Music, As She Climbed Across the Table, Girl In Landscape, his short story collection, and all of his other stories, like those in The Best of Crank! and Starlight 2 and the new novella with Kessel and Kelly in F&amp;SF. I can say, unequivocally, that Motherless Brooklyn is his finest work. When I saw the blurb &quot;This novel marks the coming of age of a major American writer.&quot; I was offended, as if his sf was the stuff of juveniles. But the statement is completely valid. The strength of characterization, the twisting and twisted plot, and the poetry of the prose, this novel is practically head and shoulders above everything he has ever written. Which gets me worried-please Jonathan, if you read this, don't abandon science fiction! If Lethem applies these talents to his sf in the future, he will become known as one of the great science fiction writers of the next century."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog's voice sank so deep into the farther reaches of my synapses that I found my brain reeling in Tourettic fever from it. I had to slow down reading, because the end was coming too quickly. The story, the characters, everything, had a satisfying, true resonance. This book goes beyond Lethem's others, which says a lot. It's a home run."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I've read all of Lethem's books so far, so I was very excited when I received an advance copy of this. It is, at once, his most serious and humorous novel yet. It seems well-grounded in research and still manages to convey emotion in an impressive manner. It is strange that his last book (Girl in Landscape- the most easy of his novels to categorize as sci fi.) is followed by this one. There is no hint of science fiction at all. This shouldn't scare his fans away, though. The book is still packed with interesting verbiage and ideas. This is the best book I've read in two years."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Otherwise, I would just give it two or three stars. But if Lethem does not have Tourette's, he still does an unbelievably authentic job of giving us its quirks - especially the stuttering, bizarre free association wordplay - in an eccentric and likeable character. I wish there had been another character I wanted to root for, however.The detective storyline is pretty standard. What distinguishes it is its main character whose disorder threatens to defeat his attempts to solve a murder case at every turn. This may not be enough to keep some readers' interests, but if you're interested in psychological twists, this one is as impressive as any I've come across. I only wish the same originality had been given to the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I felt a little sorry for one of the main characters in this book. It's a clear reminder that the friendships we choose are the foundation of our progress. It is also an interesting NYC area (Brooklyn) psychological character study. The plot did not really capture me like other books I have read that have won Book Awards. It did make for some good reading and some very well-written &amp; unforgettable lines. A recent college graduate raved about the book which made me curious. His excitement was a bit overdone as far as I was concerned because the story sort of fell flat with me. The book did succeed in keeping me awake (through a plane ride). One line I took away was, &quot;Don't tug my boat!&quot;"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"As a psychiatrist I thoroughly enjoyed reading 'Motherless Brooklyn'. The plot was somewhat mundane but the portrayal of Lionel's Tourette syndrome was more than just a case study. Lionel was a well drawn and loveable character. His Tourette symptoms became alive. Having friends who live in Brooklyn Heights also added to the familiarity of this novel. I have to pick a selection for my book club next month. Having read a number of excellent books over the summer (I'm mostly retired), it was a tough choice, but Lethem's crisp and easily read writing won out. I think most readers would really enjoy the humor and the unusual state of the protagonist."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I just want to put my arms around Lionel and hope that he taps my forehead and my shoulder while yelling &quot;Yipke, yipke&quot; in my ear. Probably one of the most interesting and endearing characters I have had occasion to meet in a book. Two other Lethem books have resided unread on my bookshelves. They will be my next 2 reads after this one. Will finish review when I am done... probably tomorrow."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"My friend Matt gave me this book this summer, and after I read it I realised that this was the second book I've read by Jonathan Lethem, who also wrote the incredibly strange This Shape We're In. This story is about a young man, part of a team of four \\"detectives\\", all orphans, who do work for the Brooklyn hustler who took them out of the orphanage. The narrator, Lionel Essrog, also suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, the condition of tics and verbal outbursts, which people in his vicinity either understand or don't. When his boss is murdered, he goes on the case to try to find the murderer; the murderer is obvious, so the story is more about finding out why he was murdered. But even more, the story is about Lionel, and understanding how he lives, how he controls his tics, and what kind of a future he has waiting for him. Orphans with Tourettes probably have a hard lot in life, and since Lionel is probably also the world's worst detective he doesn't have much going for him there either. He doesn't really do anything, he stumbles onto the story somewhat haphazardly, and hardly gets any information out of anybody.The book wasn't supremely satisfying, but nonetheless well-written. And although the story is a bit of a non-story, the way it is told and the way the story unfolds is good writing. It's certainly more straight forward than This Shape We're In."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"There's no reason for me not to like Jonathan Lethem better than I do. He's a clever, thoughtful and inventive writer capable of developing interesting, unique and textured characters. And yet...Motherless Brooklyn is, in its way, an excellent and classically-inspired detective novel. Our hero is sympathetically flawed - afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome, but not in a way that's played solely for comic effect - and he's surrounded by an interesting (if under-utilized) cast of Brooklyn characters and odd miscreants. The plot develops nicely, the pacing seems right, the resolution is ultimately satisfying. And yet...Something about Lethem's style always keeps his worlds at a distance too far. Just as with Fortress of Solitude, I find myself unable to get lost in the story and, too often, unable to care that much. Intellectually, I enjoy his work as much as I dislike, say, Annie Proulx, but viscerally I find myself suffering the same disconnect with both. Both seem inhabited by a foggy lethargy that lies somewhere between the writing and the experience."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book is about a bunch of low-life losers who follow another low-life loser and, by the way, solve a mystery. The main character is Lionel Essrog, an orphan who has never had a family (motherless) and never been out of his own little world (Brooklyn), yet is a likeable character who spits out profanities at inappropriate times due to his Tourette's Sydrome.A delightful book with engaging characters. The mystery is more of a subplot to the character study of Essrog and his loser friends."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"By creating a narrator/ protagonist who suffers from Tourette's Lethem certainly took a bold and unique approach in this story of a group of Brooklyn orphans who are recruited by a local shady character to do a variety of 'jobs\\". Lionel Essrog narrates the story and his inner dialogue as he struggles with his condition allows the author to introduce some remarkable word play that is really the best this book has to offer.The novel's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness.The plot involving a group of local Brooklyn street hoods playing at being detectives engages the reader at the start but slows to a crawl about halfway through.What kept me reading was the continued musings of the narration but ultimately the other characters are not truly fleshed out , the plot is somewhat thin and Motherless Brooklyn becomes a one man show. While that man is entertaining at times, its not enough to sustain the book for the full length."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Appreciated greatly the author's ability to put the reader in the mind of Lionel who had Tourette's Syndrome. Similarly his descriptions of the Brooklyn neighborhood came alive. I laughed and was saddened in several passages. This was easily a 5-rate. However, the plot was far-fetched as one waded toward the end of the book and not believable and this was disappointing and would lead me to not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lethem uses the English language in very unusual, and yet workable, ways. His unique take on the detective genre may yet inspire others."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"it's a little misleading to call mr. lethem a &quot;science fiction&quot; author, or author of detective novels. he morphs literary genre in a way that can be found nowhere, and i mean nowhere else in american fiction. he wrote a western disguised as a science fiction novel, for heaven's sake. Motherless Brooklyn is the rarest of books--a rippingly good tale, a look at us at the millenium through the eyes of the most god-awful wonderful character i can remember since, well, since i don't know when. an orphan who touches the motherlessness in all of us. lionel's tourettic verbal bombasts are the loving work of a novelist in love with our language, celebrating our culture, warts and all. Mr. Lethem will dazzle you. you'll understand what holden caulfield meant when he said that you'd like to call up a writer after reading an extraordinary book and just shoot the bull. Yes, it is a detective story; yes, it is a coming-of-age story; yes, it is a spiritual mystery; yes, it is what silly, sensitive wannabees like myself thrust at you, looking for that deep, silly, sensitive spot in your eyes, saying with eyes a-mist, &quot;read this, it's a masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem's National Book Critics Circle Award winning &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (MB) is both detective thriller and serious novel. It is also curiously cinematic and hence likely that some big movie studio will soon buy the rights to exploit to the full the &quot;noir-ish&quot; qualities of this eminently filmable thriller. All the elements you'd expect of a book of this genre are there - shady underground characters ranging from gangster bossmen to their threatening sidekicks, from the ambitious boss wannabee who tries too hard to the inevitable femme fatale who mysteriously disappears, etc, etc. The plot is chock full of suspense and never less than rivetting but these aren't what make MB special. The magic lies in Lethem's boldly inventive but risky way with language. That takes some courage but it works because the scatty prose pulsates to Essrog's Tourettish tics. Frank Minna and his boys may put him down and call him &quot;freakshow&quot; to his face but it's still Lionel Essrog, the underdog, who delivers and we hear ourselves rooting for him. Believe the hype. MB makes an incredibly gripping read and deserves all the praise heaped on it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"It seems very difficult to review this book within the constraints of Amazon's five star parameters. This is a wonderful story on many levels. Lethem not only created an entertaining and atmospheric mystery, he also envisioned a primary character whose Tourettic impulses perfectly match the pace and tone of the story. Lionel's frequent outbursts and irresistible urges do not exist merely as painful comic relief, they also reflect the thought processes that most people(both fictional and otherwise) naturally supress. In the hands of another writer, this may have come across as gimmicky or contrived. However, Lethem demonstrates his talent in a keenly subtle manner that provides a perfect balance between the important elements of an intriguing story.I had enjoyed his earlier book, &quot;Girl In Landscape&quot;, though their styles are remarkably different. With &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, he has seamlessly bridged several genres and produced a great novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I believe I read in Variety that the rights were sold to the movies for Motherless Brooklyn. I'm happy for the author but what makes this book tick is its love of language and its affection for the narrator Lionel. I'm not sure a screenwriter could succeed in getting us inside Lionel's head as well as Lethem. There's much suspense in this novel as well, which is why it would appeal to Hollywood, but ultimately what kept me going was the thorough believability of Lionel. One of the few new novels I wanted to read again right away (Evening by Susan Minot was another). This is my first taste of Lethem and it can't wait to sample more."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Motherless Brooklyn is Johnathan Lethem's homage to/parody of the hard-boiled detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, with a twist: the novel's protagonist, Lionel Essrog (what a great name!), has Tourette's syndrome. Lionel's Tourette's causes him to, among other things, bark like a dog, compulsively pat other people on the shoulder, and spout out nonsensical phrases, an example of which gives this review its title (another favorite of mine is &quot;Lancelot ancillary oscillope!&quot;).I'm not sure what to say about Motherless Brooklyn, except I can't remember the last time I had this much fun reading a novel. Someone apparently forgot to tell Mr. Lethem that &quot;serious fiction&quot; isn't supposed to be entertaining and funny. Here's hoping no one ever does."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Why is Motherless Brooklyn hailed as such a great book? I suppose it is because the story is told so effortlessly - Letham is a natural storyteller - and the narrator of the story is a true original. It is a fun read - I defie anyone to not be entertained by this book and see it through to the end. But when examined on it's own, this is not the piece of modern literature it is held up to be. It's only when held in the context of Letham's other works that you can make those judgements. I don't believe this is any way to judge a book and so for me, it falls far short of being a serious work. I know there are people that will say that I'm 'not getting it' but personally I don't think there's much here to get. In the end the story reads like the storyline of a weekly TV comedy/drama - if ever there was a book begging a TV series adaptation it's this one. Sure it's fun, but so is Buffy The Vampire Slayer and to be honest this story is a little closer to Murder She Wrote. Wait for the paperback and take it on holiday."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I went to my local library to borrow this book and was disappointed to see that approx. 100 people were on the waiting list before me. At the same time, I was impressed by the book's popularity and decided that I must read it immediately. I must admit that the book was a let down. I found the characters, with the exception of the main character, Lionel, to be boring, and the dialog tedious. One thing I enjoyed about the book was how Lionel, a man suffering from Tourette's syndrome, was portrayed as a person and not a &quot;freak.&quot; Mr. Lethem did a wonderful job getting into Lionel's head. However, it just wasn't enough to save the book. I thought that the plot was too weak and the ending too abrupt. And none of the characters seemed at all transformed by their experiences. The book is, if nothing else, a good character study of a man suffering from Tourette's syndrome. If Mr. Lethem would have concentrated on Lionel's character, rather than making the book into a mystery, I am sure that my rating would have been higher."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"i was drawn to this book primarily because i like a good mystery. but i'll remember it for a long time because of the fascinating, hysterical and touching portrayal of Lionel Essrog, the private eye and Tourette's Syndrome sufferer at the center of this story. he's not one of those people who simply barks out obscenities all the time (he only does that occasionally). what's going on inside lionel's head is altogether more complex. when people speak to him their words bounce around inside his skull, metamorphising and reforming into new phrases which emit from his lips ten to the dozen. it would seem like the ultimate form of creativity, were it not for the fact that there's not a thing lionel can do to stop it. his affliction extends beyond words too - he is endlessly needled by the urge to touch things (like people's shoulders) a certain number of times. it all sounds a bit weird and made up, but in the hands of this author and in the words of lionel essrog, it's just everyday brooklyn life. jonathan lethem has done an amazing job here. he puts us inside the kind of mind few people even know exists. and then through the color and supreme naturalness of his writing allows us to not only feel what lionel feels, but actually understand how a mind like his works (or at least think we do). as a mystery, motherless brooklyn is okay, but the ending is disappointing. as an insight into the tourettic mind it's absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem's previous novels have always incorporated very strange elements. Whether it's a genetically-enhanced kangaroo as a villain, or a singularity as one corner of a love triangle, Lethem doesn't shirk at incorporating the weird into his stories.In Motherless Brooklyn, however, the only unusual aspect to the story is that the protagonist has Tourette's Syndrome. Lethem infuses the narrative with Lionel's tics and verbal outbursts, but the story's premise - a murder mystery - is somewhat more mundane than his previous novels.I'm not a big fan of murder mysteries, but I was captivated by this novel. What held my interest was Lethem's writing. His use of language, his sense of pacing, and the voice of his protagonist made this book a pleasure to read. And Lethem's portrayal of Lionel was masterful. As the story unfolds, we come to understand how Tourette's works, a little - at least, how it seems to work for Lionel.But while Lionel's Tourette's was a large part of the story, Lethem didn't let it become the story. There are questions, and Lionel looks for answers. There is danger, and Lionel tries to face it or avoid it. There is humour, too - and rarely at Lionel's expense.If you've enjoyed Lethem's previous novels, I'd recommend this one without reservation. I think it's his best so far. If you haven't read a Lethem novel, try this one - even if you're not a mystery fan. I'm not, and I loved it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A happy follower of Lethem's books since day one, I was pleased to hear that yet another novel was in the works, of course. Lethem is so prolific -- kind of like a \`60s pop star, putting out an album or so a year -- that the mossy-menthol taste of \\"Girl in Landscape\\" was still lingering in my mouth when an advance copy of \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" landed in my lap. I suppose I shouldn't be at all surprised to discover that not only is this easily Lethem's most mature pure-prose, it is also his least self-conscious book to date and -- very important -- it is the closest his novel-writing has come to the incredible compression and arcs of his great short stories (go get \\"Wall of the Sky, Wall of the Eye\\", right away, now. Scoot.). In \\"Motherless\\", Lethem has also created his nost compelling doppleganger (there are wonderful clusters of them throughout his work) in the form of the narrator, Lionel Essrog, a Tourette's sufferer, orphan, private detective, private genius and fully conscious and hyper-sensitive idiot-savant stuck in a gritty underworld. If I had to guess I'd say this must be Lethem himself to a tee: his obvious delight in obsessive-compulsive wordplay, the achingly poignant non-sequitur, a razor sharp eye for dimly-glowing emotional detail and flourescent-bright pop culture lynchpins.... aw hell, I can't do it like him. You get it. Rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Like many of the reviewers who felt ultimately let down by &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; I felt that the novel began well but...phtt-- all the air was gone by the middle of the story, and the end was hurried, even careless. After all, Lionel never really finds out anything--Julia narrates it to him, and not even directly, which robs the final of even that power. And I do feel that if you write a mystery or a detective story then you must WRITE one, and though character is important, and setting an added bonus, if you don't pay enough attention to the plot then you are just wasting the reader's time. Thus, I would even say that the Tourette's syndrome, (the most fascinating part of the book, and described with much sympathy and skill by the author) ultimately becomes just a gimmick as well. Now, I'm not a philistine, and I love excellent writing as much as anyone, but I feel that the basic demands of the genre must be respected. I'll be glad to read another book by the author, but maybe not a mystery novel."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog, the orphaned hero of this superb novel which evokes and in some ways surpasses the classics of Raymond Chandler, has Tourette's syndrome and suffers from compulsive traits that make him behave in a variety of strange ways. The author's brilliant evocation of his internal dialogues and the way in which his tic constantly manifests itself is totally convincing and lifts this book into a special category.Lionel is regarded as a freak by almost everyone he meets. The exception is Frank Minna, a small-time crook running a series of modest rackets in Brooklyn, who rescues Lionel and three other inmates of his orphanage and enlists them as his \\"Minna Men,\\" to do odd jobs and tasks for him. Minna runs a fake car service which is a front for a detective agency which itself is a front for various forms of larceny. But as the book begins, Minna is murdered.Lionel's tics hide a sharp intelligence and a well-defined sense of right and wrong, which makes him the perfect hero. As he tries to get to the bottom of Minna's death, he finds that his behavior gives him a strange advantage. Nobody takes him seriously. But he is intensely serious.Seen through Lionel's eyes, the world is a strange place. New York City itself, he says, is a \\"Tourettic city\\" with its constant scratching and counting and tearing. Lionel has the customary love affair during this book with a sweet girl who seems to understand him and then doesn't. Sex smooths away his tics, the author writes, then supplanting them with the biggest tic of all.This is one of those books that takes a genre, shakes it up and goes beyond it without ever violating its fundamental rules. I believed totally in Essrog and came to see the world through his eyes."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel works at a driver service in Manhattan, which is the front for a detective agency, which is the front for a small-time hood's operation. The hood in question, Frank Minna, is murdered in the first few pages, and Lionel seeks to solve the mystery of Frank's death. The mystery is compelling and clever in itself. It throws Buddhist monks, a Polish giant, Italian mafia bosses, and a few orphans into a pot and stirs rapidly.Add to this a fascinating protagonist: Lionel has Tourette's Syndrome, which I have always associated with outbursts of context-inappropriate language. We view the entire world through Lionel's tics, the involuntary speech being just one of many. (It reminded me ofThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, also a great mystery, solved by a child with Asperger's Syndrome.) In Lethem's hands, Lionel's estrangement from the world around him, both through his Tourette's and through other disabilities, become effective types for the reader's (at least This Reader's) own feelings of alienation and estrangement.Lethem's use of language is also delicious. Take this sentence: \\"I was dredging up Minna's usages on any excuse now, as though I could build a golem of his language, then bring it to life, a figure of vengeance to search out the killer or killers.\\" (I'm a sucker for golems.)I thought it was Excellent.This was the second Lethem book I have read; the first was his first novel,Gun, with Occasional Music. I enjoyed them both a great deal, although that one mixes crime novel with science fiction, and while it does it very effectively, some people are so immediately put off by science fiction that this may be a better starter-Lethem.Note on content: The book has lots of strong language, as you'd expect from hoods in Brooklyn. And one sex scene."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"An extremely good book--does a deft job of walking the line between literary and genre fiction. Enough plot to keep you turning pages, but not so much you don't enjoy the pages as you read them. Memorable and likeable characters. IHMO, his best book.Most of the books Lethem wrote after this are more along the lines of the \\"Big Postmodernists\\"--rambling social commentary that (a cynical person might say) can be overheard in any coffee shop or undergraduate study lounge. Basically, the kind of books certain readers love because of all the obscure insider pop culture references.If you love those sorts of books, head for Fortress of Solitude. Otherwise, read this one. It's well-crafted, enjoyable to read, and worth your time."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Nothing about this book should be compared, I believe, to any standard genre fiction. The only standard is clear, compelling writing with believable characters and honest events. So rich is Lionel's world, and he is such a keen observer, that the experience is lifted to a feeling of depth like few other pieces of modern-day writing. The plot is really about self-discovery, about stepping outside your comfort zone, and about finding a home. So many wonderful, touching scenes side-by-side with compelling tension and a terrific, underlying drive to the plot."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Lionel Essrog is a bumbling detective suffering from Tourette's syndrome. Readers are treated to his hilarious encounters as he tries to solve the mystery behind his boss's murder. Author, Jonathan Lethem, has written an interesting and thoroughly engaging story full of quirky (and loveable) characters. This is one of my favorite books. Lionel Essrog's telling of his tale made me laugh out loud. I found this book truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I loved this book. I crave books which have unique storylines and characters and follow that with clever writing and an engaging plot. This book meets those wishes and more.The writing is clever, the characters are three dimensional with funky personalites and personal histories. I highly recommend this part detective novel/part love story/part character study for anyone who craves a highly unique and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In obvious homage to Raymond Chandler's form - even quoting directly from several of his books - Lethem has created a very creative, highly readable, unique take on the classic detective novel. The first person narrative from the mind of a Tourette's is the real engine that drives this vehicle, but Lethem also does a pretty fair job of building up and playing out the detective story that frames the plot. The book as a whole is written at a level that defies categorization and truly deserves the recognition that it has received as valued literature."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"While reading Motherless Brooklyn don't be surprised if you start rattling off rhymes and make alliterations to words being spoken when spending time with friends. I caught myself saying blockbuster flockfluster mockmusterr, much like the main character, Lionel Essrogg, fessrogg tesstog. The most interesting part of this novel is Tourette's syndrome which Lionel has, and the effects and details Lethem gives of the disease. Lionel is like a watch wound up too tight, an itch waiting to be scratched, and I never tired of the brilliant connecting thoughts and comedian like thinking displayed by his thought process. While the plot was slightly boring and the word Tourette existing on every page, Motherless Brooklyn is worth reading for the insight and experience of living like a man with Tourettes. Lethem never details what it is like to be an orphan, nor explains being devoted entirely to one man, Frank Minna, Lionel's boss, yet he definitely delves into the unknown world of Tourettes, hotdogs with papaya juice, and New York sandwiches...."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The detective novel has been done to death. There, I said it. There is nothing new under the sun, the bloom is off the rose, the check is in the mail. There have been some fine examples of the genre in recent times, true. Walter Mosley's \`Easy Rawlins' mysteries rank right up there with the best. But for the most part, authors bring nothing new to the table. They rehash Hammett, and Chandler, but never find their own true voice.Or so I thought.MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN has given me cause to celebrate. Not that the mystery itself is such an amazing feat of twists and turns. But the manner in which the mystery is told, the style and wit of the author, puts the literature back into the genre. This is a detective novel with class. I haven't been this startled by such originality and invention in a detective novel since Andrew Vachss introduced his \`Burke' character in FLOOD.Lionel Essrog is a New York detective, of sorts, one of four right-hand men serving under detective Frank Minna. Minna isn't really a detective, he's more of a criminal in disguise, but Lionel and the others are too enraptured to care. Minna recruited Lionel and the others from an orphanage (all four men comprise \`Motherless Brooklyn') to work as his henchmen, his drivers, his servants. When Minna is killed, Lionel must track the killer down.It sounds fairly standard for a detective novel, but author Jonathan Letham's ace-in-the-hole is Lionel's unusual dilemma: Lionel has Tourette's syndrome, a disorder that manifests itself through uncontrollable verbal and physical tics and spasms. As Lionel narrates his tale, relating his past life at the orphanage up to the present, he presents a viewpoint of the universe not many people could claim to understand, the frantic need for order and discipline in a world undesigned for this sort of comfort.This is treading a fine line. Lionel's disability could easily have become a gimmick, or even worse, a joke (although his asides and mutterings can be funny; he finds it almost impossible to say his name correctly). Letham navigates these perils with aplomb, and it is a tribute to his skill that Lionel's constant outbursts never become tiresome. We are fully immersed in the mind of a man with Tourette's, and it is often a startling experience.There is a touching aspect to Lionel's tale that only reveals itself fully in hindsight. Minna is obviously a father figure to Lionel and the others, but it is only when Lionel finally functions completely on his own does he mature into a man. Until that time, he was a boy in a man's frame, completely intoxicated with the world Minna provided, rarely stopping to ponder the seething darkness that Minna kept at bay. Minna was a father, but he was not a good father, and Lionel only comes to realize this when he faces the world completely and utterly alone.The mystery itself, like most good mysteries, is secondary. It is not the mystery that holds our attention. It is the language, the characters. THE MALTESE FALCON is a fine mystery, but it wouldn't hold our interest without Sam Spade's hard-boiled detective. A mystery is only as good as the frame which supports it. MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN has a very good frame indeed."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I really like Jonathan Lethem as an author. His books are usually quite interesting, clever, and humorous. Motherless Brooklyn disappointed me. The humor was not there, I seriously think Lethem tried to be funny but it simply failed. The characters were especially bland, and it was hard to become \\"attached\\" to Lionel the main character/narrarator. He spent too much time informing us that Lionel has Tourette's Syndrome, not enough time developing the story. The Tourette's was seriously (as someone previously stated in their review) the crutch that this book propped itself up on. Had it spent more time on the story, the book would have earned at least 4 stars because the story was interesting when time was spent explaining it. Gun, With Occassional Music is a much better detective story in my opinion. After a while, while I enjoyed parts of the book, I found myself reading it so that I could finish it. For serious Lethem fans only."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you like your books to leave you with a character you know you won't forget, you'll like this book. The central character is in many ways a flawed person, both because of the things life has dealt him and because of some of the choices he makes, but he is engaging and interesting every step of the way. The word play in this book will often make you laugh out loud, yet you are so inside the head of Essrog (where much of it occurs) that you know you are laughing with him.Don't read this as a thriller or a convoluted mystery. It is more than that, gritty but in a real-life kind of way. And the writing is wonderful."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"for restoring my faith in the novel. i love being surprised as much as i love reading then rereading some of your brightest phrases. it is somehow so satisfying to read a book where the author isn't trying too hard to make a point, or design a character, or tell a story. everything falls seemingly effortlessly into place, just as it should."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This lively novel is at once a kind of mystery and at the same time a delightful romp through the streets of New York. The central character suffers from Tourette's syndrome, and it is to Lethem's credit that he informs readers about the affliction without being condescending to his character, or making fun of other sufferers. In fact, he makes Tourette's sound like fun, which of course, it isn't. Still the book succeeds in drawing a number of lovely character portraits and in creating a lively plot. Good stuff. Deserves many readers."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"In another writer's hands, the concept of a narrator suffering from Tourettes', and trying to solve a murder could have been a gimmicky mess. Instead, Jonathan Lethem's MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN turns out to be an intriguing, original and fascinating novel. Lethem is not afraid to take chances and his gamble paid off here. While I agree that the mystery itself is secondary to the character studies (and a drop disappointing), the resulting glimpses into the short-circuiting manners of a Tourettes' victim is a minor masterpiece in character study. In fact, the other realm described here, the motherless world of orphans, is equally brilliant and convincing. Give this book a read--I highly and hugely recommend it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book has some flashes of good writing, especially in dialogue. However, that was about it. I kept wishing for more.The mystery plot did not have much in it and was summed up in about a page at the end by the narrator/main character.The main character/narrator has Tourette's syndrom. This was a great idea full of potential. Unfortunately, soon into the book this became an impediment. As obsessive and compulsive are the sufferers of the syndrome, so was this author in describing the syndrome. Page after page, time after time, the narrator would launch into the effects of the syndrome. It got tedious, interrupted the flow of the story and, after the first several passages, did not add to knowledge about the syndrome. These descriptive passages added nothing to plot nor the character.On the positive side, the main character shows that Tourette's does not make the sufferer less intelligent. He does solve the mystery. There is some good writing, unfortunately it was interrupted as I described above. I did learn something about Tourette's (it just did not have to be repeated).In sum, I feel the author missed hitting the mark in his use of the Tourette's. The character was neither amusing nor sympathetic and after teh pounding of the explanatory passages, got plain tiresome."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I don't have Tourette's but after reading this book I can see that my mind works in much the same way as Lethem describes Lionel Essrog's. I want to hire on with the Minna Men and answer the phone: &quot;no cars&quot;. I want to walk the streets and talk the talk of a 1930s detective in today's Brooklyn neighborhoods. This book takes you on a ride inside the mind of a man who's inability to control his &quot;Tourette's brain&quot; makes every moment a challenge and the next moment a surprise. The writing is superb and the story had my attention throughout. I have just started with Lethem and now I want to read everything he's written."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Great book. Lethem describes Tourette's with the humor and love of someone who has it or has a loved one with it. He uses it as a marvelous vehicle for character development. Funny engaging book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"i looovveddd this book! this is one of my favorite books now and i recommend this book to people who want to be amused and like detective-type books. the difference with this book and others is that the main character has tourettic syndrome, spitting out random words or phrases and have abnormal responses to things. this book is unique and will give u a chill near the end. and there's a ton of food involved! reminds me of Ocean's 11, Brad Pitt eating all the time ^_^"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I picked up this book on Amazon after I saw it at the local Barnes &amp; Noble on the 'must have' list for reading groups. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it really wasn't all that spectacular. It was just sort of there... If you are interested in Tourettes, it seems like you might be better off readin Icy Sparks, and if you are interested in mysteries, well...this one is OK. Just nothing to write home about..."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"If you've studied literature, you know that narratives haven't always been populated with fully rounded people. For quite a long time, writers filled their works with flat characters either due to their relative unimportance in the plot or to emphasize universal qualities or out of some allegorical or archetypal impulse. But in the past century or two, the proverbial pendulum has swung the other way, and complex, realistic characters have become badges of authorial excellence. And if you can make them grotesque or bizarre and still remain that verisimilitude, well, let the kudos rain down. That's just what Jonathan Lethem has done in Motherless Brooklyn, a murder mystery with one of the oddest and best-realized detectives you've ever encountered.See, ever since he was a child at St. Vincent's Home for Boys in Brooklyn, Lionel Essrog has had this problem, like he'll get something into his head, an odd phrase--loud maze! found days! pound haze!--and he'll have to riff on it for a while, or maybe a number, like six, let's pick six, and he'll have to do everything six times, like straighten your lapels or tap you on the shoulder or maybe kiss you, and Lionel can't help it, because he has Tourette's, it's a disorder, a compulsion to do all those things and maybe throw in the occasional--eatmebailey!--obscenity from time to time, but Lionel has a new compulsion, because he's a Minna Man, an associate of Frank Minna, small-time fence and only father figure Lionel has ever had, except Minna just got himself stabbed repeatedly in the gut and tossed in a dumpster, and Lionel doesn't know why, but he knows he can't stop until he finds the person responsible for his death.Though Motherless Brooklyn is ostensibly crime fiction, it goes a little light on the \\"crime\\" part. Yes, there's murder, an investigation, arrests, high-speed chases, a ruthless Japanese syndicate, a brutal pistol whipping, a pair of aging Mafiosi and tense stand offs over leveled weapons. But these compose only about one-half of the running time. The rest gets dedicated to developing Lionel, which would normally disappoint a genre lover such as myself. But Lethem carries it off with such skill that I have a difficult time offering anything but admiration. Lionel could've remained a joke, a one-note gag, an invention better suited for sitcoms than a full-length novel. In Lethem's hands, though, he moves from humorous to poignant and surprisingly intelligent. The piling on of personal detail does get a bit much at times. (Did I really need to know about the odd shape of Lionel's genitalia? I think not.) Still, the overall effect is impressive. This Brooklyn has got character."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I write as well though I have more skin in the game in distribution of my stories so I appreciate the unexpected cacophonous symphony of words and thoughts he lays out in printing multiple layers of consciousness to elicit truth from chaos, cover-ups and lies of the world at large. Plot was a bit of a challenge to follow along."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is the first novel by Jonathan Lethem that I have read. I was impressed with his creativity and was genuinely entertained, but this was not a favorite for me. I got the sense that all his creative energy had been absorbed in producing a readable character with Tourette's, and he did this fantastically, but I felt the plot suffered for it.I would recommend this book, but caution that the value is in the character and not the story."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"The first half of MB is excellent - solid on plot and character development and very well written. The second half is also well written, but has little in the way of interesting further character development and a plot that roams randomly towards a rather fizzled ending. MB could have been a first-rate short story or novella. It does not succeed at novel length."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Seems to suffer from one of the problems that plagues a lot of books the environment created is fantastic but the plot doesn't get going until about way through the narrative if you can hang on for awhile you should be ok. Its not the plot that got me which if I could honest wasn't particularly interesting another guy murdered wow never read that before.Rather for me it was the quite honest portrayal of a man with a horribly frustrating illness. The author does a wonderful job of communicating just how much it controls your life and how it can be overcome with the right support. That was enough for me because at times the plot moves so slow you want to throw the book down in frustration."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Ostensibly this is a hard-boiled detective novel, but the detective story is just a framework for the real story, which is about Lionel Essrog's life with Tourette's syndrome and his delayed maturity.The book is narrated in first-person from the perspective of Lionel. It starts with him and Gilbert staking out the Yorkville Zendo (a Zen Buddhist meeting house.) Their boss, small-time mobster Frank Minna, shows up, tells them he's wearing a wire, gives Lionel the headphones and goes inside the Zendo. Something goes wrong and Frank winds up getting stabbed.Cut to a long section of flashbacks about how Lionel and three other boys from St. Vincent's orphanage met Frank and became his crew for a suspicious moving business that later turned into a car company / detective agency. Strangely, the agency seldom drives customers anywhere, and seldom solves crimes. They run errands for Frank and the mysterious \\"Clients.\\" They all seem to look up to Frank as a father figure (at least Lionel does) and their reliance on him keeps them from truly growing up (at least in Lionel's case.) All the guys are basically screw-ups but Lionel is the most obviously broken because of his Tourette's syndrome which makes him blurt out bizarre phrases at odd times, obsessively touch and count things. He's not crazy; he just can't control himself. People think he's crazy, or retarded, and for that reason they tend to underestimate him. I am guilty of it myself: Even though Lionel describes himself as a somewhat large man, I kept picturing him as a scrawny, jittery little guy.Back to the present day, Lionel bumbles around, picking up clues and putting together what amounts to a very simple, almost lame-brained conspiracy plot. None of the bad stuff would have happened but for the stupidity of a few key characters. This is why these guys are still small-time...On a stylistic level, _Motherless Brooklyn_ is fun to read. Lionel's brain slices and dices language in startling, sometimes hilarious ways. The prose is frantic, kaleidoscopic. The pace is steady and the book moves you along without boring you. HOWEVER, I got into this with the expectation it would be another \\"weird-noir\\" novel like _Gun With Occasional Music_ which is much weirder and much more noir. So, only four stars. The book is good but it isn't what I thought it would be. I wound up feeling slightly dissatisfied after finishing it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I loved this innovative genre-defying novel. Ostensibly it is a murder mystery but it could be a novel about Tourette Syndrome or about adopted children or emotional fear and burdon.The title comes from boys who are in a Brooklyn orphanage, hence 'Motherless Brooklyn'. One of these boys is 'adopted' by a small-time hood, Frank Minna. When Frank is murdered, our hero becomes a 'Minna Man' attempting to avenge his mentor's murder. The portrayal of Tourettes is compelling and vivid, also quite accurate for someone with a serious case of the disorder.The writing is this side of wonderful!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"You might think a writer could not construct a brilliantly-worded, completely engaging detective story centering around a protagonist with Tourette syndrome. You'd be wrong. Lethem is a brilliant author who writes books you just can't set down once you have been lucky (or informed) enough to pick one up. Lethem writes about Brooklyn as Dennis Lehane (e.g.Gone, Baby, Gone (Harper Fiction)) writes about Boston---with the authority of experience. In regard to what Lethem says he loves most of books are \\"the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements.\\" THAT is why you read Lethem. Because his writing is true to his passion and it makes his books incredibly entertaining and intriguing."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"this book is so fresh and hectic,i enjoy reading it immensely.a unique detective book."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a great novel, providing a fresh take on the detective genre. Lead character Lionel Essrog has Tourrette's, and Tourrette's has surely got him. He's a great narrator for this sensitive tale of mentorship lost and found. The movie rights have been acquired, and they will have to adapt it considerably, so don't settle for that. Read it first, and get all the fun of Lionel's herky-jerky narration, twitches and all."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"An old friend of mine gave me this book as a gift. He is my only real connection with Brooklyn. I visited him there several times when he lived on Court Street and we walked its length while he told me stories about his experiences in the neighborhood and the minor wiseguys who sat at the table outside the Italian grocery across the street from his apartment.Motherless Brooklyn was a gift he chose presumably because of this brief, shared Court Street experience. Much of Motherless Brooklyn takes place on our around Court Street and its place names like Cobble Hill and Carroll Garden are familiar to me. It was a sweet gift.I've just finished reading it and I really enjoyed it. It was difficult to put down.It is an endearing story of New York - endearing in spite of its themes of homicide and betrayal. The narrator - an orphan, a borderline gangster/hood with a serious case of Tourette's Syndrome endears himself to the reader.I loved a scene later in the book that took place in Coastal Maine. It was written by someone who clearly understands and loves the region."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I agree with other reviewers. The plot is not the essence here but the unforgettable character of Lionel Essrog. As a fan of language and wordplay, I realized for the first time while reading this book that Tourette's can be viewed as an extreme example of the love for and obsession with words that characterizes some Scrabble champions, copy editors, and novelists. Not that anyone would covet a life as a Tourette's sufferer -- but Lethem expresses a love and empathy for his character that rings completely true."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I have never read a novel by Jonathan Lethem before, never heard of him, but the reviews for this book looked promising. This is a &quot;not to miss&quot; piece of literature. It is thoroughly engrossing and entertaining. I listened to it as an audio book, and the reader, was wonderful. This book is one of the best I've ever read (or listened to). Try it, you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book has so many twists and takes the reader into so many interesting worlds. Lionel Essrog is the type of character that most writers would portray as a one dimensional afterthought. This story is written from the perspective of the character who's usually the comic relief. Lionel is endearing, believable and so well developed. To think of this &quot;freakshow&quot; of a human being thrown into a film-noirish world of gangsters, crooks and zen buddhists leaves so many possibilities and Lethem puts it all together in a wonderful package. This is the first book I've read in a long time where I was so involved that I would literally yell at the book when Lionel would get in trouble. That is a true feat of writing."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"By page 8 I was completely drawn in to Minna and Essrog's characters. A pretty impressive feat in it's own right. Lionel's Tourette's syndrome was handled spectacularly but sensitively and added to a great story set-up by about the first 100 pages. From there the characters continue to crackle and sparkle but the mystery does unwind a bit. The 4-5 page 3rd person wrap up of the mystery does leave my mystery lovers heart a bit downcast and Julia does seem a bit typecast ( but a writer could do worse than stealing a Chandler character). But overall the book is strong and definately worthwhile. If you are a general fiction reader, this mystery/detective story will shake your reading up a bit. If you are a mystery reader you'll be impressed that someone is writing mysteries with great dialogue and characters that really stand out. Something for everyone."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book with keep you reading and reading all night long! His writing is flawless and he commands your attention. What a character he created in Lionel! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem excells again. Have you read more than good for you? Are you secretly bored by impressive bestsellers, not-to-be-missed Literature, top-notch thrillers, international supernovels? Make your brains smile again with MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This book is hard to categorize. Is it a detective novel? A satire of the detective novel? A literary journey through the complexities of language? Who knows, and the book is so thoroughly entertaining that it really doesn't matter what the authors real motives are.The narrator, Lionel Essrog (a name just dying for a Tourettic tic) has Tourette's Syndrome, which makes him a wonderful and unique storyteller. And the reader can't help but laugh out loud at his unexpected yellings and shoulder taps. I kept expecting Lionel to become annoying or to find a cure for his tics, but Lethem gratefully keeps him true to character the entire book. The word associations and spoonerisms that Lionel erupts with will be interesting to anyone who likes wordplay.The detective part of this novel comes in when Minna, a low status criminal, is knifed. It's up to his gang, the Minna Men, of which Lionel is one, to figure out whodunnit. What occurs is a tongue-in-cheek crime story that actually manages to be a pretty good mystery in the end.This is overall a pretty strange book in that it was never what I expected it to be. Hilarious, mysterious, tragic, and touching. How did Lethem manage to do all this in just over 300 pages? I'll be reading another Lethem very soon...."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I read an interview with Lethem in which he said that while writing the book, he learned to see Tourette's Syndrome as a kind of continuum, and that all human beings are on it somewhere and show Tourettic impulses. He said that if the book succeeds, readers will diagnose themselves to see where they fit on that continuum. As someone who found it necessary to research interviews on Lethem to better understand the book, I learned that I'm more like Lionel Essrog than I'd like.That's only one reason the book is a success, though. Many other reviewers have pointed out the moments of hilarity and poignancy, the appeal of Lionel as a narrator, etc., so I'd like to add a few other things:One aspect ties to what's mentioned above -- the universality of Tourette's. Lionel ties his affliction to conspiracies, guilt, insomnia, etc., showing how so many emotions and trains of thought have to do with trying to touch or change the world and how futile those efforts can seem. Lionel's interrogation of his Tourette's mind helps it rise above literary gimmickry.I also liked how Lethem showed the difficulty of controlling language and communicating effectively with other people. Lionel tics around nearly everybody, with the exception (most of the time, anyway) of Kimmery, who is a soothing presence and accepts his Tourette's more than most people. Even around Frank Minna, whom Lionel adores, he tics. Maybe that's because Lionel likes the way Minna talks -- his pat phrases (&quot;wheels within wheels,&quot; &quot;tell your story walking,&quot; &quot;tugging the boat,&quot; etc.) form Lionel's chief memories of Minna, and he repeats them frequently. I think he could be envious. Besides Kimmery, Lionel has few other situations in which he can be tic-free. A couple of those are when he listens to Prince and when he sits at the Papaya Czar, both because their art mirrors his chaotic brain. He feels validated and comforted because he is like them. Besides showing the human need for connection, Lionel also shows how language and communication break down when you're outside your comfort zone. Other characters show this, too -- Tony, who turns vicious because he is so disturbed by Lionel's outbursts; Detective Seminole, who misreads Lionel's tics completely and gets the wrong idea about the case; even Minna completely loses his cool-guy persona when he's around the so-formal-they're-scary Matricardi and Rockaforte and the silence of his mother.Oh yeah, and the book's so fun to read you don't want it to end, either."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This narrator of this novel is an appealing character, but the detective story didn't do much for me. My interest decreased more and more until it petered out completely, and with 30 pages to go I stopped reading and never felt motivated to pick up the book again. There was no building of tension and no discernible plot movement, and a revelation about halfway through the novel struck me as no big deal.On the other hand, Lethem can be a beautiful writer; there are some nice set pieces in this book, and he portrays some realistic and tender relationships. I particularly liked the quirkiness between Lionel and Kimmery.Over time, Lionel's Tourettic outbursts grew annoying and repetitive -- octaphone! Liable Dishrag! -- although now that I write this, I see that perhaps this was the point.I'm ambivalent. This is the only book by Lethem that I've read, and he seems to be a talented writer, but the story just didn't pull me in."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I have read almost every book or story printed by Lethem, and this is by far his best. This is the best book I've ever read, anywhere. It would be a mistake NOT to read it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Just adding to the general aproval that this book has garnered. I thought it brilliant and compelling. Though I wasn't particularly involved with the plot the quality of the writing and characterisation was sufficient to make it a &quot;5&quot; reqardless."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Never have I met such a unique character in a mystery novel. Lionel Essrog has Tourette's. A Brooklyn orphan from St. Vincent's Home for Boys, Lionel grows up emulating small-time mobster Frank Minna. Now in his 30s, Lionel works for Minna's limo service and detective agency along with other orphans, the self-proclaimed Minna Men. When Minna turns up dead, Lionel is determined to find the killer. This story involves all the kinds of enigmatic characters one would expect from a classic detective novel: two elderly mobsters, a Buddhist, a Giant, and Minna's widow. Nevertheless, it's the way the story is told that makes the book so intriguing. Author Jonathan Lethem's writing style is so fluid and crisp. You can't help but get caught up in the story. The first chapter begins with the circumstances surrounding Minna's death. The next chapter delves back into Lionel's past and explains why Minna's death means so much to him. The latter chapters trace Lionel's investigation and his journey to find out who he is without Frank Minna. This was truly a treat!"},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"A considerable strength of this book is its willingness to take risks. Another is its use of a narrator with Tourettes syndrome; it eloquently communicates the alienation of being different without even having to talk about it very much. Simply through his lonely existence, the narrator speaks to that part of all of us that doesn't feel it quite fits in.The author's ability to use language and turn wonderful phrases is also notable.Unfortunately, there are some glaring weaknesses too. The dialogue is bad, unnatural and even embarrasing to read in places. The plot is half-hearted, difficult to follow and pointless. The use of Tourettes is interesting at times, heart wrenching at others and cute at still others, but despite how realistic this portrait of the condition might be, I got tired of looking at the world through a mishmosh of odd phrases and found myself slogging through the second half hoping it would get better.Worth reading because it's different."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"This is a wonderful book. The writing is superb. I am in awe of an author who can transform the verbal tics of a Brooklyn detective with Tourette's syndrome into near poetry. Bored with the same-old same-old? Read this book and savor it."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"I don't know -- this just isn't that great a book, so why is everyone going gaga for it? It's not all that well written (some sections are painfully awkward), it's not that great a mystery (although the main revelation about the villain's identity is well delivered), the business of viewing everything through a Tourette's lens is handled in a ham-handed and tiresome fashion (i.e., take an element of ordinary life, describe it briefly, then have narrator comment &quot;That's just like Tourette's if you think about it&quot;), and you exit the book disappointed, especially if you entered expecting something great.Not horrible, but not very good, either, and definitely not outstanding."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Jonathan Lethem clearly is a talented young writer, and his guiding concept in creating *Motherless Brooklyn* is promising, indeed. I finished the book disappointed, however, as all three of its apparent main elements simply were not presented adequately.First of all, the book is supposed to be a different sort of &quot;detective mystery.&quot; I cannot imagine, however, that fans of Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, or Sue Grafton would find the structure or plot of Lethem's mystery particularly gripping. No, this novel asks that readers be pulled along not on the basis of any edge-of-your-seat twists and turns in the plot, but because of its supporting literary aspects, i.e., its characters, descriptions of places, etc.Here again, however, I felt that Lethem came up short in *Motherless Brooklyn*. His descriptions of &quot;life growing up as orphans in 1970's Brooklyn&quot; and then of contemporary Brooklyn generally emerge as remarkably bland and uncompelling. Overall, his characters emerge as shallow and unmemorable.To me, both the most interesting and yet also disappointing aspect of the novel was the third main element of the book, Lethem's development of his protagonist, Lionel Essrog, whose affliction with Tourette's syndrome provides much, if not most of the book's actual content. Lethem has surely done a fine job of capturing many of the details of the behaviors that a Tourette's sufferer exhibits, including the endlessly varied and creative verbal outbursts. I comment Lethem for the research and care he evidently put into this aspect of his work. However, Lionel ultimately lacks sufficient depth as a character. He actually emerges overall as a &quot;regular guy&quot; who happens to suffer from uncontrollable tics. I doubt that in real life, this would be the case. To go through one's life being a &quot;human freakshow&quot; ALWAYS and to consequently suffer the scorn, ridicule, and uncomfortable reactions from others would, it seem to me, take a deeper toll on one's psyche than we see in Lionel Essrog. The internal monolog that Lethem attributes to Lionel is surprisingly bland, and includes remarkably little *angst*, shame, frustration, or real human depth overall. The Tourette's aspect of the book comes across ultimately as an interesting gimmick, and as such actually becomes a bit tiresome after the first hundred pages or so.Overall, Lethem has created a highly readable work based on an original and unusual set of premises and circumstances, but his execution of his ideas proved disappointing to me."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"Unfortunately this really wan't my kind of book. To me the plot just seemed to limp along without going anywhere interested or engaging. I didn't bond with any of the characters, which probably made the book less enjoyable that it could have been.I don't feel the book is poorly written but I think that it is just simply not the style of book that appeals to me. So unfortunately I can't recommend this book to others but that shouldn't deter those who are interesting having a read."},{"Title":"Motherless Brooklyn","review":"if i was not a Edward Norton fan i would have never know about this book.

The Lockheed Scandal, the Wilson-Terpil Affair, several minor celebrity sin-fests, even something on tired old Watergate get comicized here. The book focusses on Hollywood, society, political and big business scandals, and so distinquishes itself from the other Big Books--on the unexplained, criminals, martyrs, urban legends, weirdos, losers and freaks. To coin a Vankinish observation, that list looks more like readers than topics the longer it gets. The first book in this series--from Factoid Books, a front for Paradox Press, which is an imprint of DC Comics--was the excellent Big Book of Conspiracies."},{"Title":"Big Book of Scandal","review":"Shame on the people inside this book whose scandalous lives provide such fun reading!

In 1750 London to Manchester took roughly 3 days. However with the newer high quality roads this was reduced drastically until 1810 saw the journey take only 24 hours. If the weather was favourable etc. Miss Helen Sanghurst is left destitute and thus decides to take the common stage to her new guardian. Needless to say the weather is not as favourable as it could be.Typically Regencies make mention of the common stage but very few render such a detailed account as this book.

And I love fashion books and TV shows, and all of that. But, this book is completely different. Molloy doesn't tell us at all what he thinks we should wear, or what goes with what, or what styles work with what figure type, and all the topics that are covered by other fashion books. He just tells us, based upon extensive research, what type of impression we will create if we wear certain types of clothing-particularly in relation to the professional working world. So, if you want to be up on fashion and impress your friends, read something else. If you want to be accepted as an authority in your field, read John Molloy and follow his advice."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I wish ALL American professional women read this book. I am sometimes shocked at the way women in this country dress--for business or not. Some of them dress vulgarly, when they should dress professionally. And then, there's the eternal complaint that men don't take them seriously... As Melanie Griffith correctly stated in \\"Working Girl\\": \\"If you want to be taken seriously, you gotta have serious hair\\"; you want to be taken seriously in the business world, dress impeccably, professionally and serouisly! And, no, I don't mean dress like a man, but like I woman who is not selling herself--if you know what I mean! This book would also be an excellent daily-life guide for women. It is shocking to go to weddings, graduations, all kinds of parites and see women--young and older--wearing jeans, tennis shoes, flip-flops! I think dressing nicely is also a way for you to show appreciation and respect for your host/hostess."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Molloy has something different to say than most professional apparel advisors. His theme is to stick with power projection as based on research. Decision points involve color, form and cut, pattern, matching, material and texture. This is useful for becoming familiar in an intuitive way with the historical basis for contemporary professional fashion, from which trends revolve. What is dated only requires modification, whereas the principles seem to have been identified by Molloy."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"As I wrote above, this is a very interesting book. It is amazing to read a book about women at work and how they should dress in a man's prospective. I didn't know many things, for example how to dress for certain places and what things women wear symbolize. I learned many helpful things by reading this book. I think people in general will like this book."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I think that this is a excellent book for any woman to read.

You can say the tips in the book are sexist but they're ture in the real world. all the results are from the excellent research done by the author for over 30 years. This is really a book for success"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I found this book very interesting, actually. It wasn't merely a man staitng what he thought about women's clothing in the workplace, it was statistical information. Molly went out into the world and did the research about what colors worked best, what skirts, what accessories, and I have to say that the results were very interesting. Who would have ever known that blue was a power color? Certainly not me without this book. Things like that are what make this book worthwhile, otherwise, it is just a rmable of common sense. Any woman can figure out that it's not a good idea to wear a miniskrit for a presentation, or wear tanktops to work. Essentially, the message is: Don't dress like a slut. Simple. A whole book wasn't needed to say this, but for certain things, the insights were interesting and ceratinyl some that I would listen to.The only problem with the book was that it is very outdated. Even having been written a mere 5 years ago, the workplace has changed so much. The book discusses formal wear for the workplace, and so many businesses now allow business casual. I would certainyl not agree with his advice of no skirts in the workplace, for this is completely outdated. I would have loved to see more on business casual and some more advice about how to dress for success in places other than offices. Women do, after all, work other places. Overall, though, this book kept me interseted and was very informative. It was thorough and easy to read and one that I would recommend to any woman in a working enironment."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Every woman should read this and then pass it on to younger women. There is a lot of good information here for women in the work place."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Molloy's first Women's Dress for Success was a huge influence in my business life. The first issue didn't just address clothing. He told a newly ambitious generation of women how to be taken seriously. Example: When the engineer-turned-executive rolls up his sleeves and solves an engineering problem, people say \\"the old boy hasn't lost his touch.\\" When the administrative assistant-turned-executive is asked to type a memo, she should make a \\"best effort\\" that is abysmally slow and say she's been away from that for too long. Excellent observations! Sorry, young ladies, but the battles for being taken seriously haven't been won. And, if I may, those of you who dress overly-sexy in the office aren't helping. Another: if you wear a suit but take off your jacket, you're now just wearing a skirt and blouse (secretarial attire).A few things have changed. I've just bought this new book, so I haven't read it. But I suspect he left out what was the last chapter in the original: How to dress if your idea of success is catching Mr. Right. (Example: salesmen like outfits that are all one color; wearing a coat long enough to cover your evening gown is critical)."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"As someone who has worked many years in the corporate world, I think the reviews criticizing Malloy for being sexist, or promoting unclear rules that vary according to if the supervisor is a woman or a man, are being naive. His excellent and detailed research is clearly explained, and he has no bias whatsoever against women! The criticisers simply don't like hearing what the research bears out.I met John Malloy and bought his first books back in the late 1970's, and his advice REALLY helped me back then when I was a stock broker. I was delighted to see he had a new book out for women. I was not disappointed. He discusses all the ways women's professional dress has changed, and has good research to back up his conclusions, which he also shares with the reader. I have now changed professions--I am a teacher living overseas. I still found his advice very valuable, especially his new advice about \\"Casual Fridays,\\" or any other business where dress is normally casual. Although I didn't know it before I read the book, this is the area which is now giving women the most trouble. He gives a lot of excellent advice--too much to summarize here. He covers many particular professions in detail."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I don't mind others being against this book -- they're just less competition for those of us who understand the corporate unconscious. I read this book AFTER becoming successful by doing the things this book recommends. Lucky me. Then, when my company changed to a casual wear policy and I changed my look, my whole life changed. I went from unquestioning respect to constant challenges to my expertise and to colleagues actually acting surprised at my level of skill, when I had worked so hard to build a reputation. Now that I've gone back to serious dress, albeit with only a little casual influence, I have my respect back. And I'm not going to give it up again!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I read the first edition of this book twenty years ago. What struck me then was Malloy's research findings about fashion and sex appeal. Ladies, fashion fails you! Sex appeal gets you into the bedroom, but keeps you out of the boardroom.Yes, Malloy's advice is based on research. He has surveyed hundreds of thousands of people on &quot;which woman is more successful?&quot; He shows people pictures of &quot;twins&quot; which are really the same woman dressed in different ways. He reports on the types of outfits, fabrics, patterns, accessories, hair styles, jewelry, and even colors that say &quot;success&quot; to people. He gives step by step tips on how to shop for &quot;success&quot; items even on a college student's budget.This new version IS updated. Malloy himself says &quot;Everything has changed&quot; since he researched and wrote this second book. His advice about business casual - avoid it if you can - is right on for professional women. We have a hard enough time being recognized as professionals in suits, let alone if everyone is in Dockers and company logo polo shirts! He gives tips on how to stand out favorably even in today's polo shirt land."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"For women who love serving the fashion machine, this book is useless. But for women who want to know how to dress to break into the &quot;good old boys&quot; network, who want to rise above their upbringing, or want to stop being treated like bimbos and trash, this book is priceless. Molloy's research into what sort of colors impress juries and potential buyers is incredibly useful. He even tells you how to dress to be a successful doctor. I find Molloy incredibly sympathetic to the needs of real women, including large-size women and particularly women of color."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This new edition of \\"Women's Dress for Success\\" covers a lot more than clothes and accessories, and is a treasure trove of advice for any woman interested in self improvement. For most of us, there is usually room for \\"image enhancement,\\" in how we present ourselves to the world, as our way of dressing and speaking, etc. all sends a message. John Molloy's recommendations are also helpful if you are on a budget. His \\"fabric test,\\" color combinations, and style tips will save you a lot of money, and you can even do well using his guidelines shopping in a thrift store! You will no longer buy without planning, the things in your closet will mix and match properly, and you will not buy something \\"just because it's on sale,\\" and find later that it doesn't really look good with anything else you own.John Molloy covers the basics of what to wear in a business environment, which he has researched extensively, and very few of the guidelines have changed over the years. The one thing he states that has changed, is that now \\"dressing for success\\" is \\"almost universally accepted,\\" and yes, there is a double standard, as men can get away with dressing poorly, but few women can, if they want the corner office with the view. Some of Molloy's research is fascinating, especially in the legal profession, as he explains how color, style, and dress size will influence a jury (\\"In personal injury cases, clients were more likely to be believed if they wore outfits one size too large\\").Aside from advice on clothes, accessories, and hair styles (all accompanied by black and white drawings), Molloy discusses body language (posture and facial expression), and the all-important and often ignored speech pattern, vocabulary and voice tone. He recommends recording oneself while on the telephone with friends, and playing it back. Anyone who has not done this is in for a surprise! Molloy also covers weight and height, and how the clothes you choose should change according to your size. Informative and entertaining, \\"New Women's Dress for Success\\" is a classic, and well worth reading if you want to \\"move up the corporate ladder,\\" or just want an organized closet of clothes that make the most of who you are."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Although some of Molloy's comments may seem sexist, they hit the mark for what it takes to be considered a mover and shaker in the corporate world. Face it ladies, unfortunately it is still very much a man's world when it comes to climbing the ladder of success. First impressions are very important. Molloy's recommendations are based on extensive research, interviews and use of focus groups. The book is not his personal comment on what is considered acceptable business attire.After seven months of searching for a better job I read this book and decided to follow Molloy's suggestions for the type of position I was seeking. My next two job interviews resulted in two lucrative offers. A 100 percent response rate.I recommend this book even if some of Molloy's perspectives of women in the workplace may be hard to accept. Look past them and adapt his suggestions to what works best for you."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This is a great book if you want advice on how to make sure your clothing does not stop you getting ahead in a formal and old fashioned work setting. It badly needs updating/rewriting for the 21st century and would now be a waste of money if you were only looking for advice on &quot;business casual&quot; or &quot;dress down&quot; clothing.Most of the book deals with formal work wear and there is very little research on business casual. The information that appears is now 5 years out of date. For example, I would really like to know whether it is still a bad idea to wear pants to work. My observations suggest that the rules have changed since 1995 and that most if not all business casual skirt outfits look wrong -(what do you wear on your legs?- hosiery looks silly and bare legs are inappropriate at work), but whether the minds of the (male) decision makers have also moved on is another matter.Some readers have described the book as sexist. It is not. It describes accurately the sexist attitudes of those who will be judging their female employees' attire and I was grateful that it did so."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Malloy gives advice to women on breaking the secret code that works against them. This world that appears informal (\\"equal opportunity,\\" casual clothes, \\"meritocratic\\") but has secret unspoken and *irrational* rules about who is considered elite, smart, upper and ruling class. Yes, too often we forget that dressing sexy, and/or dressing comfortable, and/or dressing to be a unique individual artist, is different from dressing appropriately as a professional.Also, fat women and minorities and young women should remember that they are judged more harshly. People don't say it, they know they are wrong and irrational and unfair, but they do it. That's really how it is. The world is biased towards upper class people or those who pander to that class.Mr. Malloy, if you are reading this book, I echo the other opinions and suggest these improvements that will make your book only better:1. Add color swatches and photos. You say, wear medium blue no. 7 and most of us have no idea what color that would be. SOme men's clothing guides do this. Some of the photos show texture too. Provide side by side comparison photos of outfits, one that is right and one that is subtlely wrong.2. Since 1996, there has been a sea change in the allowability of pant suits if they hide the butt and are not too \\"trying to be manly.\\" I have seen this change in federal court. In the mid 1990s, I never saw women wear pantsuits. Now I see about a third to a half wearing conservative pantsuits. See also female legislators and CEOs. Surely it's ok now, some of the time?3. Brand recommendations would be useful. However, your point might be that the fashion industry is out to get us, and our honed judgment is the only guide. The only American manufacturers I know of are Brooks Brothers, Anne Klein (the expensive line), and Dana Buchman. There used to be others but they have closed the women's lines.Overall, a harsh, painful but useful guide to navigating through the consumer world."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I'm torn between 4 stars and 3 stars. I read his first Dress for Success book back in the dark ages and went out and bought a man-look-alike grey skirt suit. Wore it twice--could not stand feeling trapped in a cookie-cutter mold.HOWEVER, during my career I always got \\"we know you're an ex-hippie,\\" comments, no matter how I tried. So I'm game to try again, and will use Molloy's calendar to record my attempts.Recently, bought 2 \\"corporate\\" suits as I'm now back to wrk as a successful corporate consultant/entrepreneur company owner. Also bought 2 pair of expensive indoor boots/pumps, in black and in brown.THEN my copy of the new Women's Dress for Success arrived. Must return both suits (waist-length jackets, one suit is black) and the boots. Probably also the mid-calf black wool coat for a kahki, but I'll wait until next winter for that.BOOK SHORTCOMINGS:1. Old--out of date. Anything in the 90's is too old for the new corporate cultures.2.Inexcusable not to have color photos. Even if it is upated every 3 years (since he is not advocating \\"style-of-the-moment fashions) as a photo supplement, it would be invaluable.I am a visual learner, and one photo is worth...well, you know.I would buy regular updates, if new photos were included.3. How about an appendix with tresearch results dates of research? Population size? Setting(corporation? Large--how large?)Results in percentages?The \\"research\\" the book refers to feels like it may be very old, and is not backed up with stats. Feels somewhat like the current G>W>B> White House reports which talk statistics but never give sources. (Sorry, John Molloy).)4. I wonder how many of book rules have changed thee 7 years later? I wonder if rules like*No pants for women\\" \\"No short--waist length--jackets\\" come from CURRENT corporate practice?Could corporate culture for women's dress derive instead from people reading Molloy and adopting his rules? So that like taste-setters in Arts and Crafts houses, instead of leading the wy they became Martha Stewart-like RULE SETTERS, even for what colors and flowers must appear on wallpaper and in gardens.5. His insistence that it had better be expensivee. Good taste often does not mean expensive--good taste can look expensive without being costly. The thing about handbags was a bit offensive--we are not in a style contest or a money contest, remember?UPCOMING --things I likedHis careful detail.Very much liked his Chapter on jackets-and-skirt (as vs. a suit)--I'm so out of it that I was puzzled at a good women's store to find NO suits, just jacket-and-skirs r jacket-and-pants sets.All in all, a valuable book, and I will use it. But I won't buy the next edition unless it has photos and updated research.With photos and new research, I WOULD buy it every year or two --like ZAGAT'S GUIDE for Women's corporate dress!!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Having a baby face, I have a hard time getting people think of me seriously, and on top of that, I am also wearing cute clothes, pretty dresses, and beautiful suits all the time. Sure, people love me, my coworker like me, and my immediate boss think the world of me, but peole up top never recognize my talent. They just think I'm a pretty face in the office, (I'm working in an engineer industry by the way). This book was a godsent to me, I'm glad I picked it up in an old store. Following Molloy's advice, I started to wear more black and dark color, and wearing most conservative /boring stuff. I can see the attitude towards me have changed and I have more respect for what I do now. Thanks Molloy."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This is a very informative book that is a must for a professional woman and even non professional women who want more respect. I have had it for years. I wish he would put out a new one. He supports his conclusions with detailed studies, using lots of people. He covers everything, from hair styles and makeup, to shoes and briefcases.I just checked the statistics, and men are still out earning women! So more women need to read this book!I agree, the jacket is still the hallmark of the American businesswoman. It is worth it to buy a wool suit, as you will spend less time keeping it looking good verses another fabric. If you own one jacket, it should be navy.However, he says not to wear pants unless you must. It looks like pant suits are much more accepted today than 15 years ago.From what I recall, he notes that the briefcase should be brown, but the shoes were best at navy, and who knows the color of the belt. I think it looks better to have the same color leather for those things and black is pretty flexible.You have to read the entire book as acceptable dress is different in different situations."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers - this book probably could, and maybe (maybe) even should be distilled down to less than 50 pages. But the information in here is extremely solid, and smart women everywhere should be introduced to it. That said, yes, if you are used to style books with lots of photos and bullet points, this book may not appeal to you. It lists lots of studies, brings in complex psychological principles, and is generally just not a fast read.I do also sympathize with the reviewers who find this book sexist. But if it is sexist, it's because the world is still sexist, and the rules for getting and retaining respect (especially when you are in management) are different for women than they are for men. Wanna dispute that? Look to the wage gap. I found this book very helpful, but I don't believe, in any way, that sexism is over.I'm really glad I bought and read this book. I kept it on my bookshelf for several years. Like the title of my review said, just knowing the subtle power of the quality, well-cut navy blazer was more than worth the time it took to read the book. The section on the length of coats (and I believe, dresses, too) has also been useful to me."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"If you don't like being told how to dress then this would'nt be the book for you. On the other hand if you like clothes and being successful then you've met your match. As a seventeen years old this book seemed very borring to me, but once you get in to it you discover the other side of business. If you were one of those people who has applied for jobs but never got hired, then this book might be the answer to your prayers. You'll find out that your clothes or hair really might of been responsible, or even the colors you wear. I really enjoyed this book,and so will you!!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"The advice in this book is rather painful. Some paragraphs feel elitist, sexist, ageist, and racist all at once. This is just like the business world. The data is old now, twenty years old. The illustrations are old-fashioned. However, the underlining theme and directions are still relevant today."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"not only was it important for me to read this to get an idea of what to wear to whatever my future job may turn out to be, it was also very fascinating to learn about the different effects that color has on people. the difference between calm and anxious can be a matter of a few shades! i didn't know that! its like a pleasant psychological romp thru a field of colors...dang i'm good."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I am sure that there is good advice in this book..somewhere. Only a man would write a book about dress for women and not include photographs illustrating his points! Am I supposed to guess what a &quot;feminine suit in a mid-range blue&quot; is supposed to lool like? (are we talking Mary Kay feminine or Armani feminine?) Navy and Black are too threatening? Red is too agressive? Dresses are out? Pants are out? No black hose? Good grief, all that's left is something my grandmother would have worn. I wonder how effective I would be wearing something akin to a uniform, and not one I particularly liked? I think that I would come across as false on some subtle level. One thing Molloy said confuses me further: He said that executive women who dress more flamboyantly expect female associates to be more creative in their dress as well. My only question is, how did these women get to be executives if they dress with flair? Surely the whole point of the book is that individuality in dressing is a career killer? Some of Molloy's advice was fairly sane: I won't wear a red jacket to an interview (I'll save it for public speaking) and I'll only wear my short leather skirt for networking with other women. But I'll be darned if I'll give up my ultra-flattering black tailored suit!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Older versions had more illustrations. What happened to them? They were so much more informative. I was disappointed as I got this for my daughter. Otherwise, the advice presented is very accurate and up-to-date."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"When I began reading, the book seemed very dry and boring. Molloy certainly does not write to be lyrical or entertaining. However, I actually found some great advice in his book. I plan to go into law, so all the advice about suits and colors to make people listen to you and cooperate with you were very interesting. I never knew most of it. I especially like how he \\"disproved\\" the idea that looking beautiful or sexy makes a woman successful. I would recommend this book to people who are concerned with getting good jobs and promotions, and are looking for specific advice on how to improve their image."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I appreciate John Molloy's research into business clothing; however, this book is only helpful if you work in a company where clothing is not too casual, or if you need to figure out what to wear for job interviews. If every day is \\"business casual\\" at your job, this book will help you figure out the best colors and quality, but it won't help you understand what to wear. John advocates always wearing a business-like skirt when possible, and always having a jacket on hand. In my job as a computer programmer, where most men where slacks and polo shirts, this would be too formal.The book is somewhat repetitive, but it helps to drill the right attitude into your mind - clothes are important, quality is very important, and navy blue is always a good choice. There are a few black-and-white illustrations, but they seem outdated to me.[...]"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This book was informative and interesting. However, the entire book could have been summarized into one chapter. The first chapter was very interesting. Some of the tips that Molloy described were indeed useful and perfectly logical but gradually, you will start to notice a pattern in Molloy's advice for dressing successfully. From then on, the book becomes repetitive. Unless you are a researcher seeking details, evidence and facts about the way women should dress, reading this book will gradually become a tedious task. In addition, the style of dressing that Molloy describes is outdated. The illustrations in the novel represent the attire of women from the 70s or the 80s. Overall, I thought the information in this book was mostly common sense but I would recommend others to read maybe the first two chapters of the novel. I believe that the information contained in those first few pages will be extremely helpful for women in the working world."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"There is a lot of negative reviews of this book. Apparently women don't want to accept the cold truth about business dressing. Business people make judgements on first impressions. Molloy has studied the habits of executives and tells us what they think. If you look around at women CEOs and and the like, they are dressed just like Molloy describes in this book. They played the game and got to the top. They didn't complain that they couldn't wear certain things--they just did it. In his book he tells you if you don't believe him test it yourself. Dress your way and make notes of how you are treated and the level of respect you receive. Then dress his way and compare the results. Try it--it could be an eye-opener. The only thing this book lacks is photos, otherwise it is a very informative guide."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I have always been complimented on my style of dress, but this book gave me some real gems as to what is appropriate and inappropriate in various situations. I definitely recommend this book to women in the workplace."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"If you are a woman, interested in etiquette, want to raise the amount of respect you receive (or money you make), then get a pen and read this book! But, if you're just looking for something interesting to read, this is your warning! STAY AWAY! This is a book that's meant to be read only if you are going to use the knowledge gained from it, so unless you're ready to take notes for future reference, there are plenty other great books for you to read.NEW WOMAN'S DRESS FOR SUCCESS is a book that gives you step by step directions to being a successful working woman. According to the author, \\"research shows that when a woman dresses for success, it doesn't guarantee success, but if she dresses poorly or inappropriately, it almost ensures failure.\\" Thus, he takes this opportunity to guide woman through everything from language, to make up, accessories, and dress for every occasion from casual days to company outings and dinners. His statements are based on reaserch (first and second hand) and serve to correct stereotypes and inform the average woman of what to do to be treated fairly and put herself on equal footing with a man (especially when it comes to respect, authority and money).While many critics are offended by some of his comments or conclusions. . . those stating that it is better if one is thin, or gets plastic surgery once old, or wears certain things \\"to be on equal footing with a man\\". . . they are the harsh truths of the day to day working world as much as many don't want to accept them, and as unjust as they may be. Furthermore, Molloy's book is based on fact, not personal opinion. He is not propogating plastic surgery or thinnes, but merely stating that those with these qualities get further.Molloy ackgnowledges that there is no one way to be or dress; everything depends on the individual. However, there are more successful ways of carrying yourself, and that is what his book is out to do: help women higher their chances of becoming more successful (based on proven techniques and strategies such as wearing certain colors to get more attention, or others to make your guilty client appear more innocent before a jurry). These are suggestions, that an old fashioned mom would've taught you regarding dress. However, in today's world, Molloy is here to do that and I found it informative especially because I plan to work in the political field.Its only problem is the constant repetition of the same facts. . . and while this may be good if you are really into the book and want the facts to stick. . . I found it annoying. The book should've had better editing and been numerous pages shorter. So, while a pretty quick read, it's a tedious quick read. But once again, if you're out to take notes, this is the book for you! (and it even comes with a calendar in the back to test out his theories for yourself)."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I thought the book New Women's Dress for Success was very interesting and helpful. This book has helped many women realize that the way they are dressing for work is not appropriate. Molloy explains the different fabrics, colors and accessories that will help women to dress for success. Some aspects of dress that seem obvious to some many not be as obvious to others. For example, wearing natural makeup, not dressing too sexy and wearing a jacket are overlooked by many women in the workforce. These dress codes will help women in interviews and to gain more respect and power at the workplace. I found this book very intriguing because I am interested in the business world and Molloy's suggests mostly likely will be very helpful to me in the future. As a high school senior applying to colleges, I can use Molloy's advice about dressing appropriately at college interviews. This book has given me a greater awareness of the importance of woman's dress today and I will be more aware of how my appearance reflects who I am."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"The book has special sections for a jacket, suit, pants, skirts, etc. These sections discuss perception of the garment in terms of its color and cut, as well as give recommendations of complimenting items to the garment. I like the section on jackets with sound analysis almost of every color you may consider for the jacket. As for suits section - it gives more details on the cut, but not many on the color, but I use the same color analysis for the suit as it is offered for jackets.The chapter on different job environment (accountant, lawer, etc.) is really good, but does not mention my industry (steel making, large corporations). In some terms basic ideas on management from this chapter is OK, but more specific sections impress with details.I find as very useful the section on informal dress for offices. It reshaped my attitude to selection of such outfits towards classic cuts and colours (no blue jeans, cozy sweaters, etc.)I highly recommend this book to every women who is interested in her career or at least her professional image. It works. It gives understanding of perceiving colours and their combinations at business situations. For example, dark grey suit (of business style) with white/light blue shirt say that this woman might be a serious person (posture, face and speech expressions should support this notion)."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"All women should read it and do what it says. As a manager, I know what high importance is placed on presentation. In the workplace today, people have become too casual. Why not do all you can to earn more money, gain more respect and be perceived optimally as a professional? It is very easy for women to make wardrobe mistakes at the office today because of the sexy and casual fashions we see in all the stores. This is a bible for the working woman!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Malloy's standards haven't changed since he wrote the first of the series; my only critical remark is that I'd like to see him talk about realtors in Florida.

It is tough to know what to wear when you enter the career world as college graduate. I wasn't sure about my fashion sense until I was given this book. I found it to be just what I needed to step out there on the right foot. I only wish others would read this book and realize there are proper ways to dress in today's corporate world."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I found this book extremely helpful in educating women on how to dress for business. There is no one catch-all formula for dressing for success, and Molloy details effective strategies for women in all career fields. (I also found this book extremely helpful in deciding which careers *not* to pursue because their elitist upper-class \\"rules of the game\\" are ultimately WAY too restrictive and expensive!) Because I happen to be short, voluptuous, dark-skinned, and young, I tend to be either not taken seriously or completely ignored or both, and there are several helpful suggestions here for those who, like, me, have the skills to get ahead but don't have the right genes. The impression you make is far more important than you may realize, and this book will help you to make that impression count *in the way you want it to.*"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Practical advice for any lady who wishes to dress appropriately for business. The advice is on the conservative side, but that is what is successful, isn't it? It would be nice to have an up to date edition in the next several years. Until then, I can't imagine another book with better advice for the working woman who wants to be effective on the job and improve her chances for promotion. If you are a woman, it wouldn't hurt to read New Dress for Success, also by John Molloy, which sets the standards for men's business attire. Both books are very interesting to read, and most helpful for looking your appropriate best in all situations."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This book promises a lot, but when you strip it down to bare essentials, it's actually pretty crappy. It is full of sexist and size-ist stereotypes and while these of course exist in the real world, it is people like him who perpetuate such paradigms.

As a recent college grad (96), I have used my fashion flair to pick out suits on many occasion. Of the five interviews I went to, I received four offers. I believe I would have looked stiff and out of touch had I followed the &quot;directions&quot; in this book!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This manual is not about how a woman should dress for success. It is about how a woman should dress to get approval from her superior, who is assumed to be a male. It only gets worse when the author states that designer handbags are an obvious choice for the businesswoman because they give her the authority to be placed on the same level as a male. In another chapter, the author writes that if a woman has a feminine voice and physique, that a black suit is almost always successful in gaining the acceptance of a man. However, it goes on to say that if the woman is in any way unattractive, the black suit tends to \\"turn men off\\". My first reaction was, when was this book published? To my dismay, I discovered it was in 1996! I simply can not believe that books such as this are allowed to circulate in a corporate environment. Women have struggled long enough to gain acceptance in a culture dominated by males, and we certainly do not need the men of this culture telling us how we should dress."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"John T. Molloy writes a detailed description of the outfits women must wear to get to the top in the business world of today. Along with clothing, Molloy also gives women tips on makeup, hair, accessories, etc...He gives exact tips of colors and fabrics to wear, things that are usually obvious to people in the business world. (example, for an important meeting, you should wear a classic color suit, not neon green!)Molloy's point of view is not one of mainstream america, although he seems to think so, stating at one point that he has \\"millions of fans\\".Molloy also discusses weight issues, and says that if you are not thin, you cannot make it in business. Molloy recommends plastic surgery and says it \\"works\\" ,especially for women over 50.Overall, I detested reading this book. Molloy is egotistical, condescending, and a horrible writer about a topic that is ridiculous to write about in the first place."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This probably is one of my worst purchases on Amazon.com ... it is all text, a few illustrations and just about the most impractical book on women's style ... God help anyone wanting to learn from this book.=============="},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This book is reasonable in its assumptions, and I believe that it really would help some women with their careers. But who really wants to read something all about appearance? Our society is superficial enough, and there is no reason to make it worse by devoting one's time to reading this book. Molloy should write something about helping people to find themselves rather than the appropriate shoe. And I cannot believe that someone wrote a novel entitled &quot;How to Date Young Women : For Men over 35,&quot; and that one of Molloy's books is being sold with it as a special deal. If I was Molloy I would hate to know that someone laughed at me the way that I did when I read that."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"In reading Molloy's book, one could conclude that a woman who thinks that earning a graduate degree, working hard and developing skills is what it takes to get ahead is all wrong. No, what she needs to do (according to Molloy) is to obsess about her looks, starve herself if genetics did not endow her with a thin build and in general market herself as if looks are all that matter. After decades of women working for equality in the workplace, there are still people who think like this?! I believe that women deserve better than this book. True, the advice he gives on appropriate workplace attire is basically sound, but there are many other books out there that give advice just as good, without the sexism and size prejudice."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"This book is exactly right about &quot;business casual&quot; -- it is much harder for women than men. It's also great if you're interviewing or working at a more conservative firm. However, right now I work at a &quot;business casual&quot; company, and I've lived in whole towns where there was no place in the city that required a tie. I wish he had provided more advice for navigating these situtations, since (as he says) they are difficult.I have to agree with some of the reviewers that I don't like many of the rules, but that doesn't mean that they're not accurate. Look through any annual report and find pictures of female board managers/CEOs, and they *are* dressing for success. I don't think Molloy is sexist for reporting the way much of the world is; he doesn't claim it's fair or just."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I was a novice salesperson-- at a time when we were called salesladies. We were referred to as \\"the new lady salesperson\\". Because women in B2B over the road sales was \\"new\\".I remember being hired and my boss told me he didn't want to hear the BS about some guy hitting on me. If I wanted to work in business-- I had to manage my clients. Each firm prided itself n one woman in sales. Clients would ask me to show them my underwear. (I was selling office furniture). I can speak volumes and trust me-- there is a book to be written.There were no sexual harrassment issues. If I brought one I'd have been fired. Young ladies, women of my age have fought for you. Do not take lightly the gift we have given you.This book published was a bible. I am googling it right now because in a recent move I found the Molloy suggested scarf to wear over that perfect navy blue suit. My daughter just graduated as a Finance Major (suma com laude if I can brag). I wanted to send her the scarf-- and a copy of the book. And for her grad present, I bought her a suit that would make Molloy proud-- 3 of them.Ladies when this book was published we were trailblazers. It should be re-published. I go into offices and see ladies making the same mistakes I originally did-- and saying \\"geee these guys don't take me seriously\\". Well darling -- those buttons- are designed to go UP. Zip it.

In fact, it may infuriate you.But if you are interested in learning about some of the most important unwritten rules of the business world, this book tells it like it is. Like it or not, the information in this book is practical and accurate. You can indeed learn to dress and present yourself in a way that makes you more effective, credible and respected in a business or professional setting. It is not difficult, and the rewards can be huge. I have followed the advice in the earlier edition of this book, and found it completely accurate. The current updated version is a bit different, but just as good. Molloy's advice is often ridiculed in the fashion press, but that should not deter you from reading this book with an open mind. The fashion industry tries to sell women the idea that they have \\"arrived\\" in the modern business world, and therefore can now wear any trendy, trashy or sloppy thing they please. If your life were a TV sitcom, maybe that would make sense. But to compete in the real world, you need to show more intelligence in how you invest your clothing dollars.

Yes, some of his comments in the book offended many people, including me! I even thought he may be a sexist &amp; racist. But again this book is NOT based on HIS PERSONAL OPINIONS. I am an overweight female company director and found out people are treating me differently now.(I was size 4 and now almost size 16 after childbirth) This book is very helpful for chosing right wardrobe for business. If you follow his choice, your wardrobe will end up the collections like Talbots, Lands End &amp; Brooks Brothers. Well, not sexy, though.

Many people have been quite critical of this book, saying it is &quot;sexist&quot; or &quot;elitist&quot;. It is not; Malloy is reporting research findings on what images (as pertains to wardrobe) work when one is trying to achieve success. I highly reccommend this book, even if one is in college or grad school; one can at least follow his advice on hairstyle, for instance, or casual clothes, as a way to become accustomed to what will be expected in one's professional field. I have followed his advice on these issues and have been taken more seriously by professors and other students in my MBA program."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"Yes, this book is definitely written by a sexist.

Thanks for the new updated DFS for Women!"},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"The book, New Women's Dress for Success, by John T. Molloy is not a story with a plot. The book is a guide for how women should dress for their different jobs. Molloy asserts that physical appearance is a larger factor in success than women recognize. Although his ideas may be ingredients for success, they also ride the edge of being offensive as he details the values of a male-dominated white, middle- to upper-class society.Mr. Molloy explains that in order to be successful and be treated like you are successful, you must look and behave in a successful manner. The key to looking successful is dressing and acting in an upper class style. For example, he suggests that a woman must wear high quality/expensive clothes, and speak properly. This conveys an image that fits with the business world. \\"If you are not sure, buy the most expensive, traditional model and you will be right 80 percent of the time,\\" says Molloy when discussing how to choose the proper attire for the job.Molloy emphasizes that dressing appropriately for interviews is important in getting the job. He notes and reinforces that there is a double standard depending on whether the interviewer is a man or a woman. \\"If you are being interviewed by a man, it is best to dress as if you already have the job and have even received two promotions.\\" He recommends that when a woman is the interviewer that one should dress for the job for which she is applying. \\"Both men and women doing the hiring rejected women who came looking too cute, too delicate, too feminine, or too sexy.\\" Molloy also notes that poor hygiene, heavy make-up, long nails, and small clothes always are inappropriate and give the image of a lower class look.Molloy makes some recommendations that are good common sense. For example, he says, make-up should look natural and clothes should look professional. He asserts that a jacket always helps to make you look professional and that wool is always the best material. He states that different colors make people see you differently. Lighter shades make you look friendly, while darker shades make you look more intimidating. These seem like good suggestions and are easy to implement for most people regardless of their economic resources.Molloy, however, also addresses issues of weight and for some women this may be both intimidating and offensive. In an ideal world, women would not be treated differently in a business environment because of their weight. \\"There is no getting around it: thin is upper class, thin is beautiful, and thin is in,\\" says Molloy, recognizing that this is not an ideal world and women are discriminated against because of how much they weigh. While Molloy suggests that women should exercise and go on diets, he also makes some suggestions for over-weight women. For example, he discourages tight clothing and light colors.Overall, this book can benefit any businesswoman who is trying to be successful. It will teach her how to increase the likelihood of people treating her as a professional, but she will have to endure the facts of the double standards that exist for women in the marketplace. Despite these issues, Molloy's book will help any woman to be successful."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"I'm a senior in high school and my Economics teacher had given us a booklist, asking us to pick a book and write a report. &quot;New Women's Dress for Success&quot; was on the list.

Molly attempts to provide inofrmation on appropriate dress in the workplace, I found most of it to be common sense. However, if you are interested in what color schemes work best for you then this is a good buy. I appreciated all the research Molly put into his book, it wasn't just based on opinion. Molloy used a lot of specific examples, which helped to prove his assumptions, I enjoyed the short blurb on the women lawyer who wore different colors according to what she would be doing that day (ex: feminine colors when talking to juries).

Overall, I felt that this book had a lot of suggestions to offer for a woman in or entering into the workforce. I would like to think that appearance does not keep an educated and ambitious person from achieving their highest in the workplace, but apparently, we live in a society where it seems almost impossible to not &quot;judge a book by its cover.&quot; I don't know if I would ever take his advice to heart, but after reading New women's dress for success , it will be hard not to think about the suggestions he offered."},{"Title":"New Women's Dress for Success","review":"My boss considers this book to be the absolute truth.

Cut your hair short. Don't show your cleavage. Dress kind or like a man.Sounds pretty basic, but many women don't wear such outfits to work. Perhaps it's because while this is a quick and easy read, there should be more images to show exactly what to wear. Also it's a bit dated by a few decades.

The whole book is simply composed of thouhgts of John Molloy's that he contantly states are proven because of tests and statistics run, but they are results are never told in numbers. For all I know, Molloy's conclusion could be true but the percent may be 51% to 49%, which in the whole scheme of things is true but not really. If Molloy would have added the numbers and more specifc details of what the tests run were, his points may have had a little more validity. Not to mention, the whole book is a generalizations of what a typical buisness person would think of his workers dressesd in a certain way. Not all buisness people may react the same to every style of dressing. Molloy also discuses the effects that being overweight has on a person in the workplace. Molloy's basic statement was that overweight people will have the hardest time getting promoted becasue of their weight. This I found to be totally outrageous and I would love to know where the proof is for this one. Molloy seems to simply assume this because only blank percent of overweight woman are in high paid professions. This may be because overweight people have low self confidence, but I do not bleive that this issue was chekced into or addressed by Molloy. It seems that also of the time Molloy states facts but may not look at the lurking variables which could have affected his tests.

In particular, as an Altoonan, I was disappointed that the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (towering above the city) was listed as the Blair County Courthouse. As most everyone knows (especially one who would publish a book) the courthouse of a community is in the county seat and the county seat of Blair County is Hollidaysburg not Altoona. Dah!!! Granted, it may seem like a trivial matter but how is one to continue with any certainty in reading the captions of the beautiful photographs that show the beauty of Pennsylvania.

For me, there seemed at first to be a disjointedness among the first three or four chapters; however, as I progressed from chapter to chapter, Simon's principle themes continued to unfold ever more clearly. The final chapter on the architecture of complexity ultimately pulled together Simon's thoughts and elaborations from all preceding chapters.In sum, this book is both highly insightful and thought-provoking. Admittedly, I was at first skeptical, due mostly to the various negative reviews posted on Amazon.com; however, having taken the time to read Simon's seminal work, I am truly glad I did. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sciences of the Artificial - 3rd Edition","review":"Let me first say a few words about the writing style. Simon's writing style is quite lackluster. He isn't a great writer like say Bertrand Russell, or George Orwell for that matter. But for the purposes of this book, his style suffices and is perhaps spot-on.Ok my general impression about the book: I think historically it's a groundbreaking book; it's a book written by a visionary; it's a book that at the time must have challenged a lot of people's opinions on a lot of things; in short it's an extremely important book! Having said that, here one needs to ask the all important question, reviewing it as one is, after a gap of more than 40 years since it was first published: Overall, has the book stood the test of time?The answer, surprisingly, is: \`Yes' and \`No'! Some of its insights are still very relevant, while some others are pretty outdated (which makes one wonder why Simon in later editions did not feel the need to say at least a few words about where he had gone wrong, and where he had over-simplified things to an astonishing degree).But before talking about both the great and not so great parts, let me briefly sketch the central idea that Simon has delineated in this book, which in fact drives the entire book. Simply, it can be described as the importance of concentrating upon the interface of a system with its outer and inner environments, without having to understand in detail either the inner or outer environments. In Simon's words, \\"We might look toward a science of the artificial that would depend on the relative simplicity of the interface as its primary source of abstraction and generality\\".Let's start with the parts that he got right. Well, first off, \\"Bounded rationality\\" of course. Simon states that the concept of bounded rationality was used by economists in some domains, even in his day (though he did coin this specific term). But he shows it quite clearly, without being antagonistic, through many examples that the concept of perfect rationality is incorrect, not only in reality (which everyone including its saner proponents accept) but also for practical purposes. Its not even good enough for practice, Simon argues persuasively. It is better to view people as bounded rational agents who adapt and satisfice rather than as perfectly rational agents who can optimize and possess an unrealistic degree of information and computational ability.Simon also says something extremely important that people tend to often forget. He highlights the fact that the debate between markets and hierarchical organizations often misses a very important empirical fact: \\"Roughly eighty percent of the human economic activity in the American economy, usually regarded as almost the epitome of a \\"market\\" economy, takes place in the internal environments of business and other organizations and not in the external, between-organization environments of markets\\". (For other, even more \\"shocking\\" facts about \`free' markets, I would refer the reader to Chomsky's writings). What Simon says about organizations, about centrally planned systems utilizing markets and vice versa, is enlightening to read and merits close attention!Ok, now onto the bad parts. These are ironically the parts for which I know Herbert Simon best: Artificial Intelligence. And it is here that Simon gets it quite wrong; his vision quite flawed and again, I would say, it is quite strange that he didn't deem it fit to acknowledge his mistakes in later editions.Simon gets the abstraction terribly wrong in his ideas about the human mind. The same idea of artificial systems having simple interfaces, that works (or can work) in the sphere of human economic activity, at that particular level of abstraction, simply cannot and doesn't work when applied to the creative use of the human mind. As Simon says in this book, (and as others from the group of \`cognitive revolutionaries' Chomsky, Miller et al would also say), the mind can be represented as an information processing system. But in line with the theme of the book, he feels that the mechanisms inside this information processing system are simple adaptive rules. His example of an ant finding its way back home is indicative of how extremely wrong he went with this kind of thinking. I quote:\\"In the case of the ant (and for that matter the others) we know the answer. He has a general sense of where home lies, but he cannot foresee all the obstacles between. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the difficulties he encounters and often detour uncrossable barriers. His horizons are very close, so that he deals with each obstacle as he comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it, without much thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap him into deep detours. Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular, complex, hard to describe. But its complexity is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant\\" Say what!?Let me just state, as a matter of FACT, how ants (or other insects) do path integration is still not clear, to this very day. To make a very long point short, so that its clear to the reader where Simon gets it wrong: Even if there was no beach, even if the path to home ended up tracing a straight line, even then there would be much complexity inside the ant. The complexity of the beach pales in comparison to the complexity of what is going on inside the ant. How is it that it integrates such different cues as sun position, leg movement etc, etc, is still unknown. This is where, I feel, as far as AI is concerned, Simon's whole abstraction, his central idea, his edifice (of artificial systems) falls apart.How could a visionary like Simon go so awfully wrong? I think the answer is pretty simple. I believe it stems from the nave hopes that he (and others) had for AI, namely, simple adaptive mechanisms could give rise to \\"intelligence\\". I feel that what he said on this subject stemmed from his exuberance for AI, which can be described thus: \\"If the mind is an artificial system with simple adaptive rules, then we shall soon invent \\"intelligent\\" machines as well. It's only a matter of time people!\\"So in short, I think it was his excitement about the birth of AI, which led him to his mistakes. Like many early ambitious AI theorists, he probably must have felt that \\"intelligent\\" machines were just around the corner.Having said that, is Simon to be blamed alone? Here's what one of my favorite scientists, the granddaddy of computing, Alan Turing says in his famous paper: \\"Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmed\\"So we see that it is Turing who should be \\"blamed\\" for the early naive exuberance for AI. He hopes that a child's mind would be more or less a blank slate with some basic, simple mechanism. (Remember, it has to be simple so that we can program it quickly, and get our \\"intelligent\\" machine ready before Christmas ). Of course now we know better. By now it's understood that even for very simple biological traits it's \\"fiendishly difficult,\\" to quote a recent advanced text, to discover the genetic basis.Coming back to the book, all in all, it is a book that I would recommend highly, primarily for its historical importance, but also for the many insights that are still relevant today! In the end I would use Simon's words (and overall sentiments) that he used to describe rational action economists, to describe his own book: Heroic but flawed!"},{"Title":"The Sciences of the Artificial - 3rd Edition","review":"in 2008, this work is primarily of historical interest. simon suggests a scientific approach to design, claiming one has existed since the mid-1970's - in retrospect, a highly suspect if not thoroughly rejected claimregardless, simon was a visionary and some of his insight is still relevant. the focus on the \\"outer environment\\" - the context of usage - to navigate the space of possible designs is a foundation of contemporary design dogma. similarly, attention to the natural cognitive capabilities of human beings (short term memory, importance/difficulty of interruptions, etc) finds a warm home in current human-centered design practicesotherwise, without notable exception, the \\"examples\\" are abstract, ridiculous and/or hackneyed caricatures. the language is abstract, wordy, repetitive, and difficult to follow. simon writes with a computer scientist's sensitivity to humanity, using identical terms to describe both a computer's information-processing and a human's intelligence (eg, p110, \\"a scientific account of human cognition describes it in terms of several sets of invariants. first, there are the parameters of the inner environment. then, there are the general control and search-guiding mechanisms that are used over and over again in all task domains...\\"). the work exhibits a techno-fetishist's faith in the power of computers and software - referencing them repeatedly (and unbelievably) to explain how human intelligence worksi only recommend this book to someone interested in the history of design and/or technology. for purposes of learning about design, i highly recommend something newer and better"},{"Title":"The Sciences of the Artificial - 3rd Edition","review":"I am really enjoying reading this book.

Steve"},{"Title":"Inner Skiing","review":"I have been reading this book for about twenty years(first publication was November 1977); it was the first of two Inner Game books which, although differing in details, both transformed my attitude to and my performance in the sports I love. I was fortunate to have been given it by a patient who was an Inner Game instructor (or rather, facilitator). If Inner Skiing has only now (1997) become widely available, thanks to the Internet, a generation of British skiers has lost out; for years it has been available only in the USA and to members of Inner Game workshops. With examples from life and from Inner Skiing workshops which are encouraging, inspiring, and often emotionally touching, the book helps skiers of all standards to confront their fears and to tap into the mind's and the body's unconscious store of knowledge and skills; the fears of &quot;flying&quot;, falling, speed, injury, failure, and the fear of looking stupid; the knowledge locked into Gallwey's Self 2, a Self which, he teaches us, is ours too. Where his Self 1 is trying, tense, unsure, scared and controlling, Self 2 is free, relaxed, effortless, powerful, and instinctive. Gallwey and his co-author Bob Kriegel, a more experienced skier than he and a psychologist, equip their readers with simple but highly effective keys to Self 2, enabling us increasingly to find in skiing the exhilaration of the breakthrough run, and unlocking the confidence without which the sport can be an exercise in anxiety. Most of us in the UK only get to ski once a year. I reread Inner Skiing annually as an essential pre-ski exercise, and if I don't read every word I never fail to take a dose of inspiration from the paragraph in the last chapter which begins &quot;Inside us all is a mountain with no top and no bottom. The skiing there is perfect. The snow is made of pure peace and there is not a trace of Self 1 interference.................Skiing this inner mountain has the power to satisfy the human longing to know oneself and the reason for which one was born.&quot; You may guess from this that Timothy Gallwey's is the inner game of life, with applications far beyond the realms of sport, as his other writing attests. Dr. Basil Lee, London, England."},{"Title":"Inner Skiing","review":"I rad Inner Skiing about 6-7 years ago, and it changed my skiing life. Most everything written about skiing (and other sports, as far as I can tell) is about technique, tricks, how-to's and so on. Inner Skiing is about being a skier - about the fundamental relationship we have to the snow, the mountain, the skis and ourselves.Discovering who I am as a skier (and what my fears, my doubts, my anxieties look like) have exploded this sport for me. This book works on the emotional, intellectual and physical levels - I use the discovery tools on myself, and with my students, and get incredible results.Even if you don't ski, this book is great - I've used some of his approaches in many areas of my life. They're fun, they're doable, and they help me focus on what's really there, not what I imagine. And beyond that, they open up incredible opportunities to play, explore and have a great time on the slopes or off.The earlier edition of the book poo-pood technique - I don't agree with that, and my sense is the book took a bit of a hit for that. There's things to learn about skiing, and taking lessons from a great instructor will make a huge difference whether it's your first day or you've been at it for decades. Nonetheless, I recommend this as book #1 for anyone who wants to ski, or who wants something more from their skiing. ANd for the instructors out there - read it!"},{"Title":"Inner Skiing","review":"I received the first edition as a present at Christmas 1977 from my mother, a pioneering 1940's skier who hung up her skis long ago. I had just come from living 2 years in Grenoble and I was a pretty good \\"technique\\" skier. I looked at the title and cover, thought to myself \\"Oh great, more Zen mumbo jumbo from the 'hot tub - peacock feathers - I'm so into myself' set\\", thanked her politely, and shoved the book into my ski dufflebag and promptly forgot about it. A few weeks later, I was eating breakfast in my little Tahoe cabin, and I cracked the book open and read the first twenty pages. Those pages resonated with me all day on the slopes -- when I got home, I spent the entire evening and half the night with the book. As other reviewers have said, it forever changed my skiing life and even spilled over into my \\"real\\" world life as well. Since this book really is \\"Zen and the Art of Skiing\\", I'll stop here because the first rule of Zen is it cannot be explained in words, only in the doing. In the past 30 years, I have given this book as a gift several times, with always the same rather earth-shaking positive reaction. I'm here at Amazon to pick up a copy for my teenage son (can't find my old dog-eared copy, but it's around somewhere). I recommend this book for any age and any level of skiing, from beginner to \\"everyone watches when s/he comes down the hill\\". If you're a beginner, you'll avoid a lot of \\"noise\\" in getting to the pleasure of skiing. If you're an expert, you'll marvel at how much additional pleasure you can get from skiing just by eliminating some baggage.

You just have to work on shutting up the 'Self 2' that continually barks comments, judgements, technical tips, abuse or detrimental thoughts all the time.I tend to push myself in most sports, but this book helped me channel that energy into something more constructive and pragmatic.

Here's just one example (I hope you're sitting down for this):(from page 174) \\"Remember this: When reasoning is valid, then it is unlikely or impossible for the conclusion to be false IF the reasons are true. Thus, reasoning can be shown to be invalid by showing that it would be a genuine possibility for the conclusion to be false even if the reasons were true...\\"This is just one mercifully short example of how this author gets his highschool-level book to achieve the thickness of a college-level text.

But I ended up reducing that because the author decides to use examples, in the text, that hint at a political agenda. His decision to use the power he has (being assigned as a mandatory text in some college courses) to promote a political/moral ideology in a book that should be an unbiased learning tool for serious students knocked him down to 1 star.The fact that there is not even a hint of the author's academic credentials to be found anywhere in the book makes it look like his uncle must be an executive at Prentice Hall.
