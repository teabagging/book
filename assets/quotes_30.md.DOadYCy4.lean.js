It is also full of internal searching and psychological exploration.The story, in a linear sense, tells of a new captain on a ship in the Far East. He is not yet familiar with his vessel or crew. Instead of establishing rigid routine and discipline, as one would expect, he starts his leadership off with some bending of the rules and norms. This allows him to then discover what he believes to be a headless corpse floating alongside his boat. The corpse is, in fact, a living man, who comes on board, and under the captain's protection finds some reprieve from his sin.On the surface, one would think this story an adventure yarn with some vague psychological elements. In reading about Conrad's life and demeanor, though, it is clearly about much more. Conrad, himself, was born in Poland, lived on the high seas, and took up residence in England. He was a man caught between different worlds, different standards. He seems to deal with some of this as he compares the loose-cannon captain with the questionable stowaway. They are ghosts of each other, he implies, doubles in many ways. Is Conrad questioning his own moral nature? The darkness within? Is he pondering leadership and manhood and how it is defined by capricious decisions? Why is the captain willing to risk the lives of his entire crew for the sake of one somewhat guilty man?There are many questions amidst this fun read. I enjoyed the writing, the story--even if it has the late 1800s tendency to tell such tales secondhand, through a removed storyteller."},{"Title":"The Secret Sharer and Other Stories","review":"The Secret Sharer is a good novelle about an English sea captain on his first command.

I would have been completely lost if it were not for the helpful introduction written by Albert Guerard. I read the introduction after reading the story, and it shed a lot of light on the book. Though I did not enjoy the book, I am impressed with the man behind the book- I cannot believe that English is his second language.

This book has a good philosophy behind it that says requirements and processes are important in testing. However, the book presents the information in a way that people in organizations that may not have firmly defined requirements or processes can still easily apply the techniques described in the book.There was a lot for me to like about this book. First, there is a wide coverage of test and test-related topics. There are many topics in software testing - just go to a testing conference to see some of the possibilities. Tamres does a good job in covering the major topics in a way that leaves the reader with an understanding of what's needed for software testing. Second, the book is appropriate for testers at all levels. Although the title is \\"Introducing Software Testing,\\" I would not dismiss it too quickly as being a book just for beginners. I have been a full-time tester and trainer in testing for 14 years and still learned valuable things from this book. Third, there is adequate detail. I never left any topic asking \\"why?\\" or \\"how?\\". The level of detail is a good balance between readability and having enough detail to explain the topics. For every topic, there are multiple examples of how to apply the techniques described in the book. These examples show realistic ways the techniques would be applied in an actual project. Finally, the book is based on proven and practical techniques. The techniques shown in the book are the same ones that testers have been using for many years, but having them in one book is a great thing. The techniques are easy to understand and apply. I'm all for creative and new techniques for testing, but for foundational approaches that have been proven to work and to scale for large projects, I like to keep firmly grounded in good practices.I can highly recommend this book to anyone in testing, whether you are the poor soul that has been assigned to test your company's latest project and know nothing about testing, or if you are a test manager looking for a resource to build your team's skills. This book covers the major topics in testing in a way that promotes process-driven and requirements-based project structures, but the techniques can be used in any project environment. This is a must-have book for your technical bookshelf."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"Teaches good habits to new testers, and offers much to experienced test professionals. I cannot imagine a better introductory book for software testers because this much needed text bypasses the theory that similar books inundate you with and goes straight to the essence of what testers spend most of their time doing: writing test plans and developing test cases. In fact, the first chapter (Tackling the Testing Maze) is the roadmap for the rest of the book, as well as the test process itself. The approach is modern in that it's aligned to iterative development life cycles, which is based on eight stages:1. Exploration2. Baseline test3. Trend analysis4. Inventory5. Inventory combinations6. Boundaries7. Data8. Stress the environmentWhat I like about this book is the no-nonsense approach to developing a test outline from which the test plan(s) and test cases will be derived, and the way that this documentation is aligned to the real world. For example, due diligence in the form of meticulous attention to sign-offs and authorities to proceed is emphasized. This alone is a common failure point in many test organizations. I also like the way that the realities of the project are highlighted, especially the interactions with the development team and the integration of project considerations into the process - in particular, the schedule constraints that all testers must juggle while meeting quality goals.Other areas that make this a realistic look at testing include the chapters on object-oriented and web testing, and the inclusion of security testing - especially the latter which has been neglected in many advanced books and is an important, but overlooked, aspect of the full test suite.Because this is an introductory text the author uses case studies and copious examples to illustrate and reinforce concepts and activities. But most important, the focus is on activities that reflect what testers do and theory only when required. This makes the book interesting and will give to anyone who follows the approach solid skills that will increase their worth to their team as well as dramatically increase their professional knowledge and skills.For new testers this is probably the most important book you can buy. If you're a test manager you'll find this book to be an ideal training tool, and if combined with Systematic Software Testing by Rick D. Craig and Stefan P. Jaskiel will give you a complete reference library. The approach in the Craig and Jaskiel book is completely consistent with the approach in this one, making both books all the more valuable."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"It is impossible to perform effective software testing without an enormous amount of organization. To develop this required level of organization, you must plan, plan and plan. Before that can happen, you must preplan to organize the development of the plan. This is done by using descriptive tools such as state diagrams, spreadsheets and matrices. Using such tools to manage software testing is a complex act, and the main point of this book is showing you how to use them.As a mathematician, I was delighted to see the section on reducing test cases, where the authors describe how to break the feature set down into equivalence classes. In mathematics, an equivalence class is the group of all values that behave the same when operated on. Therefore, in software testing, the examination of one case will be testing all others in the equivalence class. However, this is not as easy as it may appear at first. Two different features may behave the same for one input, but react quite differently when accepting a different one.Testing the two main areas of modern software, object-oriented software and web applications, is covered. Many of the difficulties of performing tests that are reasonably complete are examined in detail. For example, the many possibilities as a consequence of the keys that can be pressed to enter data into a textbox are examined. Unusual possibilities such as function keys, control characters, and backspace/delete are put forward as possibilities to consider. While they may not be a concern, such keystrokes should be considered and eliminated or dealt with whenever data is to be entered.The mathematical laws of combinatorics prevents us from ever examining anything more than a small subset of all possible ways our software can be used. Our only hope is to test a \\"meaningful subset\\" of those possibilities, which is a set that we can test in our time window that covers the largest number of most likely scenarios. The information in this book will help you two ways. It will help you increase your efficiency so that you can cover more options and also show you many of the options that are more likely and those which are equivalent to the highest number of scenarios of use."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"This is a good book for starters if you are new to the QA arena. I really found this a good source to better organize my thought process and isolate what level of testing I need to focus on. Test cases was a big thing for me. Learning to create repeatable tests, something that can eventually be automated was important. I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"I used this book to prepare for the ISEB exam. It is a good overview of testing but not thorough enough to properly prepare you for the exam."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"I'll readily admit at first I was 'lost' in the first two chapters, lost in the thought I really didn't need to know the intricate workings of the US tax system or of how a cooker was intended to operate. But stopping and reflecting on the thought that this is a book to introduce you to testing and the relevancy of it becomes clear.For experienced testers or test managers the bulk of the material may already be known, but consider the extensive references and the very useful appendices, then this book provides not only a good grounding for the test team but also a valuable reference book for experienced testers and managers.Is it useful or just theory? I'd hazard a guess that marked improvement in test effectiveness would be achieved just by applying \\"2.3.2 Test categories\\" as a form of checklist. Add in the rest of the books contents and we have an essential book that's sitting well along others such as Whittaker/Thompson's How To series."},{"Title":"Introducing Software Testing (ACM Press)","review":"Finally! A book that answers the real questions about testing: how to write and manage test plans.I had despaired of finding a good book that reflected the real work testers do, which is analyzing, strategizing and writing. Indeed, the act of testing is only the tip of the iceberg of the testing process and this book shows how to do what testers do, and do it the right way.What makes this book so special is the way Louise Tamres shows the big picture in the introductory chapter, then leads you through the process of creating and refining test outlines that are used to develop test cases. This is the most confusing part of testing for anyone who has been thrust into that role, and is made more confusing because many companies don't have standards. The few times I have had to function as a test analyst there was no agreed upon approach, and it was like the blind leading the blind. This book will prevent that from ever happening again because it clearly shows what needs to be done and how. I like the way that simple test management tools like spreadsheets are used, because a lot of books on the subject cite very expensive test tools that are outside the budget of small companies. This makes the book realistic and practical. I also like the way each chapter is summarized, and the cases and examples are used to make the information real to the reader.While the book shows how to develop the plans and test cases it also shows basic test techniques, including testing various software environments (web, object-oriented, performance and load, and end-to-end). These are like a compass to the new tester because they give a direction. I also like the way that associated activities, such as project and configuration management are included because these, too, are things that the new tester needs to be aware of.If you're new to testing get this book and keep it nearby. If you are experienced, you'll still learn a lot from the book."},{"Title":"The news twisters","review":"Using an exquisitely straightforward and repeatable methodology (counting and reporting on the verifiable actions of others) Efron clearly demonstrated the left leaning bias in the mainstream media's reporting of political elections.All one has to do is read the book and then start counting how many times a candidate is shown smiling, talking to a large appreciative audience, kissing a baby, etc and you will be on your way to updating Enron's work.Would CBS have tried to kill the opinions of an author? Of course not.

The result was clear that the networks devoted _far_ more time to the Democratic candidate.But she didn't stop there -- she transcribed the recordings and _counted_words_, even analyzing the emotional content of the vocabulary used to describe both candidates. The result again was that the media characterized the Democrat more often positively and the Republican negatively.Was the book the genesis of claims that the media are biased? Perhaps.

For a long time I've been in search of a book like this one. There are widely known books, like \\"A Course in Probability Theory\\" by K-L Chung and \\"Foundations of the theory of probability\\" by Kolmogorov, which are great but require strong background in probability and mathematics. On the other hand, there are numerous books for beginners and most of them are, however, just good enough for getting things done. These books won't let you prepare for advance study of the subject. In fact, most of these elementary books will somehow let you feel that probability is all about applying correct formula of probability and that of permutation & combination. But the subject has much more than just permutations. A foundation on probability cannot be on strong unless you understand the physical significance of each assignment you do, each axiom you learn. This fine book by Grinstead and Snell has done a great deal in teaching probability from basics and in enabling readers to have independent thoughts and broader perspectives as one progresses.My recommendation to aspiring beginners or to anyone self-learning, is to take this book sincerely, and when you'll be at a certain level (may be halfway through this book) start reading the book \\"An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications\\" volume 1 by W Feller, as well.

What a disappointment it was, from the disturbing cover art to the 50's clip-art illustrations to the hodge-podge, disorganized text. In a series of repetitive, higgledy-piggledy chapters, the author recommends the reader read specific children's books in order to \\"notice\\" a single thing about them (eg \\"See how Gene and Phinny are best friends--who turn out not to know each other at all\\") and gives assignments which mostly have to do with keeping a journal of memories from one's own childhood... and then she makes one of the most appalling errors I've seen in the literature on children's literature.On page 125, she writes that Harry Potter is \\"bullied by Malloy and Snipes\\". Now I can understand not liking Harry Potter enough to read it, but in that case, why use it as an example? And surely the name of Snape, if not Malfoy, has entered the zeitgeist by now to the extent that most people know it? This was where she finished losing me.She began losing me on the page where she suggested that the hopeful writer visit a school and ask lots of questions about the children's daily schedule. I've worked in the public school system. A person who did this would probably excite quite a bit of suspicion and might end up getting a visit from the police.The book may contain material that is new to a beginner, but the difficulty of ferreting it out may daunt some readers.

I didn't have a scientific background at the time, had worked in tourism for five years at that point.I think you can easily skip the technical bits and focus on the excitement of the discoveries.

The stories that are in it that are true (I don't know about finding a Journal in the rubble) are great fun to read; the description of breakfast was very accurate too - Croutons instead of toast - and I'll add \\"fruit juice\\" that was more like a smoothie because of all the pulp in it.

Her grandmother had sought passion in the arms of many men, and explains that for the diary to surface now would cause harm to important families. Jenna has possession of one of the diaries, and the other lies concealed in a desk that had been sold to rancher Sam Winchester.Little does Jenna suspect her own unawakened passion. She pours her gifts into her music, having become a concert violinist. So Jenna arranges to help in Sam's fund raising project for a local hospital in return for experiencing ranching first hand for two weeks. She does not dare risk Sam discovering her true reasons for being at his ranch. But from their first encounter, Jenna's desires become a powerful motivation to discover far more than the hidden diary.Author Karen Anders pens a sensual treat with THE DIVA DIARIES. The glimpses into the diaries are sensual and intriguing, providing a powerful backdrop to newly awakened passion. Jenna's journey of self-discovery contrasts sharply with Sam's disillusionment, proving they both have a lot to learn about themselves, each other, and love. The resulting tale proves Anders's gift for vividly realizing a fun, sensual tale with memorable characters and interesting toys that lend the novel a breathtaking intensity. THE DIVA DIARIES come highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Diva Diaries (Harlequin Blaze, No 74)","review":"Beginning to end, the book was great, as was the passionate scene in the stormy hills. Now that was lovely! Many scences were beautiful, naturistic, emotional. The plot was of the heroine's grandmother dying and asking her to find her old desk in which she tucked away a diary of intimate experiences in her youth and some erotic jewlry. These could ruin the families of the fine men mentioned in the diary. So the understanding heroine, Jenna, tracks down the auctioned desk, traveling across the country to search through it for the items. That's when she meets the hero, and must keep from him the fact that she's snooping in what's now \\"his\\" desk. I read this with alot of suppressed love boiling over in my heart at the time, so everytime I came across affection and a love connection expressed in this book (which was often and in a convincing way) I cried a little. The part where Jenna plays in concert was almost amazing because of the way the author described the melodies emanating from the violin and affecting Sam. Sam was very encouraging, supportive, respectful, without being mushy - and she was all the same to him. They amazed eachother with their strong solitary selves, especially with the things they had in common they never expected. They are different, yet so alike. They connect from the start, the road to their love not really being bumpy at all, because it was filled with mature understanding, observation, respect. It was pure and real. No games, no pains. I like that very much in a book and relationship. To me, it's one sweet little keeper, due to high regard and affection I harbor for it's realism. I can't forget it and look forward to reading it again. It was very sexy, the scenes in the barn. There was even a very surprising, yet sad and amazing, scene about a beloved cow. Oh, it was a funny book too! And the storms were wonderful, as were the animals mentioned. There was much in it for me to like, so I'm grateful to have read it. It was my second Blaze ever.

Although definitely not a sequel to the first \\"Hollywood\\" book, \\"Hollywood Husbands\\" is the first in a long line of novels Collins would write with the word Hollywood in the title and with Hollywood as the backdrop.In \\"Hollywood Husbands\\" we meet several men who are as different as any male species could ever be. All though are caught up in the fast lane of Tinsletown and battling the terrible bug of financial and critical success in an industry that not only destroys career in the drop of a hat, but also ruins souls.First up is Jack Python who produces a talk show and is involved with an Oscar-winning actress, but finds money and women are not enough. Then we have Howard Soloman who owns a studio. Having three divorces to his credit he is currently married to a creature that spends money faster than a lighting bolt. My favorite character is Mannon Cable who has sex appeal and charm and is a superstar. He's having a hard time dealing with his past divorce and it's up to his current wife to salvage him.These three men are all friends and their lives are forever changed when a young, beautiful model from New York enters their lives. The question is, \\"will they survive?\\".Fun, engrossing and highly entertaining I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Hollywood Husbands\\" and found myself at the end wanting to read more about these characters.

HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"Collins Jackie: 0330297228 Hollywood Husbands","review":"but it was still worth the read. Jackie Collins always knows how to write a fast paced book,and this certainly is no exception.Hollywood Husbands main characters are: Jack Python, whose one hour weekly talk show is THE show to watch on tv; Howard Solomon is the head of Orpheus Studios and has a lot of power behind the camera; and Mannon Cable is an actor who is still in love with is ex wife Whitney, another super star in her own right. However, Mannon is currently married to a bimbo named Melanie-Shanna, who he married to make Whitney jealous.The plotlines revolve around these characters, with a cast of many others including a dynamic character named Silver Anderson. Her storyline alone makes this book a good read!I had a hard time getting into this book when I first started reading it. It wasn't that the pace was slow, but I couldn't figure out where the plot line was going. Too many characters to keep track of in the beginning, but I soon found myself immersed in the story lines.This may not be my favorite Jackie Collins novel, but I hope those of you who chose Hollywood Husbands as your first Jackie Collins novel try one of her better books, such as the Lucky Santangelo novels, and you'll see why Jackie Collins' fans are hooked."},{"Title":"Collins Jackie: 0330297228 Hollywood Husbands","review":"This Is the first Jackie Collins book that I have read.

I'm very dissapointed by this book, I suppose the ending won't change my point of view.Buy It If you a fan of Jackie's, otherwise its a time waster!"},{"Title":"Collins Jackie: 0330297228 Hollywood Husbands","review":"I read this book in the Spanish version, to improve my command of Spanish. That part was worth it. The book is called Maridos de Hollywood. In English, I wouldn't waste the time. What's the point? There is no point, unless it's Jackie Collins idea of entertainment, apparently shared by those who buy her books. There are some long, drawn-out tales of parallel lives, but no very deep insights, only surface stuff, maybe what Ms. Collins believes Hollywood is like itself. In this book, she writes some interspersing chapters, all in italics, about a female pyromaniac, who is abused by various males in her life and some females also. When she gets pushed too far, she lights a match and it's &quot;hasta la vista, baby,&quot; to her antagonists. This is the climax of the books: she lights up the big guy's yacht on New Year's Eve, and four deaths (and some supposed heroics) result. But who is this mystery woman? Unless I missed it in the Spanish version, we never find out. So what's the point? Just to keep you guessing, I guess. The Spanish translation was interesting, since the translator took pains to literally translate idiomatic expressions. I'm glad I read it for that reason, but for the content? Forget it!

I can't believe this book has finally been reprinted after such a long time! I first read this book when I was 11 (I am now 16) and have loved it ever since. I first found the books in a library but when I went to look for the series in bookstores, all I could find was the second book,&quot;A gathering of Gargoyals&quot;. When the series in the local library somehow disappeared, I was totally davastated! I asked lots of bookstores bout the series, but found out that it was out of print. I have never seen the series since.( Partly because I moved out of the country at 12.) I searched for this book in Amazon Books only out of curiosity, never really expecting to find it.

Hope you like the book!!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book is the first in the Darkangel Trilogy, and I think it's one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. Aeriel is a character that you learn to love, not only 'cuz she's the main character, but also 'cuz she's so compelling. These books are a little bit difficult to understand at first, but eventually you get the hang of them. Example: one revolution of Oceanus = a daymonth. In A Gathering of Gargoyles, we follow Aeirel across the Sea-of-Dust and across the lands meeting different characters and learning of the magic in the land. It ends with an odd 'edge-of-the-precipice' feeling, but is eventually picked up in the third book: The Pearl of the Soul of the World. This third book is the one I read the fastest, it concludes everything that's been building up and has an ending that you wouldn't expect. I think Meredith Ann Pierce did an amazing job with this trilogy, on question I have though: Was it intended to be a trilogy? If you look at the copyright dates, you'll notice that six years went by between the second and third books. Oh well, no biggie, they're still really well written and a compelling story to journey into. I highly recommend these to anyone who is into fatasies/suspence books. These are awesome!!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Besides a few negative reviews about this book, I was shocked when I read it! By all the five stars I saw I thought it was going to be the young adult novel of the year. In fact, when I picked it up at the library I was surprised not to see a Newberry Medal on the cover;now I realize why. I found that Darkangel was quite boring, and the details were there when I least cared about more information, and not there when I craved it. Not only that, but the author seemed to be writing for young children, and not for young adults. I realize that sometimes it's good, and somewhat pleasing to include youth plots and be based out of a fairy tale. I mostly enjoy those kind of books, but this one I couldn't stand to read, and only finished it for a feeling of completion. It was very bland, and matter of fact. Much like my old language arts teacher used to say, it should be a shower, and not a teller. I gave this novel three stars only because I thought the plot was amusing, but could have been brought out to it's full extent of pleasure if only there was another author interpreting it. I fail to understand how this book got an average of five stars."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I, too, was sucked into reading this trilogy because of the many glowing reviews of this book. I was expecting something spectacular, especially since I absolutely loved &quot;The Woman Who Loved Reindeer.&quot; While the premise was alluring--vampires of the soul, gothic romance, dark velvet landscape--the execution of the novel was truly disappointing.Aeriel is an unconvincing and petulant heroine; she does nothing for herself (everything seems to fall conveniently into her lap) and worse, she stubbornly refuses to realize things that are right in front of her very nose (&quot;No, I can't be his sister, that's just impossible!&quot;).I agree with those who say the book is boring; it is boring because the plot is dull and predictable, and the prose does little to hide this fact. Even books with no plot try to make up for it with dazzling prose; Pierce's compound nouns like &quot;earthlight&quot; and &quot;daymonth&quot; only irritate the reader. In essence, nothing at all happens in the first novel, little more happens in the second, and the third is just disappointing. The huge battle scene at the end takes all of maybe five pages, and the climactic confrontation with the evil Witch another two, and the resolution of the novel is wholly unsatisfying. You come out of this book feeling more starved than you began.And for those who ask, Pierce's &quot;daymonth&quot; system means that the time it takes for the sun to travel from east to west is about two weeks (a fortnight) in our time. Two weeks of light and two weeks of darkness makes a month, but the earth has only made one revolution. Thus the daymonth. A confusing and unnecessary complication, I know."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"One of those hybrid sort of books. Throw in fantasy, horror, and a bit of SF, and see what you get. Something like a little of the later Tepper, perhaps.

Unfortunately, it wasn't at all what I expected. I expected great detail, especially about the darkangel himself, but never got any. The darkangel made few appearances, and the detial wasn't the best. Even the writing seemed a little awkward at times...truthfully, I think that many of the sentences weren't even written correctly. However, even when I got through half of the book and nothing extremely interesting had happened, I still allowed myself to hope, because for some reason the writing drew me in, as did the plot. This plot had so much potential, but the writer really fell short. I was really dismayed at the lack of interaction between the main character and the darkangel!Overall, it wasn't that bad of a book, it just didn't meet my expectations: I just wish the story had been told a bit better.

I am a huge fan of fantasy, and this yarn was just a bit thin for me.Meredith Pierce has a unique story telling voice that others may find enduring but I found rather tiring. Her descriptions were not very clear, yet redundant at the same time. If you don't know what I am talking about, here is a quote from the book on pg.58 that illustrates what I mean. \\"'It must be amazement,' thought Aerial, 'That I am spinning, for I am amazed to be spinning at all.'\\"In one sentence, she used the word \\"spinning\\" and \\"amaze\\" twice and you still have no clear image of what's going on. The wording in this book prevented me from seeing pictures and images in my head becuase half the time, I was trying to decipher what she was trying to convey!I have to admit, I stopped reading the book at about a quarter of the way through.. I couldn't put up with the frustration anymore. Perhaps if I had read the thing the whole way through, it might have redeemed itself.And then again, perhaps I am just a very picky reader and you may find that you LOVE the book. This is just my two cents."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Meredith Ann Pierce published &quot;The Darkangel&quot; in 1982, well before the current 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' craze. Pierce's heroine, Aeriel is kidnapped by a darkangel to spin and weave for his twelve-and-one bride-wraiths, whose blood he has drained and whose souls he has imprisoned in his necklace. He needs to find a fourteenth bride and go through a final blood-sucking, soul-stealing marriage ceremony before he can become a true vampyre.Luckily, Aeriel doesn't strike him as bride-material: &quot;'You?' he cried, and Aeriel's heart shrank, tightened like a knot beneath the bone of her breast. 'You be my bride? By the Fair Witch, no. You're much too ugly.&quot;The darkangel himself is quite something to look at:&quot;Then he opened his wings, and Aeriel found she could not move for wonder. Before her stood the most beautiful youth ever she had seen. His skin was pale and white as lightning, with a radiance that faintly lit the air. His eyes were clear and colorless as ice. His hair was long and silver, and about his throat he wore a chain: on fourteen of the links hung little vials of lead.&quot;To continue with the story, the beautiful darkangel flew forth from his castle to find a princess, and instead found Aeriel, the mud-bud (an appellation borrowed from Carol Burnett's retelling of &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;).&quot;The Darkangel&quot; resembles &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; in that Aeriel is a sort of 'bride-in-disguise.' The aspiring vampyre doesn't realize that he wants to marry her until after she has made friends with his previous thirteen wives, suborned his vicious gargoyles, escaped from his castle, and almost got him killed by a Lunar lion.I can't give away any more of the plot, but I'd like to add that you need to be in the right frame-of-mind to truly appreciate the beauty of &quot;The Darkangel&quot;---pensive, perhaps and willing to believe in the magical power of love. (You also need to believe that someday it will be possible to terraform the Moon).&quot;The Darkangel&quot; has two sequels: &quot;A Gathering of Gargoyles&quot;; and &quot;The Pearl of the Soul of the World.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Meredith Ann Pierce's \\"The Darkangel\\" is the first book in a stylized epic trilogy set in a world that is so dry and thin-aired it can barely support its population - although it manages to do so through magic and machinery. The world has been cursed by the White Witch and her seven unnatural sons, the darkangel vampyres.Aeriel is a slave, a foreigner in Avarra, the country of her mistress, Eoduin. A marriage is to take place in their village and, as customary, Aeriel and Eoduin are out gathering nectar-flowers for the wedding. Without warning, Darkangel, the dark-winged vampyre, sweeps down upon them and carries off the lovely Eoduin to be his 13th bride. The young slave is blamed by Eoduin's parents for the kidnapping. Now, alone, bereft, without her lady, who has also been her beloved companion since infancy, Aeriel seeks to be taken by the same Darkangel in order to find and avenge her mistress. Returning to the scene of the kidnapping, she sees the face of the Darkangel for the first time when he comes to take her to care for his thirteen wraithlike wives, including Eoduin. Aeriel is awed. \\"Then he opened his wings, and Aeriel found she could not move for wonder. Before her stood the most beautiful youth she had seen.

Her task is to weave clothes for the thirteen wraiths. Although once beautiful young women, as each becomes the Darkangel's bride, she, overnight, turns into a withered creature with no blood, no heart, and no soul. All their souls hang around their husband's neck in vials of lead, to be given to the Water Witch, a lorelei, after he collects just one more. In only twelve months, the last bride will be taken and he will become the true seventh vampyre son.Aeriel's dilemma is whether to destroy her vampyre master for his evil deeds or to save him for the sake of his beauty. She has seen a spark of greatness through the ugliness of his spirit. The miserable wraiths and Talb, a dwarf-like man who lives underground, convince Aeriel to kill him. They have been victims for a long and terrible time. So, she sets off on a dangerous quest, (aren't they all?), to find what is necessary to rid the world of the monster.Filled with faery legends and lore, this is both a fascinating myth-like tale and a dark romance. The icarus vampire shines here as dark goth hero.

I started reading The Darkangel because the summary sounded interesting. Sure enough, the book had a very early narrative-hook (and more as the story went on), and I just had to read it through in one day. Meredith Ann Pierce superbly accounts a story about a young slave, Aeriel, looking to find revenge for her beautiful mistress, Eoduin, who was captured and taken as a bride by the darkangel. Instead, she finds adventure, mystery, and a dash of romance along the way. There's just enough twists to make the plot interesting and intricate, but not too complicated.

But one day as they are picking flowers, a strange creature with enormous dark wings scoops Eoduin up and leaves Aeriel seeking revenge for her mistress. She too is taken captive, and discovers that the hideous darkangel of legend is a gorgeous young man, with giant black wings and an icy heart. She is to spin and weave clothing for his living-corpse wives, from whom he has drained their souls. Aeriel finds herself with a terrible dilemma: should she kill the darkangel, or try to redeem him?The sense of true fantasy is evident in this book, naming the sun Solstar and such things. Though some things (like saris) are recognizable, overall the book has a sense of comfortable otherworldliness. The writing style is descriptive, poetic.The darkangel himself is thoroughly hateable in a likeable sort of way. Just when I am really starting to despise him, he displays a tiny hint of humanity. I actually felt very sorry for him near the end, and during the storytelling session, which is quite an impressive feat. His flailings between his humanity and the darkness inside him are quite compelling, as are Aeriel's attempts to understand him.Aeriel is an awesome contradiction, a determined young woman who is also unsure of herself. Perhaps it's because her determination stems from a desire to help free the wives of the darkangel, and to protect innocent people in future. Her dangerous journey to find the starhorse is like a very long poem, beautiful and evocative.And then there's the bizarre little man who lives in underground caverns, who advises Aeriel. He's a perfect gem of the Lloyd Alexander school, funny and wise and quirky. The little mage never makes things too easy, but manages to be a truly engrossing character. Hope he returns in the next two books of the trilogy.A warning: If you like standalones, this will stand on its own, but is obviously meant to be part 1 of ?. A few paragraphs near the end indicate twists in the future, so be forewarned.This book is the classic that it deserves to be, a glorious tale of strength and redemption. A must-read!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I first read this when I was twelve years old. At the time I liked it but since a friend's sister lost my copy of the final book of this series I couldn't re-read it. Thus it remained a kind of shadow memory of an enjoyable trilogy in my mind. At the time I junked it in with Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel\\" as dark and enjoyable complex young adult fantasy.But like \\"Sabriel\\" this book really wasn't written for young adults. This whole series is very dark and complex, perfect for older readers or mature young adults. It's also the only non-realistic fantasy book I ever read that I liked. In realistic fantasy, things happen for a reason, in non-realistic fantasy weird stuff happens that no one even tries to explain. This book is almost dreamy because of the style.This is the tale of an odd world, where days last two weeks and nights the same. The world is dying slowly, but people still cling to it. In her village Aerial has no idea of all this. She lives with her masters (she's a slave) and one day is with her mistress and friend Eoduin when a darkangel, a creature like a vampire out of a story, flies up and snatches Eoduin away so he can drink her blood and steal her soul.To avenge her friend Ariel heads on a quest to kill the darkangel, but is overcome by his beauty and power and the small spark of good in him, the soul he still has. With the help of strange and wondrous beasts, she alone must kill the vampire before he takes his fourteenth bride and gives the souls to his evil mother the Lorelei. Then he will become a true creature of pure evil and along with his six vampire brothers will destroy the world.This book is sparsely written with little characterization but it's still fascinating and haunting, just like the darkangel of the title. Reading it again was great fun, but I really think this only deserves four stars. It's very, very good, but so sparse that you get little true feeling for the characters, in spite of the descriptions of thoughts.Four stars and I am going to read the second books again (it's been years) called \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles.\\""},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I found this book many moons ago at a school book fair. I was attracted to the cover and after reading the back of the book...I had to buy it. It was the only book I bought at the fair. Was I lucky!!! It turned out to be one of the greatest books I'd ever read. That was over 17 years ago...and I can still honestly say that the story still moves me to this day. The story of Aeriel and Irrylath, which carries on through the two remaining books in the trilogy, is what started my &quot;love&quot; affair with vampires and vampire novels. But this trilogy, unlike many other vampire series, is more fantasy based and driven. It doesn't stick with the same myths and legends surrounding vampires. Instead it interweaves a very human story...the journey of a young girl who learns a great deal about herself, her heritage, true love, and what life is all about...on her quest for vengence. There are elements of magic, mystery, ancient gods, and mystical far off lands throughout the series. Not to mention the romantic and tragic thread woven in as well. This series has it all. It is a must read for anyone who loves a good fantasy novel...and a definite for any vampire enthusiastist who like a tale told with a new and inviting twist. The Darkangel is a literary delight for young and old fantasy lovers alike."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"After I had finished reading The 4th Harry Potter book, my english teacher just handed me this book out of the blue and said, \\"Here, read this.\\" Little did I know that it would take me on a journey so Amazing that I would end up adding it to my favorites list. This book was so wonderful that I am currently reading the last book out of the trilogy. This tale is about a girl named Aeriel who is captured by a beautiful darkangel who she knows she must kill but soon comes to find love for him. However, beneath this main plot are many smaller ones that will follow into the past and fate of Aeriel. It will keep you guessing the mysterious ways of this world and how Meredith Ann Pierce even thought of such a wonderful story. I strongly recommend that after reading this book you continue to the other two, because it would just be silly not to! This story will change your perspective of literature and love!! SO BUY IT!!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Aeriel, a slave in the land of Avaric, has known no family more than her mistress, Eoduin, and her nurse (no, not the hospital kind. Nurse-maid?). So when the Darkangel sweeps Eoduin up into his twelve wings, she must follow him to save her friend. When she is then taken - as a maid to his thirteen wives - she is stunned to discover that his thirteen once beautiful wives were now wraiths, horrible creatures who need garments woven with Love and Charity. Within time, Aerial begins to learn to love the small piece of good in the Vampyre. But can Aeriel, with help from her small duarough friend, Talb, and those pitiful wraiths, kill the Darkangel?This is a true, classic piece of fantasy. Aeriel is a character you can sympathize with - a not-quite-so beautiful girl who makes many mistakes, though is still just as smart as any opponent. The only thing I have against her is how she is as smart as a whip at times, but as dumb as a chair the next. It is confusing to the reader in understanding the terms Ms. Pierce uses on distinguishing days from months. I, personally, still don&#65533;t know which a day-month is.Another irritating fact is how she [Aeriel] puts too much on love alone - if she had simply killed the almost-Vampyre instead of trading his heart of lead for her heart of... muscles... the whole mess would never have begun. However, besides those [minor] complaints, this book is a piece of true gold.Meredith Ann Pierce wrote a haunting, stunning tale of fear, hatred, fantasy, mystery, and, most of all, love, beginning with this one book. May her pen never still."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I picked this book up the first time at my school library. I was still up at three in the morning trying to finish it; it was that captivating. It has all the components of a fairytale, and yet is worked into a fantasy novel that includes vampires, gargoyles and other strange and macabre creatures. Don't be put off by the word 'vampire' though, this book isn't yet another vampire book of that most over-used genre, but an incredible story with a huge scope and scale that stretches from a small village, to the vampire's forbidden castle, to a seemingly endless desert. It begins when a young Aerial's mistress is kidnapped upon the hills by a dark angel, or a vampire. Taking it upon herself to rescue her, she sets off on a wonderful journey that includes characters you've only ever seen in myths and legends. With her bravery, kindness and story-telling abilities Aerial gradually begins to lighten the darkangel's world and teach him of his own dark heritage.I read this book when I was thirteen, but when I went back to the library to get it out again, it was gone! But ... I've finally found it again, and I'm just about to go down to the public library to order it. I've never read the third book in this trilogy - 'The Pearl of the Soul of the World', but upon looking at reviews, I see there is a character called Ravenna in it! What a fluke, as my nickname was Ravenna long before I even remembered any of these books. I'll be reading that one as soon as I can, hopefully to find that the character who shares my name is a good one."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Once again, I too discovered this book when I was a teenager, and eagerly awaited each of the sequels. It is an incredibly imaginative tale, original and provocative. It certainlly deserves more press than it has gotten. I'd recommend it to any young girl."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read the entire trilogy when I was fourteen. I fell completely in love with it then, and now at 21 I love it even more. The Darkangel is probably one of the most fascinating vampires ever created--he is arrogant, evil, and utterly beautiful. But he too has a very human side to him, so one can certainly understand Aeriel's predicament when she falls for him, and why she is so desperate to save him. The style of writing is almost poetic, and so powerful that you forget you're reading about a futuristic moon colony. The sequels are truly moving, with one of the saddest endings I have ever read. Anyone who enjoys vampire fiction must read this book!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This series definatly ties with Meredith Pierces' other series, 'The Firebringer Trilogy', for the best fantasy books I've ever read. I have read All the Harry Potter books, most of Tolkiens books, and pretty much everything else... but it always comes back to the *BADLY* underappriciated books by Ms. Pierce. She builds strong worlds of beings with their own myths and ledgends...I love everything about her books. Her rythmic method of writing will have you completly hypnotaised to the point of having to shake your head after you finish one of her books to wake back up. Her worlds suck you in and inspire you...The comments left by 'A Reader' from Denver are quite unnessisary and are based on nothing but misinterpritation of a dark and beautiful tale. There is absolutly nothing 'racist' about these books, there is no 'wife-beating' (Of course he sucks souls... He's a VAMPIRE!!!) And as for Alcaholics.... where?The trilogy ends in a 'girl power'type of way (but better then that) So even if there was beating, alcaholism, etc (which I assure you- there is not) The ending would have the power to balance it as it is anyway...I reccomend people read the books before commenting on them.."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This magnificent work of fantasy combines high magic, archaic and beautiful language, and completely believable characters to weave a tapestry of &quot;a dream of the Moon.&quot;The lands Aeriel the slave hails from are but a thinly disguised Moon, with Oceanus/The Planet as an obvious Earth. A whole world has been created on the Moon, a world where lorelei, icari, and other fantastic creatures live, dwell, and rule.Aeriel vows to kill the darkangel when her friend Eoduin is snatched from a hilltop near their home. As the darkangel's servant for a full year, she plots and plans his downfall with the aid of the Wardens of the planet, a dwarfish mage, and the darkangel's own wives.

Wounded and worthless, she takes to the hilltop, knife in hand, to exact her revenge. When he appears, Aeriel finds herself powerless to harm him and is taken in the same manner as her mistress. When he deposites her on the rough stone floor of his abandoned palace, however, she learns that she is not to be his bride, like her mistress before her, rather, she is to be the servant of his brides.This is my favorite book of all time. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, the plot is captivating and well-thought-out, the characters are fully three dimensional and memorable, and the style is sincere and elegant. A wonderful unusual fantasy that few authors can mimic and few readers will find elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I first discovered this book in sixth grade, in the school library, and had not seen it in quite some time until I saw it, not without some surprise, in its brand-new edition cover. Reading it again, I found that the prose which had moved me in middle school is really quite spare and simple, but that's where it gets its beauty. I don't need to summarize (lots of people here have done that already) but the story, about a girl who becomes involved with a vampire, is at its heart a basic one and can be easily read at any age, but only gets better with time. The otherworldly setting and the hinted-at background of myth and history also adds to its charm, and the simple elegance that I will always love. I have never been able to get a hold of the second book, but I have read the third, and I am still not sure whether it spoils the story or completes it."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"loved this book and i can't wait to read the others. i have heard some spoilers but i am not going to say what they are 1 because i don't know if they are true and 2 i am not rude. i can't wait to read any other books she has."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"*Spoiler Review*At first sight, this book appeared to be a romance. Not something I would go for, but I'm a fan of the author and this story has such good ratings, I thought I'd give it a try. Now I'm confused over what the fuss is about.Aside from some parts being worded a little awkwardly, I generally thought the language style was exceptional. It kept me entertained, as did most of the plot. I did my best to ignore the Narnia-ish characteristics and did fine from there, but what I absolutely can NOT understand is where the protagonist's \\"love\\" for the bad guy comes from. I was even more baffled when she gave her own life to save him. It makes no sense at all.Darkangel-boy is mean, cruel, and quite childish. He spends his time talking about his mommy, torturing little animals, and ignores his \\"pets\\" chained up in the castle, ultimately starving them. Never, throughout the ENTIRE story, does he express so much as a wit of affection, or anything that could be similar to affection, to anyone-least of all Aeriel. Granted, at the beginning of the story she couldn't help but feel devoted to him, due to his magical awesome hotness. I got that, it was supposed to be his powers at work making her fall in love. But afterward, when his spell was supposedly broken? She still claims to love him, and she does not have ANY explanation for it other than remarking about how good-looking he is. For a protagonist who is supposed to become stronger by the end of the story, that is an immensely shallow and stupid reason to give her heart away (literally).Now, I understand wanting to save him. He really was an undisciplined child cooped up in a titan's suit, so I found myself hoping he'd be spared death in the end. But still, the overdramatic solution to this was just so out-of-place I was shocked, then disappointed. While sacrifices for loved ones make for tear-jerk endings, they need to have some credibility and something substantial behind it to make it believable. This story had neither, so I consider the whole ending a waste."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I really liked this book it has everything i ever wanted in a fantasy novelAdventure, suspense and just a bit of romance in there not a lot though but it's still great"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I love this series!

I snatched up and devoured the second and third books as they came out, eager to follow the tale to it's end. I was greatly disappointed. The ending was NOT what my teenaged fantasies had anticipated it to be. Still the beautiful poetry of the books, their epic fairy tale quality, called to me, and I continued to pull them out and read them every six months or so. After a few readings, I began to understand why Pearl ended the way it did, and to appreciate how much more beautiful and . . . right, it was. Like many of the best works of literature, this series only improves upon further readings. My only problem (now) with it is that I honestly don't agree with it's classification as young adult literature. Not that I'm against kids reading it -- I fully intend to read it to my children as a bedtime story -- but I think classifying it as young adult undermines it. This is a book for anyone who loves good poetic prose, literature, fantasy and folklore."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I originally read the three books in this trilogy over ten years ago, as a teenager, when they were first released. They stayed with me, so when I so them in paperback recently, I picked them up. Well, they read just as well the second time, more than ten years later, as an adult. What I really enjoy about these is the way the author draws metaphors and comparisons between two things that only exist in her books, yet the metaphor works, you have a picture in your mind, you know what she means. Highly enjoyable, but the ending was not as I remembered--my memory must have rewritten the ending in the 12 or so years since I first read the trilogy.

The Universe Ms. Pierce creates is completely different from our own, and yet there are hints of similarities. There are vampyres and other magical creatures, quests and other standard fantasy stuff but the people are remarkably the same as in our world. This was written as young adult literature and it reads like it. The writing is simplistic the story plain and relatively uncomplicated although I will admit I did like the plot. Character development was adequate although more could have been done, especially for the protagonist Aeriel, to me she seems to be a little undone. In fact if I had to describe the book with one word I would say it was 'undercooked.'There is little explanation as to how their world came to be the way it is, it had not always been the way it is portrayed, where did the magical creatures come from, where did the people go? A lot of questions and very few answers. Do these questions need to be answered for you to enjoy this book? Not really but they do distract from the story itself.This story is very age appropriate for young adult readers. No sex, violence is mostly implied and the horror fairly mild.I found this to be a very average work. It is the first volume of a trilogy and I intend to read at least the one following vollum, we will see if it gets any better. Even if it remains at this level it is not a BAD book, I'll leave it as a RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Wow, I really just don't know where this story lost my interest. The concept as pitched on the back cover was intriguing. The writing, though it felt a bit forced and overly complicated to feel old and fantastical had its charms. The story itself was completely creative in just about every way if not a bit of a beauty and the beast rip off. Yet...although I can't quite put my finger on it I just could not commit to this book. I finished it, but really disliked it. The characters were far from engaging and because of the cardboard style of writing I just could not relate to a single one of them. This might have been helped with a bit more romance or at least sexual draw between the icarus and main heroine but most of the book was spent with her wondering around the castle or on her quest. Some of the storyline was just plain weird like Never ending story meets Clive Barker (I mean...ripping out hearts and switching them...huh?) Maybe it was too far removed from reality for me to appreciate it for what it was. I would not recommend this to teens unless they are appreciators of the classical fairytale stories. I do not feel compelled to read the other installments. If you are looking for a supernatural/dark romance YA novel this is definitely not it. I would then direct you to The Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer, the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead or the Tithe Modern Fairy Tale series by Holly Black."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"While it may have been original for the vampire theme before such things became common, this book is nothing short of shockingly ordinary. The claims are that Aeriel say that she was captivated by his beauty and the spark of goodness. He actually never actually exhibits this goodness in any real way, just sort of by allowing his servant girl to live. He's never actively good, just sort of less evil on occassion.What's more, that Aeriel loves him by the end is nothing short of unbelievable and unrealistic. They don't seem to have enough actual conversations and with absolutely no character breakthroughs for the grudging-tolerance-into-love thing to work out well.What's more, it's also pretty tough to write a book with only two real (and even those two are pretty undeveloped) characters. Aeriel is entirely unremarkable in her character--annoying saint-like, actually. And the Icarus is just plain evil, with absolutely no depth.There was something bugging me the entire time I read this book, and it wasn't until the end that i could actually figure it out. Pierce does not once adequetely elaborate on the settings of the place. A paragraph, for a dark castle. A sentence, for a vast desert. No matter how hard I tried, I simply couldn't picture what had been taking place, and--having never had this issue before--I believe it was due to a simple lack of description.Finally, the plot in itself was faulty. The so called \\"surprises\\" at the end were actually what the reader more or less knew all along namely due to the tactlessly presented and painfully obvious hints provided for by the offer. And the plot twists were impossible, going off the rules of a strange world never explained at any point previous in the book.The book wasn't actively bad. The idea was okay. Overall, I tolerated it. I wouldn't reccomend spending hard-earned money on it, though."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"this book cant be judged by its cover though it did draw my attention when i saw it laying on a book shelf at the library. the cover made me wonder.the summary gives you the story but the adventure you have to read the book to get. it doesn't sound copied from another book or stolen from another fairytale.at first it sounded like it was going to be a romance book, but it is really not. i would rather put it under \\"adventure\\". i liked that the girls journey was long and had a bunch of issues along the way. i was sure i knew the vampire's fate, but i was wrong. some pieces were predictable and some made me, like, 'oh, wasn't expecting that'. this is not your average fairytale.i think adults would find it boring and too easy to read. but hey, it depends on the reader right?i advise you to read the next two books in this trilogy if you like the first. actually even if you don't like he first you may find your self wondering about the fate of the vampire and his wife at night. you can likely pick them up at your library."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I really did enjoy the first book in the Darkangel trilogy and although I did find the ending a tad didappointing I suppose I could overlook the little flaws to see and otherwise wonderful and intruiging book with a gripping plot and a well developed heroine. This book is definately worth the time, Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"By reading the description of this book, I had no idea it was for young adults.

I am looking forward to reading the whole Darkangel Trilogy."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This is the only book that I have ever delayed finishing, because I loved it so damn much. The storyline is deceptively simple: a young slave seeks revenge for her mistress, abducted by a vampyre, and becomes his servant instead...but like the best stories, there's a lot more to it than that.Aeriel is a heroine who grows on you at the same time as she grows into her own skin. The vampyre, like the best villains, is simultaneously replusive and seductive. And of course, there are the helpers, like the Duarough, the tribespeople, the Pendarlon...It might take you a while to guess where the tale is set. The mythology is rich and left me panting for more. I'm delighted to discover the other books have been published, and will be ordering them as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The first of my three favorite books in the whole world.

It was when I recently reread the books as a twentysomething that their messages of loyalty, sacrifice, duty, forgiveness, and love truly resounded with me. Pierce's lyrical, sparse prose moves the epic story quickly, and the unlikely heroine Aeriel -- strong of character, yet unsure of herself -- is someone with whom every reader can identify. The Darkangel Trilogy are not simply vampire books, nor are they merely fantasy or romance -- they are the masterful telling of a timeless legend, an unforgettable fairy tale of epic, serious, marvelous proportions that will keep you entranced and enthralled until the rime has been solved and the last page turned. Absolutely enchanting!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read this book back in seventh grade when I bought it at a library auction, I lost the book in a move and have been trying ever since to find it, im so happy i did, it amazes me how reading it 12 years later, it still has the same effects it did back then.

I was in elementary school in the 80's and this was a book I came across in the young-adult section of our local library. I read it and loved the story.

She is taken to the darkangel's castle and forced to serve his thirteen wives, once beautiful women, but now wraiths whose souls were eaten away by the darkangel. There, she befriends a dwarf-like creature called the duarough, who tells her that once the vampyre takes his fourteenth wife, he will come into his full power, and there will be no hope of redeeming the wraiths. He gives her a rime to follow, and after a daring escape, Aeriel flees to the plains in search of the starhorse. Along the way she acquires allies and enemies, experiences joy and trials. When the time finally comes to kill the vampyre, will she be able to do it and end his reign of terror, or will she spare him for the modicum of good that remains?This book was really good, a dozen times more creative than Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\", which was what drew me into it. It reminded me a bit of the old fairy tales - East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon, and Beauty and the Beast, and also was a bit reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. It was a very enjoyable story, with believable, likable characters. It was very easy to put myself in Aeriel's place, and to see why she did what she did. Everything about the story was great, but there were parts that should have been described more clearly. For example, the Starhorse. I gather that it's some kind of horse, but what did it look like? And what on earth is a day-month? I could only make an educated guess based on the context. Also, the author uses several different names for some of the characters, such as translating the names into Latin, and then there were others. I was able to keep track of who was who, but you really have to pay close attention to puzzle it out. A reader doesn't want to have to work their minds for something so trivial! The only other thing is just me being weird, but the author has a magical lyon guardian, and one of the several name's of the darkangel's \\"mother\\" is the White Witch. That's a bit too much for me, being a huge fan of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Sometimes...it seemed as though the book could have used another rewrite. Then, it would have been awesome. No complaints.Really, though, it is a good book, and though I can go on and on about what little faults it has, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and recommend it to anyone who wants a break from the \\"Twilight\\" vampires."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Although labeled as a YA novel, do not be fooled!There's so much more going on here than your typical angsty teen novel!The language is beautiful, the world is lush, vivid, and ALIVE. Not only the landscapes... but the animals, the creatures, the people! No character is flat or seemingly cardboard--they all have personalities, and flaws, and strengths.This is such a BEAUTIFUL tale that NOBODY should miss!

Under his intoxicating spell, but needing to stop him, Aeriel--persuaded by a mage--journeys to find the key to the Darkangel's undoing. Masterfully written, deeply beautiful and imaginative, this clever and unpredictable retelling of Beauty and the Beast was more than one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time. It was like a dream from long ago that I'd forgotten. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It was just a normal day for Aeriel, a servant, having to complete her chores. This time she was with her mistress, Eoduin, collecting flowers upon a mountain.Both girls were told numerous times about the dangerous creatures that roam the earth, although neither ever took them seriously. But one story, the one Bomba had so urgently told them, about the Darkangel, the vampyre who takes the souls of innocent, beautiful women, became a reality for the girls.While up high in the mountains, with very little capability to see or hear, the Darkangel swoops down to capture Eoduin.This does not bode well with Eoduin's parents or Aeriel. Wanting to seek revenge, Aeriel goes back up the mountain to confront the Darkangel, only to discover that he captured Eoduin to become his thirteenth bride. Unable to complete her task, the Darkangel then captures Aeriel, not to become his bride but to be his servant.Aeriel soon learns that once the Darkangel captures his fourteenth bride, his powers will be fully developed.And so begins Aeriel's journey to not only save her life, but the lives and souls of the thirteen other girls -- and to prevent the Darkangel from seeking his last bride.From the very beginning, readers will be enticed by the dark and mysterious world created by Pierce, where no one is safe. The author's great use of detail creates vivid images that will haunt the reader and leave them wanting more.Reviewed by: Randstostipher \\"tallnlankyrn\\" Nguyen"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The story gave a new nuance for me. I am fond of reading YA books and so far, this is totally different from other vampire's book. The setting, which at the beginning kind of confusing, started to make sense if we imagined ourselves living on the moon (another new idea, vampire - night - moon).This vampire, the \\"Darkangel\\" who stole Eoduin, to be his bride and Aeriel, to be his brides' maid, was a halfmade vampire. He still had soul dan a trace of goodness that made Aeriel (and me still) loved him. Instead of taking revenge for having made Eoduin and the previous 12 brides into wraiths, she decided to save and free him from the White Witch that intended to make him a \\"darkangel\\" son.With the guidance of the first of three stanzas of the Lady Ravenna, Aeriel started her journey to save the ones she loved and ultimately, the world."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I was intrigued by the picture of the hardcover version (yes, I freely admit I judge books by their covers), but I picked up the book and looked at it three times before I finally read it.

An elusive tale that obscures good and evil, and through the eyes of a young girl, builds the world as it should be. In addition to being a refreshingly feminist fairytale it is also one of the most beautiful stories about vampires ever written. The next two books in the trilogy, A Gathering of Gargoyles and The Pearl of the Soul of the World, while still beautiful are not as satisfying as the first. The Darkangel, because it never strives to be beautiful, captures the true beauty in a woman's coming of age. Woven through with complex characters and poetic language, this story is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This is one of the best series that I have ever read!

I cannot believe how horrifying the end is. THINK PEOPLE. Just because someone writes something amazingly well does not mean that the message is a good one. Enough of this beauty and the beast trash. Too many women in this world are sticking by \\"monsters\\", waiting for that little, tiny spark of good to surface.

The library let me reed the book even if i weren't big enough though I was a &quot;grownupinhermind&quot;-girl. honestly i don't like fantasy, but these books goes directly intoo your heart, maybe is it the language as someone said but i fell in love with the darkangel-i think that's why. This author toghether with Diana Wyne Jones,terry Pratchett are the fantasywriters I approchoate strongly. i've read the triology three times now. Someone who has read them more? I would like to say it to meredidh herself,doesn't she have a homepaige?I would like to tell her how sad I become everytime at the end when Aeriel can't live with her angel and that I'm sorry for her mother if she is dead because it's written &quot;for my mother who liked the first two books&quot; at the first page.

The plot inches along slowly, but the language and the characters enticing you to read more...until finally you're at the end...and that's it. The end is short and sloppy. After I read this book I was very angry that a book could be left in such a place...so many loose ends. How was that done again? - She did WHAT? Very sloppy...but the story its self demands to be read. If you can stand your own anger at the ending...the book is decent enough."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This was a book that captured my heart. The tale of a young, plain girl who becomes a most important person to the world and to Irrylath. Though it did sadden me that Irrylath could not return the love to her, when she was still with him. The darkangel was a fasinating character. Dark, evil, yet confuse and struggling between what was his goals and what he was as a little child. I think we all have this in us. Our childhood memories are still strong in us, even if we've become something else today. And sometimes it haunts us or give us bittersweet memories. If Meredith Ann Pierce reads this, PLEASE, PLEASE, create a fourth book so that Aerial and Irrylath will be together again. I had tears when she left him at the end to take her place somewhere far from him. This had been such a great book and it really touched my heart. I've read this since I was in elementary school. Now I'm in College, and it's story is still in my heart. I'll never forget Irrylath or Aerial, the one who gave her life to him and the world."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book is terribly over rated, not at all worth 5 stars!

The only appealing thing was the darkangel, him and his looks. Aeriel was unbelievably common, nothing interesting about her. A simple book for simple minds."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"So I had high hopes for this book after randomly picking it up and reading the back cover. I found it confusing right from the off - I'm still not entirely sure what a 'day-month' is. There were just too many 'different' things that were really just normal things. I WANTED to like the story, even though Aeriel didn't grab my affection. I thought it strange, actually, that they made such a big deal out of her goodness for pitying others when she herself was pathetic in many ways, not the least of which was calling her mistress friend. Maybe I'm just stronger (not difficult) than Aeriel, but there's no way any of my friends would treat me like she's treated to start with, and I'd rather be alone than deal with that.Then there's the darkangel, a new name for an old foe. The vampire, pardon me, vampyer. I do not go for misspelling something just to be 'unique'. And that's not the only word in the book done that way. I did love the vision of the darkangel, his horrible beauty and presence. I fell in love with his careless abuses. But the story was planned out so that you knew (mostly) what was going to happen each step of the way. You wonder what sort of fool Aeriel was that she didn't see it until the end.Ah, the end. What a travesty that was. Here it is folks. Aeriel saves the darkangel, whom she's fallen in love with. And when she does, he turns into a prince charming, albeit a scarred one. A prince charming who while he was stolen away as a child has grown up, but hasn't aged all the years he's actually been enchanted. This isn't really explained, but it's nifty, because although he's been enchanted for twenty-odd years, he only aged to 16, which is perfect for Aeriel because she's fifteen. Perfect match! Oh, and since he's been 'saved' every single thing that made him beautiful and horrible and endearing and revolting as the darkangel, has been replaced by a safe, common, attractive human boy. Who also happens to understand that he did horrible things, and has a perfect moral compass, despite that he was stolen as a very young child and spoiled and taught only horrible things his entire life. The end. Well, not quite, but I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Upon reading the positive reviews I borrowed a copy of this book, for I am a fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's fantasy novels. Sigh. What can I say? The plotline is so predictable that I wondered if Aeriel has terribly weak logic to not see Darkangel IS the Prince Irrylath Dirna drowned in the lake. She is not very likable, the story is oddly bland and lacks in real action, drama, and passion. I suggest reading Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' \\"Hawksong\\" to get more kicks than this dry thing."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It SOUNDED promising, but this book is one of the most boring things I've ever read. There is no emotion, the plot is frustratingly simple, and it's hard to deciede who's stupider- Ariel (a bland, unlikable character we are supposed to believe suddenly becomes a \\"strong\\"-but equally boring and stupid-woman in less than ten pages), or the author."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Darkangel by Meredith Ann Pierce was an incredible book. This fantasy book captures the reader throughout the story, making me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. The well thought out characters were amazingly described. A new twist to this mystic tale is revealed as it goes on. I would recomend this book to any adventureous reader seeking a puzzeling fantasy. 5 stars go to Pierce for this excellent book. For those of you who have enjoyed this book i would like to recomend the next book in this trilogy; A Gathering of Gargoyles. Good luck to you fantasy seekers out there."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Not only is this books series captivating and realistic, it has everything that makes up a classic; a great plot, a great villain--and a MAGINIFICENT heroine. You get caught up in the reading and you're really sorry when it ends...I hope that Meredith Ann Pierce plans to write another book for all our sakes, and that the story doesn't stop here...the ending in &quot;The Pearl of the Soul of the World&quot; really gets to you, and you'll need a box of kleenex. You'll laugh, cry, and never forget this marvelous masterpiece in young adult fantasy/science fiction. This is my all-time favorite book series, and if you read it and it doesn't become your favorite, I guarantee you'll still have memories from it when your ninety. &quot;The Darkangel Trilogy&quot; will bring out the many sides of you as it catches you and suspends you in it's lyrical telling."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"As you look at all the reviews for this book, you will see that most people have either given it a 10 or a 9 and many describe it as the best fantasy book ever written. I also have to say that The Darkangel is one of my favourite books, and has been ever since I was around 10 (I am now 22). It's one of those books that you just never get tired of, that you can pick up at any time and enjoy just as much as you did the first time you read it. Every time I read it, I pick up something new. Trying to pick out what sets The Darkangel apart is very difficult, as there is just so much that it is perfect about it. I love the style and the language used - there is an almost musical quality about the way the words fit together to tell the story, and I can almost imagine the story being told as a bardic ballad. The characters, from the heroine, Aeriel, to the Darkangel himself are all very well portrayed. I can always completely sympathise with Aeriel, she is a wonderful heroine, and yet she is not presented as absolutely perfect, which is a sad tendency amongst many fantasy authors. I think it might be the way she grows as the story goes on- I find myself, even now, 12 years after I first read it, becoming more and more interested in Aeriel as the story goes on. The story grabs the reader practically from the first page, with Aeriel's mistress being captured by the Darkangel, a kind of winged vampire who must steal the soul of a maiden every year for fourteen years. At the end of those fourteen years, he must present the stolen souls to the White Witch of the Lake, in order to be made into a true vampire (I should point out here, that in Pierce's world, which is actually a futuristic vision of the moon, true vampires drink both blood and souls). Aeriel, partially in desperation to avoid being sold as a slave, and partially out of loyalty to her stolen mistress, embarks upon a quest to kill the Darkangel, but falls under his spell, all the while loathing him for what was done to her mistress. However, in the end, she embarks upon a quest to save the Darkangel from his fate (for vampires, remember, are made, not born, and he's not a proper one yet).There are two followup books, which I have never read, as I have never been able to find them until now. I can only recommend most strongly to anyone who reads this review, PLEASE, read The Darkangel. You too will be captivated. It is quite simply impossible to say how good this book is- I only hope I have said enough to convince you. I would say anyone, young or old, whether they like fantasy or not, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"The disparity in the reviews here seems to boil down to a question of what you're looking for in a book. The Darkangel is not an adventure novel. The pace is slow, so if you're looking for a faster paced book you're likely to find it boring. If you enjoy beautiful language that floats you through the (admittedly kind of thin, but with some great moments) plot, this book will make a big impression. The pace picks up in the two sequels (A Gathering of Gargoyles) without losing the magic of the language, and Aeriel does gain more character as they progress. Have some patience and enjoy the scenery and this is a lovely book."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book was amazing and I just want to start off that you shouldn't be waisting your time reading this ...buy the book and go and read it as soon as possible .Now to explain it with out ruining the great story.It is about a girl named Aeriel , a blonde haired , green eyed girl who is a slave to a young woman a few years older than her named Eoduin .She is taken by an icari (the white witches sons all of which are vampyrs) and Aeriel ,under speculation that she did it goes to slay the icari .But once she climbs atop the great mountain steps she waits and he comes.She is taken aback by him and his beauty.She then is taken to his castle ,long deserted , and makes her a slave for him and his wives...or what she calls wraiths.Now for the rest of the story ,you will have to buy the book and read it because it is very good and I did say I wouldn't ruin it.So I also decided that I liked it so much that in my spare time ,for something to do and so I can continue this story .I will continue on with her happenings and try to make the stories as good as the Authors :Meredith Ann Pierce.But I just want to enchorage all people to read these books."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"After all the rave reviews, I was surprised. The Darkangel was not at all what I had expected from reading the reviews. I just didn't like the author's shady way of letting us know/guess what was in the main character's head. Overall, not worth 5 stars, it was just another average YA fantasy novel."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I first read &quot;The Darkangel&quot; when I was in seventh grade. Even then I loved it. A year ago I located an out-of-print copy in a secondhand bookstore and bought it on sight. I still love it. The story is haunting, the writing poetic. Images hang in your mind like jewels: Aeriel's first sight of the darkangel, a dozen black wings churning like a storm, colorless eyes and hair as pale as platinum, cruel and compellingly beautiful at the same time; the sunlion racing across the desert like molten gold, his scent like sandalwood and burning; the blue planet Oceanus hanging in the sky beside Solstar; blind Dirna muttering in the dark and the duarough frozen into stone by sunlight. Aeriel herself--thought unbeautiful for the color in her skin, her golden hair and her green eyes--slave to a beautiful mistress whom she sets out to avenge when the darkangel takes her away for his bride, is stronger and more compassionate than she appears. Part of the joy of the story is watching her grow and change through her long, strange journey, and yet remain Aeriel throughout. The world of &quot;The Darkangel&quot; itself is amazing, half science fiction, half fantasy, and one hundred percent original; the various cultures are vividly depicted, the characters drawn clearly and colorfully. A beautiful book from all ends of the spectrum."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Some of these reveiws are so imature it had me laughing.Well ''I'' Personally loved the book and read it 3 times! The first one is the best in my opinion and I wish to reread the entire trilogy when I get the chance.I loved how they made the Dark Angel's Personality, Conceited, Stuborn, Cold. and if you honestly couldnt SEE it, you shouldnt be reading in the first place.I Recommend this Book 100%!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I re-read this trilogy (The Darkangel, A Gathering of Gargoyles, and The Pearl of the Soul of the World) every so often and even though I know exactly what's going to happen, every time I find myself enchanted all over again. However, Meredith Ann Pierce doesn't explain everything to the nth degree. Instead, you have to listen to her language and figure things out for yourself. This trilogy isn't for your run-of-the-mill fantasy reader who looks only for a thinly disguised re-hash of Tolkien. It's startling and original, fey and luminous, absolutely enchanting.As for the negative reviews: (1) those of you who find these books \\"boring\\" must have no ear for language or no sense of the numinous, or your ideal fantasy is something of the \\"sword and sorcery\\" genre; (2) a whole lot of you don't seem to get that this trilogy takes place in the *way far* future ON THE MOON!!! That's what the \\"daymonth\\" and \\"earthlight\\" things are about. Re-read it if you don't believe me -- particularly the parts about the ancients \\"who had first fallen from the sky in fire to quicken this, a then-dead world, the moon of Oceanus, into life..\\" then returned whence they came, back to Oceanus (the Earth). \\"Oceanus hung, a swirl of blue and white, almost directly ahead of her...\\" Doesn't that put you in mind of that famous photograph (I think it's called \\"Earthrise\\") taken of the Earth by one of the astronauts?"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book may not appeal to the modern-day YA reader, but, then again, since that's me...maybe it will. Haha! Anyway, it's definitely darker and \\"heavier\\" than most of today's YA fantasy, but I loved it. I loved the whole series. I loved watching the main character grow, and I loved that it wasn't just superficial or written for max sales. It's realistic and different. This book feels like actual literature."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I close my eyes and I can remember the many dark, seductive moments from this book.I must have read this book about 12-14 years ago but I can still remember moments from the protagonists life when she meets the dark angel and is taken to his home.This book had a profound effect on my childhood including some other books that I had read.I can visualize this book and the characters from the book because the story was written in such a magical way that I was so drawn to it.As a child, I didn't have funds to buy books and I had borrowed the trilogy from the library.

After many years, I forgot the title, remembered the story, and longed to read it again. When I got to high school, I searched for and fell in love with it all over again! The writing style is beautiful, the character is human, not the Mary-Sue characters that have begun to plague the recently published YA books. With Pierce's writing, I can actually see the amazing and fantastical world that she has opened her readers to. This is a rare gem, and deserves to be more widely known. The story is so unique and lovely that I had to give it 5 stars, which I have never given to any other books.

I read this trilogy originally in the 90s, and then looked forever for a hardcover copy, but it was out of print. I was excited to see it was reprinted in 2007, but I'm surprised that it hasn't received much notice in the book world.If you like fantasy novels, with some fairy tales and interesting creatures (vampires, wraiths, dwarves, gargoyles, etc) you need to read this series!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"My 15 y.o. thought this was a great book. She recommends it for the older teen and young adult."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I'd been hearing lots and lots about Meredith Ann Pierce long before I ever picked up one of her books. For the longest time I associated her in my head with a book calledThe Woman Who Loved Reindeer. And neither the title nor the cover did anything for me. But, as is so often the case, I had several friends who highly recommended her Darkangel trilogy. And they were persistent enough and vociferous enough that I finally picked up the THE DARKANGEL (much more interesting title and premise) to give a new author and a new series a go. This was probably somewhere around ten years ago. And I'm still so glad I gave in and picked up the trilogy. That way I didn't even have to wait before diving into the second book. And this really is a series that builds upon each previous book until the final showdown is indeed something to behold. This was Ms. Pierce's first book, written when she was just 23 years old, but you would never be able to tell. It's a treasure trove of creepy ambiance, layered characterization, and suspense. First published in 1982, the entire trilogy was fairly recently rejacketed nicely and released to (hopefully) a new crop of readers.Ariel is a slave. Accompanying her mistress on a flower-gathering expedition, Ariel is dismayed when her mistress is abducted by the terrifying Darkangel--a vampyre who is destined to only come into his full power when he acquires his fourteenth and final bride. Yes, you read that right. He's got twelve of 'em locked away in his fortress and Ariel's mistress gets to be unlucky thirteen. But not if Ariel has anything to do with it. Somewhat taciturn by nature (and life status), she sets off in pursuit of her mistress, determined to fetch her back before the Darkangel drains her all but dry of life like his other wives, finds a fourteenth, and ascends to the dizzying heights of power of a seventh son and a full vampyre. Then he will be immortal and have truly left the last of his humanity behind. Unfortunately, Ariel herself is captured on her journey, and the Darkangel forces her into servitude to his bevy of wraith-wives. Soon Ariel begins to form a plan to kill the Darkangel and set the wives free.***His hair was long and silver, and about his throat he wore a chain: on fourteen of the links hung little vials of lead.***I remember reading that line and feeling chilled, wondering just exactly what he carried inside those little vials. This is a vampyre novel of a different kind from the sort you may be used to. The mythology is woven very densely here, as the title character himself is more of a icarus-vampire hybrid than your typical broody night dweller. Everything about this dark fantasy/scifi is slightly left of what you expect it to be, and I love it for that very reason. Ariel is at times shy, furious, fearful, and bold. Her captor is coldly indifferent, with his black wings and his all-but-dead heart, but with a multitude of reasons lurking behind his violent search. And once Ariel discovers the truth of his history, his family, and his existence, she becomes determined to go on her own quest to recover the one object that might release him from his terrible fate. She makes this decision on her own, in the face of his certain disapproval and the possibility of her own annihilation. She is strong and sympathetic and her motivations never struck me as weak or dubious. The world these characters inhabit is as frigid as the Darkangel himself. Craggy and desolate, it provides an excellent backdrop for each character's isolation. Plus, it has friendly gargoyles, crafty dwarves, and one incredibly terrifying Lorelei. And this is only the beginning. It gets endlessly complicated through the course of the next two books as the reader grows fonder of both Ariel and the Icarus. I adore the entire trilogy and highly recommend it to anyone tired of the same old paranormal rigmarole. This one is different. A keeper."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This is a fairytale in the truest sense of the word. However, it's main 'un'fairytale-like quality is that one of the two main characters is a vampire. The other is a girl who falls for him but don't make the mistake of thinking it's going to be an angsty teenage fantasy the likes of which Ms Meyer offers because it's not. You'll be disappointed if that's what you're after. The cover makes it look like any other ten-a-penny vampire fantasy but it couldn't be more different if it tried.This was first published in 1982 and it feels a bit dated now. Not because of the writing style and definitely not because of the subject, but by association. Because other - more recent- novels in this genre are edgy and fasionable with urban settings and situations and they use language that you'll come across every day in life, Darkangel just seems to miss the mark if you're more used to the modern vampire romance.It was republished in 2007, no doubt to soak up some of the popularity that vampire fiction has generated in recent years, and there's nothing wrong with that. Especially since Darkangel was actually a forerunner of all those other urban vamps. But it does tread a fine line. It's counting on the purchasers of Twilight and The Vampire Diaries and House of Night books to also show interest in this one and there's every chance they will, (afterall, I did), but I want to add a word of caution too...It's not what we've come to expect from vamp literature. It's not worse though....it's just different. Go into it expecting a fairytale and enjoy the weirdness of it all and it's a good story. From what I hear it gets better in the next two books in the trilogy, but I can't comment on that because I haven't read those. Read it for what it is, a cutting edge (at the time) dark fairytale. Like all good fairytales it has a bit of spook in it and there's a couple of bits where it gets scary and you'll hope it turns out well but it's not 'edge of your seat' type stuff and neither is it a 'will they, won't they' romance, it's just not that kind of book. I don't have a mad hunger to find out what happens next, if I'm honest, so I'm still not sure if I'll try the follow on books but if you're in the mood for a nice traditional fairytale with a nice untraditonal vampire then this might be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"When I started reading The Darkangel, I wasn't sure I would like it. After all, it was told in such a melodramatic way as to read like the fantasy of a teenage girl. When I found out, however, that the book was published when the writer, Meredith Ann Pierce, was only 23, I understood a little bit better why I was getting that impression.Though the book has its flaws, the story soon swept me up into in heady mix of folkloric and fairytale elements, set within a sci-fi framework of a planet colonized by a people called the Ancients many moons ago. I won't go into the details of a synopsis--others before me have done that, and quite well--but I will say that this is one of the most unique books I've read, weaving together disparate and seemingly incompatible story ingredients into a compelling dark fantasy. I'm just a bit disappointed that I came late to the party and didn't discover this series until now."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I very much enjoyed this book--stayed up all night reading it in fact!

However, she finds herself becoming the vampire's servant to care for his wives. He needs 14 of them to become a full vampire. She meets a little wizard in the basement of the palace, she befriends the vampire's wives, she tames the gargoyles and then she leaves for a journey. When she returns it's to free the wives and kill the vampire. However, upon returning she's discovered she loves the vampire.I had trouble determining time in this book. At times it was very exciting and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Most other times, I wasn't really sure what was going on. I get that the vampire is beautiful and our heroine is an ugly duckling and she has a great big heart. But when exactly did she fall in love with the vampire? All I got out of it is she fell in love with his beauty. I didn't care for the ending of this book and probably won't read the rest in the trilogy as I wasn't impressed with this book. I'm really not sure what all the hype is about."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Meredith Ann Pierce's Darkangel Trilogy enthrallsthe imagination from the young to the young atheart.

There's no question that it's beautifully written, and the Darkangel, his castle and brides well-described; the problem is the heroine. Aerial is a perfect fairy-tale heroine--in fact, like Cinderella or Snow White, she is just flat-out perfect. No wryness, no irony, no flaws, and no sense of humor; no explanation how she got to be so darn brave and loveable; where other women fail, she succeeds just 'cause she's so completely *good*. There's no backstory and no depth to her. Little kids might find her appealing, but compared to the heroines of Martha Wells or even Tamora Pierce, she is flat & uninteresting; definitely unengaging for the adult reader. (Maybe she gains another dimension or two in the next books; I didn't care enough to keep going.)"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Okay, so I discovered Meredith Ann Pierce with the &quot;Firebringer&quot; trilogy when I was about 11 or 12 years old.

I've only read the first one so far, but I can tell you truthfully that it has captured my heart and my interest even at the ripe old age of 26.

I got that copy of the book from the local library, but had such fond memories of it I recently decided to purchase my own copy so I could read it again. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, because so many other things I really enjoyed as a teenager are not things I would enjoy today. But I was pleasantly surprised. This is just as evocative, just as moving, just as amazing today as it was back then.Part fantasy, part fairytale, part sci fi, part parable, this story is so beautiful it's haunting. I guess that's why I still remembered it after so many years. Another good thing about it is that it's so easy to read. I raced through it like a hot knife slicing through butter, yumming it up as I went along, unable to put it down, hungry for more. I felt empathy for the characters. I was moved by what happened to them. The writer made me care. I was gripped, from start to finish.It's nice to know that there is at least one good vampire book still on the market...it's been a while since I read one that was even halfway decent. If you like vampires, you'll like this. It's a great read for teens, and just as good a read for adults.I can't wait to read the sequels.

Now at 47, I am reading it again, realizing how powerful both myths and dreams can be. This is a wonderful love story, bittersweet and poetic. But it is really much, much more. It is about the power of fate, the lure of myths and the value of dreams. It is about what we once were, are now, and will become. It's about growing up and letting go, accepting responsibility. This story touched my heart in a way books usually touch a child's heart. What a joy. I only hope that Ms. Pierce can find it in her heart to write a few more with these wonderful characters. They deserve one of those fairy tale happy endings. Don't miss it. It's worth every cent."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book reminded me a bit of the Narnia books for some reason. Possibly due to the talking lion and the friendly gnome creature that tells stories to the main character. It also reminds me a bit of Lord of the Rings in the sense that some poem/saying is strewn throughout the entire novel. The story was interesting enough, though when you pull it all together it could be summarized in a sentence or two. Also, the ending is a bit of a surprise. One second you are engrossed in the book, and the next page it is over, finished, end of story.Usually, the amount of detail and description in this book would have bored me, but The Darkangel makes you feel like you are there, living with the characters. I cared what the honey flowers in the beginning of the book looked and tasted like, and even though there wasn't action at every turn of the page, I was entertained. The whole thing felt like a long short story, if that makes any sense. I felt like it was a story being told from a wise elder, or a grandmother figure, and I was just along for the ride. Overall, a pretty enjoyable story. When I went to read the second book, however, I found I couldn't take anymore of the poem deciphering, and gave up."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"My own collection consists of copies of this trilogy so at any point in time I can give them away to those who don't yet know the greatness..Pierce makes and bates you for a full three books about a girl that becomes a woman by the time you leave her side. In the first book she encounters a creature called a darkangel, with feathers so black they reflect no light and are as cold as nightshade. You're dragged into the tale of loss, anger, confusion and helplessness as the girl, Ariel, has to face a darkangel to avenge her slavemaster and friend.The story starts when she and her master climb a mountain to pick trumpet flowers for a wedding to be held down in the valley below. The air on the mount being too thin to hear each other unless they yell makes a moment of Ariel's preoccupation with picking the blooms to allow the dozen-winged darkangel time to sweep up her mistress and steal her away to make her his bride. When Ariel runs back down for help after having failed saved her owner and companion, everyone blames her for the loss and whispers of putting her back up on the slave market- where she'd be poked, prodded, broken and sold- stir up in the household she belongs to.Unable to bare the thoughts of the slave auctions and that everyone believes she let the darkangel steal her only friend away, Ariel faces the climb back up alone with one pouch of water and a dagger. Her water runs out as she waits for the creature to return, leaving her able to only wait to death or hope for him to come back and more than likely kill her.As she starts to starve and thirst and freeze, he comes. And as she stands to face him, the vision of his flawless beauty makes her hesitate long enough to be snatched up and lofted away in the numbing cold.Alive and living as his slave now in a large castle with no other mortals, she cares for the darkangel's brides, whose blood he drank and whom have turned into light, airy wraiths she must tend to as well as seven gargoyles that are chained to the tower who guard and survey the land around the castle, baying and howling whenever they see something to alert their master, keeping her from escaping. The wraiths wail and can't remember their human lives, and Ariel knows one of them was once her beloved mistress (but how can she tell possibly find which one she was when they all are equally hideous?). Between their constant sounds combined through the castle and a man-creature who has become a monster and threatens her life with a smile every chance he gets, she must make her own contentment in the dark but warm caves below the castle until she can discover a way to steal the leaden vials from the darkangel and give her mistress and the other once-women their souls back.. And perhaps even kill the darkangel himself.Her problem is she finds herself smitten by him, afraid of him and not confident enough to do anything brash..Buy it, read it, love it forever..."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Now, I read the collectors edition which had all three stories in it so I'm not real sure where this one ends and the next begins. But I'll try to get the overall point across. A slave girl's beautiful owner is captured by a soulless vampyre. Facing being auctioned she goes to where her mistress had been taken and waits. Eventually this beautiful but frigid boy comes and takes her to his palace as a servant to his wives, all of which used to be women but since he sucked out their souls are now wasting away so that she can not even tell which one is her mistress. But she falls in love with the vampyre and escapes to try to find a way to free her mistress and maybe the vampyre who had once been a boy but was stolen by a witch.Through much travel she comes upon powerful magic, befriends strangers, learns the true origins of her people, befriends monsters, and meets her vampyre's evil full grown brothers. Throughout the books she hunts down and fights this witch who is trying to destroy her world and lives many other adventures along the way.I loved the book\\"s\\" and can tell you that you will never ever guess the end.

But I checked it out at the library again, when I was for the second time attracted to its cover. I loved it! It's absolutely brilliant writing, spun just like a beautiful tapestry. It is not a typical vampire book at all--it's very much a fantasy, verging on sci-fi.Ariel is a servant girl. When her mistress, Eoduin I think her name was, is kidnapped by the infamous Darkangel (vampire) to be his bride, and nobody will do anything about it, she knows she has to. She gets captured by the Darkangel, and he makes her the handmaiden of his thirteen wives. His wives, once beautiful women, are now shrieking wraiths, and at first Ariel is hesitant to go near them. Soon she gets to know them, spinning them clothes out of charity and love, and gently coaxing their memories to return. But then they ask her to kill their husband, and she knows she must, but how? She goes on a journey to retrieve the only weapon on earth that can destroy him, and when she returns she has every intention of killing him. But she finds that she's fallen in love with him, for the good that she knows is buried in his heart somewhere.

Book 1 of the Dark Angel trilogy introduces us to Aeriel, a slave who ends up following her lifelong friend after she was captured by a Darkangel. His goal is to take 14 wives as sacrifices so that he may become a full fledged vampire. Aeriel's friend, Euodine, is to be his 13th wife.Aeriel plots to be captured as well, the Darkangel deciding to take her so as to serve his wives. Upon meeting the Darkangel, she is stricken by his beauty. While he is undoubtedly evil, she sees something deeper within him that makes her want to save him.This is not your typical romance, and really quite a bit of the story is centered around general fantasy lore and mystery. The Darkangel does not find Aeriel physically attractive, outright calling her too ugly to be one of his brides. That to me already sets up a very interesting dynamic that I enjoyed seeing played out in this book. If he is to fall for her, it would be for something deeper than her outer beauty to him.The writing style, while created for young adult, would translate well for general adult readers as well. The story truly made an impression on me and to this day, I think back to amazing scenes. I love the complexity of the Darkangel as a character and I think other readers would, too."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This is the first book in the Darkangel Trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce. This was an excellent book, very fairy tale like in the telling and an interesting, somewhat traditional, take on vampirism.Aeriel's friend is taken away by a vampire to become his bride. Aeriel is determined to find her friend and take her back home. When the vampire comes to take her she finds herself in a castle where only a gnome-like mage, gargoyles, and the wraiths of the vamp's wives are her company. Aeriel must find what she needs to do to free the wraiths from the vampire's clutches. Her quest will take her on a magical and fantastical journey.The writing for this book is a bit dated but good. At times the writing is incredibly descriptive. The story is very fairy tale like, slow-moving at times with lots of deliberate description. There isn't a ton of action here. The pacing is variable; at times the story moves forward at a very deliberate pace then all of the sudden months have gone by. This story is not for people who are really into high action or fighting scenes. If you are into fairy tales then this is the story for you; that is the best description for this book....classic fairy tale style.Overall this is a beautiful story and very gothic. It is also a fairly short book; takes maybe a couple hours to read. Appropriate for young adult readers or maybe even younger readers who don't scare easily. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series :-)"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book was odd. It wasn't historical fiction, though some things had a parallel to our history. It was definitely a fantasy book, with lots of different magical elements.Some things I had a hard time picturing. It mostly came up in the sequel, but some people had different color skins. I'm not talking white/black/tan either. That was just random for me.I started this series for the romance. But so far it just seems so much more about the action. That's not me. Action and me is bad, with a few exceptions.I wouldn't stay with this series because it's not giving me the romance I want, but I'm hoping the romance appears in the third book and it'll be less of a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It was a little tricky to get into this book at first, I will admit, however, once I did, after Ariel, the main character, goes to avenge her kidnapped mistress, I found it hard to put down. The characters grow before your eyes and mature (well, in the case of the heroine) in a decently subtle way that it almost catches you off guard when you realize it had happened. The wraiths make for lovely side characters, despite their hideousness and piteous behavior. The conclusion to this book, though, left me wanting more (and I was not disappointed). I especially enjoyed the Ridding Rime, or Ravenna's Rime. It gives the reader a chance to try to figure out the story without actually ruining anything in advance (unless you figure it out, that is)."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"It's the first in a trilogy, but it can actually stand alone quite well. In fact, I found the story arc was thinning in some places by the end of the third book, which was inevitable, but not necessarily satistfying. This is the best of the series, though. Nevertheless, all of the books were quite absorbing. Pierce knows how to tell a good tale. It's never failed to impress me that she managed to do something different and beautiful with the vampire genre."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I am so glad to see this series in print again. Pierce manages to blend fantasy and science fiction in a dark, stylish and completely original manner. Like nothing I've read before or since."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I loved this trilogy! Not just for young adults.The first one was the best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read this trilogy when I was 13 in the mid eighties and I loved it. Just loved it. I could easily picture the desert, the dark castle, the dead virgins and Irrylath - oh, Irrylath - the vampire. I was completely in love with this character. So perhaps one has to be a teenager to fully appreciate this trilogy.This series will for ever hold a special place in my heart and though I don't appreciate the ending (hence only 4 stars) it is most definitely worth a read.If Meredith Ann Pierce ever comes to her senses and writes a sequel I will be the first one to buy it!!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"I read this trilogy in high school, and after 5 years, I discovered it again amongst the long list of books I've read over the years. It's rare when a book series actually sends a stab of nostalgia and the overwhelming desire to read it again through me, but this is one of few series that does so.This series is well written and completely absorbing, which is as expected from Ms Pierce. I read this series and I will be completely oblivious to the world for hours.The creativity of her environments, the fantastic creatures, the societies and peoples, the memories and backstories of her characters are all so in depth that when one reads the story they feel as though they are an invisible character that is never mentioned, but always there- you feel as though you are there- in fact, I often was quite startled when Iw as interrupted in my reading of them- I was so entranced and absorbed by the books I forgot I was in my room.If you're looking for a series to tide you over until the Last Harry potter book comes out, this is definitely the one to get- you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Published in 1982 The Darkangel by Meredith Pierce is a book I enjoyed reading in my high school years in the late 1980s. I remember how I enjoyed the weird landscape, the shattered history, the strange creatures, the fantasy mixed with a hint of science.The main character, Aeriel, must save the Princess from the vampyre. Not just because they are friends, which I don't think they are, but because she may be blamed for what happened to the Princess or even sold into slavery. So she gets herself kidnapped by the vampyre who takes her to his castle. And the story begins.I don't want to give too much away, but I will say the story seems to remind me a lot of the semi-fantasy works of Gene Wolfe and Diana Wynne Jones."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"As a rabid reader, I found myself drawn into this book right on page one.

I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"This book first struck me as just a little neat book with some made up words for every day objects, any other fantasy book. As it went on, however, the scale got much larger and got much more beautiful. Aeriel is a great heroine, someone that represents the element of love in all of us, willing to do anything for that \\"what if?\\". Her ultimate sacrifice for beauty and innocence was the best part. I couldnt put this book down, i read it in one day actually.Also, I've never read a vampire novel that actually had the vampire with wings, i loved it, for its something i've always wanted to see in a book personally. Now i can't wait to read the second one!"},{"Title":"The Darkangel (Darkangel Trilogy)","review":"Pierce's \\"Firebringer\\" trilogy was written for kids. So...when I read this book (and its two sequels), I was expecting to read a kid's story. Instead, I was amazed by the depth of \\"The Darkangel.\\"To the person who couldn't get past Pierce's style of description: The spinning wheel made yarn out of emotions. Aeriel was surprised that she was spinning anything-and the yarn that she was spinning was made from her own feeling of surprise. Does that help any? (Pierce's storytelling voice is, indeed, a little strange...but that just means that you have to pay attention to the details!)"},{"Title":"Junior High and Middle School TalkSheets Psalms and Proverbs--Updated!","review":"This is an awesome book.

Since the pages are meant to be copied and handed out, the pages should have been perforated or given a URL to download them from.2. Actually a continuation of 1.

There certainly are a lot of riddles in here, and the index is very helpful so you can find ones on certain topics, but many of the riddles sound old-fashioned, like they were from the 1960s or so. I assume kids are the ones using this book the most, and I can't imagine that they relate to many of these riddles. Also, many of the riddles are only lukewarm (not that witty or funny).

The notes are thought-provoking and make useful cross-links to other legal cases. The presentation is effective as well, with a logical progression from a statement of the rule through several particulars and qualifications. The book is perhaps too dense to be useful for a complete beginner not grounded by a good textbook on Roman law or previous education in the subject, but just superb for the classroom or continued self-study."},{"Title":"A Casebook on the Roman Law of Delict (Classical Resources Series / American Philological Associati)","review":"Frier's work is an excellent inroduction to the Roman legal system and, in turn, to legal reasoning in today's world. Although this book is probably best utilized in a &quot;case method&quot; classroom setting (I was fortunate enough to take Bruce Frier's Roman Law class here at the University of Michigan), the discussion questions at the end of each case are excellent tools to help one reason each situation for himself. If you have any interest in why lawyers think in the method that they do, then this is an excellent way to introduce yourself to that line of thought."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I read this book cover to cover on an airplane flights as the whole controversy was bubbling over about Springsteen's &quot;41 Shots&quot; song about the Diallo shooting NYC. This excellent book provides a compelling context to understand this issue. Anyone who thinks Springsteen is some phony, trying to capitalize on a tragegy to make money should sit down and read this book. The book is well-documented and avoids a lot of the vacous rah-rah the fills the usual rock biography. Read it."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"The perfect balance of scholarship and heart, this book looks at Bruce Springsteen's music in the context of life at the end of the 20th century. The author makes no secret of being a fan--a long term, dedicated, would do almost anything to see him type of fan. But this is not a fawning, hero worshipping treatise. Bruce, the fallible human being, the two legged mortal, just like the rest of us, is examined here. Happily, the book is about the music, and deals with the personal aspects of his life only when commenting on how they influence his song writing and performance. Anyone in search of salacious celebrity gossip should look elsewhere. But if the soundtrack of your life begins with Greetings From Asbury Park and ends with 18 Tracks (and the wait for the next release), you will read things that make you laugh, reflect, appreciate, and be glad that you--and Bruce--are alive."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I have read a number of books on Springsteen, and this is by far and away the finest written and most insightful and balanced account of his life, both in and out of the studio. Anyone who is a fan of Bruce or is interested in reading about a great songwriter and entertainer will enjoy this book. It provides wonderful insight into what made Springsteen an icon of the 80s as well as what drives him on stage."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"written by a self-confessed fan, this book captures the larger importance of Bruce by careful attention and subtle appreciation of Springsteen's work placed into social context. it's fun if you love Springsteen's music and want to think about it too. many insights supported by careful research and obvious deep appreciation of the artist and his work."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I picked up this book when I first discovered the music of Bruce Springsteen. I was immediately taken by the way Alterman described his own experience as a fan. Everything that I was feeling and lacked the language for was perfectly described: all of the admiration, all the of the love and all of the indescribable feelings that I had were perfectly explained and outlined within this book. He very eloquently explains why Springsteen's music resonated and still resonates with so many of us. He analyses songs and without sounding too trite or pretentious, explains why the songs and their lyrics affect us the way that they do.In addition, as a fan I was able to learn a lot about the man that I had recently come to admire as an artist. I learned about his upbringing, influences, recording process and began to piece together the man that I come to know as a very important figure in rock culture and in my own life. In coupling a biography with his own personal stories Alterman helps to tell the story of Springsteen while also shedding light on what the life of a fan is and the effect that he has on so many people in America and across the world. Sure sometimes it might sound like he's gushing but if you're a Springsteen fan you feel like he's right there with you."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I thought that the book took a while to get going. The first few chapters are largely just a restatement of the basic facts of the Springsteen story. These facts are well known and Altman doesn't add that much. In fact throughout the book he relies, heavily, on widely available secondry sources like Springsteen's book Songs which is a pity because Altman's own insights are always very interesting. But the book definitely does improve a lot as Altman gets into his stride. It's great strength is the way that the author, mainly in the second half or two thirds of the book, is able to make sense of Springsteen's work in a political and social context without ever being reductive or simplistic about ideas like class and manhood. In fact Altman always uses theory as an aid to see more clearer and is not, like most academic writers, blinded by theory. Altman is also really good at explaining the deep meaning that Springsteen's work has for his listeners.The book should have been a lot longer, it always feels as if Altman is just scratching the surface. But the second half of the book does have enough of Altman's valueable insights to make it, in the end, an exciting and inspiring read.I started off a little frustrated but ended up moved."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Alterman presents a well researched and documented book complete with analysis that attempts to explain why Springsteen's art motivates others to take direct action in their own respective communities. The book seems to suggest that Springsteen is providing a soundtrack for the idealism that the pundits have told us died in earlier years. Sprinsteen reminds us that we aren't alone struggling in the wilderness for the things that matter; that there is a communitiy of people out there who are working toward better lives in their own neighborhoods and there is something to this idea that there is power and redemption to be found in rock-n-roll; but let us not forget, through it all, the politics and ideas of community aside, there was an 11th commandment; &quot;Let it rock&quot;."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This book is more like Eric Alterman's personal diary of his devotion to Bruce Springsteen. The introduction of the book tells of his meeting and shaking hands with Bruce in the green room of The Charlie Rose Show and ends with him attending a show at the Asbury Park Convention Center before the start of Bruce's reunion tour with the E Street Band. In between we get more of Alterman's account of how Bruce affected his life. The book does provide a biography of Bruce's life and his work, but it has been told before and much better in other Bruce books (most notable of course is Dave Marsh's &quot;Born to Run&quot;). Alterman is a political and cultural commentator and the one saving grace of the book is his commentary on Bruce's political leanings and his effect on our culture. Also, it contains an account of his 90's work which has not been extensively written about to date. Being a huge Springsteen fan myself, I want to read everything that comes out about him and that's what lead me to this book. After reading it, I was very disappointed. The book is competently written and if it had more cultural insight and less Alterman it would have made for a better book. For true Springsteen devotees only."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This is one of the toughest books for me to rate because two different kinds of people will have different reactions to this book.Springsteen fans will love it. They won't learn any new biographical information (most/all of Alterman's research comes out of Springsteen bios and Backstreets magazine) but they will gain fresh perspective on where Springsteen has come from and what he has meant to all of us. That's why I give this book four stars instead of three. Some artists transcend their craft and Alterman shows how Springsteen has been more than catchy tunes and lyrics.But if you're not a Springsteen fan, this is a two/three-star book. It is a non-critical look at a hero by a fan. There's some inside baseball here and Alterman writes as though he expects his reader to have some pretty thorough background knowledge of Springsteen.Ultimately, if you're a Springsteen fan or interested in how music has affected culture and politics in America in the last quarter of the century, this is a good place to go."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"A decent timeline of Bruce from Freehold to the reunion tour. Interesting to connect the dots to what world events were about to take place and the inspiration for The Rising and beyond. An easy read from the perspective of a long-time fan. In places the author loses eloquence for the sake of details, but those instances are limited."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This book is well researched, well written and fun to read. I learned much more about Bruce on the human vs. superstar side."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This is certainly not the definitive Bruce bio- nor does it pretend to be. All one has to do is read the introduction and get that all this book pretends to be is \\"something to say\\". In some ways, that's a lot like Bruce.As this is a fan letter, it's obviously pro- pro- Bruce. It tends to gloss over some of the more disappointing aspects of his life and career. But, then again, most people who actually read the book are in that camp. You can pretty much ignore the one star reviews for that reason. In addition, the author makes it pretty clear what his favorite albums are, and even if you are a hard-core Bruce fan, you may disagree.I think this is worth a read, then if you are really interested in Bruce one should read other accounts of him to get a broader perspective."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I heard from a friend that Alterman's &quot;Ain't No Sin...&quot; was a book about Bruce's political and social relevance (something that was done with, I should say, somewhat better results in &quot;Tramps Like Us&quot;). Coming from this perspective, its shortcomings are not great and Alterman is an astute observer."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"A good, quick read that covers all the ground Marsh's early promotional bio did, with additional insight into the psyche of the artist, his impact on pop culture, his political and spiritual evolution, and the nature of his fans from the perspective of a fan.

The tale he tells of being kicked out of a car while sick for wanting to see a local Springsteen concert on Yom Kippur is priceless, and this book is full of moments like that which fuse respect and biography until they're inextricable. It makes the argument that an artist's life, no matter how interesting (and I find Springsteen's fascinating), is just there to serve the listener's passion for his work. I wouldn't recomment it for non-Springsteen fans like some reviewers here (why'd they even go past page 10?), but if you've found yourself drawn into the promise and messages of a certain artist, you'll find emotions to bury yourself in here."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I just finished reading Eric Alterman's brand new book on Bruce Springsteen, entitled &quot;It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive -- The Promise of Bruce Springsteen,&quot; and I can safely say it is a very solid, well-researched, and thoughtful book. The book is definitely a worthy read.Alterman's book is not so much a biography (which in many ways it is), as much as it is a substantive and interesting look at Springsteen's artistic work and productive career. As a result, the reader gets an insightful feel for where Springsteen fits in the grand scheme of American history and pop culture, as well as a meaningful human portrait of a rock 'n' roll icon.Most of the book is devoted to conceptual and thematic interpretations of Bruce's albums and songs. However, to avoid purely subjective analysis, Alterman intelligently talks about the political and social times under which these albums were released. This has the overall effect of bringing Springsteen's work ALIVE for the reader and giving him or her the proper context to more fully understand what Bruce was striving for at that point in his career. All the while, there are biographic facts and stories interspersed which helps put flesh and life on the subject. In other words, when you read about Springsteen in Alterman's book you feel like you're actually reading about another human being, not some aloof and detached celebrity.Alterman is also very fair in his writing. He talks about the legendary triumphs of Born to Run and Nebraska, as well as the artistic struggles and 2nd-rate nature of much of the Human Touch material.The best element of this book is the human portrait of Bruce Springsteen that emerges. Springsteen has an amazing and unique gift from God and we are blessed to live during a time in which we can appreciate him and his music, first-hand. In so many ways, he has the amazing ability to inspire an intense personal relationship with his art. For many people over the last 25 years, Bruce has been a tremendous source of hope and inspiration, as well as a &quot;reason to believe&quot; on so many days and nights when we felt not so special or unique.How many artists in any medium can you say this about? The substance-abuse problems, embarassing movie roles, and just plain crap that so many, if not all other, artists put out during their career is wholly absent from Springsteen's career. It's difficult, if not impossible, for me to think of another artist of any worth who has received so much commericial and critical success while still retaining integrity and credibility.So, Eric Alterman's book not only reminds us of all of these things, but most of all everything that is human about the artist. In the end, we're left not so much with an account of a singer's career for the last 25 or so years, but in some weird way a guide on how to live a life of worth and meaning. A testament of how to go through the storm and come out with your soul and integrity intact. An inspiration to have the will and faith to believe in yourself, as well as your dreams. How not to lose your innocence and aspirations in the face of the harsh reality called becoming an adult in today's world.As a Springsteen fan, I've read a number of articles and books on him and his music. Alterman's work is probably my favorite. It's interesting, insightful, and rewarding.Tom Bernardo"},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Eric Alterman, a Springsteen fan himself, writes with insight and sympathy for Bruce Springsteen, a man who, despite his wealth and success, is still trying to figure himself out and be honest to his core values. Springsteen is trying to be the conscience of America while also it's best concert entertainer backed by the best band in the land. No mean task! No wonder he's such a perfectionist. As other books have implied, Eric Alterman leaves me feeling that Bruce makes all of his fans better for helping them keep in touch with the better angels of their nature. This book will only increase the reader's appreciation for Bruce Springsteen, the man and his art."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"I was excited when I learned on the internet that this book was going to be released. Eric Alterman does a great job gathering an enormous amount of information, which he uses to put the reader in the room with Bruce. From the John Hammond audition, to the many late nights in the studio trying to perfect an album, to the night Mr. Alterman got to meet his hero, the reader is right in the middle of it all. Along with this, Alterman sprinkles in personal stories of sacrificing anything to get to see Bruce in concert. Any true fan knows what he is talking about and can relate to his love of Springsteen and his music. The book was so well written that it will cause me to research other things that Alterman has done. Feel free to send me your comments, or if you want a Bruce fan to chat with."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This is a really fun book for someone (like me) who both makes a living working in and writing about politics and who has spent more time than I normally would like to admit listening to the Boss. What's most compelling is Alterman's tracing (in a NOT academic way) Bruce's various views of community. He's picked up several Springsteen references to his nation of fans as an &quot;imagined community&quot;, words taken almost directly from Benedict Anderson's book about nationalism that bears the same title.I have one small reason for not giving this book a fifth star. I would have hoped that a writer of such talent in indentifying various bodies of thought would have been able to secure an interview with Springsteen. Much of this book demands comment from the Boss -- such as hearing what our self-taught muse has read that has influenced him. Occassional comments in other interviews or in concert monologues is an odd way to assemble his thought ... more akin to writing about a dead president than the living king of rock.Or the quintessentially American tension in his music between rebellion and responsibility. Most rock artists (other than say Dylan) have avoided taking it on directly in their lyrics. What does this say about the limits of Rock as an art form? I want to know what the Boss thinks.A draft of this manuscript certainly should have been worthy of getting a few hours of Springsteen's time so that he could speak more directly about his ideas. And if Alterman did try to do this and failed, that in itself is a story worth telling.Still, a really fun read. I read it in two sittings."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"&quot;If a body catch a body comin' through the rye&quot; Holden Caulfield would have loved Bruce Springsteen. He's no phony (to us or himself) and Alterman captures that so well.Bruce has the same frailties that we have, which endears him all the more. My parents died several years ago and the home we grew up in was sold. I found myself driving out of my way to go past the old home without really knowing why. Alterman gives an insight into Bruce having the same unconscious habit that has given me something to think about regarding my own past.I could not put this book down. There is a lot of human insight in this book that non-fans could even connect with. Alterman knows his subject. It's a great story and my next book is a letdown already."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Having read the vast majority of books on the subject. I am happy to say that this is the most intelligent and most enjoyable. A perfect balance of biography and wider analysis, the book manages to remain mature and interesting while still capturing all the childlike drama and passion of being a Springsteen fan. Where Jim Cullen's work was dry and self concously academic, this book is both human and enlightening. Not a source of the minute biographical detail that would thrill an obsesive fan, but beautifully capturing all that is positive and invigorating about Bruce Springsteen. If you are looking for a good introduction to the subject then this is it. If you are already a convert then this will help to send that shiver of excitement back through your soul."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Notwithstanding a few glaring factual errors, Alterman accomplishes what no other writer has: he explains the rational (in the view of this Bruce nut) near-religious ferver and devotion of Bruce Springsteen's core fans. I want my wife to read this book, so she might understand why I drop everything and fly around the country every few years to see a 50 years old man and his close friends sing and play for three hours a night. The stories are largely derived from Dave Marsh's hagiographies, but the book works."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"It Ain't No Sin to be Glad You're Alive, is a critical/biographical look at Springsteen that is wholly objective, yet deeply personal. This combines for a narrative that ultimately moves the reader the way the best of Springsteen's music does - to the emotional realization that rock 'n' roll can matter in our lives, that it does matter. Alterman's occasional personal asides only liven the material. For a reader who is roughly the same age as Springsteen's carreer, the insight into what it felt like to be a teenager when Born to Run came out was especially powerful. Also, as someone who has never seen him in concert, the closing made me feel a little closer to what I missed without creating a larger sense of loss. That is, Alterman connected through his writing and recreated the feeling of the experience as best as one can on paper. A great book for lovers of Springsteen or lovers of rock in general."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"More than a biography, this book is more a long essay about the cultural significance of the music of Bruce Springsteen and its far reaching - almost religious - impact on audiences: how Bruce was perceived during the Born to run era, the infamous Time &amp; Newsweek's covers, the hype, the ups of downs of the eighties and the final, successful come back tour. Bruce has always been - except during the Lucky Town/Human Touch episode - a critical success if not always a sales success, and many quotes from rock critics are added to prove the point, and the author does not hide his love for Springsteen's work, but his views are always well-centered.But the greatest value of this Alterman's work is perhaps the solid interpretation he makes of the albums and the songs. He has helped me see his music and each album under a new light and, must I say it, only deepened my admiration for the Boss."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Eric Alterman has achieved in this book what I belive no other author has been able to achieve when it comes to analysing the music of Bruce Springsteen. In it he delves into the lyrics to Bruce Springsteen songs and how they reflect what stage of life he was experiecing at a certain time in his career.In addition, each albumn is analysed in terms of success and artistic merit, as well as a look at the tours conducted following each record. A must for any long time Bruce Springsteen fan, as well as any new fans of the &quot;Boss&quot;."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"A work that does justice to Springsteen. It perfectly captures the power of his art and explains why he means so much to so many people. Not only does it provide criticial insight into his work, it shows how his art intersected with the events of his life and the culture around him. Well written and totally engrossing, it is a pleasure to read. If you only get one Springsteen book, this should be it."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Agreed - it does read like a term paper. Not sure if it was over-edited and any potentially interesting stuff was taking out, or if it wasn't touched and too much about the author was left in (who cares if his family didn't like him going to the No Nukes concerts on Yom Kippur?). Alterman is a professional, and this reads like a college paper. Quoting other journalists (especially Griel Marcus) is just lazy, and quoting from the songs is amateurish. Most unforgivable line: &quot;changes made uptown and the big man joined the band&quot; to cover Clarence Clemmons joining the E Street Band permanently. It made my skin crawl. Don't waste your time unless you don't know anything about Springsteen."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This book serves as a good introduction to learning about Bruce Springsteen and his music, his band, and career. But it is by no means a great literary masterpiece. In fact, it is not literary, at all. What it is is a good way to learn about Bruce. However, I have found the best way to learn about Bruce is to listen to his interviews, watch his concerts, listen to his albums, read articles in unbiased magazines, and read his lyrics. Bruce is not an intellectual on par with some of the great minds of today, whoever they are, but he does have something to say and he tends to do it well. His meat and potatoes are in his live performances. That is where you'll find the real Bruce Springsteen. When on stage and behind a telecaster, he is simply unbeatable, even at age 54.Alterman does a good job of laying the basics down. That is about it. One has to be care when reading about Springsteen because people either love him or they don't get it and then they try to tear him down. Most people who don't like Bruce and write about him are simply too negative and their lack of understanding what he is all about becomes evident. Also, writers who knock Springsteen usually have an axe to grind about some other issue, such as Springsteen replacing Dylan or some other crap that doesn't matter. Saying things like \\"fans ought to get a life,\\" is a good example of that. People who really like Bruce, like Alterman, tend to soft pedal the questionable aspects of his career, and their worship of him comes through like glossy paint.I'm still waiting for the definitive biography of Bruce Springsteen, this is not it."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"THe writer is a gifted one, but the book is weak. It should have been longer. This is HARDLY the definitive Bruce biography. This has yet to be written...Anyway, it's a fast reading that will give you a general portrait of his career.But, one observation about his defense of the total commercialism of the BORN IN THE USA album: I like the BORN IN THE USA album. But, if the video for DANCING IN THE DARK is not a total sell out, well, I don't know what a sell out is anymore.."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Pure and simply the best book about Springsteen--or any other rock star--I have ever read."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This book reads like an 11th grade term paper. Nothing new -- just repeating information gleaned from other sources. Thankfully it's short, so I didn't waste too much time on it."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"This is a useless piece of thumbsucking in which the author rambles on as he attempts to cash in on a great artist."},{"Title":"It Ain't No Sin To Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen","review":"Eric Alterman and Bruce have one thing in common. They both worship the ground Bruce walks on. Eric, and fans like him, that bow at the altar of Bruce need to get a life. The idea that Bruce or Eric have a &quot;cultural impact&quot; is just nonsense. Bruce is a talented songwriter and performer and it pretty much ends right there. Making him the focal point of ones life will rob you of time. If Bruce has a message in his songs it's about movement in life and growing up so why can't fans just take the advice he offers and let it rest already."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"Fast paced and marvelously inventive, with a wealth of characters, settings, and events. You'll look at the last page number and wonder where the authors put all that great stuff in a book of such ordinary length. Unabashadly self-congratulatory in its theme of humanity's superiority over all other species, largely due to the average human's refusal to give up in the face of pain or adversity."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"This is one of the few books I read more than once as a teenager. In fact, I was reading it on February 9th, 1971 at 6:01 a.m. when the big Sylmar earthquake hit. What a rude way to have a good book interrupted.

Keith Laumer is one of my favorite authors. However, I rank Earthblood in the lower middle of his works, it's somber and sad where many of his stories are powerful and noble and fun. I recommend Planet Run or Great Time Machine Hoax or The Long Twilight or, of course, any of the Bolo or Retief stories. I also credit Laumer with increasing my vocabulary, his use and play with words is edutainment of a high order."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"I first read this book at the age of 13. Before I was 20 I'd read it 14 times. Now, at 42, I've read it again, and my opinion has changed greatly. This novel has many things right with it but oh so many things wrong.Unusually for a science fiction novel, it starts before the main character is born. The book is wildly colorful and bathed in blood from the very beginning, as Roan Cornay's future parents are attacked shortly after purchasing him as an embryo. After birth, Roan begins to learn of his unique heritage as a Terran, member of a race which once ruled the galaxy until they were challenged by the powerful Niss. The war between the Terrans and Niss ended, seemingly, in mutual destruction 5,000 years earlier, and now Terrans are rare in the galaxy.Roan grows up in poverty among many races of aliens on a dirty, backwater world. Logical problems manifest themselves immediately, as the book begins to play on its theme of human superiority by showing us species with limited abilities, primarily lacking the capacity for creative thought and relying instead on pre-programmed instinct. Unfortunately, the point is carried to ludicrous extremes with a species called Gracyls (actually, the name for a species of crow) who, despite an ability to fly, cling to trees in blind panic when attacked by lumbering saurians. Laumer and Brown obviously gave little thought to the process of Darwinian evolution. On our world, even the stupidest flying insects fly away when attacked. In the Laumer and Brown universe, winged beings with written language and technology have failed to manage this instinctive response. So much for the science in this science fiction novel.Rosel George Brown was a female writer who came late to the field of letters. Keith Laumer was a devotee of Raymond Chandler novels and aped his style. However, the melding of the two writers produced a hyper-macho tale with zero feminine edge. The style is brash and the plot soon decomes drowned in a sea of brutality.When Roan is a teenager, he's kidnapped by a traveling space circus. This is probably the best extended sequence in the book. The beings are colorful and credit must be given to Laumer and Brown for doing good work on the backstories of various characters. The character of Iron Robert is especially compelling.Laumer's affinity for the Chandleresque tough-guy style gives this book a meaner edge than any other sf adventure I've read, and in many ways a more believable one. The novel is driven by the passions of even relatively minor characters such as the angry Itch. This gives the book a certain gut-level realism that's refreshing in the often plot-oriented world of sf.Roan Cornay proves to be a tremendous brawler. Unlike most other sf heroes, Roan is willing to go to any length, however vicious, to win a fight. He doesn't merely beat his opponents, he mangles, disfigures and cripples them. Indeed, he's something of a sociopath.We can commend the bravery Laumer and Brown showed in creating such a flawed character. Roan, driven by the anger and violence within him, makes many mistakes and senselessly kills several people.Roan is captured by space pirates who raid the circus. This eventually leads to a scene on the planet Aldo Cerise which, in my view, is the single most beautiful passage in the book. However, it also has its share of logic flaws.As the book rushes towards its conclusion, the level of violence and illogical plot twists rises. Death loses its dramatic impact. Situations and plot twists become more contrived and unbelievable, and almost always result in someone (often many someones) being killed. The violence, the macho posturing and platitudes, become wearying. Also wearying is all the lunkhead tough-guy dialog.This is unfortunate. While it's true that &quot;Earthblood&quot; is entirely lacking in speculative rigor and instead intensifies the shopworn elements of space opera, it's also true that the scope of this book exceeds that of any other space opera I've encountered. This novel could have been a masterpiece if handled with more restraint, if it had been allowed greater length so as to avoid the rushed feeling of its conclusion, and if the characterization had been more nuanced. It would have been better without silly 'love at first sight' disease. It would have been better if...There are too many ifs. In the end this is a very flawed book. In many ways it's a fairly dumb novel, a comic-book novel. The final scene is practically imbecilic. From my own experience, I'd say it's a great novel to read when you're a teenager. It would also make a fantastic movie. Older readers will want to think twice about this one.Finally, I wanted to rate this book two-and-a-half stars, but that wasn't available, so for the sake of sentiment I went with a higher rating."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"Earthblood (1966) by Keith Laumer and Rosel George Brown - 311 pages - rating: 7.0/10A boy is born to foster parents in the slum of a far away planet and yearns to discover his roots.This cross galaxy space adventure has weird creatures, mutant human pirates, space battles and lots of fighting. I like the gritty unpolished feel of the narrative. At times it feels like a book written for a younger audience and yet at others the violence and gore is clearly meant for older readers.The sensibilities are unusual and one wonders at some of the authors' plot choices. But while its apparent that the authors do not necessarily give you the good feeling of everything working out well for the hero all the time the result does have a more realistic and less fairytale feel. Some people may not like this approach.There were periods where I loved this book and others when I felt myself just waiting for it to get good again. Perhaps this can be explained by the fact it was written by 2 authors.Overall a good, but not great space opera.Claus Kellermann2006 June 5Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"The two produced a work far below what they normally write. The narrative was barely readable and did not flow smoothly. Characters presented were shallow and disappointing."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"As with many other reviewers, I first read this book when it came out (I still have my SF Book Club edition) and re-read it every few years. It is as perfect an example of the 'space opera' genre as you could ask for: a tragic and somewhat flawed main character with a mysterious origin, driven to find what happened to the now-vanished Terran empire. One reviewer here (Steve Duff) criticized it as brutal and violent; I suggest he go read some biographies of Alexander the Great.Again, as with others, echoes of this book stay with me. The child Roan growing up among aliens and Terran hybrids and struggling to hold his own. His joining, of all things, an interstellar circus, and then a crew of interstellar pirates. Searching for Terra, the homeworld, and what he finds there. And all along the way, making mistakes, hurting those who love him the most, and suffering bittersweet loss.A great read, and one that will stay with you, too."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"Although I read this book over 30 years ago, the story has not been forgotten. I actually did a report on this story in grade school (Now I'm 47!) A really great adventure of imagery in true exotic science fiction fashion.

Although a test tube baby born from an alien woman, his genes originate from the now mythic planet once known as Terra (Earth), a planet that at one time in the ancient past, ruled the galaxy. In the present ultra-future time, Roan learns of his legendary home world and then proceeds to dedicate his efforts to find his home world Terra, a planet most believe never existed.

It's even better with age. It's a classic, unapologetically politically-incorrect tale of a human child who claws his way to the top in a universe after the downfall of the Terran Empire. If you like classic Heinlein (not the bizarre self-indulgent stuff he cranked out in his last years), you'll love this book."},{"Title":"EARTHBLOOD","review":"Great fun! Laumer deliver's (as usual). It's not Dune, and it's not aspiring to be high art ... more of an action packed Heinlein juvenile, which is not a bad thing to be. Typical Laumer elements. Hero who doesn't know when to quit.

These stories date from the 1960s.Part I: Earthblood (1966)Raff and Bella come to Tambool seeking a viable Terran embryo to raise as their son. They have almost five hundred credits for the purchase. The dealer has an embryo that matches their desires, but wants two citizenships (worth about two thousands credits) for it. After some haggling, Raff and Bella pay the price.Raff and Bella are followed from the dealer's office. They enter a cul-de-sac and then turn on their pursuers. Raff proves to be much more than the followers expect. All the pursuers except T'hoy hoy are killed, but Raff has broken bones throughout his body.T'hoy hoy is with the attackers and pleas for his life. Bella agrees to take him as a slave. He is a storyteller and spends much of his time telling Roan about the Terrans.Roan grew up playing with gracyl children about his age. The young gracyls dig holes and Roan digs one even deeper than theirs. Later, the gracyls practice flying and Roan finds another way to join the game. Roan misses out on the mating rituals until a white female falls on him.When Roan becomes sixteen, he tries to sneak into the Grand Vorplisch Extravaganzoo and is caught by the security guards. Then Roan spots Raff inside the tent and tries to reach him. Raff is clubbed down and Roan is dragged away.Part II: The Niss Stories by Keith Laumer\\"The Long Remembered Thunder\\" (Worlds of Tomorrow, 1963) is about a visitor who comes to Earth to prevent a Niss conquest and falls in love with a native woman.\\"The Other Sky\\" (WoT, 1963) is a science fiction fairy tale involving Little People, space, and time.\\"The Soul Buyer\\" (Amazing, 1964, as \\"The Further Sky\\") concerns a man who is very curious and goes for whatever he wants.Part III: Stories bt Rosel George Brown\\"Save Your Confederate Money, Boys\\" (Fantastic Universe, 1959) relates a tale of a Yankee boyfriend, southern swamps, and new immigrants.\\"Flower Arrangement\\" (Galaxy, 1959) explains the construction of a unique composition by Sally Jo and her son Tommy.\\"Fruiting Body\\" (F&SF;, 1962) exposes the fate of a wife fed a special fungus.\\"Visiting Professor\\" (Fantastic, 1961) considers the reaction of a small college to an academic from the future.\\"Car Pool\\" (If, 1959) deals with eight preschool children, an alien schoolmate and a respectable woman.\\"And a Tooth\\" (Fantastic, 1962) considers experimental brain surgery and the resulting split personality.These stories are mostly standalones, although the novel is based on the far future of the Retief universe. The Niss are the bad guys in the Laumer works, but have no other distinctive traits. So his stories are about the humans-- and Little People -- rather than the aliens.The Laumer stories are action adventures. The Brown stories are about personal relations and changes. The two authors together wrote one of the best novels in science fiction.Highly recommended for Laumer & Brown fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of social struggles, interpersonal conflicts, and strange circumstances.

It immediately clicked with me and I've reread the book at least once every five years since.We don't know what's happened to humanity, but its legacy is a proud one. And embryos with human genes are prized above all others. Roan is 'purchased' as an embryo, brought to term and raised by his adopted parents, and spends his life seeking his roots. His trials and adventures appeal to teenagers and teenagers-at-heart with questions of 'Who am I?', 'Where did I come from?', 'Why am I different from everyone else?', 'What makes me unique?'.Roan's parents bankrupt themselves for the opportunity to purchase a son that may actually be human. As a boy living a poor, integrated neighborhood (with all forms of aliens), Roan experiences poverty, prejudice, fear, and dreams for a better life. A traveling, galactic circus gives Roan a chance to experience a new life, where friendship, love, loyalty, and competition give him a chance to develop and forge new relationships while exploring the possibilities of his heritage.After a pirate attack on the circus, Roan learns to exercise some control over his environment and to become a leader.

This book gives by far the best outline of what his contributions were to the revolution. While many books on Lenin's life seem to focus too much on his childhood, his years in exile, and his relationship with Krupskaya and Iskra, Hill focuses more on what Lenin's from the revolutionary standpoint. There is a great and brief introduction on how the Revolution (both 1905 and 1917) came about, and sheds a little more light on how exactly the Bolsheviks gained power, which according to Hill was by public persuasion and popular vote in the elections. There is also a great focus on what the Russian Revolution actually meant, and how it was a case of trial and error policies while still sticking to Marxist fundamentals. Hill argues that the uniqueness of the Russian Revolution prevented the Bolsheviks and Lenin from adapting Marx's and Engels' ideas directly. The book has a bit of a weak point as there is a large part dedicated to the crisis in World War I that I personally think could have been explained a little more in depth. Also, there are chronological inconsistencies as the book jumps from different periods sporadically; an aspect that hinders the flow of the book a bit. Aside from these minor problems, I think this book does a great job of telling Lenin's story from the most important perspective: the revolution."},{"Title":"Lenin and the Russian revolution (Men and their times)","review":"Written in 1947 and updated in 1971 and 1992, this is a sympathetic and balanced summary of Lenin's life and the part he played in the rise of Russian communism and the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. As it is impossible to understand anything about Lenin without reference to Russia, it is fair to say that this book is equally about that great country's history too.Part One skillfully covers a great deal of material, sketching the history preceding the Revolution (1870-1917), the state of the society then, international relations, and the formative influences on the Lenin himself.Part Two covers the Revolution, the formation of the iron-fist in iron-glove state party, the appeal to the peasants' interests (usually by mere sloganism, 80% of the people still worked on the land), the rise of the Soviets (workers' caucuses) as an effective mechanism of power, and the building of a Socialism with a capital 'S', that is, with a world-dominating intent. The vision from the earliest was to bring Russia into the 20th century, expressed initially in the desire to industrialize, and bring electricity and railways to all parts of the land. The fervour with which they planned and worked is comparable to any other visionary movement of which we know the detailed history. The author draws interesting comparisons between the psychology of the English Puritans in the English Civil War (17th century) and that of the Bolsheviks.Part Three covers the aftermath of the Revolution and the rise to power of Lenin's Generalissimo, Stalin (the self-dubbed 'Man of Steel'), who styled himself as Lenin's disciple. [The only clear inaccuracy in the book is the attribution of Lenin's death to a \\"stroke\\", which was put out as the official explanation. It has since been recently revealed from the Russian archives that he died of the disease he was being treated for, syphilis. His doctors were treating him with arsenic-based Salvarsan, only used to treat syph., and as it has some very unpleasant side effects no one is prescribed it on a just-in-case basis.) The essential nature of the personality cult of Lenin as autocratic father-figure, which was essential to the Revolution and its aftermath, was set early on. Lenin's ability to encompass the broad sweep of strategy and still focus on the fine detail is described by his foresight in the need to plan a full scale Russian armaments production capacity, and also know enough about a particular piece of anti-aircraft artillery to impress even military experts at an exhibition.The short 1992 postscript fairly acknowledges that the Soviet Socialist experiment has failed radically and finally. And let's face it folks, if the Soviets could not subdue Afghanistan after ten years of occupation, but when push came to shove, the US managed it in six weeks, the end was never ever really in doubt, was it?"},{"Title":"Woman's Book of Soul","review":"Most women end their day exhausted, stressed and wondering if it is all worth it.

Not much has changed in the Open Adoption world since this book was written."},{"Title":"The Open Adoption Book: A Guide to Adoption Without Tears","review":"The Open Adoption Book is A Guide to Adoption Without Tears. I want to live on the planet Dr. Rappaport resides on and so do the tens of thousands of women in the United States who surrender babies every year for adoption. The tears never stop, whatever adoption practice the children were placed under. Read Merry Bloch Jones, Birthmothers and you'll see \\"the amputation of the heart.\\" Rappaport describes open adoption as though it were a rose garden in which \\"...close relationships between the adoptive parents and birthparents become almost casual or routine, just as they would be in a biological family. The sense of normalcy is striking\\" (p. 120). Yes, of course, this may be the case with some open adoption arrangements, but Dr. Rappaport writes that \\"most open adoption families\\" consider the presence of the birthparent(s) \\"just a normal and routine part of their everyday lives.\\" We do not have longitudinal studies that support this view, and common sense tells us that it cannot be true of most open adoption arrangements. We learn in a see-saw of research papers that many birthmothers report that if they had to do it over again they would not have chosen adoption but raised the children themselves. Some would even have chosen abortion over adoption. Mothers relinquishing a child for adoption often tend toward more grief symptoms, especially if the adoption is an open one, than parents who had lost a child to death. Studies show that many mothers using open adoption often feel more socially isolated, express more difficulty with normal everyday life, feel more despair, and express more dependency than their counterparts using confidential adoptions.Dr. Rappaport's book was published in 1992, but meanwhile we do have more data available. We learn from the largest longitudinal study (720 individuals) conducted by Harold D. Grotevant and Ruth G. McRoy on the full range of adoptive openness, (Openness in Adoption, Exploring Family Connections. Sage 1998): \\"The clearest policy implication of our work is that no single type of adoption is best for everyone.\\" These authors warn that the long-term impact of openness for all parties in the adoptive kinship network is not known and longitudinal research is necessary to answer this question. Most importantly, the long-term impact of openness on the children is as yet unknown. In fully disclosed open adoption, the child is continually reminded that she has two mothers. This \\"insistence of differences\\" is a vulnerability in open-adoption families which professionals and laypersons are concerned about. David H. Kirk's Adoptive Kinship Theory predicts that openness in adoption imposes strains on all parties in the adoption triad as a result of role ambiguity. In their study Openness in Adoption, New Practices, New Issues, (Praeger, 1988) McRoy, Grotevant and White suggest that \\"The child may be more likely to feel that he is \`matched' with his adoptive parents, if he or she is not constantly reminded of the contrast between birthparents and adoptive parents.\\" The authors suggest that Semi-open adoptions (no personal contact between birthmothers and adoptive parents but non-identifying letters through the agency) tend to minimize problems regarding role expectations of adoptive parents and birthparents.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"Polarized Light: Fundamentals and Applications (Optical Engineering, Vol 36)","review":"I own a copy of Klinger's book &quot;Polarized Light in Optics and Spectroscopy.&quot; It's a very useful reference, and I find myself going back to it on an almost daily basis. I've been pretty satisfied with the information in Klinger's book, but phenomena relating to polarization are very important in my field (fiber optics) and so I decided it made good sense to get a copy of Collett's book, as well. I've not been disappointed.Collett's book has two parts. The first part is what I was mostly interested in, and it deals with polarization in the classic optical field. The second part of the book is less relevant for me, and deals with the classical and quantum theory of radiation by accelerating charges.The prerequisites for reading and understanding this book are pretty basic. For the first book, you'll want a strong basis in algebra, linear algebra, and trigonometry. For the second half of the book you'll also want to be versed in things like vector calculus (div, grad, curl, etc.) as well as some integral optics and concepts essential in quantum theory. Both the mathematics and physics should be easily within the grasp of anyone with a BS in physics or mathematics. This is not what I'd call a book for the armchair scientists. It is a specialist's book, with all the detail and mathematics to allow the specialist to do quantitative engineering and science.Collett offers one of the best all-around descriptions of the Mueller matrix that I've found. The book starts with some background information describing the wave equation, various interference experiments, and reflection and transmission at a dielectric interface. With this foundational information, he moves on to describe the polarization ellipse, leading naturally to a description of the Stokes polarization parameters. In all of this, Collett does a nice job of helping the reader understand the basis of the Stokes vector in actual measurements associated with the Stokes parameters, and their fundamental utility and practicality.With the concept of the Stokes parameters established, Collett proceeds to introduce the Muller matrix, and he derives the matrix form for several different optical components such as polarizers, phase plates, and the rotation matrix. He also has a useful chapter for the experimentalist, describing various techniques for measuring the Stokes parameters of optical components.There is an entire chapter on the derivation of the Mueller matrix of tilted dielectric surfaces. This discussion carries over into the next chapter where Collett derives the Mueller matrices of plates, and stacks of plates. [These derivations ignore multiple reflections, though Collett is careful to make this clear, and he provides chapter references where the student can look up the completely correct treatment.] This chapter has some interesting mathematics that can be quite useful in other polarization work, since it describes the process for linearizing the Mueller matrix in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues (something that makes the analysis of stacks of plates much easier to do).Reading this book, one gets the distinct impression that Collett favors the Muller matrix calculus over the Jones calculus. Still, he has included a very nice chapter on the Jones matrix calculus that is both relatively complete, as well as written in the same easy-to-understand fashion as the rest of the book.The chapter on the Poincare sphere was not quite what I'd expected, but was still very helpful and interesting. Be prepared to brush up on your spherical trigonometry when you read this chapter. I'd hoped for more information from a practical point of view (and a few better illustrations), so this was a bit of a disappointment. However, there are bits of practical information here, and the beauty of the spherical trigonometry is enough to make the chapter worthwhile on its own.The first book ends with a chapter on the interference laws of Fresnel and Arago, which seems a little strange. The chapter seems somewhat out of place, and, perhaps, better suited near the front of the book, though it does provide the opportunity to illustrate some of the principles learned in earlier chapters.Space does not permit a detailed description of the second half of the book (the first half is about 280 pages, and the entire book is roughly 580 pages).This is a first-rate book, and if you are involved in optics and polarization, in particular, you really owe it to yourself to have this one in your personal library. The book is well written, for the most part, pretty easy to follow (not a small task, given the subject matter), and nicely referenced with additional reading material listed at the end of each chapter. There is also an adequate index, which is a good thing, since this book will find widespread use as a reference text.I really have only two complaints: First, the book needs an appendix (like that found in Klinger) listing the different Matrix forms for various optical components. It would be nice, in addition, to have an appendix listing the definitions of variables used in the equations. Instead, I have little sticky tape all over the book so I can find my way back to important equations. There are a few blank pages at the end of the book, so perhaps I'll write my own appendix with these equations. Secondly, the book has too many typographical errors, some of which can be disastrous if you just copy the equations out of the book without looking at their derivations to check for dropped/misplaced variables. A second edition with these mistakes corrected, or at least a published erratum would be a good idea.Other than that, this is a great book. I highly recommend getting it and reading it, if polarized light is something for which you have a quantitative interest."},{"Title":"Polarized Light: Fundamentals and Applications (Optical Engineering, Vol 36)","review":"This book was a godsend when I was struggling with my advanced optical physics courses in graduate school.

Before I opened this book, I respected Bayless for being an accomplished home-grown American chef in Chicago, a leading expert and writer on authentic Mexican cooking, a respected TV chef educator on PBS in the tradition of St. Julia rather than on the commercial Food Network and, lastly, the author of a truly great \`cook with kids' book, \`Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures'. About the only thing Rick has not accomplished is to beat Bobby Flay on \`Iron Chef America', although he did loose by only one point.Just as I did when I opened Jacques Pepin's \`Fast Food My Way', I expected to find a \`sell-out' book in one way or another. My worst fear was that this was just copied from recipes in his other books. At best, I feared it was simply a cash-in on Rachael Ray's popular '30 Minute Meal' formula. I am here to report that it is none of these, but a culinary and intellectual revelation surpassed by few other true cookbooks.Bayless' success in this book is grounded in his total mastery of his subject. He knows things so well; there is no hint of any misstatement, certainly none that I can detect in the world of chemistry or technique. I will simply assume his pronouncements on authenticity are authoritative. This great facility with his material even overcomes Bayless' former clumsiness with writing. He seems to have found his voice or a better copy editor.The introduction is a total surprise to the reader when Bayless launches into a discussion of his weight problem, and how he began dealing it with yoga, weight training, and portion control. None of these reflections make Bayless a weight watchers expert, but the things he personally learned on his journey to loosing excess weight is a great lesson and inspiration for anyone with a weight problem. But what does all this have to do with fast Mexican food.The starting point is Bayless' statement that many classic Mexican dishes have a lot of \`extras' loaded on top of its basics. This is the first time I have ever heard this statement and I must say that my knowledge of Italian and French cooking indicates that the same is NOT necessarily true of these European cuisines. I do suspect that it may be true of Thai cooking, but that's just a hypothesis at the moment. So, Bayless' first step at slimming down both himself and cooking times was to remove much of the traditional frills such as moles and red chile sauces. He then gives a masterfully concise list of things to pare down recipes and speed up prep times by citing which techniques can be speeded up or simplified with things such as the rice cooker, microwave oven, food processor, and blender. In spite of this, Bayless also states that in a pinch, you can do everything in this book with a really basic set of tools. The one oddity in his recommendations is the fact that he is virtually the only major chef I have read who endorses the use of a garlic press.The \`second' introduction is a rundown of pantry items for Mexican cooking. Aside from a few brand recommendations, I suspect his earlier books cover this material in far greater detail, but it is well done for the Mexican cooking newbie.The Table of Contents is done in the very best way for a book of this size. Every recipe name and page number is given in the Contents in English. The Spanish name in smaller type is given on the page with each recipe. Almost as good is the fact that each chapter is intelligently divided into sub-subjects as follows:Chapter 1: Salads and Other Easy to Make SidesDressingsVegetable SaladsBeans and RiceChapter 2: Contemporary Main-Dish SaladsChapter 3: Classic Main Dish SoupsChapter 4: Quick Meals from the Grill: Seasonings, Salsas, and SkillsRubs and MarinadesClassic SalsasGrilling Springboards:Classic to ContemporaryChapter 5: Soft Tacos, Enchiladas, Tostadas and TortasChapter 6: Seafood, Poultry and Meat Main DishesChapter 7: Desserts (five recipes)Each recipe ends with some \`riffs' which, like fellow Chicagoan Charlie Trotter, are jazz-influenced improvisations on the original recipe. Unlike Trotter premium cookbook prices, this fine volume retails for $29.50. It would be a good buy even at the typical $35.One thing I especially respect about Bayless' book is the way he is so true to the sense of his title in that this book deals with things Mexican cooks actually do everyday when they are pressed for time, without bypassing the need for some basic cooking skills such as roasting peppers or harvesting the flesh from a fresh avocado. Part of this \`everyday' doctrine is the statement that regular weekend and holiday feasting is as much a part of sensible weight control as is everyday portion control.Thus, Bayless has essentially followed in Pepin's footsteps by giving us a collection of authentic but trimmed down recipes from a great world cuisine. And, all this is done with a recipe writing style that is better than most I have seen. The list of ingredients is done with lots of clarifying details regarding preparation, quality, and choices, such as in the selection of the best vinegar for a dish, when several may be good.Note that rather than giving a list of sources at the back of the book, Internet sources are in the leading section on Mexican pantry items.This is an excellent book. Possibly it's very best audience is those who want to start out in Mexican cooking but are intimidated by the work involved in many Mexican staples described by Senor Bayless and Senorita Diane Kennedy."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Having most of Bayless' cookbook offerings to date and used them extensively, this purchase was a non-brainer.It lives up to the high expectations that this renowned chef has for Mexican cuisine, but here with the added nicety of for everyday, health conscience eating. He goes through his dietary advice at the beginning which includes portion control, yoga, etc. What is catchy as well is his leaning in this recipe collection for what can be prepared quickly and yet with robust taste and nutritional and easy-to-find ingredients, especially via Mexican staple supplier or via internet.This Norton published volume has gorgeous full-color photos, with absolutely great pictures of various ingredients, techniques and finished dishes. Bayless also jazzes each recipe up with what he refers to as \\"riffs.\\" This are wonderful options, e.g. Grilled Fish in Tangy Yucatecan Achiote he suggests one can substitute pork or chicken and vegetable substitutions as well for the green beans. There are some great sidebars as well, e.g. five page tips for quick grilling ten great foods.This is a winner with the likes already enjoyed of: Lime-Cilantro Dressing, perfect with Jicama Salad with Watercress; Avocado-Mango Salad with Fresh or Blue Cheese, Bacon and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds; Seafood Salad Tacos with Tomato, Radish and Habanero; Seared Salmon (using Masa) with Spinach and Creamy Roasted Peppers; Skillet Fruit Crisp; Fresh Lime Ice with Berries.This can easily become a \\"go-to\\" volume within your collection also when you want some really great Mexican meals with all the flavor and minimal effort/ingredients."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I am a huge fan of Rick Bayless, but with two children aged 3 and under in my house, it is difficult for me to find the time to make some of his more elaborate recipes. With \\"Mexican Everyday\\", however, Bayless has provided the solution for cooks like me. It is indeed possible to get authentic Mexican meals on the table in under an hour.These meals are indeed fast to prepare and very tasty. The three I have made so far (Green Chile Chicken Soft Tacos, Guajillo-Spiced Pork and Potatoes, and Red Chile Chicken and Rice with Black Beans) have been hits. They do require some specialized ingredients but most of them were found in my local grocery store.This cookbook is going to become one that I return to frequently and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I like the trend in cookbooks towards simple, quick meals. How many of us have the time to take hours to prepare a meal outside of the holidays? Mexican cooking can be intimidating but Rick Bayless takes the complication out of it with this great book of simple yet delicious recipes. While the recipes are designed to be prepared in 30 minutes, I think the average home cook will be looking at 15 - 30 minutes longer, depdending on thier skill and quickness. Still, even 45 minutes isn't bad for some of these recipes. Rick has essentially dumbed down the recipes to make the preperation with more common ingredients, easily found in your pantry or grocery store. While the recipes may be scaled down and simplified, there certainly seems to be no effect on the taste. His tips for cutting prep time are not only vital to the recipes in this book, but to your home cooking in general.The book is laid out by section in the usual manner: Salads, side dishes, soups, main dishes, desserts, etc...I'm still not all that experimental so the section on Tacos, enchiladas, tostadas, was my favorite and my family and I really enjoyed the varitions on these more common dishes such as the green chile chicken tacos, as well as the grill prepared recipes as we grill a lot. The Chicken Tortilla soup with Avacado was another winner.Rick proves that Mexican need not be intimidating and time consuming. This is a book that I am happy to have in my collection!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Oh boy, Rick Bayless has done it again.I love Mexican food and consider myself very fortunate to live in a Mexican-American neighborhood. From my neighbor's tamale days to the taco trucks and multiple hole-in-the-wall restaurants, I am constantly surrounded by the aromas of that glorious cuisine. But I was intimidated by all of the effort (and heritage) that went into preparing the _real_ Mexican food that I craved.Enter Rick Bayless. His previous books gave me a bedrock where I could build my own Mexican cuisine. I've developed a reputation among family and friends as a great Mexican cook (thanks, Rick!)--and even humbly swap salsas and moles with my neighbors.The one problem: Most of the recipes in Bayless' earlier books are much too involved for everyday meals. Like most of us, I don't usually have the luxury of spending an hour or two roasting chiles and tomatillos, soaking dried chiles or pressing fresh tortillas.That's why \\"Mexican Everyday\\" hits the bulls-eye. I've prepared several of the recipes in the last two weeks and they've all been remarkably quick/easy and very tasty. They may not always be truly \\"authentic,\\" but they do have that spirit and vitality that makes Mexican food so special.And don't miss the philosophy behind the recipes. Reading the Introduction is a pre-requisite for understanding each one--and provides a very healthy perspective on eating in general.And now it's time for dinner--my fifth night in a row of homemade Mexican!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I began cooking Mexican food at home 5 years ago while living in upstate New York where authentic Mexican restaurants are scarce. While I loved the results, many of the dishes were time consuming and unrealistic for weeknight cooking. I purchased the newest Rick Bayless cookbook hoping it would introduce Mexican cuisine beyond tacos to our mid-week dining.So far, I am very pleased with the cookbook. Rick left out more time consuming recipes such as mole or chile sauces made with whole, dried chiles and in their place has recipes that rely on chile powder, tomatillos or other quick cooking ingredients. To my delight, there are several slow-cooker recipes included which are perfect for mid-week meals.So far, I have made the fire roasted salsa, slow-cooker beans, chipotle-balsamic dressing, the adobo marinade and the Yucatan rice. All were delicious and very easy. The salsa has quickly replaced store-bought as it can be made in minutes. It's even quicker if you forgo the roasting of the jalapeno and garlic, which I've done with fine results.As a bonus, the majority of the recipes are quite healthy with little added fat or cheese. I also appreciate the chapter on main dish salads.

I would give it 3 1/2 stars for user-friendlyness. The directions for many of the recipes begin by giving instructions and then saying \\"...or you can do it like this....or you can do it like this...or you can add this but it is optional\\" I think that makes for very distracting instruction, as the recipes read more like essays that encourage note-taking. For a book billed as \\"Everyday\\" I think it is a little misleading, as some people may think it's a collection of quick, make-this-tonight recipes. It is actually a collection of simpler, or simplified versions, of Mexican fare with the author's riffs on many dishes. These seem like the kind of recipes you try out (along with the author's suggestions and tips and hints, which there are a lot of, right in the directions for the recipes, where they really don't belong), and master, and ONLY THEN can you make them \\"every day.\\" Which is fine, but not really what the title encourages people to think, so buyer beware.Like I said, I cannot comment on the food. The recipes LOOKED tasty and simple enough, and they looked like real food you could feel good about feeding to friends and loved ones, so A+ for that. I did make swiss chard with onions according to his directions from the swiss chard taco recipe, and I thought it turned out great, flavorful and healthy. It's my go-to way of preparing chard now.I think there is some good food to be made from this book, I even think the author's tips and suggesttions help the reader choose the best way to prepare a dish and make it feel like their own. I just wish it was more user-friendly; the format could be better."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Full of flavor and easy to make dishes...if you cant find ingredients locally check out the riffs for substitutions and alternate preparations.

We did the \\"Grilled Red-Chile steak with sweet plantains, red onion & chipotle salsa\\". The salsa was unremarkable. The plantains & onion were worse. The rub wasn't bad, but very similar to a rub in the original \\"Webber Grill Book\\"That would not be so bad, I mean what celebrity chef doesn't bomb once in a while.However, following the great \\"Bayless technique\\" cost me a $60 All Clad saut&eacute; pan.

We've eaten good food all over Jalisco, Sinaloa, Nuevo Leon, Guanajuato, and other places. I'd like to think that for an American, I know what Mexican food should taste like.This book by Rick Bayless is perfect for us. My wife and I are trying to eat healthier and smaller portions, so many of the recipes in here are great for that purpose. We probably won't follow everything in the book to the letter, but it is a great starting point for many wonderful recipes.We recently tried the birria recipe (I think it's called roasted lamb or something in the book) and it was excellent. I haven't had birria that deliciously Mexican since the last time I was in Guadalajara. It is impossible to find anything that matches that here in Texas. We are already planning the next few recipes to cook.If you decide to check out the book, keep in mind that you should pick out a few recipes, and buy the ingredients in advance. The reason being that while the recipes are easy to prepare, you have to already have the ingredients on hand. So if you don't have something like canned roasted tomatoes or large amounts of ancho chili powder, you will need to buy a lot of them first. Just read through the introduction to the book and a few recipes that you would like to try, and buy the things that come up repeatedly in bulk.The actual cooking doesn't take that long, and while everything in the book is not 100% authentic, Rick Bayless has some great recipes and understands Mexican food better than most people. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to cook simple, authentic Mexican food."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I've learned so much from this book! The recipes aren't only delicious but also healthy and affordable. It feels like a real treat with every new meal and even the regulars! I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn how to cook mexican with everything from the herbs and spices to where to find some of the hard to find items. I read the book from front to back and really got the full lesson you wouldn't normally get just jumping from recipe to recipe like I did for a while.

After awhile, the simple Italian, French, and American-style recipes just get boring, and I was on the lookout to add flavor without adding fat or significantly more cooking time. I bought this book on a complete whim, and it's quickly given me several weeknight standards.Thus far, I've made the Lime-Cilantro Dressing, Jicama salad, Fried Beans, Chipotle Beef Tacos, Mexican Scrambled Egg Tacos, and Pork Tenderloin a la Mexicana. I have the Pork Tinga in the slow cooker right now. They've consistently been both simple and stellar. I would have bought the book for the pork tenderloin recipe alone. I wasn't the biggest fan of the jicama salad, but that had more to do with me not being a fan of jicama than the recipe. I just really appreciate the consistency of high quality that the recipes have had thus far, and my sweetheart really appreciates the food."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I never write reviews, but I need to tell the world about this cookbook!It is incredible!Every single recipe I have ever made from this book - now over 25, have all been out of this world.

Like everyone else has said, in this book Rick Bayless makes simple delicious Mexican dinners. And one of my favorite parts, many of them use the slow cooker!! This is huge for me because: 1) I'm a full-time working single mom and 2) I usually HATE slow cooker recipes, but not these. These are awesome. People ask me all the time what my favorite slow cooker book is and really, it's strange, this is it! I truly haven't found another I like. (Not that this is really a slow cooker book but in this book he uses it a lot for braises and stews.)Anyway, everything I've tried in here, which is a lot, is great. Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I love Rick's show and the books are wonderful. They give you tons of information in addition to the delightful recipes, so you're never left wondering, \\"What is this?\\" and \\"Where do I get that?\\" He answers all those questions and makes recommendations for substitutions. He knows his stuff. Fresh Mex is not only delicious but healthy in most cases. So, grab these books and add them to your collection. You'll love them."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I was disappointed with Ricks previous books because I felt that the recipes were poorly structured,and did not have enough of his dishes photographed.I'm sure most cooks would agreee ...presentation is everything! Anyway,I felt that this was a re-hash of the previous recipes he has offered, and I was diappointed that he did not offer many new and creative recipes. Overall,I'd say that if you don't have any of his previous books,and like mexican cooking...you should start with this one. Very well done,"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Every recipe I have made from this cookbook has been a big time hit in my house. It has made my addiction to mexican food worse because it has exposed me to more variety than is found in your average mexican restaurant. Rick Bayless also gives a section for each recipe suggesting riffs. I really enjoy the riffs because they have given me insight into how the foods go together and rather than mindlessly following the standard formula I can tailor the recipe to my preferences. All this, plus, the dishes are super speedy to make.Love your book, Rick! Thanks a million :-)"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"If you want an easy way to save money with delicious food, this is the book for you. The ingredients in Mexican food are so cheap, yet the flavors can be quite complex. This Chicago institution describes each ingredient and where you can get some of the more exotic ones. All of the dishes take advantage of some of the savory flavors possible with Mexican sauces and spices."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Well written, pretty good photos, delicious staple recipes. If you only need one or two Mexican recipe books, something by Rick Bayless is a must, and this book will give you all the basics to get you going and give you rock solid authentic Mexican dishes to serve, all you have to add is love.Another great book is \\"Truly Mexican\\" by Roberto Santibanez. This is also an excellent book, giving you everything you need to know to make great Mexican food, well written, beautifully photographed, perhaps even a tiny bit better than Rick's book. But that's just my opinion, yours many be different."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I really enjoy the way Rick presents cooking and his recipes. Much can be learned about an author's philosophy of cooking and eating by reading the introduction. This is one of the best I've read. I am less interested in what people may consider authentic than I am in recipes that are usable and provide results that I like and I can serve guests. That is the case with Mexican Everyday. At first I was put off by the lack of some of the old standby recipes then I read the introduction about everyday eating as compared to feasting. This book is about food that most anyone can prepare for a weeknight meal. The ingredients are easy to find and he lists alternatives to speed things up. He also knows the value of a slow cooker, something that most cookbook authors seem to miss. His recipe and instructions for slow cooker beans has become my standard. They're superb! He has a nice section on basic supplies for your pantry which really helps when you've got to put a dinner on the table in under an hour. The Pineapple Skillet Upside-Down cake that was a real life-saver recently when we had unexpected dinner guests. It was fast, easy, simple and delicious. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to use cookbook that does not include a lot of exotic recipes with complex ingredients."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"James Beard Award-winner Bayless approaches everyday cooking with two goals - easy preparation and nutritional balance, with an emphasis on one-dish meals. He omits complex traditional moles except for a simpler Oaxacan yellow made with masa harina and tomatoes and he frontloads the book with salads and sides, like Green Bean Salad with Red Onion and a salsa dressing or a Sweet Potato Salad with Caramelized Onions and a red chile vinaigrette.He follows this with main dish salads and soups in which avocado, lime and tomato make frequent appearances along with smaller amounts of chicken, beef or sausage. And chilies, of course.Several classic salsas - tomato, tomatillo, chipotle - preface quick meals from the grill, which include Grilled Fish in Tangy Yucatecan Achiote with Green Beans and Roasted Tomato Salsa, or Grilled Pork Adobo with Smoky Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Guajillo Salsa.Of course there's a tortilla-based chapter (Tomatillo-Sauced Enchiladas with Spinach and Mushrooms, Seafood Salad Tacos with Tomato, Radish and Habanero) and a few desserts (Skillet Fruit Crisp).Meat, Seafood and Poultry are grouped together and more often than not the dishes include vegetables and rice, potato or beans, continuing the one-dish theme. Tomatillo Pork Braise with Pickled Chiles, or Red Chile Chicken and Rice with Black Beans, or Jalapeno-Baked Fish with Roasted Tomatoes and Potatoes require little, if any, accompaniment.\\"Riffs\\" at the end of each recipe provide preparation tips, variations and suggested embellishments, along the line of Mark Bittman's \\"when you have more time\\" feature. Luscious color photos include ingredients, techniques and finished dishes.The recipes are bursting with bold flavor and while many home cooks won't make the \\"30 minutes\\" goal, the elimination of extra side dishes saves a lot of time and organizing.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Mexican food with a Gringo approach.Written by Chicago based Rick Bayless, of the PBS series 'Mexico One Plate at a time,' this is a series of Mexican dishes designed to be easy to make with ingredients that are not impossible to get. In fact he has even been known to get things like salsa and (shudder) even beans out of a can. These are things that greatly reduce the amount of effort that goes into preparing Mexican food that looks and tastes good.One key to cooking on a regular basis is that we all work. We are all busy. Once in a while we like to spend an afternoon in the kitchen playing with food, but on Monday it's a differrent matter. Mr. Bayless has designed a series of dishes that fit well into cooking when you get home on Monday. There's not a lot of chopping, there are simplified sauces that do not have to simmered for hours.This is a book that has the potential of changing how you think about cooking Mexican food."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I really like Rick Bayless on TV. Though I cook everyday and enjoy cooking his recipes seem a little time consuming. So, when I saw he came out with a \\"Mexican Everyday\\" cookbook I thought he had a book of simply or simplified recipes. I haven't found it to be true. Quite a few recipes require a day ahead planning unless you want to be in the kitchen all day long. The couple recipes I've made are very good, but I think the title of the book is misleading. You can't just open this up and cook dinner. You need to open it up and plan ahead."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"My wife and I love this book for its simplicity in preparing complex flavors. We have one other Bayless cookbook and loved the recipes in it, but wanted recies that weren't quite as time intensive. This is the perfect balance.And it inspired us to try Frontera Grill over New Years, and it was all we'd hoped."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"After taking a week vacation at a cooking school in Mexico's southern interior, I became a devotee of authentic Mexican food. And because I live in Iowa, I have to make it all myself! This book provides dozens of magnificent, simple recipes that I can whip up with mostly pantry ingredients, often without the use of a blender or more than one or two pans.I've made at least ten recipes so far and enjoyed every one. The roasted tomatillo salsa is now in the regular condiment rotation in our house. Chicken a la Veracruzana goes on the meal plan regularly. And the Grilled Roadside Chicken with Knob Onions was a huge hit at a dinner party this weekend.Buy this book. Cook a few recipes, try a few \\"riffs,\\" and read the intro about Bayless' conversion to a healthier, simpler diet and lifestyle. I promise it won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but this book truely deserves my high praises. Everything I cook out of this book turns into a keeper recipe that my family & I absolutely love. I'm a bit of a cookbook hoard with books from Kellar & Flay being some of my favorites. But this single book has become my go-to about 5 days a week for a good meal. Its amazing food that you can make quick. In the real world, people dont have 3 hours at night to make a high-class dinner. You can make meals out of this book without sacrificing any flavor. Thank you, Rick!!!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"This book works perfectly in my household: I do 95% of the cooking, and most of these recipes are simple enough for me to prepare on a weeknight (which is the point of this book). The recipes are simple enough for an experienced cook to throw together without putting forth too much effort. My wife doesn't do much cooking, so for her these recipes are more for a weekend project, but she has been able to follow a couple of the recipes to make a nice Sunday evening dinner.Not all of the recipes we've tried were great, but we love the recipes for the Chipotle Chicken Salad Tacos and the bean-chorizo mixture that goes on the tortas. My wife finds the way the directions are written to be very frustrating, but I haven't been bothered by that. Some of the ingredients can be tricky to find if you don't live near a good, well-stocked Mexican grocer, but the recipes have enough suggested adaptations that it wouldn't be hard to assemble most of the dishes with items commonly available at non-ethnic grocery stores.This book's strong point is that it shows how Mexican food on weeknights can go well beyond seasoned ground beef tacos. Experienced cooks will be able to use this collection for delicious low-effort meals, and less experienced cooks will be able to put together some weekend meals that won't take all day."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I have purchased many cook books in my time and most of them have ended up collecting dust on my book shelf. Not this one. This is a book that I actually use. The recipes are simple, and straightforward.

It was one of my first cookbooks and is still one of my favorites, though the pages are so worn from use that the binding is totally falling apart! One of my favorite parts of this book is the section with \\"Riffs\\" on the original recipe. This allows for a ton of variety as well as allowing for compensation of hard to find ingredients, although most ingredients are available at most chain grocery stores. The other things the Riffs will do is expose you to the variety of different regional flavor variations and teach you how groups of flavors combine together. Before this book I didn't know about regional cuisines in Mexico. Now when people ask me to cook them some Mexican I ask them from what part of Mexico!I really couldn't recommend this book more highly, it is an absolute must buy for any beginning student of Mexican cooking."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I bought this mainly to get an idea on how to make authentic Mexican sauces & salsas and I was not disappointed. Wonderful great tasting recipes. My favorite Mexican cookbook."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"There are so many great things to say about this book.First of all, this recipe is not a step-by-step manual for preparing Mexican food as it is a blueprint to Mexican cuisine. Thus, it helps you understand how to cook good Mexican food without adhering to a script. It features a great introductory chapter on the different ingredients, where to obtain the unique ingredients, etc. In addition, each recipe includes a good explanation on potential \\"riffs\\" of the recipe and how they might alter the taste. For example, Rick tells you how a different type of chile can be substituted and how it will affect the overall taste.There is great variety here too: salads, soups, stews, meat entrees, taco-like creations, desserts, salsas, etc.Finally, what really makes this book great is how good this stuff tastes. Every single time I've cooked something in this book, my family or dinner guest as been impressed with the outcome. The dishes do not require a huge time investment, but they are so delicious.Honestly, this book has provided me with some of the very best Mexican meals I've ever eaten. Even I've been amazed that I was able to prepare a Mexican meal so delectable with such ease."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"this is a great cook book on 2 levels, one the recipes are easy to follow even for me ( a not so good cook) and two, its also a good \\"read\\". the recipes are well decribed and include variations."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Amazing cookbook.

I highly recommend Mexican Everyday."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"One of the best Mexican cookbooks for Americans. Easy to read, easy to use, it is filled with beginner-friendly words of encouragement for us beginners. Rigorous attention to the need for fresh organic vegetables and herbs, but not pedantic. Lots of substitutions allowed - cilantro in place of epazote, for example. My daughter-in-law took Mr. Bayless' class in Merida, and says he is as good a teacher in person as he appears to be in the book."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"The recipes in this book are so easy and so delicious. Every recipe I've tried so far has been outstanding. My favorite is the tortilla soup b/c it's so easy, and it tastes as good or better than any soup I've had at a restaurant. I have really enjoyed experimenting with different types of peppers and spices. However, Bayless gives plenty of alternative suggestions if you aren't able to find the ingredients called for in the recipes. I have been buying copies of this book for family and friends. It's fun and exciting to have interesting, flavorful food on any night of the week."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"As with his other books, this one is no disappointment. Although many of his books have duplicate recipes, each one has something to offer. This one simplifies the recipe where it can be done but keeps the food true to its roots. One of my biggest complaints about \\"quick and easy\\" cookbooks is that the recipes usually lack flavor or predominately use prepackaged ingredients. If that is what I wanted, then I would go out to eat at a your typical or chain restaurant.So far I have made several of the salsas, salads and main dishes. All of which were excellent. The slow-cooker Conchinita Pibil is excellent. Some people may ask how a six hour process is \\"Mexican Everyday\\". With a slow cooker, you invest a few minutes in the beginning and the rest of the time the food is doing its own thing. Everyone needs to slow down and enjoy the process of cooking their own food.On a final note, this book stands out from his others for a couple of reasons. The layout, typeface and overall design is phenomenal. Photographs are used very effectively as well. Lastly..... and I know this may sound weird.....but the paper that this book is printed on is very unique. It is heavy and smooth and just has that special feel to it. Pick up a copy and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Mexican Everyday is a cookbook that lives up to its name! Rick Bayless is an absolute master of Mexican cooking, and brings together many classic Mexican tastes into this collection of easy-to-prepare dishes. Even with my busy work schedule, I'm able to have most of these recipes on the table for dinner on weeknights. A few recipes do require a little extra planning, but they're all explained incredibly well (with pictures explaining ingredients that may not be familiar), making this cookbook friendly to cooks with limited experience. This book also offers variations for most recipes, for those wanting a new challenge.Even if you don't make every recipe, this book is worth it for two favorites: Chicken Tortilla Soup and the classic Mexican Rice recipe. The tortilla soup is a hit with everyone I make it for -- from all areas of the country and with all different levels of tolerance for spicy foods. Bayless seems to put a rice recipe or two in each of his cookbooks; the one in Mexican Everyday is a staple around our house.If you're looking for cheesy burritos, hard-shell ground beef tacos and other staples of what many Americans view as \\"Mexican\\" (most of which, I contend, is actually \\"tex-mex\\"), Mexican Everyday is not for you. These recipes are classic Mexican cuisine. But, I'm sure that you (like I have!) will grow to love these even more!This book goes along with recipes from a previous season of Bayless' cooking show on PBS (Mexico One Plate at a Time), though you don't need to be familiar with the show to enjoy the cookbook."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I mustve not read this but i cant do a cook book with no pictures lol.

Good luck everyone!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"My daughter purchase the book and we had several meals at her home. After that we bought it and we have not had one meal that we did not like.I have now two books of Rick Bayless."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I have tried 3 recipes so far. 2 were great, 1 was fine. The \\"Tomato-and -Jalapeno-sauced enchiladas\\" were so good I have made them 4+ times in the last month. Love this recipe. I have tried the \\"riff\\" of adding goat cheese and another time feta. I think adding feta is nice. I use homemade flour tortillas- so good and easy. Another thing to make the recipe faster is I buy roasted chicken from the grocery store which makes it very quick to make. It works well as left-overs as well. The Tomatillo-sauced enchiladas with spinach and mushroom were also very good. The Seared Salmon with Spinach and creamy roasted peppers was fine, but not as superb as the other 2 recipes I have tried. It was not bad, but I probably won't make it again.Overall, great recipe book. I am excited to make more of the recipes. They truly are fast and delicious."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"My girlfriend and I were won over by Rick's passion for delicious food south of the border in his show- Mexico One Plate at a Time so it was only natural that we would want to replicate some of the dishes we'd seen on TV in our very own kitchen. I was nervous and using a variety of ingredients and produce I'd never used before- Ancho-Chili Powder, Tomatillos, Serrano chili peppers, etc. It's safe to say I was not in my \\"comfort zone\\" but Rick's expertise and complete mastery of the subject helped me through. Don't know whether or not the avocado you have is ripe? Don't know how to roast a pepper? Don't know how to make a flank steak tender? Don't know even the basics of Mexican Cooking? Then this book is for you! Rick constantly reassures the cook by anticipating the questions I had and answering a few I didn't ask but probably should have!The main thing I like about this cookbook is that the recipes are simple but the taste isn't. Several times I had to do a double take because I was sure that the recipe couldn't possibly be that easy, but it was. While cooking a Bayless recipe you will find yourself spending a lot of time in the produce aisle- this is the foundation for what makes Rick's recipe's so delicious and easy and also what makes the recipes healthier than dishes you'd find in other cookbooks! It's just a great tool if you are a die-hard fan of cuisine of Mexico."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I have used this cookbook extensively for the past 16 months and have made almost every single dish at least once and several other favorites multiple times now. I am still in aw of this book for it's coverage of Mexican culinary tastes, techniques, and cultural influences. I have not been bored a single minute using this book. Somehow or another, the book makes cooking informative, fun, and satisfying to a much greater degree than any other book I have used.For those of you hesitant to take Mexican cooking cues from an aparent American cook, you could not be more wrong. I would bet that Rick Bayless has a greater grasp of Mexican cuisine than any other cook in America. One need only sample his dishes from the bright Yucatan (like his Cochinita Pibil)or the earthy Northern region of Mexico (his Birria or Pollo Asado- estilo Sinaloa)to understand Bayless' total mastery of Mexican food.It is not enough for me to say that this book is good and that the dishes are good, Rick Bayless understands precisely what it is each dish should taste like. In other words, he remains true to the cuisine but offers superb techniques to overcome the challenges that the Mexican cuisine presents. He understands that the more complicated dishes are nearly impossible, save for a few times a year. Bayless solves these problems without sacrificing a thing, thereby unlocking the potential of cooks at home everywhere. As a Mexican and lover of true Mexican cuisine, Bayless has made any faovrite dish possible and has taken my cooking at home to new heights.This book has been fun and rewarding to say the least. Buy this book if you love to cook and would like to find out what Bayless knows, that Mexican cuisine is on par with any cuisine in the world.- PS. Invest in a good slow cooker, this book will make excellent use of it. Dishes that traditiaonally take 24 hours in preperation and cooking time- like Birria, Barbacoa, and Cochinta Pibil are acheived in the kitchen. The results will blow your mind and your friends and family who can appreciate the difficulty and time it takes to make suche dishes, will be astonished."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I bought both Authentic Mexican and Mexican Everyday together - both books are excellent at capturing the authentic flavor of Mexican food that you just won't find at all those 'Mexican' restaurants that serve the ground beef burrito combos [Yuck!]. Mexican Everyday, however, offers simplified recipes. Simplified does not mean less authentic or watered down versions; the dishes are full of flavor and maintain the spirit of true Mexican cooking, they are just easier to prepare thanks to Mr. Bayless' shortcuts and techniques. He microwave-steams veggies, he offers tips and riffs that help you along in ensuring your final dish is as delicious as the wonderful pictures in the book look. He also focuses more on healthier versions of dishes - baking versus frying, steaming versus boiling, and so on. As with any authentic ethnic food, there are some ingredients that may be a bit difficult to find, but he offers alternatives to those hard-to-find products to make sure you can still make the dish and have a great-tasting final result. Mexican Everyday is my go to book when I want something fast, easy, and delicious. I've made several of his dishes out of this book, and I always get complimented on them. I highly recommend this book for people who don't have a lot of time to spare, but want a true home-made and delicous meal."},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I bought this book about a year ago and had used it occasionally, noting like many others that there are several ingredients that I just couldn't find at my local grocery store and not wanting to make a special trip to find them. Well, this summer I have been trying to eat healthier and have been cooking much more, and after making the grilled roadside chicken which uses ancho chile powder (that was at my local grocery but rather expensive) and finding it to be DELICIOUS, I decided to just go online and purchase ingredients. I found that [...] had everything I was looking for, and since the bulk of the shipping cost comes from your first item, I recommend doing as I did-going through the book to find everything you might want to make and order all at once. For example, he uses ancho chile powder in large amounts for several recipes, so I went ahead and bought a pound, plus some dried chiles (guajillo and negro), achiote paste, avocado leaves and chipotle chile powder. I actually found the prices to be very reasonable aside from shipping cost, but like I said, that's why you'll want to buy as much as you can all at once. Then, once you have this stuff on hand, you are suddenly able to make all kinds of stuff, and I don't think I've ever used a cookbook this much, as I probably make at least a couple of his recipes every week-there are so many yummy and easy recipes, and my husband and I have both LOVED everything we've tried so far- the grilled roadside chicken, the roasted poblano and potato salad (I added broiled salmon), the lamb jalisco (except I used a chuck roast), used the Yucantan marinade on grilled chicken, chicken enchiladas, and even the skillet upside down cake with peaches. What I love most is that there are very few recipes that you will even see on a menu in a Mexican restaurant, but they are easy, healthy, different and delicious! So, BUY the book, order what you need to online, and then get cooking!!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"I was given this book by a friend recently and it is divine. The flavors are unlike any I have ever tried combining before, and they are so refreshing and fresh tasting. A new family favorite is the Chipotle chicken with romaine lettuce and the carmelized onion and steak and oh, there are so many to like. Quick to prepare, healthy, enjoyable food. I have not had any trouble finding the ingredients at the market and in many cases he gives several substitutions or variations on the recipe. I have truly enjoyed this book and it has given me a new outlook on Mexican food. It doesnt have to be all cheese smothered and sourcream covered!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Most of the recipes I've tried so far taste wonderful, are simple to make and dead-on that Mexican flare. (I live in a predominately Mexican area so most of the ingredients listed in this book are very easy to find.) I think some people purchase this book intending to make tacos or burritos or that \\"normal\\" Mexican food. But this is true Mexican cuisine from all different parts of Mexico, each region has it's own taste and preferences and I feel this book reflects that. I married into a very large Mexican family and have had trouble imitating my in-laws amazing cooking. What I love about this book is that along with each recipe is cooking techniques, alternative flavorings and alternate methods of preparing the dish so you learn quite a bit as you go along. My husband is happy, so I know I'm doing good, ain't nobody alive can cook like his mama!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"Some people take exception to the fact that in the book, Bayless discusses weight and health and thought it had nothing to do with the book. I disagree. I found the book very inspiring. I agree with him that in order to reach and maintain a healthy weight, one must eat wonderful food, taking time and care to prepare it and enjoying it with people you love. His idea that for most of the week, you should eat around the edge of the store, that is, vegetables and lean meats with no processed foods, and that one must feed one's soul and enjoy a feast once in a while makes sense to me. The recipes in this book have helped me to do that and I am healthier and happier because of it. I truly believe that if people shifted their goal from weight loss to healthy, flavorful, satisfying eating, that more people would lose weight and keep it off, as well as enjoy food and life more. Thanks, Rick for helping me do that. P.S. there's some really tasty recipes in the book!"},{"Title":"Mexican Everyday (Recipes Featured on Season 4 of the PBS-TV series \\"Mexico One Plate at a Time\\")","review":"My husband and I have tried quite a few of the recipes in this book.

I had no idea who he was but was attracted by the cover and the title and, if I'm honest, Eric Hobsbawm's preface. This is the best-written and most educative history of our country and its wars that I've ever read. I finished school over a year ago and have been travelling the world. This amazing history taught me more than I'd ever learnt at NYU. This book should be on every history reading list. I'm not saying that I expect everyone to agree with its arguments, but simply in the interests of diversity and freedom of thought. I was educated on Professor Niall Ferguson's work (he, too, like Kiernan is a Scot!), but THE NEW IMPERIALISM was a wonderful antidote."},{"Title":"The Fall of 67...","review":"This is some of the best poetry I've ever read!His verse is outstanding.

God chose me as an instrument\\" \\"Other people need to read this\\". \\"I don't want to check the sales\\" (you're ranked #2,607,620 as I write this, Chief). The article went on and on, throwing similar statements around like confetti. The book explores the pain of lost love, and I would predict the last poem is about when the girl realizes she's dating an artsy, self-adsorbed blowhard. But I'll give him 5 stars anyway, just for the self-confidence, and a sincere wish for good luck...."},{"Title":"Electronic Signals and Systems","review":"I like to tinker with electronics and this book helped me learn alot about TV signals.

The language is wonderful. I highly recommend this version for personal gratification. Would that it could be used in the Episcopal Church. Cambridge is, in my opinion, the best Bible publisher around and their workmanship makes this a gem as well. Thankfully the ECUSA has loosened its grip and allowed the use of the 1928 prayerbook for special occasions. I suppose thats the most we can hope for."},{"Title":"Book of Common Prayer, Standard Edition Prayer Book, Black Calfskin Leather","review":"There is confusion about this book. It is not large print, but it is a calfskin leather in a beautiful hardback box. The poetry of old England is quite refreshing. I like to read it aloud so I can &quot;hear&quot; the words. Amazon has not characterized this as a non-American Book of Common Prayer. It is the BCP of the Church of England. I recommend it 5 stars. Also check out The Divine Conspracy. It is non-denominational so far as I have read, and puts this world and the world that Jesus lived into one. I'll likely give it a 5 star rating also from what I've read so far."},{"Title":"Book of Common Prayer, Standard Edition Prayer Book, Black Calfskin Leather","review":"This is a great edition of the current UK BCP 1662. Some reviews misunderstand the 1662 part and think it is a reprint of the first edition. That is not the case. The 1662 book is still in current use and the prayers for the royal family are updated to stay current. There are other changes such as the lectionary for daily prayer dates from the 1800s, with an early 1900s optional lectionary. Some royal services were also dropped.The current Everyman edition has some of the things removed from the book in the 1800s. However even that edition is not a reprint of the 1662 first edition.This classic prayerbook is wonderfully printed. I recommend it. If you want the details of the differences from 1662 to the present, do a web search there are detailed listings of the changes on the web.This is the printed version to use.

I remember a friend of mine giving a book report on this book and saying Garrison really had nothing new to add and supporting the Warren Commission's viewpoint. I thought, \\"did you even read the book or just read what someone else said about it?\\"Garrison introduced lots of material that had not been covered anywhere else at the time and gave reasonable explanations for who really killed Kennedy and why.As another reviewer said, as valid today as when it was written.

With its cleverly ingenious humor that somehow mixes so well with its occasionally gruesome violence, this is a novel that made me wish I had written myself! I bought and read this book 12 years ago, and have recently unearthed it from a box that had been stored in my garage since I moved into my new home three years ago. This brought back some great memories, and I'd like to share them with you.Narrated in first-person by Paul Sheldon, a famous writer of cheesy romance novels (starring a heroine named Misery Chastain) who crashes his car in the middle of the snowiest winter in the middle of Colorado and is rescued by local nurse Annie Wilkes, who happens to be, as she immediately lets him know as soon as he comes to, his &quot;Number One Fan.&quot; She also happens to be, as he soon finds out, obsessed and dangerously crazy. Her care of him soon becomes a prison, one from which he knows he must escape, someway and somehow. It will prove to be difficult, as he is bedridden with two badly broken legs. When crazy Annie reads Paul's latest installment of the Misery series and finds out, to her horror, that he killed off her beloved heroine, all hell breaks loose. When she finds out that he did this to finally exit the romance-novel arena, and was working on a more street-savvy book starring a troubled teenage boy, she makes him start on a book entitled &quot;Misery's Return.&quot; As distasteful as this is to him, he is not in a position to argue his way out of it, knowing that Annie holds all the cards and has him completely at her mercy. After all, it's hard to argue with a big, strong woman who carries an axe, and who, by the way, saved your life.MISERY is a taut thriller that understands its two main characters, the introverted and reserved Paul Sheldon and yes, even Annie Wilkes in all her irrationality. King loves her even as he simultaneously (and hilariously) makes fun of her quirky speech, which he dubs &quot;the Annie Wilkes Lexicon.&quot; MISERY is a real page-turner (I read the entire 250-page book in one day) that is full of suspense and dark humor. I love it in all its ooginess, and if you haven't read it yet, then you'd just better do it now, you dirty bird!MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 17 &amp; UP"},{"Title":"Misery (Spanish Edition)","review":"This wasn't just a book for me, Misery was a moment. It was April 2000. I closed this book and said, \\"Yes, that's how you do it.\\" Stephen King is the master at tinkering with his craft. He is not satisfied with putting out the same type of stories over an over.Misery is his best example of that. It's not a point A to point Z novel.

This, after putting out a series of books about the life of a woman named Misery Chastain who lived during the late 1800s. In the (planned) final installment, he kills off the character. Unfortunately, while driving under the influence in hazardous road conditions, he is injured in a car accident near a small Colorado town. Adding insult to injury, his rescuer happens to be his \\"biggest fan,\\" a forty-four-year-old mentally unstable former defrocked nurse named Annie Wilkes. Instead of calling an ambulance, or driving him to the hospital, she takes him to her house, splints his injured legs, feeds him intravenously, provides pain meds and waits for him to come to. Over a series of months, her behavior towards him alternates between almost rational and completely insane, Nurse Wilkes' goal being to force the author to bring Misery back to life. Fans of Stephen King's earlier works will not be disappointed with this gruesome story of suspense. As for me, it was just so-so. Better: The Dead Zone by Stephen King (my favorite), Firestarter by Stephen King, and Salem's Lot by Stephen King."},{"Title":"Misery (Spanish Edition)","review":"I read this book and I liked it. It inspired me to read more of Stephen King\`s books.The scene that stood out for me the most was whenAnnie hobbled Paul. It was so attentive to detail that it felt like I was looking at a picture inside of the book.This scene showed just how deep Annie\`s paranoia went. Paul hadn\`t done half the things she was accusing him of and his legs were healing, but what she did to him pushed him back to the beginning of his torture.You should read this book because it is so good that once you pick it up you can\`t put it down.~submitted by my student Jake"},{"Title":"Misery (Spanish Edition)","review":"I am only 14 years old and my freind got me very interested in this book even though i have never seen the movie.

Most of the work covers either the early defense of Kentucky by Confederate forces in the winter/spring of '61/62 and the combined invasion of Bragg and Kirby-Smith during fall 1862. The final essay by the editor on the Confederate orphan brigade was moving mostly due to the enormous loses suffered by these Kentucky troops. James Ramage's essay on John Hunt Morgan's raid was disappointing, while Wiley Sword's work on Patrick Cleburne who was not a Kentuckian hardly seemed relevant to the other works. If would have been nice to have seen works on guerrilla warfare, the home-front, slavery in Kentucky, Appalachian Kentucky during the war, or a number of other small raids, but mostly this is a solid work."},{"Title":"The Civil War in Kentucky","review":"This is where brother literally did battle against brother.

As a 16-year-old, I am still young enough to remember a little bit of what it was like to be 10, and this book does an absolutely outstanding job of communicating that. With his other works (esp.

While the antics of the characters do occasionally stir a childhood memory or two, I was not drawn particularly to any of them. There are some poignant moments in the last third of the novel which really saved the book from being a disappointment. I wasn't overwhelmed by Angela's Ashes, either, so maybe I am missing something culturally.

I felt that, although this book is well written, it is over-appreciated, if you will.The book lacks storyline, and, although it is written exactly for that, it does get tedious towards the hundred and fiftieth page where there is still no plot.On the other hand, the book is incredibly nostalgic. It really is fantastic to read and then suddenly remeber similar childhood antics.Also, the book is driven by the emotions felt by Paddy as his world changes, which is marvellous to find as this is the only factor that kept me reading all the way through."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This book is an easy read. No complicated words, no scientific/historical facts that will make you go looking for an encyclopedia to check up on just to get it. Why? Because it was written from the view of a child.It is not childish in anyway, yet the ideas are presented are simple, yet not easy; i.e. themes of handling crises in the home. How a boy handles his life. It was superbly written, and I got so lost in it I forgot it was not written by a child but by Doyle.Take a peak into the book and you will see what I mean.

The plot is clearly building up a believable, often amusing, and constantly entertaining image of childhood, which can then be shattered due to the family rift that occurs towards the end. A semi-autobiography, this book touches on the element of childhood that so many people have forgotten. A clear, beautfiul, amusing, and moving portrait of Irish childhood. Being Irish myself, I find no difficulties comprehending the language, and am dismayed that others presume the Irish author should change his vocabulary for the benefit of his American readers. The Irish words will be at least obvious to any intelligent reader.

I really enjoyed this book because i was able to make strong connections between my childhood characteristics and Paddy's. It was very interesting to see Paddy's relationships with different people in his life and how he dealt with the hradships that were thrown at him. Paddy also evolved alot as a person throughout this book. He learned alot about himself through his relations with others and become a more conscious young man, a very old 10 yr old.

I do believe that in order to really enjoy this reading you must have a very imaginative and playfull mind."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle tells the story of a young boy named Paddy Clarke who experiences the advantages and disadvantages of childhood. Throughout the book, the things that Paddy did not think too much of, such as his mother and father arguing, or paying attention in class, becomes more important to him, as the things that Paddy seemed to think were very important soon started to fade, one example being his concern of Kevin's opinion of everything.

Paddy in the biginning wants to be a hero like his dad, or individuals he has heard about, but then he finds out heros are not all that they are cracked up to be.

Doyle reminds you of the kid's-eye view of life, less naive and ignorant than we generally mis-remember. The mixture of cruelty and enjoyment is realistic, not exaggerated like, say, Lord of the Flies. The view of teachers and parents is forgiving, as all children are wont to do. But then the shock when you realize you are a parent now, and G-d forbid that Paddy Clarke's descriptions should sound familiar.I doubt that I have any control over Amazon's combination-purchase recommendations, but if I did, I'd say \\"better bought with A Death in the Family by James Agee\\"."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This was an excellent book. I believe that it is one of the few that I have actually enjoyed reading front to back in an English class. Although the different stories were quite random, I enjoyed that aspect of the book the most of all because staying with one topic for too long can become rather dull. Roddy Doyle shares the thoughts of a 10 year old with the reader and there were many times in the story when I could definately relate with Paddy when I was 10. The ending is superb because you can really see how Paddy grows and changes with the book. The only thing that didn't seem realistic to me was the fact that Paddy had no friends in the end. His friends made fun of him, and although 10 year olds make fun of other kids all the time, they get over it fast, whereas in Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha, Doyle makes it seem like his friends will hate him forever. All in all, I recommend this work of art to high school students and above."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"By far Roddy Doyle's greatest novel to date, this brilliantly written, subtly plotted recreation fo childhood well deserved the Booker Prize. It remains the most truly insightfull book I have ever read. Previous reveiws have bemoaned the apparent lack of plot. This seems to suggest that they simply didn't read it all. There is a very strong plot going right through the novel, only it doesn'y take center stage, simply because the narrator - a 10 year old boy - fails to understand what is really happening around him until the very close of the novel, when his innocence is brought to an abrupt end... To say you should read this book is an understatement - you simply must read this book. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"If there was ever any doubt about Roddy Doyle's lyrical talent, those doubts are washed by Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha. The narrative -- the world as Paddy Clarke, a 10 year old Irish lad sees it -- is funny and thought-provoking. It's sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and other times emotional challenging, which is no easy feat.The problem with the book is that the story really goes nowhere. It's not a story at all but, rather, a bunch of recollections of a boy's pre-adolescence. It's something like a (non-linear) memoir, albeit of a fictional person. The only thread that seems to tie all Paddy's little memories together is the disintegration of his parents' marriage. Nothing seems to change for Paddy. He just keeps on doing what 10 year old boys (the more rambunctious variety) do. But, through him we see his parents drifting apart, which is the only hint in the book that time is moving forward. Admittedly some readers will find this charming rather than problematic. Others, like me, may find this makes it hard to stay interested."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The novel is moving. Doyle's use of voice is brilliant.But I thought I would lose all vestiges of sanity because of the unending simple and compound sentences that follow one upon the other like ants at a picnic.Yes, I understand that this use of sentence construcion results in the authentic voice of Paddy, but as wonderful as the book may be, I don't think I could survive another reading experience like this. Beautiful and tedious, beautiful and tedious...."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"At one point in this rambling yet enveloping running narrative of seemingly isolated sequences from a ten-year-old Irish boy's life, we join Paddy Clarke as he recalls even younger days, sitting under a kitchen table for the pure joy of his closed-in surroundings.\\"I saw things. Balls of fluff, held together and made round by hair, floated on the lino [linoleum]...The lino was nice on my face. The air wasn't alive like outside, beyond the table; it was safe. It had a smell I liked. My da's socks had diamonds on them. I woke up once and there was a blanket on top of me. I wanted to stay there forever.\\"Paddy doesn't. He gets taller instead, too big to fit under a table. By the end of the short remembrance, he's dismissing the whole thing as \\"stupid\\".The whole of Roddy Doyle's \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\" is like that, the protagonist experiencing the joy of small moments later left thoughtlessly behind. It's a world all of us go through but few remember, let alone capture, as well as Doyle does here. Doyle's short, chapterless sections antically hop from anxieties at home to the overbearing discipline of a hated teacher to games played by Paddy and friends in their rapidly developing Barrytown neighborhood. I enjoyed how the author cosmically sends up Paddy's childish concerns without ever intruding the slightest hint of an adult sensibility.If only it had a plot.Real life is plotless, of course, and that extends to childhood. Things happen, lives change, people adjust, and those of us left move on. Most novels however, nearly all but this one in my experience, present some plot focus, giving a reader something to grasp onto. Doyle challenges us this way, taking more than half the book before any such focus reveals itself, and when it does (trouble between Paddy's folks), it takes place almost completely out of Paddy's ken. He only senses something's wrong, and sleeplessly imagines himself responsible.Paddy starts out a pretty unlikeable character, Doyle here as elsewhere choosing reality over sentimentality. We open with him picking on his younger brother, Sinbad, a recurring motif in the book. Following the unprincipled example of his friend and neighbor Kevin, he steals, burns things, and bullies younger kids with no remorse or reason. One can see this changing over time as his parents' troubles and a more serious approach to his studies draw out a sensitivity in him, but he's rebellious throughout.Doyle was known more for comic writing when he published this in 1994, and there are a lot of bits of recognition humor here, as when Paddy digests reports of U.S. soldiers fighting \\"gorillas\\" in Vietnam. Set in 1968, you have to negotiate timely pop culture references to things like the Monkees, the Man From U.N.C.L.E., Irish commercial jingles, and British soccer stars.But nostalgia and funny business take a back seat to the emotional toll of Paddy's domestic traumas. Here I think the book didn't do enough. The parents are presented as decent people for the most part, though we get hints of something troubling about the father. He's a bit of a drinker and a bit of a hitter, though it's never clear what is happening. Of course this is how it happens for many ten-year-olds. But the overall rambling quality of Doyle's narrative rambles too much; by the end he presents a neat, tough conclusion that feels more abrupt than anything else.Read \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\" to rediscover a world you may have forgotten, through the eyes of a distinctive character who can't quite notice as you do the way it dissolves around him."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This fantastic book well deserved to earn a Booker Prize. Doyle plumbs the mind of a small boy to a marvelous extent. We are transported into a boyishness of mind. Our protagonist's concerns become our own: his hopes, his fears, his moral dilemmas--all ring astonishingly true. And yet, this is no demeaning view of the small boy's mind. Though he is small he is working through the great difficulties of this world. The prose is delightful, gripping, and page-turning. The book sails along at the hands of a remarkably skilled author. Having just finished [Huck Finn], I am comfortably holding this book alongside that immortal classic. Though Paddy Clarke Ha Ha ha does not enter the greater terrain of his day (while Huck Finn is immersed in slavery), the book does deliver the mind of a child in a way that few books ever written have done. Indeed, we might fairly ask: has any book, ever written, so thoroughly and effectively transported the adult reader to the consciousness of a child? At the very least, that question can be asked. This book is a complete triumph."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"My second Roddy Doyle book and it was no less impressive than the first. Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Ireland. His experiences range from boyhood friendships to the classroom to his parent's increasing fights. Doyle is immensely talented and consistently manages to embrace his characters and represent them in a nearly too real fashion. Paddy Clarke not only feels like it's a story of a 10-year-old boy but is specifically narrated by a 10-year-old boy and by the end of the book one has to wonder \\"Doyle, who's he?\\" Doyle's narrative is addicting and moving and I had to have spent half the book asking people, \\"Do you remember when...\\" A definite must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I had previously read The Commitments and thought I would give this one a go as well. I have to say that it's one of the best novels I've read in a long time, and I tend to be VERY picky. Roddy Doyle masterfully draws the reader in to the 10-year-old child's world. We feel what he feels, see what he sees. As I was reading, I couldn't help thinking that I felt and thought many of the same things that Patrick does when I was that age. The novel is at once heartbreaking and triumphant. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Great memoir-type book. Fantastic kids' voice this author captures.

Sewed up quite powerfully at the end too!"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This is a story about 10 year old Patrick Clarke, his family and friends. The entire book is totally stream of conscious from Paddy's point of view. The boys in his crew terrorize Barrytown and each other! He also picks on his younger brother Francis - calling him Sinbad. Paddy's parents fight a lot and we find out, in the end, that the title of the book comes from his father's deserting the family and the boys chanting \\"Paddy Clarke, ha ha ha, he has no da, ha ha ha.\\"The book is truly entertaining - there is no question on that end. It is also extremely hard to read in any broken-up setting (commuting, a little each night, etc.) because there are no chapters, no breaks and no natural flow to the plot. This also helps the credibility level as 10 year olds really act and talk like this. The insight might be lacking, but it frees the mind to imagine background to the characters as well as a future for each of them."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"- Your daddy has a better job than Ian's daddy, she said. Then she said - Don't say anything to Ian. Sure you won't.The McEvoys lived on our road.- My da has a better job than yours!- He does not!- He does so.- He doesn't.- He does.This short scene clearly points the spirit of childhood that covers the whole \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\", a novel - more a series of vignettes - that gave Irish Roddy Doyle the Booker Prize in 1993. The title character is a young lad growing up in Dublin circa 1966. The narrative follows his daily routine at home, at school, with his parents and siblings and friends.Paddy is as innocent as rebel - that kind purposeless rebellion typical of kids - and is always up to a soccer game or a fight. He is not the best at school, but not the worst. He is just average. His confusions and sense of humor reminds of French Petit Nicholas - replete of innocence, nave sarcasm and black humor.Doyle manages to make a deep sincere portrait of childhood. And it is as touching as funny. At the same time, the writer avoids every clich&eacute; typical of this kind of novel - narrated by a child while coming to age - or of the time - middle 1960's. And it is a relief. There isn't child abusing, neither alcohol abusing. His parents, teachers or acquaintances are just regular people.This simplicity is what makes the book extraordinary. But don't get wrong. Being simple doesn't mean being shallow or irrelevant. The beauty of \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\" lies in its honest portrait - maybe there is some autobiographical things throughout the narrative - of a regular childhood. Doyle is able to make us laugh and cry - and all the laughs and tears are honestly conquered."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This book was published in 1993. It described a few years in an Irish boy's life from around age 8 to 10 in the mid- to late 1960s, in his own voice.I enjoyed most the way the novel showed the narrator's development -- in perception, use of language, self-understanding. From the beginning, when the only concern was the love of play, the daily explorations and sadistic competitions with friends and baby brother, and early role models like Father Damien and Daniel Boone. Simple joys like the smell of a mother's meal, a warm blanket at night, a compliment won from a father, and a shared laugh with parents. To the first bicycle, the growing love of sport, the radio and television, and inklings of the power of language, including swear words, of course. To the brink of adolescence, where the comforts of a stable home and simple friendships were left behind, and conflicted emotions had to be accepted. It brought back many memories.For this reader, the story passed over too quickly the religious education of the day, which must have had more impact, as well as the thrill of going to the cinema and the first glimmers that there was more to kissing than at first seemed apparent. The story seemed to lose something of its focus and intensity after the first 100 or so pages and might have gained from some tightening. This at least was the impression I got from the author's style of moving rapidly from one scene and subject to another. Moving ending, though.Excerpt near the beginning:\\"Our names were all around Barrytown, on the roads and paths. You had to do it at night when they were all gone home, except the watchmen. Then when they saw the names in the morning it was too late, the cement was hard.\\"Later on:\\"Sometimes, when you were thinking about something, trying to understand it, it opened up in your head without you expecting it to, like it was a soft spongy light unfolding, and you understood, it made sense forever . . . . Sometimes you gave up and suddenly the sponge opened. It was brilliant, it was like growing taller.\\"\\"I didn't listen to them. They were only kids.\\""},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I'm not very familiar with Irish literature, but I think this was a good book to start with. The book does a really good job of expressing the voice and experiences of a ten-year old. It can get a little confusing in parts, because Paddy tends to get sidetracked in his narratives, but I love the honesty and complexity of it. I read this in my English class, and I'm not sure I would have come upon this book if I hadn't had to read it for school. The writing style is a bit different from what I'm used to, but it made the book more interesting. Overall, I would recommend this book because it does a really good job of portraying childhood and gives some insight into what it was like to grow up in Ireland in the 1960's."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The book Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle reveals the world by the point of Paddy, a 10-year-old boy. The world seen through his eyes is filled with lots of curiosity and unpredictable things. The childhood events are depicted by lively, pure and innocent conversations between Paddy and his friends. Paddy gets to know about the parental conflicts and becomes exposed to the &iexcl;adult&iexcl; world. At the end, he catches the moment that his father hits his mother, and his father leaves the house on the same day. His father comes back home on day before Christmas Eve, and they shake each other&iexcl;s hands. His identity formed by having &iexcl;complete&iexcl; family begins to collapse when he first finds out the tension between his parents. However, he figures out his own way of protecting himself from the world that has taught him the life strategy."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I feel that Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha is an interesting book, but often hard to relate and get into. I think this is because it is written from a 10 year-old's perspective and what amuses and is observed by Paddy is often just extremely simple events that I feel can be hard to relate to. However, I feel this book is refreshing in the way that it is written from a 10 year-old's perspective as well. His observations and the way he plays can often get a little hard to get into, but it is still very interesting to see how he does think, and some of the childish, and unaware observations that are seen. This is refreshing to see, because many books are filled with a lot of analyzing and critiquing. Although, this is interesting, it too can also be a little hard to follow and relate to. It is nice to read a book that is based on observation through a child's eyes.I like how the author describes how Paddy and his friend's play, loyalty and being amused by simple things are definitely aparent in the scenes when the kids are all together. The way they play shows the boyish style of play and also the friendships and lack of friendships that are also involved. Reading these scenes when the kids interact with each other, another world is discovered. There are leaders and followers, best friends, enemies, fights, partners, and brotherly bonds. It is hard to forget how much children create when younger and this book does a great job in emphasizing these relationships that can be easily overlooked and thought unimportant.The book has a sad theme to it also. Towards the end, it seems as if Paddy has lost much of his innoncence, because of the relationships between his father and close friends. He discovers more of himself and does a good amount of maturing. This can be seen as a wonderful thing, but you can't help to feel a little sadness because the simplicity, games, loyalty, and an overall happiness of a child's world is often lost with this maturity."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I think this book is pretty decent. In this book the author can brings out the voice of a young kid. The sentence, speech in the book are all really easy, clear sentences. It's like a conversation between two young boys, innocent and funny. Through this book, I understand more on what is usually on a young kid's mind. They can only see the surface of an object. They see things really simple. They won't look deeper inside of an object. They live in a carefree simple life. Although people will always say that for people who think simple, they are basically living in a lie. However, I think that a simple life makes you a happier person because you don't see the ugly part of the world."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"As a literary work, Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, was a well written novel, but it did not hold my attention and I am not sympathetic with the subject matter. The author explored correctly the mind of a ten year old boy, but some of what happens is lost in this endeavor. I will give the book that it delved into territory mostly untouched, is a pioneer in this new way of writing, and it is a starting point that will be developed hopefully in the future. This book I a good literary beginning more than just a &quot;good read&quot;."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This book is a work of art. It successfully captures the thoughts and cares of a ten ear old boy. Although the train of thought form that the book is written in can be confusing at times, the randomidity of the events superdly reflects the way a ten year old thinks and successfully conjures up memories from your childhood when you were ten years old. A few examples are your changing opinions of your friends as you fight and/or mature, the level of importance school has on you as you get older, and the way you worshipped your parents and how you began to view them in a different light as you mature. I highly suggest reading this book to all readers at the high school level and above."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Few writers can capture the mind of a ten year old within the pages of a book. However, Roddy Doyle does it, and he does it well. Prepare for a ride into the world of random thoughts and childish dreams. Laughter, frustration, sympathy and a surprise ending are all woven into a wonderful story that never ceases to amaze and amuse its reader. It is a constant reminder that children can know more than we think they do, but they prefer to dream as well. Read this book and travel back to your childhood with Paddy Clarke as he walks the road of growing up."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I was unprepared for the strength of this book. After the light-hearted, hilarious yet at most bittersweet previous Doyle works such as The Commitments and The Van, I was assuming that this book would continue in that vein. Instead, what I found was the maturation of an incredibly gifted writer, one who demonstrates his newfound maturity by reverting to that most basic of human creatures, the ten-yeard-old boy; our curiosity was balanced only by our inability to be impressed, and our cruelty was neither a sign of mental illness nor primal instincts geared towards pack advancement, but simply a continuation of our attempts to fill those sponge-like little minds.The final chapter left me breathless. I finished the book, found my wife, handed her the book and said &quot;This is what it was like to have been a little boy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This is a well-written book about a young boy in Ireland, but I'm about 137 pages into it and I'm struggling to finish. Doyle's quality prose isn't enough to keep you interested in Paddy Clarke's story, which is told from the first-person perspective of the boy himself. There's just never enough insight into the boy to really care. If you want to read a bunch of vignettes from a boy's point of view, knock yourself out, but know what you're getting.This is the fourth Roddy Doyle book I've read and frankly it is his least engaging. \\"The Van\\" is one of the funniest books I've encountered and I'm going to steer you towards that. Also, if you've got the stomach for it, you might want to check out Irvine Welsh's \\"Filth.\\" It's not for the squeamish, though."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle was born in Dublin in 1958 and saw his first novel, \\"The Commitments\\" published in 1987. It was later adapted for the big screen, a version that saw Star Trek's Colm Meaney and a very young Andrea Corr among the cast. Doyle went on to win the Booker Prize in 1993 with \\"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha\\".The book is set in the 1960s Barrytown, and is told by Paddy Clarke- the eldest child of his family. Although he has a few younger sisters, it's only his younger brother Sinbad who features to any degree. He's a Manchester United supporter, and particularly idolises George Best. His chief hobbies involve playing football, and messing around with his friends on neighbouring farm and nearby building sites.Sinbad doesn't always get a fair deal from his brother. He cries constantly, wets the bed and as a baby, he once got his head stuck in the bars of his cot. He never smiles in photos and doesn't eat his dinner - something that particularly infuriates his Paddy Sr. Despite wearing glasses with one black lens - to deal with an eye problem - he's a great dribbler on the football pitch. (Paddy and his friends used to make Sinbad be Nobby Stiles when playing football - so he stopped supporting United, and started following Liverpool).Out of Paddy's friends, he's probably closest to Kevin Conway - though, to be honest, Kevin isn't an entirely likeable kid. James O'Keefe, for the most part, is a good deal more - deapite being, quite possibly, the biggest liar in Barrytown. O'Keefe is hated by their teacher Mister Hennessy - he even gets blamed on making noise in class when he's off sick. (Henno does appear to have a slight vindictive streak in him - in fact, he reminded me a little of a teacher I once had at secondary school). The two most likeable of Paddy's friends, however, are a pair of brothers called Liam and Aidan. The boys' mother is dead, and though their father is trying his best, he seems to be a little lost. The neighbours aren't above gossiping about him and - although they are officially part of the gang - Liam and Aidan are also on the receiving end of a fair few nasty comments. As much as Paddy loves going over to their house, even he's not immune to a touch of snobbery.The story is told more from a child's point of view rather than by an adult looking back on things. There are some things that raised a smile - the childhood theories about Purgatory, for example - and it even inspired a touch of nostalgia sometimes. However, it's set at a time when not only is Barrytown changing, but Paddy's home life is changing dramatically too. Naturally, Paddy doesn't always understand his parents and the things they say - so it's only gradually, as the frights become more and more frequent, that you come to realise there are problems between Paddy's dad and mum. There's a certain sadness about watching Paddy grow up as the story is told, while the difference between Paddy at the book's beginning and on the book's final couple of pages is tragic. A lovely book, though very sad."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"In &quot;Paddy Clarke, Ha Ha Ha&quot;, Roddy Doyle captures the Irish upbringing effortlessly. Having grown up in Ireland myself, the mischeivious little boys in the playground are images far too familiar for me, and Roddy Doyle manages to transmit the memories of most Irish people into text.This novel is fantastic. Even without an Irish upbringing, the adventure and playfulness of childhood is resurrected for the audience. Roddy Doyle seems effortless in transforming his mindset into that of a 10 year old boys, and this is what makes the book so delightful. Roddy Doyle could even be called the Sue Townsend of the 1990s - though Paddy Clarkes experiences aren't recorded in diary form, the relationship between Paddy and the reader is equally as intimate as it was with Adrian Mole......this book is an adult version of Adrian Mole!To Irish readers, or to readers of Irish decent, this book is a must-have as there are so many incidences to which the Irish reader can relate. However, the story is delightful, and though at times not a particularly easy read, Roddy Dolye keeps his audience captivated throughout and helps us remember just what a big wide world it is out there.......especially to a 10 year old boy!"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"&quot;paddy clarke ha ha ha&quot; achieved the Booker Prize (1993) for obvious reasons. Technically it is brilliant; the subject matter is conveyed in an appropriate form. The disjointed approach mirrors that of an actual child. This fact make the reading much more interesting, as the story is not in a straight line through time.However, while this may be faultless, the story is definitely for a hard core reader. So don't try to read this book without 'warming up' first with a simpler more easy publication. Something chronological. Nevertheless, if you are ready for the challenge and you are a keen reader this is definitely something you should read. Even if it is just to say that you have read it."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"&quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot; is a heartfelt tale of a 10-year-old boy's transition from childhood into adolescence. His simplistic and untainted view of the world takes you back to the days of childhood. Paddy's adventures with his friends in small Barrytown Ireland are quite similar to many chilhood experiences. He spends more time romping around with his friends than he does at home, and he is often cruel to his little brother Sinbad. Your typical young boy. However as the book progresses you see Paddy change, he learns more about the world and starts to lose his child-like perspective.Roddy Doyle is a master at capturing the thoughts and feelings of Paddy and the reader finds himself caught up in Paddy's world. Not a life-altering book, but a refreshing look back at childhood."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle's _Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha_ realistically and poignantly captures the nature of childhood in a manner probably unlike any novel ever previously written. Unlike Holden Caulfield, who is a frightened and disturbed adolescent severely out of touch with the world around him, Paddy Clarke is very much a typical 10 year old boy growing up within a very normal environment and circumstances. His family--his ma, his da, and his younger brother, Sinbad--are also quite ordinary. That Paddy spends his childhood in Ireland is incidental to the novel. Paddy's experiences and feelings are universal to young boys throughout the world.We enter the world of Paddy and his friends in the classroom and at play. With every situations filtered through Paddy's eyes, we can experience his pain, his joy, his fears, and his triumphs and disappointments from his perspective. Instead of a linear plot development, Paddy tells his story in terms of incidents in his life. His narrative is disjointed, very much the way a young boy would necessarily relate such a personal tale to others. Because of its realness, Paddy's tale is never less than engaging and heartfelt.Recalling my own childhood, I was particularly amazed at how accurately portrayed were Paddy's reactions to the conflicts and attitudes of the adults around him, especially those of his parents. Being a child, Paddy lives in a different world from his parents. A constant outsider, he desperately tries to gauge whether his parents have been arguing, whether his mother has previously been crying, or even if his parents were on the verge of breaking up. Also, like most children, Paddy has an active fantasy life. We share in Paddy's imaginings about death--an animal's, those of individual family members, and even his own. Particularly affecting is the author's depiction of Paddy's dealing with the universal conundrum of love and hate. Paddy learns that one is not necessarily mutually exclusively of the other, and that he can feel both love and hate at the same time, especially for his little brother."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle's book, Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha has all the factual and understandable trappings of youth. Doyle's youthful voice flows through the pages as a young boy's thoughts flow through his mind. The set up and flow of this books appears to be skittish and and unstructured, but that is the very sense of youth that Doyle tried to capture. Following a boy and his friends through the awkward time of youth is no easy task for an adult, with only memory as a guide, but Doyle elegantly recaptures the spirit of boyhood pleasures and pains. From fighting parents and friendship stand off's, Doyle emerges his young hero as a dynamic character. Paddy grows and changes in this book, from a mere boy to a understanding, effective male figure."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Mr. Doyle has definitly mastered the voice of a ten-year-old boy, but, let's face it, ten-year-old boys, although interesting to observe for brief moments, can get a bit tedious after a while. The plot was highly predictable -- problems at home lead to tragic ending and discovery of self -- but not nearly as interesting as it sounds. Futhermore, although I'm sure Mr. Doyle was trying to &quot;set the stage&quot; and make us see into the world of a young boy by describing his day-to-day world, he needn't have done so for half the book, leaving no real plot line until page 150. Overall, I'd use excerpts of this book as a believable reference for a child's voice and thought pattern, but not as a pleasure-read."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"There are so many reasons to love this book. Chiefly, Roddy Doyle puts you right inside the mind of a 10 year old boy masterfully. He nails the joy, the logic, the insecurity and the bravery of the child mind that takes you right back. Also, just as a celebration of everyday Irish dialogue, this is a hoot. Finally, this is a very touching book, taking the reader on the journey of a childs creeping realization that all is not well with his parents marriage.A+ effort."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The book had a few moments of interest, but it was too long at 280 pages. I found it a chore to get through, and I could not relate to anything our young protagonist had to say. I noticed that one of your reviews said that males would probably relate to this novel better than women; I have to disagree with that statement as I found the book to be rather thin on storyline and of no real interest"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"After reading Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in English class I came to appreciate the book. Upon reading the first thirty pages or so I thought that the book was easy readying and should not be read in an 11th grade English class. As I read more of the book I say the true meaning, which is that children can see the world so differently from how it really is. Children also make up situations to be what they instead of what is going on in reality. I think that this book will take back anyone to the days of youth and few worries."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"After all the hoopla, this book was a bit of a let-down, but only a bit. Doyle does a very convincing job of conveying a child's voice and sensibility, and his lack of sentiment is, in one way, admirable, but at the same time it denies him-- and the reader-- the full range and intensity of real childhood emotion, and so the book book feel both authentic, and at the same time, somewhat bloodless. The laugh-out-loud reaction I heard from friends was one I never got, though I did smile spontaneously from time to time. The real weakness of the book is its narrative strategy and structure. The story is the old one: childhood intact, childhood broken, and as is almost inevitably the case, the intactness feels static and less interesting that the breaking, which only really kick in 200 pages-- over 2/3s of the way-- into the book. Those first 200 pages, while they do limn childhood thinking and experience, feel a bit aimless and wandering, and it isn't till the family begins to break up that the book acquires a purpose and a sense of drive. In spite of that, it's definitely a cut above the average."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"If you like to read different types of books, this is definitely one to consider. Written from an 11 year old's point of view, it captures the thought process and perception of the events throughout the book very acurately. However, I wouldn't recommend this piece to people who have a liking for deep/phylisophical thinking. Though when examined thoroughly, the child's superficial perceptions can be converted to a more adult mindset and emotional level. I enjoyed the book up until around the halfway point because it was not written in &quot;engfish&quot;, but soon after became bored of the lack of depth and non-lineal thinking. It was a nice change of pace from the expectingly articulate works which I have been required to read."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I read &quot;Paddy Clarke&quot; soon after reading &quot;Angela's Ashes.&quot; While I know that I'm comparing a novel to a memoir, Doyle's first person, &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; of a 10-year-old Irish boy was incredibly more powerful and moving for me.Doyle adroitly builds his story from the every-day to the specific. The novel derives its power from the slow dawning of adulthood on this young boy... that very soon, he may have to be the &quot;man of the house.&quot;Doyle's ability to write realistically through the eyes of a 10-year-old is a triumph. My favorite book in the past two years."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"When Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha was first reviewed in the 1993 New York Times Review of Books, I could not wait to read it. Finally getting to it five years later, I must admit to some disappointment. Doyle tells of ten-year-old Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Clark's life in Barrytown, Ireland. The writing is episodic; Doyle goes from scene to scene -- Paddy among his friends; Paddy at school; Paddy with his family -- without any clear plot. Much of what happens is very funny. The concluding chapters -- where the &quot;plot&quot; at last becomes clear -- are sad. Throughout the book, however, I found my attention wandering significantly, and I often could not recall what I had already read when I went to pick it back up (my four-year-old daughter has the habit of at times removing or moving my bookmarks, with predictable results). Others, however, adored this book (it won the 1993 Booker Prize), so I will not disuade anyone from reading it. But for whatever reason, Paddy Clark -- unlike Doyle's marvelous The Snapper -- did not do it for me."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Yes, this book paints a convincing picture of the mind and world of a 10-year-old boy. But most 10-year-old boys are unpleasant, especially to each other and their younger brothers (yes, I was once a 10-year-old boy). Most of what they do and think is neither interesting nor enlightening. Doyle captures all this well, but I found it very dull. The humorous touches were only mildly amusing--enough for a forced mental &quot;ha ha ha&quot; like the title, not a real laugh. There's not a trace of plot till almost the end, and that bit is trite and too predictable halfway through. I was particularly annoyed by not knowing exactly what some of the dirty words mean, and not being able to look them up or ask someone--which of course is the typical 10-year-old's predicament! Yes, reminders of my youth...and why I'm well out of it."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I just loved this book....it gave me a good time and it is just hilarious....."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"In Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha Roddy Doyle attempts--with some success-to see the way a child views, and understands, the world evolve and mature. The book starts out with Paddy a feisty 10 year old and follows him through adolescence. As Paddy grows up and starts to realize that there are real problems and issues out there that really do affect him and that he's got to come to terms with, the narration does an admirable job of maturing along with the boy.The problem for me, as it appears to be for many to others who have commented on this book, was that I never engaged with the story on an emotional level. The story never grabs you and sucks you in. Reading this is sort of like having an out-of-body experience-you see it all, understand it all, but never develop any sort of feelings about the enterprise.The writing style is interesting, the story moves along, there are some interesting insights. Unfortunately, this appears to be one of those books where the whole seems somehow to add up to less than the sum of it's parts. In the end you are left with a book you can appreciate but for which you have no particular fondness."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"While this book does an excellent job of capturing what it's like to be a 10 year old boy growing up in Ireland, it just didn't give me much reason to care enough about that boy to really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I really enjoyed reading Paddy Clarke.

Throughout the book, you are able to see the behavior and mental changes of a 10 year old boy. The story is narrated by Paddy who gives his opinions freely of every situation. From the beginning to the end, Paddy has to grow up and see life from many different angles. Paddy's interests change from the start to the finish, and show that he is growing up and focusing on more important aspects of life.

To relive your life as a ten-year old is amazing. The mindset of the book reminds the reader of things that they may have done when they were they younger. There were some confusing parts but it is easily understood if you think about it. The langauge is really funny since it is Irish and many of the words that they boys use are not used today. I would not recommend reading this book in sections because it does get boring after a while. I would say read some pages and put it down until you want to read it again. There are no chapters in this book so you can stop whenever you want and pick it up at that same spot. Roddy Doyle does a good job of capturing the imagination of the ten-year old and does sibling and friend relationships at a young age. Read the book and see if it grabs your attention because it surely did grab mine."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I chose to give this book four stars because in my opinion, it transported the reader to a 10 year old frame of mind and placed in uncomfortable situations at home, school and with friends, and showed us how a changing young boy would react. I believe the author's use of his parents fighting was an excellent way to show the maturity of Paddy throughout the book. I also liked the distinct differences in his behavior toward his younger brother, and sister. I was not so fond of the friend problems presented throughout the book, at age 10 everyone has fights, and I don't believe that a persons character or anything else is done growing, and I feel the author ended the book not redeeming any of Paddy's friends. That may have been his intention, but I did not feel it was the best way to end a book. Overall I think this is a very good book, and would recommend it to a high school audience at the very youngest.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is a great book to really understanding a childs way of coping with different things.

I can relate and I think that many others that read this novel will relate to the personality of this 10-year old Irish kid.

While a little tricky to get into initially, one quickly realises that the thread of the story hops around a bit, much as a 10 year old breathlessly relating a tale to you. So much better than Angela's Ashes and more deserving to be made into a movie. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The most amazing book I have read for a long time.

Brought through an imaginative focus upon the growing pains of such a wild creative mind. Easy to relate to with such memories of a forgotten childhood."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Doyle has created a masterpiece out of nothing. At first glance, it may seem that he simply enumerated common instances in human life, through a ten-year-old boy's eyes. It reminds you of your childhood and makes you smile, looking back on good memories. But there is something more than that. Paddy has grown up and become mature throughout the book. Through the relationships with people around him, Paddy has started to realize what is going on out in the real world. He is not embraced by his Da anymore, Paddy shakes hands with him."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha deserves four stars for its great description of a child who, through experience, grows faster than his age. Doyle did an exceptional job of capturing the life of a ten year old. The book is written in a ten year old's &quot;voice&quot; including short sentences and many vingnettes. But it feels as if you are right there with Paddy, observing the same things, from fighting with his friends to watching his parents fight.I enjoyed reading this book but I have to say the ending although well written, was a short stop. It left me feeling incomplete, wondering what would've happened next. At the same time, Doyle did conclude the story at an interesting place that worked and that I liked but left me not knowing what to do next."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The most notable thing about Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha was how the work portrays the voice of a 10 year old boy authentically. Although it wasn't written by a child, the word choice and the way the different issues are presented thoughout the novel makes the reader wonder if the author spent some time studying how a child thinks and feels before he started writing. The story is refreshing because of the way it is so simply put, without all the analyzing and explaining that comes with most adult literature.One of the weaknesses of the book has to do with the plot line. The first 100 pages or so feel slow because the main conflict is subtle, and Paddy jumps around a lot and does a lot of describing of different memories he has and events he experiences. The reader is left hanging about why the parents argue so much because we see things only from Paddy's point of view which is limited in understanding. Some could say that the lack of detail is interesting but for me it was frustrating. The book also ends at the climax of the story which leaves you wondering what happens afterwards, but that also is probably intentional.Overall this book is value for the study of point of view and voice, but it moves slowly and takes some focus to follow the plot line. The writing is authentic and evokes a large spectrum of emotions, from empathy to fear to hilarity. It's a good read if you are looking for a little nostalgia."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"&quot;Paddy Clarke, Ha, Ha, Ha,&quot; is a remarkably poignant novel about the transition of age of a boy of 10 years old growing up in Ireland during the 1960's. Roddy Doyle depicts Paddy as both a brave explorer and a sensitive son. Everything seems to be changing around Paddy, he notices qualities in his friends that he had previously been oblivious to, his brother becomes more special to him, and his parents fighting seems to be worse each day. Paddy desperately wants things to return to the way the were before, when he was an innocent child, but no matter how hard he tries he must realize that nothing can ever be the same. Doyle accomplishes all of this while speaking in the mind of a 10-year old,which is all at once inquisitive, funny, brilliant, and sad."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"No matter where you spent your boyhood, either Barrytown, Ireland or Anywhere, USA, you will be able to feel the memories comming back to you with each turn of the page in this book. The mischief and shenanigans that I think most of us boys got into will be re-told by the hero of this story Paddy Clark. A touching tale of a young boy with, of course, arguing parents, bratty little brothers, and lots of friends that want to get in trouble with him. A great story that I'm sure most adults will enjoy not only for the story but also to relive a little of their own childhood."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This novel provides a terrific antidote to the tendencey, especially among Americans, to romanticize Ireland and &quot;Irishness&quot; (views of the latter often border on Stage Irishness). The language is straightforward and the sentences direct, which makes the episodic structure of the novel and Paddy's weird, non sequitur thoughts easier to follow. The novel rewards careful reading (and especially re-reading, which is easy to do)--Doyle has a way of making his prose flow deceptively easily before your eyes, but there are powerful currents beneath. The novel is especially delightful because it manages to capture the painful and joyous growth--emotionally and psychologically--towards adulthood of a single boy as well as the current tension in Ireland, caused in part by its newfound economic success, between old ways of defining Irishness according to land, religion, and conflict with England and Ireland's new sense of itself as a technologically and financially &quot;modernized&quot; country with increasingly more similarities than differences with the United States and England."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is one of the sweetest and most true-to-life books I have had the pleasure to read in a very long time. Doyle captures the essence of childhood in Ireland, as seen from the eyes of a small boy. If you are Irish, or you want to explore Ireland through the eyes of a child growing up in Ireland, read this book. You'll laugh and cry, and you'll want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"A stunning portrait of life as a child. Something we all experience,but sometimes forget. Roddy Doyle gives you the option ofbecoming a child all over again, through the trials, games andloves of youth.

You become Paddy; youremember."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke is 9 years old, the older brother of a whinylittle boy, and is on the brink of growing up.

I recommend this book to everyone. It is truly incredible."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I am seldom disappointed with Mr. Doyle's books. It is very clear why this book was an award winner. How Mr. Doyle manages to take on the voice of a 10 year old boy and to remember the feelings, the things that are so intensely important to a 10 year old, the irrational fears, the careless days, the petty rivalries. This book is really a testament to his creativity, originality and his lovely wit. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood for the type of reading that totally immerses you into the life of the main character and reaches such a wonderful level of emotion and humor that you dwell on the story and on Paddy for weeks to come."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Funny, Fascinating, hilarious look at life through the eyes of a ten-year-old Irish boy named Roddy Doyle, who is trying to deal with his parents' impending split-up.

Doyle has crafted a timeless 1980s where cheeky children play in open fields, steal sweets from simple minded shopkeepers and go to church on Sundays. A smattering of translated Gaelic phrases coupled with the occasional rambunctious rendition of a folk tune by young Paddy further add to the feeling that the novel is suspended in time. Paddy's family float along getting the children up for breakfast, off to school, patching up the day's scraped knees before dinner and a suitably early bedtime. The shaper edges of adult life are seen from Paddy's partially comprehended perspective where arguments are muffled by closed doors and the smell of alcohol on someone's breath is unusual enough to be amusing.For the most part, Doyle does an exceptional job of capturing and maintaining Paddy's voice. Even the adults speak as Paddy hears them and a grown up expression or concept rarely slips through. In one instance, Paddy says that he was delighted about something however this type of break of character is rare and most of the time he is just a snotty, grubby annoying little kid.The main reason I didn't enjoy Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is because it's chock full of snotty, grubby, annoying little kids. I failed to warm to the company of ten year old boys when I was ten and feel no real need to do so now. Paddy's life is either supremely harmonious or he's a bit thick about what's going on around him. While many might find this naivet&eacute; endearing and charming it failed to help me enter or appreciate Paddy's world.I would normally rate something like this as an above average read however, to be honest, I had to force myself past page 50. I wasn't terribly interested in dead animals, scabby knees and boy germs the first time around."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I found this book very disapointing after reading the barrytown trilogy.I have read and re read the trilogy seen the movies and totaly enjoyed them but could not seem to get into this one.I am a fan of Roddy doyle and hope that the next book is beter i am about to read a star called henry and hope that i find myself liking it."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I found that Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha, was a typical story about the triumphs and tribulations of growing up. It was refreshing to read the stream of consciesness style of writing. However, in theme, plot, and message there was very little that distinguished this book from a million other books about childhood. Although well written and amusing at times, Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha was unoriginal and did not provoke thought."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle has created a beautifully lyrical account of a young Irish boy's maturation into adolescence. He manages to capture the inner life of a ten-year-old boy without reverting to sentimentality or allowing his narrative to descend into cuteness. The accuracy with which Doyle conveys Paddy's voice is perhaps the greatest achievement of the novel.Despite the lovely prose, this is not a book that is easy to get into. It lacks a traditional plot or narrative structure, instead being composed of brief vignettes of Paddy's life at home and out with his friends. These episodes seem random and unconnected at first, but as they accumulate they gain emotional significance. Although I found the first third of the book to be distinctly un-touching, by the time I got to the end it was heartbreaking.Doyle does a wonderfully subtle job of describing the gradual changes happening around Paddy, both in his home and in the town where he lives, and of describing the effect that these changes have on Paddy himself. He really manages to convey the feelings of confusion and powerlessness that Paddy experiences as he tries to make sense of his changing world and struggles futilely to hold on to the way things used to be.This book is worth the work that it takes to get into it. I found it a very moving experience, and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle does an amazing job of staying in a child's perspective, while evolving the character, the child, into something more than a kid, and more of a person. The reader feels connected with Paddy, the main character, but at the same time feels sorry for him because the reader understands more of what Paddy is seeing. There are moments throughout the book that are poignant representations of childhood, that hold no nostalgia for Paddy, but the older reader can see traces of their childhood in them. All in all, a good, light read with strong emotions, though the first hundered pages or so are kind of uneventful. Stick with it - the middle, what Paddy goes through and how he changes, redeems it all."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This book shows Northern Ireland and a town through the eyes of one boy who also has to witness the failing marriage of his parents. where his town grows his family does not. Written in sketches with funny and emotional scenes I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"\\"Paddy Clarke\\" is alleged to be a black comedy, wickedly funny, etc. While I'm sure that's accurate for people of certain sensibilities, my reaction throughout the book was a tightening in the pit of my stomach, as the Patrick Clark and his friends go from one frightening episode or trauma to another. It's hard to imagine surviving that type of childhood intact, even though it was probably pretty typical for working-class Irish in the 1960s. It might even have been considered a bad deal at the time.Paddy Clarke is 10 years old, and he is being raised in a new development near the Irish coast. His father works, and his mother stays home with Paddy and three younger siblings. They don't have luxuries (no phone in the late 1960s), but they're not hungry nor under financial duress. They have their comfortable family rituals (dad's love of TV news and American Westerns, mom's wonderful cooking), but it's a dreary existence in many respects.For play, Paddy and his friends run through fields that are gradually being churned up for low-income housing developments and the infrastructure needed to serve them. They watch as a farm disappears, a barn burns, and their large soccer pitch becomes a road. They find dangerous adventures in mud, fields, water, and more. They set fires, steal from construction sites and from stores, and fight with each other relentlessly. They kick and throw things at animals. The older boys (Paddy and Kevin) sadistically target the younger ones, including Paddy's brother Sinbad (real name: Francis). The book is a sickening litany of kicks to the leg, punches, attacks with sticks and rocks, mud fights, and more. It's horrible.School is worse. A sadistic teacher lords over the boys with slaps, punches, and smacks of a switch. All the kids hate him and every other authority figure in the institution. On the rare occasions when a teacher or administrator shows mercy, the kids are actually confused by the gesture.Topping all this off, the marriage between Paddy's parents falls apart. It progresses from verbal fights to drinking and physical violence. Paddy, while barely understanding what's going on, tries to mediate through humor. But he can't fix the problem, and he falls into sleeplessness and depression (not that he'd know the word). Ultimately, his father leaves -- and the loss becomes fodder for Paddy's playmates. The book ends with Paddy trying to make sense of the new situation.None of the above, by the way, suggests that \\"Paddy Clarke\\" isn't an excellent book. It evokes a place and an era very deeply, and it shows the positives and negatives. It also produces a feeling of a real boy and the tough dilemmas he must face about how to get on in the world."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle is an unusual, highly original account of life in a Irish Catholic household. Written from the point of view of Paddy, the eldest son, aged ten, of the Clarke family, it draws the reader through a particular experience of childhood.There is a child's wonder at the new. There are strange facts about the world to be unearthed and challenges to face like a man. But when you are ten, there is also always the rock of parents, ma and pa, ma and da, mum and dad on which to rely. Their love for you and their constancy will always offer support and never let you down. Like God, they are not subject to question.So when you do something that was not quite advisable, and as a consequence a window gets broken, or a plant uprooted or an ornament broken, there's recrimination to expect, of course, perhaps punishment to endure, but it will be fine in the end, because ma and da always make things happen that way. You can trust them, assume their interest, take them for granted.And that applies even when you beat up your mate, and hit him just a bit too hard. You might say he fell, or stumbled and hit himself hard in an unfortunate place, let blood that spotted his shirt or came home crying in fright, but it would all be fine in the end. When you give your younger brother a dead leg just to keep him in his place, or declare war under the covers after bed time, or even when he messes his pants provoking the others to giggle and mock, there is always home waiting, where there will be safety behind the parental screen.And when you pick a fight because someone says that George Best is not the best footballer in the world, that a teacher you like is a whore or a defenceless sibling ought to get punched, ma and da always step in, mediate, soothe.Until, that is, you realise your da might not be telling the truth, until you realise that he is just another grown up, perhaps as inconstant and unreliable as all the others. And what about when your ma and da start to fight? The noises percolate through the wall from the other room. They can't be hidden. Well that's just called growing up, which is already happening, even - perhaps especially - to a ten year old. And then, of course, there will be adulthood, when everything will be different in a world where people don't fight, where there will be no conflict. This is Northern Ireland, after all.Roddy Doyle's book is a delight. It takes a while to suspend the disbelief associated with becoming a ten year old, even longer to get used to the idea that little Paddy might have written it all down. But the mood and his character soon take over and draw us into a world as fascinating and as threatening as any experienced by an adult."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Clarke, a 10-year-old boy, narrates this story about his childhood experiences growing up in a working class family. I found the writing style and tone extremely authentic, including the lack of chapters. Squishing all the anecdotes and memories together with little more than a double space seems exactly the way a child would write. Paddy, his younger brother Francis, aka Sinbad, and the neighbor boys spent their free time as one would expect; playing outdoors in and around the neighborhood. Paddy recounts the details of their mischievous, sometimes dangerous deeds (including getting caught a number of times), incidents that take place in school, and interactions with his family, especially the conflicts between his parents, which increase over time. Mr. Clarke's personality seems to be the main cause of the couple's marital difficulties, (p 37), \\"He was like that, our da. He'd be really mean now and again, really mean for no reason. He wouldn't let us watch the television and the next minute he'd be sitting on the floor beside us watching it with us, never for long though. He was always busy. He said. But he mostly sat in his chair.\\" Best of the book: neat similes like these, (p 17) \\"The jellyfish was still floating there, like a runny umbrella,\\" (p 24) \\"The wrinkles at his knuckles were a bit like the design of a wall, the cement between the bricks up and across,\\" and (p 39) \\"She had big veins like roots curling up the side and the back of her legs,\\" as well as its authentic tone, which means it reads just as one would expect a 10-year-old to talk, (p 46) \\"The best story I ever read was about Father Damien and the lepers,\\" (P 53) \\"Snails and slugs were gastropods; they had stomach feet,\\" (p 72) \\"I killed a rat with a hurley,\\" (p 79) \\"I crossed my heart. I did it all the time; nothing ever happened and I was usually lying,\\" (p 84) \\"We went to heaven, unless we went to hell,\\" (p 152) \\"Scabs were made by things in your blood called corpuscles,\\" and (p 194) \\"The ice growled when you leaned on it.\\" Also good: Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, Dubliners by James Joyce and (for something a little lighter) Round Ireland with a Fridge by Tony Hawks."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Written from the perspective of a 10 year old boy, Doyle's writing throughout the book is in short bursts, talking about one thing then off on another. This very much emulates the way children's thought patterns jump from one thing to another.I had to smile in some parts at the childish understanding of events and the way it evoked memories of my own play at a similar age.Paddy's awareness of his parents quarrels and his struggling to stay awake to prevent them arguing was sad, as was his understanding of how events would pan out. His own long standing friendships seemed to come to an end at the same time as his parents, but his instinct to survive and the way his relationship with his younger brother Francis (Sinbad) developed seemed very true to life. One to read!!"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I just finished Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, and I am basking in the glow of this remarkably entertaining story, which Roddy Doyle somehow conjured up from his childhood memories. What's most impressive, I think, is how Doyle captures the voice of a 10-year-old boy so authentically. It's not what the boys do so much as the logic and reasoning that ring true, especially when Paddy makes the stupid mistakes that come with being 10 years old. The funny bits are great, and the family drama is small, quiet and emotionally powerful. Read this book."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"The first half of this novel captivated me. In Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Roddy Doyle demonstrates a marvellous ability to remember what it was like to be a ten-year-old boy. In that respect, the novel is brilliant. I would describe it as a fictional memoir of childhood written from a child's point of view. The novel is composed of a series of literary sketches, often seeming to follow no particular order, as if they spontaneously arose in Doyle's mind and then appeared on the page like happy chance accidents. This in itself creates a wonderful, free spirited, childlike mood.The second half of the novel dragged on a bit. A narrative became apparent: Paddy's parents were fighting frequently and it was obvious that their marriage was breaking down. Their ultimate separation didn't come as a surprise; I felt as though I was just waiting for the inevitable to happen.The greatness of this novel is Doyle's astonishing ability to catapult the reader back into the triumphs and losses of childhood, how important it is to be loved and wanted, how painful is the loneliness of a child."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"When his novel \\"The Commitments\\" became a smash hit movie, Irish writer Roddy Doyle acquired a vast new American audience for that book and the two others (The Snapper; The Van) in his gritty and hilarious trilogy of Dublin working - or rather workless-class life.Tragedy lies just the other side of wildest laughter in Doyle's first three novels. Each is characterized by lots of colorful, streetwise dialogue, fearlessly resourceful characters and loads of ironic wit.This novel, winner of London's prestigious 1993 Booker Prize, is different.Paddy Clarke is ten in 1968 and the narrative explores what that means in an almost stream-of-consciousness fashion. Paddy and his friends stage a Viking funeral for a dead rat, run the Grand National over the neighbors' hedged gardens, set fires at building sites, rob ladies' magazines (because they were the easiest) from shops, and torment each other, forming fluid alliances and watching for weaknesses. They are funny and frightening and unaware of both.The early part of the book roams from hair-raising adventure to adventure, incorporating casual cruelties and unheeded dangers with equal aplomb. Family intrudes only as a framework, a background of sustenance and tiresome restraints. Sinbad, Paddy's younger brother, is a tag-along nuisance, tolerated primarily as a victim for experimentation, such as forcing a capsule of lighter fluid between his teeth and lighting it.Paddy is full of life and contradictions; his mind is never still and, while full of wonder, not introspective. His rich fantasy life is more likely to be cruel than kind. He's as typical as any individual can be.Then the ever-simmering tensions between his parents intensify. The mysterious fights, his mother's tears, his father's black moods, move into Paddy's life and begin to take it over. Not that Paddy abandons pick-up soccor games or schemes against the boys in the corporation houses. But he begins to see his little brother with new eyes - a person who can share the burden of fear and maybe help stop it from happening.But Sinbad is uncooperative. Too young or too-long tormented by his older brother, he refuses to even listen. Paddy is left to turn the tide by himself. He stays awake all night because if he does it will stop them fighting; he watches them and interposes himself between them, learning how to turn their anger.The last third of the book is filled with gut-wrenching uncertainty. The sense that anything can happen at any time keeps the reader on tenterhooks, no longer able to laugh but hopeful, like Paddy, that normality will return.Doyle has created a masterful portrait of a boy - a child who observes so much more than adults expect but whose understanding is skewed by being a child. Paddy Clarke is funny, exuberant, unpredictable, subtle and heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I had, at the age of thirty five years, forgotten quite a lot - if not most - of what it meant to be ten years old.I have no idea how Roddy Doyle managed this incredible book - how he captured the wonder, the pain, the self-importance of being a child - but he did, I'm glad for it.If you can't remember the wonder, the adventure, the all-engrossing pain of being a child, you should pick up this book."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Given how many people use a shrink to restore childhood memories, the success of this book remains astounding. It is utterly timeless in conveying all we went through at one level or another in those ancient days. Reading this book is an indication of why many of us have quashed those images - the cost of painful recall is often too great to bear. How much did Doyle pay in order to dredge it all up again and present these recollections for our delighted reading? Whether this account is autobiographical is of no matter - what Doyle expresses gives voice to many wishing to be heard. If some would only listen!Those who discern little plot in this book should reflect on their own lives. Can you trace the steps leading to now from when you were 10 years old? It may seem easy now. Doyle superbly expresses the complexity of a boy's life. Elders view it with simple minds. Paddy must balance life with his family with that of his gang, his teachers, learning about himself against conflicting views of others. Kids don't have it as easy as we like to think. Parents devised the ignorant dictum that 'children should be seen but not heard' with the result that boys like Paddy expend immense amounts of energy forging an identity for themselves.Reviewers here make much of the Irish city setting of this book. Bosh! Urban, rural, Eire, Canada, Germany - all could find in children's lives a compelling topic. The locale is meaningful in the expressions Doyle uses to impart his ideas. There's merit in contending that only an Irish writer could do this tale full justice. Doyle's tale is a cry from the heart, a characteristic many attribute to a Gaelic inheritance. No matter, Paddy's story is truly universal. Every parent should read it carefully. Every bookshelf should contain a copy."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Roddy Doyle, whose novel, &quot;The Commitments&quot; was made into the famous hit movie in 1991, is one of those writers whose dialogue and observations put you in the protagonist's mind. In Paddy Clarke, that mind is one of a ten year old working class Irish boy. The winner of the Booker Prize, this little novel is sometimes wildly funny, poignant, and sometimes hard and frustrating at the same time. The author puts us into Paddy's head and we are given a better understanding of the thrill of the harmless pranks, the concern of the need to &quot;fit in&quot; with the bigger boys, the frustrations of trying to understand why your parents no longer get along, and the gradual awareness of both self and others. Many of the reviews of this book repeat the theme of a &quot;childhood lived, not just recalled&quot;, and this is very accurate. This is not a book about an adult remembering the days, but an adult who has captured the voice of the child as he is experiencing his life every day."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"By far one of the best books I have ever read, Roddy Doyle really takes you into the mind of Paddy Clarke, a young boy growing up in Barrytown in the 1960s. As we get older, we often forget how the world looks to young people, and Doyle has taken us back to relive it. All the doubts, fears, fun and games are there -- and the result of Doyle's prose and heartfelt descriptions of life for a ten-year-old whose world is falling apart is nothing short of magic. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone"},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Before you read this book, realize what Mr. Doyle is doing here. He writes as a nine-year-old first person narrator. The narrator not only tells his story from a child's vantage point, but proceeds as a child as well. He has a short attention span, he goes off on tangents, he changes his mind without explanation.Paddy Clarke is a pretty normal kid, which means, of course, that he is quite different from adults in profound ways. It's certainly a challenge to wade through his misperceptions, and his random eruptions, but it is well worth it.It is also a very funny story. I rarely laugh out loud while reading, but I laughed a number of times in this slender tome."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Paddy Clarke and his friends grow up in an Irish town called Barrytown. Their games and fun and carefree life is pretty much the story. But what is amazing is how beautifully and authentically the child-mind is pictured. The catch is when you are a child you would probably not be able to enjoy or write such a story and when you have grown up you have lost touch with the child-mind. Roddy Doyle is remarkable in overcoming this and he makes it look so simple. Little sentences and sentiments that make you re-live your childhood. The end is sad but the way a child feels sad without knowing much about the adult world is definitely a fresh read."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I can't relate to reviewers who say the book isn't emotional. On the contrary, it packs a wallop, but you have to see it through. The whole book is made up of little pieces, fragments, seeing the world as a boy does, including the often humorous (mis)understandings--old wives tales &amp; presumptions filling in as knowlegde. I'd forgotten what it was like to lose yourself in time, the way you do in childhood, and the kind of thoughts you have in that state. This is what makes the book a valuable work of art (though never in a stuffy or pretentious way). It's a simple story &amp; doesn't much kick in until the end (when it knocks you flat). Read the first several pages and you'll have a feel for the whole book. I had to push through the middle a bit but was well rewarded at the end.The book is filled with psychological understanding that runs very deep--especially the dynamics of boys' cruelty to and friendship with one another (read to the end for the full benefit). The narration jumps back and forth a bit, but it's pretty easy to follow. Some of the slang challenged me at first (I'm not Irish), but I figured it all out by the end. (Here's a head start: eccer is homework, mitching is skipping school.) Some may want more plot, but I'd call this a masterpiece. If you like Virginia Woolf, you must read this. You'll get inside character more accessibly and just as deeply. The prose has just as much graceful style and far more humor."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"It has excellent technique and unusual style. A terrific insight into a child's thinking. It tracks a child's growth, probably through his life's first crisis. It illustrates his realizations and the formation of a personality. Roddy, thankfully, avoids sophistry and twists in the plots. Any one who liked &quot;To kill a mocking bird&quot; and &quot;The catcher in the rye&quot; would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"Wonderful story of two youngsters growing up in Ireland and their (mis)adventures.

Instead, I found myself surrounded by his thoughts, and the complete lack of unity among them. I felt that this book had no direction whatsoever. What was written, and warranted the three stars, was a book of random thoughts that allowed me to feel as if I could relate to the kid. I understood how he felt which was beautiful, however, it was not enough to keep me particularly interested in the book as a whole."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I preferred to read this book straight through, with no interruptions. When I had to stop, it was easy to slip out of listening carefully to what Paddy had to say. Moved along very smoothly. Just the right amount of detail and very true to how children really get along. Nothing prettied up for you. Stark but not bleak. Paddy handles a difficult life. Very funny, too, in parts."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This is, arguably, the most accessible Booker winner. Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke makes you laugh, makes you cry. An emotional rollercoaster ride that makes you wish you can gripped your heart to shield the aching sadness."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"In his fourth novel, Doyle takes a leap and enters the mind of a ten year-old boy. Here he presents life as it is lived, with ups and downs, idle chatter, and small trials and triumphs. This important book also serves as a reminder to all of us that children understand more than we think they do. Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is the most realistic of both childhood and of Dublin in the 1960's anyone could ask for. Doyle may be short on plot, but he is long on meaning. If you were ever a child, you need to meet Paddy."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I followed Patrick through his tumultuous doings, and felt, as he did, the subtle seismic shiftings and closing in of circumstances that took him out of the charming self-absorption of childhood, forcing him to ponder and try to fix what was going on with the adults in his life. From the freewheeling hooliganism of Paddy and his friends, to the narrowing of his world, to the deeply sad ending, this is an intimate, moving portrait of childhood. I was in tears as Paddy took on the role of 'ref' in his household, as he tried so hard to stay awake night after night. 'Loss of innocence' is an overworked phrase, but this book vividly details the loss of control, of predictability, stability and ease that make up the innocence of childhood."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"I disagree with the readers who say this book is not for women. As a woman, I found this book (as I also did Doyle's The Woman Who Walked Into Doors) outstanding. It truly explores the emotions of a 10-year-old boy. Yes, they are different from those of a 10-year-old girl. However, by letting oneself feel what Paddy feels, even a woman can experience the humor, joy, mischief, pride, sense of adventure, and (ultimately) the fears of Paddy Clarke.

I too was many of the readers who believed there was no plot. I am ashamed that I even thought that. This book was simply amazing. Funny, and sad.. You truly care about Paddy Clarke and his unique way he sees the world. I have never read anything else by Roddy Doyle, only seen the movies. But, if this book is any indication of his style, and insight, I am sure to read more of his stuff. A amazing book. This books is for everyone.."},{"Title":"Paddy Clarke, ha-ha-ha","review":"This is an important book. Childhood and the view of the small world from a child's height - physically - is beautifully captured and expertly written in a sometimes colloquial tongue which puzzles the intellect and delights the soul. The boys all have faces, yet the words only impart the slightest of detail about the adults in the story, the view of their faces is obscured. It is important in that it takes men (this man at least) back to their particular childhood with spooky deftness."},{"Title":"Nutcracker Suite","review":"I purchased this score years ago before Dover published the full ballet score, and though I wished I had the full ballet at the time, this sufficed as a convenient set of selections from the ballet that form the Suite. Please, do realize that this is the SUITE and not the full ballet. It does say it in the title, but I've read a few reviews from people upset by the fact that it wasn't the full ballet. The title says \\"Suite\\" so please realize this before purchasing this product."},{"Title":"Nutcracker Suite","review":"I was slightly disappointed when I received this score. While the contents of the book are exceptional - as is always the case with Dover - and the binding of the book is unusually strong - sewn, not glued - I found it disturbingly thin.

Perhaps I am unfamiliar with the exact contents of the &quot;Nutcracker Suite,&quot; but all the pieces on my Nutcracker CD were NOT in this score.99.9% of the time, Dover produces the best score available to the average consumer.

One, the reissue prices are ridiculous for paperbacks. Two, and probably most disappointing, is the decision not to re-issue the original covers.

Being a teenager living in a world were teenage pregnancy is rapidly growing; the book has only made my resolve stronger in not joining that rapid number on surveys. What I found unique about Letters from baby Doe was that it was comforting. It reassured the reader, and even more so the mothers. This was not a book to ridicule the parents and add on to their guilt. It uplifted their spirits and gave them hope."},{"Title":"Letters From Baby Doe: Messages of Hope, Love, and Forgiveness","review":"I think this work would be more effective in changing people's hearts and minds than any number of angry debates. As someone who used to be vehemently pro-choice but had a change of heart, I think a book like &quot;Letters from Baby Doe&quot; would have been invaluable in helping me to &quot;wake up&quot; even sooner.The only thing that troubled me about this book is the ethical inconsistency of the fact that the protagnist is a hunter. It puzzled and saddened me that Falcone, who had been gifted with communications from murdered unborn children, apparently saw nothing wrong with slaughtering some of God's other living creatures for &quot;sport&quot;. As a Christian, I believe that humans are creation's stewards and servants, not its masters; that all creatures are loved by God and deserve mercy; and that *all* life is precious--born or unborn, human or animal.Overall, however, I would still recommend &quot;Letters from Baby Doe.&quot; I was deeply moved by the author's evident compassion for both aborted children and their mothers. By not demonizing abortive mothers and by extending understanding and forgiveness toward them, Wyand not only demonstrates profound wisdom and compassion (perhaps someday his heart will be open to all sharers of God's creation), but also makes his book's message more powerful and convincing."},{"Title":"Letters From Baby Doe: Messages of Hope, Love, and Forgiveness","review":"Touching, healing.

But if I was a romance writer, and if I could claim just one book to my name -- I would be proud to have written this one. The two main characters, Merriam and Drake, are about as sexy as two romantic partners get.Yes, this is an erotic book. But the sex scenes push the plot along. They never feel forced or done just because the author thought: \\"Well, it's been fifty pages, better put in a sex scene.\\" Actually, I can well believe that a person would stay up all night reading this book once it's begun. The first scene grabs the reader in a steamy hot embrace of lust, righteous indignation and instant attraction.Middle-class widow Merriam Everett lives in a quiet world of lady's lectures and philanthropic endeavors. She has never been loved, not by her overbearing father or her late philandering husband. Then, one day, she accidentally overhears the wonderfully handsome Julian Clay call her a \\"whey-faced widow,\\" and something snaps in Merriam's docile, scandal-free little world.She decides to do something so out-of-character that she can hardly believe she's doing it -- she decides to put on a sexy costume, attend a notorious masked ball, find Julian, seduce him, and then leave him \\"unfulfilled.\\" She wants revenge for every slight she ever endured from the mean-spirited men in her life. Unfortunately, she makes one small error. She mistakes Drake Sotherton, the so-called \\"Deadly Duke\\" for Julian, and then cannot stop the erotic game before it culminates in one of the sexiest opening scenes in romance novel history.The reason I love this book is because the main characters actually do change and become better people for having known one another. The subplot, which concerns the murder of Drake's wife and Julian's possible involvement, makes for exciting subtext to a really heartfelt love story. The last chapter is just wonderful.This is a romance to be savored, placed on the keeper shelf, and re-read over the years. It is this lady's pleasure to recommend it highly to any romance reader."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"This book is not a historical romance. Boring characters. I could not finish it and plan to take it to the used book store."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"If you can get past the fact that the words \\"oh\\", \\"oh my\\", or \\"incorrigible\\" seemed to pop up at least once every 5 pages, it was a very good book. As some of the other reviewers stated, the editing of this book was somewhat lacking. The ending seemed to wrap up a bit fast, but it was a very good read to the very end."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"Merriam Everett decides that the mysterious \\"Deadly Duke\\" of Sussex would be perfect for a one night stand. However, how to meet him to set up the tryst she desires is going to prove difficult as Drake Sotherton has become a recluse who never ventures out into society since his wife died. Most of the aristocracy believes he killed his spouse, but he believes Lord Julian Clay did the foul deed.Drake attends a masquerade ball where he meets the sensual seductive \\"Cat\\". She teases him into a taste of her like no feline has ever done before. Drake goes after her with an ardor that stuns Merriam with the passion she feels. Meanwhile he assumes she is connected to Clay. As he plots vengeance he persuades Merriam to be his mistress though in his mind she is a mouse in his scheme to catch a rat; a throwaway that he falls in love with as she sends him to levels of euphoria that makes him forget his previous desires.A LADY'S PLEASURE is an exciting erotic Victorian romantic suspense starring the mouse that roared and the man who goes from using her to loving her. Merriam is a fascinating female as she has plenty to prove while Drake has even more to prove. Their gender battles make for a fine tale with a late suspense spin involving Clay. Sub-genre fans will enjoy this fine historical.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"Really enjoyed this story. If you like this genre then I definitely recommend reading this book. Just 4 more words..."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"First the story, the reason we read most books: If you're reading for a great story that makes reasonable sense, this is not the one for you. The plot is contrived and unbelievable (mistaken identity, crazy hot sex in public with the wrong person, a madame, a man \\"buying\\" a lady's company for the season, a murdered wife and no one knows who-done-it, blah blah). However, if the reason you're reading this is for some hot sex scenes, A Lady's Pleasure might be the book you're looking for. Lots of steamy and explicit sex. The theme was domination lite - Drake's bargain with Merriam is that she must do everything he says, but he never pushes his demands to an uncomfortable extreme. So enjoy it for what it is - a steamy sexual romp with a with a weak \\"real\\" story."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I don't think this book was awful but it was not good either. There wasn't much of a story to hold my interest: A mousy widow hooks up with a returned scoundrel for one season for an affair. I expected to enjoy stimulating backs-and-forths between the two main characters and was disappointed to find them totally unmatched. The widow never really evolved from mousy to an interesting rounded person and the scoundrel never became the kind of alpha male romance hero that you would root for and sigh over. His smacking her bottom scene didn't excite me in the least, I am not much for physical abuse even if it supposed to be \\"sexy.\\" There is a time and place for this kind of thing but I don't think a mainstream historical romance novel is. I kept reading on hoping the book would go somewhere story-wise but it didn't."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"What a disappointing little book! It took me forever to finish it, mainly because I kept losing interest every 4-5 pages. Don't know why I bothered.I can't even tell what it was about... the story was so lame. Even the \\"innovative\\" sex scenes were lame. Some of them sounded downright unpleasant and unbelievable. The characters were so shallow. Revenge for something I couldn't muster any passion for. Attraction. Sex. That's it.Having read the other reviews, I expected so much of this book, I was sorely disappointed. Also, it is supposed to be happening in Victorian England, but it felt very Regency. I think the author didn't do any research at all. She must have read a lot of regency romance and decided, \\"Hey, what the heck... no one would notice anyway...\\"Well, I did. I like to take something from books that I read, even if it is an idea, a description, a phrase, a word, an emotion. This book gave me nothing to take with me. A Lady's Pleasure is by far the most superficial book I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"A Lady's Pleasure by Renee Bernard is a very sexual book - which is not a bad thing. In this novel Merriam is a widow known at the mouse but decides to step outside her comfort zone and seduce a rake. Of course things go wrong and people beleive lies but it quite the journey. Looking forward to her next book Madame's Deception coming out - Aug 28, 2007."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"Masterful nobility, rebellious ladies--this is a great spin on the dustyTon historical genre. Well written with an unpredictable turn of events--this author jumps to the top of the new author pile. While it's easy to put a modern sensibility on a character from the 1800's, it's more difficult to put authentic responses to a character true of the time period. Although the sensuality and passion rule the characters decisions, it's not difficult to understand, given the strict choices offered within their society, why the couple is willing to risk so much. For the female characters especially, ruin is a reality of the time period and passion out of marriage is highly costly of reputation and even potential \\"freedom\\". She could be considered \\"mad\\" from sensuality and sent to a mental institution.

Any book that starts out with sex in the very first chapter is a book that I'm not likely to put down until I've read it cover to cover, which was the case with A Lady's Pleasure. The story was good too. Drake Sotherland and Merriam Everett were both extremely well developed characters. Lots of description and interesting dialogue.Each scene was set very well with just the right amount of description without giving too much.

Merriam Everett is out for revenge against the arrogant lord who disparaged her. For one night only she'll transform herself into a captivating lady of the night and then seduce and discard her unknowing tormenter. But then, \\"the best laid plans..\\" and all that, it seems like she might have got the wrong man. Drake Sotherton, The Duke of Sussex has only recently returned to England after a self imposed exile, and like Merriam he's seeking revenge against Julian Clay. His plan is to seduce Clay's mistress to begin then path to his destruction. However though the initial encounter was fierier then he expected he and the lady never exactly exchanged names and now he has to track down the masked temptress to continue his plan. Merriam meanwhile is suffering the joint agonies of mortification and yearning, and when Drake finally finds her and offers her the position of his mistress she throws caution to the wind and embraces a passion that sweeps her up and scandalizes all who know her. Drake cannot reconcile this shy, sweet woman with the position of lover to Julian Clay, and his uncontrollable desire for her threatens to undo all his carefully laid plans. This is fantastic stuff!!

And let me just say, those scenes literally leap off the page with such vivid language and creativity that enthralls the senses and leaves me wanting even more! Congratulations to Miss Bernard! I will happily (and anxiously) await the next book! Bravo!"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"A fine tale of mistaken identity and sexual discovery. A good story needs to have characters you care about and a good plot line as well as great sex. This is a good story."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"The initial meeting between the lovers was interesting, but throughout most of the rest of the book I wanted it to be over. Conflicts were based on Drake making inaccurate assumptions about his former friend Julian and Drake's current lover Merriam. Sexual language: strong/erotic."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"A warning that perhaps you shouldn't read this in public if your prone to blush, giggle or break out into a sweat by reading explicit and *inventive* love scenes.Drake, the Duke of Sussex is out for revenge for the death of his adulterous wife and Merriam, the shy plain faced widow is caught in the middle of the his scheme unwittingly. She mistakenly seduces him at a masked ball in which she determined to bring another rake to his knees (literally) and leave him hanging with her new found sexual confidence. So it is the Duke she seduces and later is unable to resist the tension between them and becomes his mistress. But what will happen when the Duke discovers that he has lost heart to the one women he was wrong about and betrayed?This is ONE HOT BOOK! I'm pretty jaded when it comes to love scenes. Most historical romances contain the same 'scenes' at nauseum, but not here! I've never read a book with SO MANY love scenes and they were well written too. Unfortunately, I feel that the 'romance' part suffered a bit because of this. You really don't feel the emotional side of the characters, rather its more of a primative or lusting-type love. There is essentially no buildup since the encounters are so frequent and start VERY early in the book. Its a different approach to writing (although not neccessarily worse), but it lead me to care less for the characters than if the tension was strung-out a bit.I know this is Bernards first work and I have to commend her on her bold statement, but I have to mention a few irritating points. I agree with another reviewer, the description of time period (regency? victorian?) is sorely lacking. Sometimes the writing was jumpy (a fault of the editors) and I found scenes abruptly ending and new ones begining practically within the same paragraph. And the repetition of 'Oh my! and 'Your incorrigible' was annoying.That being said, I really did enjoy the book and I have hopes that Bernard will improve in her next novel (how can anyone resist a book about a Madames Deception?)So if you like lots of explicit love scenes (Kleypas and Jeffries watch out!) with two likeable characters and don't mind the lack of emotional build-up and the decidedly weak revenge plot, this ones for you."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"A steamy debut novel and a new voice in erotic romance, 'A Lady's Pleasure\` is a breathtaking story of mistaken identity.The hero of this tale, Drake, is back in Town from a self-inflicted exile to seek revenge on his wife's supposed murderer and lover, Lord Westleigh. Once best friends, each is out to ruin the other.Merriam, the once meek little mouse is also set on revenge against Lord Westleigh for calling her a \\"whey-faced widow\\". Her plan: get him hot and bothered then leave him wanting more. Things don't go as planned when Drake is the one she inadvertantly seduces instead.What follows is some explicit and creative love scenes that will leave you breathless. Merriam and Drake were insatiable, but because the scenes were so well written and different I didn't skim a single one.There is also hero-jealousy as Drake intends to use Merriam as 'bait\` to lure Julian, Lord Westleigh into his web.**The mystery gets tied up rather quickly in the last two chapters but the rest of the book was so good it is hard to mark off for that."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"First the positives--the writing flowed well, the characters fleshed out nicely, and the sex scenes leaped off the page. HOWEVER, the author has no business writing historical fiction with NO (I mean none, zilch, zip) knowledge of the era in which she sets her book. Well, actually, my first quibble is I'm not exactly sure when this novel is supposed to be set, because the author gives the reader no overt context. Let's just say it's \\"ye merry ol' England.\\"I do not profess to be an expert of \\"ye merry ol' England,\\" but after years of reading romance I do know one thing--an earl would never be introduced as a plain mister (see page 49). Although this is not the first naming error, it's the most egregious. Normally, I'm not a stickler for this sort of thing. Actually, anachronisms fly right by me most of the time, but errors as blatent as those in this book kept pulling me out of the story.Also, the story contained continuity problems. For example, the story starts off with the heroine not knowing the identity of the hero. Then, he gives her his card (which should have his name on it), but even after seeing the card she asks the hero who he is. BEFORE he tells her, she calls him \\"my grace.\\" Huh? Do you know him or not?For the most part, I'm going to chalk the problems in this book up to atrocious editting and recommend that Pocket retrain whoever allowed this book to go to print as is. My recommendation for the reader: wait to buy Bernard's next book and hope that the writing stays consistent and the editting improves."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It's definitely readable, but the characters were somewhat flat. The best characterization was done on Julian, the villain. Also, I couldn't believe that Merriam would indulge in the kind of sex that she indulged in with Drake then continue to say, \\"Oh my!\\" every time she had an orgasm and remain so...child-like throughout the book.Perhaps I shouldn't have read this book right after Elizabeth Hoyt's \\"The Raven Prince\\" which will put many books in the shade this season."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"Drake Sotherton, the Duke of Sussex leaves England years ago under suspicion of the murder of his wife and returns as the \\"Deadly Duke.\\" His best friend, Julian Clay, the Earl of Westleigh, who seems to have been involved in some way with his ex-wife's death and also was the main accuser of pointing to Drake as her murderer, are involved again in a struggle over a woman. This time it is Merriam Everett, a plain widow, who overhears Julian make a comment about her being a \\"whey-faced widow.\\" She seeks the guidance of a famous courtesan and changes herself into a luring beauty in order to attend a masquerade ball and lure Julian into a evening of unforgettable sex and then leave him wanting. A change of costumes and mistaken identity cause Merriam instead to have an evening of passion with Drake, who has no idea about Merriam's plan, and wants nothing more then to find this sexy beauty after this unforgettable evening of intense pleasure. He discovers there is some connection with her to Julian and takes the wrong meaning of the connection and decides to take her as a mistress and use her as a means for revenge. Merriam agrees only because she is drawn to Drake, not knowing what is going on around her and that danger is building. As the eroctism and danger increases, the mystery unfolds to an intense and surprise ending. Renee Bernard's story and character development and ability to create a well-developed story around well-written, passionate, erotic sex scenes is perfection. This story has the main ingredient for intense passion - vengeance. A truly pleasurable read and a book difficult to put down. I am looking forward to many more erotic historicals by Renee Bernard."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I bought this book based on the customer reviews which are normally reliable. I am fond of explicit erotica/romance so I was looking forward to it. What a disappointment. This book is so badly written it is actually amusing. One lurid phrase comes comes after another so much so that it is totally unbelievable. The author obviously did no research into the period at all and it really shows. When describing a card game she goes into no detail about how the parties are playing. The hero and heroine engage in sex acts from the beginning. I have absolutely no problem with that but it does help to describe the hero so the reader has some idea about what he looks, sounds, smells like and that isn't done. I am so sick of writers referring to 'shafts'. There are plenty of other terms that can be used. What finally did me in was the constant reference to Drake's (the heros??) sperm as 'creme'. That term would be apt if Ms Bernard was describing the 'creme' that you put in coffee but the French do not use this term to describe sperm. If you want to read decent historical erotica, I suggest you try Lauren Holly, Cheryl Holt for really explicit stuff and Sabrina Jeffries, Kat Martin and Lisa Kleypas for less explicit but very erotic stuff. All writers have RESEARCHED their period AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY WRITE DIALOGUE to build up character which Ms Bernard didn't do in this book. The best of these are Lauren Holly's - she has written 2 historial novels to date and they are incredibly well researched and dense so that when the sex shows up (and it does very frequently) it is much more rewarding and real because you have a clear idea of the characters. This is the only book I had to put down because I simply had to give up reading it."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I couldn't actually believe I've read A Lady's Pleasure until the end! Actually I believe it because:- I don't have a lot of money to spend on books so I read what I buy- I kept hoping the hero would become less menacing once a hint of feelings would be inserted into the plot- Usually I like the hero once his bad/icy/mistrustful character is justified but in this case it was hard even to manage pity- I kept hoping the sex scenes' lack of feeling will be remedied (I mean, the first scene, when they didn't know each other, was warmer than the rest)The reviews promise something hot, testing the border of what's allowed in mainstream romance, blah blah. That is correct only if you judge it sex-scene-by-the-numbers kind of way, because while the acrobatics were different, the chemistry... well.. there was none. She kept thinking there's attraction but that's at best one-sided... There are authors out there who, using words, could turn the missionary into the ultimate sensual adventure or could at least plot more skillfully around the standard wallpaper plot: \\"bored spinster looking for an adventure/revenge/etc meets very-soon-to-be-reformed hard/bad/cruel rake whose comportment is excused in the last chapter by the death of someone dear\\" and this is why Renee Bernard was not a rewarding read. And because the hero is cold."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I have a friend who knows the author and highly recommended this (her debut) and the rest of the series. I am pretty picky but I like to give new authors a try. And I was pleasantly surprised.Like everyone has said...it is VERY steamy! I am used to such love scenes but not so many in one book. Not that I am complaining ;-)Although her story isn't as captivating as Judith McNaught, Lisa Kleypas, or Julia Quinn (my all time favs), it was very entertaining AND, most importantly, it was unique. I LOVE regency romance and it is hard to find any new plots. But the story of one daring night and how Merriam thought to tease one man but thoroughly seduced another was ingenious and amusing. Ms. Bernard's writing was such that I pictured myself in Merriam's position and could feel what she was feeling: shock, embarrassment, humiliation, fear, etc. And I was also so proud of how she gradually learned to stand up for herself and have self confidence after years of being degraded.Both characters were very well written, although Drake is a bit meloncholy for me...very Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre (another fav of mine) and their romance and passion was well written.The only real complaint I have is that the 2nd characters were a bit confusing. I kept mixing up Drake's best friend and the other prominant male character (forgetting his name). Also, the relationship between Drake and his \\"evil\\" ex-best friend is never really explained as well as I would have liked. I can't imagine being great friends with someone who tries to steal everything I have?I have bought Ms. Bernard's next 2 books in this series and greatly look forward to beginning book #2. Ya! for a new regency author to add to my collection!"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"It is hard to put a finger on it, but this book had a problem with the characters. It was a stretch that such a conformist like Merriam could just jump into furious sex with this guy like she had no control whatsover, even if she did want to shed her image of \\"Merriam the Mouse.\\" The love scenes were hot, I will give you that, but somehow I wanted more from these people. I wanted Merriam in the end to make him grovel a bit, and woo her before convincing her to marry him. Instead she says yes, right away. I also agree with the others observing her lack of knowledge of the time period. It did hold my interest to the end, thus the three star rating."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"This novel was just scrumptious. I loved it! It was hot too. Someone hand me an Aquafina.Merriam Everett is shy and unassuming, but decides to go for one adventure and seduces the enemy of the man that once jilted her. That man is Drake Sotherton. He's returned to avenge himself and he gets distracted by an encounter with Merriam.They find each other again and strike a deal to discover and explore the passion between them. There is a mystery in this story, but I hardly paid it any attention because of the sensual and fiery relationship developing between Merriam and Drake. You just start reading and focus on them, they are so hot together and so vivid. If a spicy, erotic romance is what you are looking for then read this book, but make sure you have a cold glass of water near, you are going to need it. ;D"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.

Would recommend it highly to anyone who loves a wonderful romantic and sensual story."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"\\"Oh my GOSH!\\" Talk about Hot, Sexy, and Sizzling. I read this book from cover to cover non-stop. The hero is sooooooooo sexy. Great sex scenes throughout the entire story. The heroine is a bit mousey. However, when it comes down to it she really gets loose. I enjoyed this so much I read it twice. Definately a keeper!"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I read this book straight through, even though it meant losing half my sleep for the night. But I couldn't help it. I was hooked from the first scene. I loved both main characters, as much for their flaws as their strengths, and the secondary characters were just as interesting. I would have thought that with this many love scenes (ooh, la, la:-), a book would have to lack plot because how could someone fit it all in? But this book had plenty of plot. I wasn't even sure who the killer was until the end. No boring beginning here, no sagging middle, no convenient ending; Ms. Bernard's debut is simply fantastic with plenty of mystery, plot, characterization and (need I say it?) scorching hot sex. I only just found out about her, thanks to a reader who mentioned her at Dear Author, but I've already got her 2nd book and will get the 3rd asap. She won't be able to write fast enough for me!"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"This book gets right into it, the first chapter is full of very hot sex which appears quite steadily throughout the story. But typically such steam falls apart without a good story, but fortunately this noval has. In a case of mistaken identity, the lead character Merriam Everett, a shy, conservative young widow, seduces the wrong man in an act of revenge at being called a \\"whey faced widow\\". Thus begins the mingling story lines as she goes through her normal daily routines eventually learning she did seduce the wrong man, and as the man she did seduce-Drake Sotherton-tries to figure out who she was. Until they meet and the sparks fly. This book had me chuckling, blushing, and reading on! And underneath it all was the on-going story of Drake and Julian (the man Merriam meant to seduce) - their painful shared past, and Drake's suspicions that somehow Julian and Merriam are in league together. A few times I did find myself skimming through some sex scenes as I really wanted to find out what happened next as 3 or 4 pages of passion was a bit of an interuption to that story. But overall, it more than met it's purpose to entertain! Can't wait to read more of her books!"},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I just read a first book by author Renee Bernard - A Lady's Pleasure. It is an erotica book but the book looks like a regular historical romance. OK, maybe it looks a bit spicy, but definitely readable at work with the cover art. In any event I absolutely loved it and strongly recommend this book.I kept being sucked in deeper and deeper, and by the time I was done was thrilled to have found a new must read author. I was disappointed that this was a first book, because I can't go immediately read everything else in the backlist, but excited to have found a newly published author I love. The secondary characters are wonderfully portrayed and their world seemed so real that I would be very surprised if there were not even more books in this series. (And the next one is due in August, 2007.) I did not realize when I first started the book that it was a racy one and those are my favorites. I am just thrilled in so many ways by this book."},{"Title":"A Lady's Pleasure","review":"I really liked how this book started out. Very interesting and different. It was a good read. Worth buying."},{"Title":"Wounds of the Spirit: Black Women, Violence, and Resistance Ethics","review":"Traci West accomplished something very difficult and very rare: she wrote a book that is very readable yet extremely smart; it is well researched, well argued, and engages current scholarly discussions, yet it is timely and has great political significance. &quot;Wounds of the Spirit&quot; engages deep and painful social and cultural structures and systemic injustices and does a very good job at showing some of the connections between the possibilities for resistance that already exist and some that may become possible in the future. This is a book about the cost of sexual violence that is written with intelligence, compassion, and a strong and clear activist intent. It benefits greatly from the author's relentless refusal to be pigeonholed as either too &quot;churchy&quot; or too &quot;academicy&quot; and her self-conscious reliance on the voices and wisdom of the women she interviewed and whose stories centrally inform her study. The result is a highly relevant study, written with the conviction that black women's lived reality can and does tell all of us something incredibly important about society, religion, and culture. Do read this book!"},{"Title":"Wounds of the Spirit: Black Women, Violence, and Resistance Ethics","review":"This book successfully attempts to do three things: (1) look at the impact of violence on black women, (2) shows the ways in which society and church covers up this problem, and (3) gives and ethic in order to create change with the church and society.First using narrative, West chronicles the lives of Black women as they struggle with various forms of violence. Especially troubling is the idea that violence does not exist for black women.This silence is enforced not just by men but by the structures in society which place how white women are affected by violence as the norm for how all women are affected. West analyzies how this happens in our society.She then outlines an ethic as to how the community can create change so that the issue og violence against black women can be understood and made to change.A must read for all church workers and those concerned about violence against women."},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","review":"puffy used to be good. now hes not doing to well. there are much better rapper such as DMX,Jay-Z just to name a few. i'm not trying to offend anyone but puffy used to be cool,but now hes just totally lost it. he can't dance or rap well either."},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","review":"Sean Combs is the best, he's so wonderfull!! his style is incredible!! i would like to write him, but i don't know his adress. if somebody can help me, i would be so happy..so please, if somebody has some information about his adress, please answer me to jackqueline88@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","review":"im a sean combs fan !!! i ainttrippin on puffy. in case you dont know what he says on his tapes aint the way he is. i thought he was fine cents i saw him rollin wit biggie. peple say he cant rap but theydont see that its not how you do it its what you say. i aintgot nothin but love for a goodblack man takin care of his kids and his girl!! ill tell you what when you walk in my room he is the first thing you see.hes worth the money i spend on him!!! ps justin and christion look just as good as he do!!"},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","review":"You all need recognize Puffy's talent as an entrepeneur, All of this Puffy hatin is brought on by jealousy and envy of those without the Bentley or iced out chains. ya'll sit around talkin' bad about Puffy and his riches but ya'll too lazy to get up and get it yourself, I'm 18, I started my first business when I was 15, through hard work and sacrifice ( i dropped out of college) I now have a 2000 Ram Truck and a 1990 Bentley Turbo T, yea, I bought it used, but it's still a bentley, I see the look in these haters eyes when I drive by, keep up Puffy , can't nobody stop you but yourself.Much Love!"},{"Title":"Gb Puff Daddy","review":"Hi Puffy, my name is Yvonne Gaskin I think you are so cute.

Thus the results are skewed. In business or science this would make the book untouchable by any serious reader. Indeed, it a perfect world it could cost the writer her chairs on various academic boards.This Amazon.com reviewer was a teacher in the Columbus, Ohio intercity school system. Now, America's intercity schools are some of the poorer schools in Western civilization. However, because of the vast pro-girl and pro-women infrastructure these schools at least gave women of color a fighting chance of getting a good education and going to college. The fact of life is African-American males do considerably poorer in academics than African-American women. African-American women do a better job of sticking together as a cohesive group than a similar group of males. These girls and future women can band together to meet future challenges. Think of it. Because of feminist writers, like Carol Gilligan, the number of women attending college is now over sixty percent at many colleges. However, you don't see Ms. Gilligan write about the vastly successful pro-girl education system in America. Why? She makes money saying things for girls are bad.Historically, I must give Author Carol Gilligan her due. Her writings are treated as gospel by the academic and media communities. It's puzzling to an informed educator of how her grossly incorrect conclusions have had such a massive impact upon the public mind."},{"Title":"Between Voice and Silence: Women and Girls, Race and Relationships","review":"lifes lessons and hard courses and choices are in this book. this book shows us how to deal with them all."},{"Title":"I Believe...

A lot of preparation should go into a guided hunt and this book answers the questions most hunters have about finding an outfitter, how to communicate with your guide, what to bring, what not to bring, and how to put together a budget. It even tackles the sticky subject of tipping. Don't be disappointed -- read this book before spending your hard earned money on the hunt of a lifetime. It really is an inexpensive insurance policy."},{"Title":"Power of the Runes Deck","review":"The artwork seems very true to the traditional meaning of the runes very much! With scenes that do a great job of showing the runes within there cultural system properly in most cases. Certainly the best set of runecards i have seem. The only card that really misses i think is Mannaz (it just looks very vague). All the rest hit exactly on! The only other complaints i have are things that are not true to the Old Norse culture; such as in Jera the clothes the people are wearing looks more like what farmers in the 19th century or later would be wearing (seperate tops and long skirts for the women). Also on Ingwaz the god Inge-Frey has small horns (as in the wiccan horned-god idea) which is incorrect for Frey to have. He is not the same as the Wiccan idea of the horned god. Another thing i don't like; in Ehwaz the rider of the horse has cheesy horns on his helmet. No vikings EVER had horns on there helmets! But i must say, all the cards are stunning and VERY intense and powerfull! They really reflect the meanings of the runes in a amazing way! I wholely recommend these cards to anyone! They have a VERY Old Norse feel and vib to them (except those things i noted)! :)"},{"Title":"Power of the Runes Deck","review":"This deck is among the most stirring rune decks that I have in my collection.The images are nothing short of breath taking, and excellently inspired.If they had full sized movie posters of these cards for sale, I would buy each and every one of them.The price is wonderful.The information booklet leaves a wee bit to be desired, but with many other fine volumes available, this point is negligible.in closing I would highly recommend this deck for anyone with an eye forartwork as well as an interest in divination."},{"Title":"Power of the Runes Deck","review":"I usually prefer to read the runes as stones, wood carvings, and other methods but if you're looking for a deck of cards with the runes this is a good deck. The accompanying book is very basic, and they include an extra card with Yr which is not part of the Elder Futhark. The card artwork is very good and the names of the runes are spelled out in runes at the top of the card, which is a great touch leading towards deeper understanding of the rune. Overall, very good."},{"Title":"Power of the Runes Deck","review":"This is a great deck, drawn largely from the works of Thorsson and other contemporary but serious writers on the subject. The imagery is beautiful, stirring, and inspiring. The artist has clearly internalized the tradition and added a great deal of integration to the imagery that occurs in much of the contemporary literature. Yet the artist's voice is not lost either, and despite the fact that my own understanding often diverges from the artists, I have chosen to replace this deck.This is a worthy deck."},{"Title":"Power of the Runes Deck","review":"I was not expecting what I received with this deck!

In Uruz there is a Auroh (very powerfull looking!) with green energys radiating from him. Thor's about to bash a Thursor (can see the Thursor's shadow) with his hammer in Thurisaz. Ansuz has Odin playing a harp outdoors with his Ravens around (one on his shoulder; the other flying) and a drinking horn nearby (maybe he's sipping on Otherier between playing?) and on the ground a Fly-Algeric mushroom grows in one spot. In Raidho Thor is flying across the sky on his cart drawn by his two goats. In Kenaz Wyland (or a smith anyways) is working on making something from a long round peice of metal. In Gebo a couple is naked sitting on a rock intertwined together so as to form the rune Gebo with there bodys intensely having sex (you even see there sweat). There is a energy connection between there heads too. In Wunjo this is inside a Old Norse house. A Old Norse family is hanging out and drinking and making merry together. Hagalaz has a misterious hooded figure (maybe Hulda?) standing before a tree(Yggdrasil) with a fire cauldron before her (can't see her face or anything but get the impression it's a ancient female figure under the dark hooded robes). There is snow at the base of the tree around the area where the fire is. Above is outerspace. She (the figure in the card) is working with some sort of energys of formation which acually is rediating energys that form the younger form of the Hagalaz rune. One part of the rediated energys goes to the fire pool. The opposite part goes to this valknot in the air before the tree. There is a worm (snake) coiled around the tree biting it's own tail. In Nauthiz there are three people on a raft out at sea in a storm. They are ragged with there clothes shreaded. This raft has a really tattered sail which forms the runes shape. Up ahead in a clearing of the storm is some land. In Isa there is a frozen human frozen in ice with a Frost-Giant holding onto the block of ice the human is in and exaiming it. A beam of energy is coming from above to the frozen person's ice (maybe either forming the ice or melting it?). In Jera there are farmers bringing in the harvest of grain. Some are in the process of cutting the grain. Others are on break and enjoying some of the food that is aviable right now. In Eihwaz there is Ullr with his bow and his skies are up against a Yew tree which he has his back to. His shield also lays against the tree. He has caught and killed a boar which he has one foot upon. There is snow all about the scene and it is clearly winter. In Perthro there are the three Norns with spinning wheel and one has some runic staves which she has cast with a drinking horn which she is reading. The other two are working at weaving the thread from the wheel. They are at the very base of a tremendious tree (can only see just the root base of one small part of it as it's so big). There are tree moons in the sky. One waning, one full, one waxing. There is a well in back of them. It looks like the source of the material they are using to weave the thread comes from somewhere above on the tree maybe. In Elhaz there is the Valkerie naked riding a huge Elk. She has a spear and a small shield. She has on a winged helmet and those kind of sandles that tie all up the lower leg with strap. That's all she wears. In the background is the Rainbow Bridge arching down to the ground from the unknown. There are three swans flying around. In Sowilo there is Sigurd the hero with sword upraised and he has shield. he stands upon the top of some moutain and there are all these moutains below in the horizen. Above Sunna shines brightly in the sky. You can see her face on the sun and it's for sure a her! In Tiwaz there is a feirce battle going on in the background. In the foreground there is the Irimisal column with someone (maybe Tyr with both hands?) tied to it. in front of him is a warrior killing another warrior. the warrior being killed has a broken sword. Above all this is one bright star in the night stary sky. In Berkano we are in a forest scene with Birch trees. There are ferns and soft green-ness to the floor of the forest. Some mushrooms grow about. There is a naked green lady (everything about her is green) feeding a normal human colored baby from one of her breasts. She is knealed down on the soft forest vegatation. In the background is an old crone lady with hooded robes (but we can see her face) watching them. The crone seems like she is protective of them. She has a short walking stick which she leans on as she watches from back in the forest. In Ehwaz there is a horse with rider (with horns on his helmet *boo*). The rider has a shield with the rune carved into the boss of it. In the energy aura of the horse (which has 4 physical legs) we see that is may have 8 legs in it's aura form. The Mannaz card does not seem to say much of anything of all the cards. There is a person (not sure if they are male or female) standing on some hill area. It's a dark gloomy sky with red patterns in the sky (maybe it's when the sun is setting?) There is a sun going down at level with this persons head. This person has there arms up and back so that there forearms disapear in back of there head (why?). Way in the background are two rows of mountains that vanish at there base into some clouds. This card is the only one that does not speak. It's so vargue. In Laguz there is a baby in the position of one still in the mother (with cord still) but it floats in the cosmic waters. There is thunder feeding the baby energywise. The deeper section of this cosmic sea is outerspace with Earth in the distance. In Ingwaz it shows Inge-frey first buried deep in the earth (can see a cut-away of below the survice of the land)..........."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"The spook who sat by the door should be required reading for any man of color.

It highlights deep social and political issues: &quot;black-on-black&quot; crime; the emergence of social revolutionary philosophy (in the vain of Bobby Seale or George Jackson); and yes, even quotas.

They taught him everything he knew and pretended he didn't exist because Dan Freedom was Black. It must have been a slap in the face for everyone when they found out that there safe guards didn't work. When one leader falls another one is there to take his place.

If the Soviets hadn't recruited an army of Black terrorists by 1975, chances were they never would.The Spook Who Sat By The Door is essentially a dystopaian novel under just that kind of premise, but this time it's internal; what would happen if the CIA trained a Black man as a secret agent, and he used what he'd learned to destroy them? Dan Freeman is recruited into the CIA, not on the basis of talent, but because it's election time. A patronizing pseudo-liberal senator needs a gimmick to get Black votes, and what could be better than integration of the CIA? He's certain he'll gain the support of the NAACP and the CORE with a big splash in the papers, \\"Senator Stanley McLiberal demands Black trainee for CIA.\\" And get them in they do, but only Freeman passes the course. It turns out he's extremely qualified for the job; college grad, army officer, combat veteran, martial artist, etc. He refuses to associate with his laid-back Southern classmates, none of whom last the month. He trains hard, practicing his marksmanship on his own time, going out of his way to be the best at everything there is to know in the CIA; weapons, ordnance, communications, propaganda. Then of course he goes back to Chicago, recruits street gangs for a terrorist organization, and all hell breaks loose.I'm told this novel caused a big stir in the 70's, but today it appears forgotten. It's not included in any collections of African American literature, and the only copy I could find was almost 20 years old. Sam Greenlee had been in the US foreign service, but unlike the character in the book, he got sent overseas and was in Baghdad during the 1958 revolution. Perhaps the book might seem dated to some, with no mention of computers or cell phones. There's also a generational gap in the music styles; Freeman listens to John Coltrain and Miles Davis, while today's young people would be into hip-hop and R&B.; The late 1960's \\"summers of rage,\\" where America's cities burned, is not as familiar to young people today.There are some funny aspects to this book. The street gangs play all kind of pranks on the police and the National Guard; they rob an armory, kidnap a General, play cat-and-mouse with the National Guardsmen, broadcast calls to arms from a cassette player mounted on the El, and when the Guardsmen try to take it down, they find too late that it's booby-trapped. First the police can't handle it, then the National Guard comes in, and the National Guard are all weekend servicemen whose \\"stand and fight\\" training is useless in an urban setting. The General, despite his bravado, is unqualified for a combat role, and finds that his regiment are really just trained to march in parades. It reminded me of the book \\"First Blood\\" where a battle-hardened Green Beret wipes out these weekend warriors. The scene where the kidnapped General is found babbling reminds us of a scene from Ralph Bakshi's \\"Coonskin.\\"It's time this book were brought back to light. It's a great parable on what the USA was at the time; a racially charged environment full of angry young people and adults who hated them."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"I did not know what to really expect from this book.

As a person who loves controversy, this book really hit the spot. It always amazes me that books that talk about corruption and racism within the government are published but others don't believe that these things really do exist. The way Dan was able to infiltrate the CIA and move up in ranks and remain hidden was just shocking. I really would recommend this book to anyone that doesn't believe that racism and corruption in the government exists."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"This book is an excellent example of revolutionary literature. The author presents a character that manipulates our perceptions about the ideal hero, anti-hero, and antagonist all to satisfy an agenda set on puting power and courage back in the hands of the people. It really makes you wonder about the apperances and the assumptions we all make based upon what people allow us to see about themselves.The beauty of this book rests in the realization that you never really know the motivation behind the actions of some people. There really could be a &quot;spook&quot; working with the President or on an executive board with a major corporation that is planning to unleash the fury of a downtrodden socio-econmic class and show what potential is being wasted on street corners and in jails in every city and the consequences of turning a blind eye to the people that bear the brunt of society's worst hypocricy- equal opportunity."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"I am not a person who reads alot of books but this book was a rare exception, I read the whole book in one night.

But then he left the CIA within a few chapters and I was like &quot;What?&quot; The rest of the book...? I really don't know what rating to give this book. I don't agree with killing for freedom but at the same time, I ironically understood many of Freeman's decisions. I can't give this book five stars because I don't agree with the overall turn-out of the book, but I would have to give it four and a half because it was a page-turner, interesting, intriguing, enlightening, and educational.

However, the author made his protagonist Freeman an employee of the clandestine agency, the CIA. It's the late 1950s and early 1960s. Freeman quits the CIA, disgusted with the prejudice and careerism in the bureaucracy, and goes back home to Chicago to be a community organizer, where he uses the \\"agitprop\\" (agitate and propagandize) techniques he's learned to radicalize and push for civil rights. The novel is a send-up of the establishment keeping down the poor-and-stuck on the domestic front. I also read it as the fictionalization of what Greenlee absorbed from his embassy post as a foreign service officer, observing the operations of U.S. (and other countries, too) personnel applying similar tactics against political groups."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"I had an excellent transaction with this seller.

He was strong and a leader."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"This novel, written in the 80s (and later made into a movie by the same name), answers the question: What would happen if a modern black hero/CIA agent built a guerrilla army made up of black inner city street gangs, and incited armed insurrection in America among them?The novel's protagonist and hero is a super-square yuppy, Ivy-league trained, black spy, who just happens to have also been the first black CIA Agent. His job as a spy was to monitor community-based radicals from a non-profit CIA storefront in an inner city black Chicago neighborhood. However, the whole time the CIA thought he was spying on community radicals, he was in fact actually assuming the role of a double agent training and helping to foment black revolutionary aims in the inner city.After he left the CIA, he succeeded in teaching street gangs all of the tools of normal CIA spy tradecraft and set up revolutionary cells in Chicago that were eventually replicated across the country's inner cities. And although he was eventually caught up with and killed, his martyrdom, incited riots in ghettoes across the country. Over night, America literally became James Baldwin's \\"the fire next time.\\" Black people took to the streets to redress century old grievances.The significance of the novel today in our post-modern \\"post-racial\\" times is that it recalls from deep within the white subconscious one of white America's rawest psychic fears: a revenge movement on the part of blacks to get back at whites for a half millennium of slavery and discrimination. At least up through the riots of the Civil Right's era, this was more than just a palpable fear.But a second reason this idea still has currency is that at least one author, Webster Tarpley, a well-known conspiracy theorist, in his book about Obama, (The Unauthorized Biography of Barack Obama (BHO)) theorizes that BHO has been a \\"controlled agent\\" of the plutocrats, who was also \\"sheep-dipped\\" in intelligence as a Chicago community organizer. Now, that he has been elected President, Tarpley in his book worries and wonders out loud whether Obama may indeed become a real modern day \\"spook who sat by the door.\\"Given the way BHO has condemned and lambasted black men as a whole, and especially those within the inner cities, I believe Tarpley's fears are misguided. The real fear is whether or not BHO is being used in exactly the way the plutocrats intended for him to be used: To advance the plutocratic agenda. Tarpley can rest assured that the limp-wristed President we have in the Oval Office today will not rise to the level of being another \\"Spook who sat by the Door.\\" An insightful book even though its material is finally dated.

Finally, I heard an interview with the author on radio: Not one much for fiction, this book is an exception because of its impact upon media stereotype (Africans in the New World etc); However, the interview with Sam Greenley, was key in relation to what happened to many of the people involved with the making of the film: the involvement of the FBI with Hollywood to recoup their investment then confiscate all but two copies! Mr. Greenley became a cab driver (was an educator I believe), actors like Paula Kelly could'nt work in the industry for years.I recommend this book (screenplay done by author but book is much better)to the USA, for it is classic unspoken Americana, and currently \\"on stage\\" elsewhere today."},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"I must have read this great book 35 years ago and it still pops up in my memory from time to time.

The beginning gives no indication of what the ending has in store. Read it and have fun!!!"},{"Title":"The Spook Who Sat By the Door","review":"The book is quite interesting--definitely a page turner. It serves as a very fascinating exploration of the political outlook it presents. Hard truths continually hit you with regard the portrayal not just of establishment Whites, but also of liberal Whites and middle class Blacks.I do have to take away a star based about the actual revolution plot itself, though. Many aspects of its execution require a signficant suspension of disbelief. And its goals are never detailed by the Freeman character to his soldiers, nor to the reader by Greenlee, beyond to &quot;be free&quot;, to &quot;make Whitey stop messing with us&quot; and to &quot;make Whitey choose between global interventionist policies (e.g. Vietnam) and continuing to oppress us&quot;.Um . . . OK . . . so what does that mean? U.S. military policy has long been readiness to fight two major wars on two different fronts. How do various guerilla uprisings suddenly force such a choice? And even if they do, who's to say the choice wouldn't just be to concentrate on cracking down on Blacks? And even if that weren't the choice, what exactly constitutes a victory? Do Blacks run their own neighborhoods independent of any governmental authority that has Whites in it? Black neighborhoods secede for city, state or federal government control? Or do we all move to one place and the fed governemtn turns the land over to us for our own independent nation? Or do we expect that at the end of the rebellion Whites will just magically stop being racists because we've shown we fight back?Just HOW will things be different at the end of the successful guerilla campaign? We will be &quot;free&quot;. But what does that mean? What are the precise specific objectives. You don't undertake a war without some sort of measure in that regard and that is never given to us in this novel.All that said though, the rest of the story elements are compelling and certainly make the book worth a read.

Karenga once wrote that, \\"The negro was made and manufactured in America\\" and it has long been the belief of white people that they have \\"their negroes\\" under control. Because of the wholesale sellouts that left the streets following federal jobs in the post-riot sixties, far too many people in trouble think that most blacks have assimilated. This book will put the lie to that pronouncement. Simply, a brother gets into the system and doesn't become OF it. He works during day, trains revolutionaries and plans by night. Although he doesn't live to see his dream come true, it is his tireless work that brings the inevitable revolution into fruition. For people who are serious about struggle and organizing, this book should be read.

There are three original marbled papers glued into the booklet, the largest by Diane Maurer and the two smaller examples by Paul Maurer (at least, in my copy). They are signed underneath the actual artwork, in pencil or crayon. I was delighted to find these original works of art in this edition of the booklet, after ordering it blind.The contents of the booklet are divided into a two-page introduction and history of marbling, followed by sections on how to create these lovely patterned sheets of paper or cloth: \\"Materials and Equipment;\\" \\"Preparing to Marble;\\" \\"Applying the Color;\\" \\"Pattern-Making Concepts;\\" \\"Making the Print;\\" \\"Traditional Patterns;\\" and \\"Other Design Techniques.\\" The booklet closes with a list of suppliers and a short bibliography.Marbling can be a tricky technique, and the authors share their expertise on constructing your own tray, rinse board, skim board, whisks, and patterning tools. They go into detail about your workspace, e.g. no direct sunlight, no air conditioning, no dust, cool (50-65 degrees F.), as the size where you are going to float your colors can be quite finicky. The pattern-making concepts in this booklet are very easy to follow, and the authors also include examples of what happens when problems like air bubbles or a paper shift occur.The paper used for marbling has to sprayed with an alum solution first so that it will retain the colored patterns on top of the size. My first and biggest mistake was to allow these sheets to buckle while they were drying. It is very hard to place a warped piece of paper flat on top of the size---not that the authors didn't warn me about this problem!If you have fallen in love with the beautiful patterns that can be created through this antique art, this is an excellent booklet with which to begin your apprenticeship. Make sure you get a copy with the Maurers' art work still glued within the booklet!"},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"Everybody is familiar with at least some part of the Lancelot -King Arthur-Guinevere story, but when authors write about it, the novels almost always focus on King Arthur or Guinevere. It's about time someone wrote about Lancelot and portrayed him as something other than an adulterer.The research that's gone into this book is truly amazing. Every detail feels real and that's only helped by Ed Beard's fantastic cover painting and Ron Rousselle's wonderful pen-and-ink drawings which grace the interior of the book.In this version of the legend, Lancelot and Guinever are childhood friends, raised together by the Lady on the isle of what is probably Avalon, although it's never specified as such. Their other childhood companions included Gawain and Galehaut. This latter character is another historical figure who is often overlooked in the legends. His friendship with Lancelot borders on devotional and it's a real pleasure to see a companionable friendship with such depth portrayed within the context of this legend.The King Arthur of this novel is much more the warlord and much less the godlike figure that most writers seem compelled to portray. His marriage to Guinever has less to do with love than it does to do with securing a strong military position in the north and expanding the sphere of his influence.The book, which includes an incredible chapter recounting Lancelot's childhood with the Lady, comes into focus when the main characters are adults and Arthur is duped by a scheming Regina -- Guinevere's half-sister -- into thinking that the woman he's married is not the true Guinevere, despite all evidence to the contrary. When Arthur tries to install Regina on the throne, chaos errupts and threatens the fellowship (a.k.a. the Round Table although it's not called that here).This legend of the False Guinevere is just as prevelent in the lore and mythology as the other legends of this time period, but since it's an often overlooked one, it makes for a great retelling.If you're looking for something that is truly set apart from the same old Arthur-as-God motif, you'll love this book. It's beautifully written and fully realized and is one of the best novels about this time I've ever read."},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"Be warned right now: This book is not for the &quot;lazy&quot; reader. You will be fully transported into this other world of knights, quests and all-consuming love affairs. This is by far one of the most detailed, rich and historically accurate tales of this time period I have ever read -- and as a history major I've read a lot. The story draws on some of the most rare of the stories involving Lance, Gwen and the King. It is a must-read for anyone who loves this myth. HOWEVER, don't be caught off guard: This is a retelling for GLBT readers and other open-minded folks. If you don't know what I mean then here's another hint: There's a &quot;Crying Game&quot; type of secret about that handsome young Lance... and a heck of a lot more to &quot;his&quot; relationship with the Queen than most might think. A GREAT read. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"All my life I've dreamed of living in the *real* Arthur's court and wondered what it was like. Not the medieval version so many writers fall back on, but the post-Roman Britain when the Warlord Arthur and his clan really lived. This book made me feel like I was there. The detail is amazing; the story so moving and real I even dreamed about the book at night! If you think you've read all there is to read about Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot, you haven't. READ THIS!"},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"Okay, first of all, the original &quot;legend of King Arthur&quot; is more like this book than the one everyone is accustomed to hearing.In the eleventh century Eleanor d'Aquitaine, an English queen, had the story of King Arthur (who was actually, historically speaking, probably not even a king), &quot;remade&quot; into something that sounded better and that introduced chivalry, courage, etc: the traditional knight's story. But that oh so beautiful story that everyone loves oh so much is a nonexistent fairy tale. Whoever is saying that this book ruins their beautiful story obviously doesn't know much in the way of history. This story is one of the first that has enough courage to gainsay the &quot;traditional&quot; Arthurian legend and portray the characters as actually human. If you're looking for a realistic, honestly good, and not hopelessly sappy book, I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"I opened this book expecting a retelling of the King Arthur story from Lancelot's point of view. I got a story that had almost nothing to do with the King Arthur legends except in the names of the characters.I got a story where Arthur and Lancelot were not, nor were they ever friends, and Guinivere and Arthur were not in love. I have read a great many of the King Arthur legends and was shocked to read this one. One of the items that makes the story of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot so intriguing is that it is a love triangle. All involved are supposed to love each other thereby making it a tragedy. In this book, instead of the legendary tragedy, it was portrayed as someone who loves a woman who is married to a heartless man.I found neither the depth nor the content that I expected. I wanted to know what Lancelot thought about Morgan and Mordred, about his comradarie for his king, his quest for the Holy Grail, his son Galahad. Morgan and Mordred were mentioned once or twice, King Arthur and Lancelot barely spoke, Lancelot never sired a child, and the Holy Grail was never mentioned.In addition to what the book was about, I found the sentences and phrases mundane and hard to follow. I thought it was a book by a teenager because of some of the phrases and the many descriptions and references to sex, none of which were exciting in any capacity.In short, I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you are looking for a telling of the King Arthur legends from different perspectives, I would read at Bradley's book, &quot;The Mists of Avalon.&quot; I have never found another book about Arthur which comes close to the depth and amazing cadence of The Mists of Avalon."},{"Title":"Queen's Champion: The Legend of Lancelot Retold","review":"I love stories of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelet. It's the most beautiful, romantic love triangle ever told. I am so disappointed in this book. This author just butchered all the historical characters I have come to love. What's left is a mean, grumpy King Arthur, a very dull queen, and a sappy knight. And the ending??? I am very open minded, and love a good twist on a story, but frankly, this book just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. If you're looking for a new perspective of this classic tale, read Bradley's The Mists of Avalon."},{"Title":"Global Road Warrior for France","review":"Horrible, one page of content and all the links are broken.

Not only do neighbors say that their new house is haunted, but they also say that there's a treasure!Pete, Pam, Ricky, Holly and Sue must solve these mysteries, and many more. They have the help of their parents and their faithful Collie dog named Zip. In the midst of meeting new friends and exploring their new home, the Happy Hollisters find themselves in the middle of one adventure after another. In the process of solving these mysteries, they explore their town, meet neighbors, find new friends and discover clues that help them solve the many mysteries. The brave Hollisters must also face many new dangers in their new home. The family's adventures will keep you turning the page and it will be difficult to put the book down.If your children are not yet acquainted with the books, The Happy Hollisters is a good book to introduce the series. While the series can be picked up with nearly any of the books, the first one introduces the characters and gives a lot of details that will make reading the other books more enjoyable. It's also a hard book to put down and will help to pique your children's interest in the other books in the series."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I had a similar experience with the Happy Hollisters, but I had only 2 H.H. books as a child. I thought that was all there were. Imagine my surprise and delight at discovering there are 33 total! I've done some research, and have found out that Jerry West was a pen name only. Most of the books were written by the same person, a couple of them were not. The books came from the same publisher as Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and other children's series books. Quite a bit of information about the Happy Hollisters is available on the internet, including a full list of all H.H. books published. I'm determined to have the whole collection eventually!!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"When I was in grade school, I brought a report card home that showed a &quot;D&quot; in one of my classes (I forget which one). This was unacceptable (does anyone remember those days?)and my father restricted me to my room for the entire next marking period - 9 weeks! I couldn't come out of my room except to go to school, eat and go to the bathroom. There was no TV, stereo, computer or other electronic toys in my room because this was when color TV was still a big deal. I read the entire sets of Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys and Happy Hollister mysteries twice through. And I loved slipping away to Shoreham, VT to explore the world with the Hollister family. I have even visited Shoreham, VT (a real place on Route 7 on the western side of Vermont) and wished I could've had a copy of one of their mysteries to see if I could identify actual road names and locations. It's a beautiful little town and the books really reflect the sleepy town feel. I love these mysteries and wish I could purchase the entire set. If Mr. West is reading this, please let me know how I can obtain the whole set!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I remember as a child in the 70's reading the Happy Hollister series and I only wish I still had the books to share with my 3 children now.

Wonderful, wonderful books.!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I wrote my original review for this book back in the August 2005. It was somewhat difficult to obtain books in this series at that time. Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III, grandson of the author, and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations.Andrew E. Svenson wrote the 33 books in this series between approximately 1953 and 1970. This particular book was the introduction to the series. The reprint has the illustrations and text of the original hardback books. Even better, the reprints are now available as Kindle books.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book. Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. In this introductory book the family is moving to Shoreham. During their trip a van carrying the children's toys is stolen. The van is also carrying valuable papers for their father. As the story unfolds, the children believe someone is entering their house. Mr. Hollister does not believe the children, but after Pete gets a picture of a strange man with a red hat in their basement, Mr. Hollister gets the police involved.We also meet mean Joey Brill in this book. Joey is a recurring character in this series. Joey is a bully and is generally obnoxious. As one example, Joey puts White Nose and her kittens on a plank in a lake. Rest assured that someone nearly always thwarts Joey in his attempts to be a bad kid.The story finally arrives at an exciting chase between boats and a mysterious discovery in the Hollister's new house. There seems to be a lot of danger for everyone, but rest assured that everything comes out okay in the end.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.While the original hardback books have become somewhat difficult to find, this edition is available once again as a paperback and a Kindle edition. With continued interest, perhaps the Svenson family will be able to reprint the entire series and entertain another generation or two of children. Even if my grandchildren do not find these books interesting, I still love them!I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I wish I could find my former school librarian in Dorval, Quebec, Canada (early 1970's) and let her know the tremendous impact her dedication to her job had on my life. I was in 3rd grade, it was during library period, and I was wandering around looking for a book to check out. She, sensing my interest in books, directed me to a shelf containing the library's collection of Happy Hollisters. I wasn't too interested at first, but with her encouragement I agreed to try one. Many years later, at 42 years of age, not only do I still enjoy reading them, but I have read them to both my girls (12 & 17), and I have been fortunate enough to collect 2 complete series over the years. When my daughters leave home, they will both have a set to read to their children.I also discovered, when dating my wife, that she too had read and enjoyed the series. We were both amazed that there was somebody else out there who had heard of and loved the HH.If you've read the books, you don't need me to tell you how wonderful they are. If you haven't read them yet, the comments on this page will let you know why you should. I can only agree and endorse what has been said here.I have read many books in my life, and my reading level is much more sophisticated today. But every now and then, I grab a Happy Hollisters book from the shelf, and I'm a little kid once more in the sanctuary of the school library, returning to a simpler day, when there was still much magic and wonder to be found in the world.I think my librarian would be pleased."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I was reluctant to submit a review as there's little I can add to the warm and wonderful praise already found here, but I've no qualms in writing what amounts to a love letter to these books and their creators. I first encountered these books in the mid-1960's --- an unexpected birthday gift subscription to the Happy Hollisters (Doubleday) Book Club. To this tough little Brooklyn tyke, who much preferred 'Famous Monsters' magazine at the time, the titles of the various volumes intrigued me enough to dip into one after simply shelving and avoiding them once they arrived, and I was soon hooked! True, there were far greater thrills to be found on television or the aforementioned monster magazines, but in retrospect I think the allure to a city kid without siblings was the decidely exotic notion of a large family living in a beautiful suburb in a rambling (to use West's description!) old house set upon a lakeshore who then had the audacity to leave this perfect world on an alarmingly regular basis --- to seek out adventure! Could life really be so wonderful? West's books convinced me it could be, and surely sparked my interest in travel to far flung places quite beyond the crowded city streets that composed my world at the time.Another reader boldly declared the sensory pleasures of these books --- and how right he was! They had a unique scent all their own, and I still vividly recall the feel of the deckled page ends and the pebble texture of the bright red covers beneath the jacket too. (I always removed the covers while reading the books to keep them neat and clean --- a habit which surprised my Mom to no end.)It's all so long ago --- but small fragments of the books come to me easily while thinking about them now: The hateful neighborhood bully Jerry Brill, Mr. Hollister's American-Indian employee (who's name I can't recall, sadly) at his store, 'The Trading Post,' the Hollister's wide and varied assortment of relatives who's visit invariably heralded the start of an adventure, White Nose and her kittens (who remained kittens for the entire run of the series as far as I know) --- oh, I could go on and on. Who can forget the Hollisters arriving in NYC in a helicopter during a storm and landing atop the roof of what turned out to be their hotel? Or the hapless boy who's life was in such turmoil that he took to the Shoreham river in a rickety boat, prompting a massive seach? Well, to go on is pointless --- I know anyone who reads this can add their own memories to this list.A year or so into reading the books, I wrote a fan letter to Mr. West that couldn't have amounted to more than gibberish, but wouldn't you know --- he took the time to type out a very personal reply on special stationary emblazoned with illustrations of the Hollister kids, to thank me for writing to him and (I still find this curious but lovely) to urge me to explore other books and authors as well. A gracious author and gentleman in every sense of the word.The world has indeed moved on since then in dangerous and unexpected directions, but if one >can&lt; go home again --- albeit briefly, I know I'll enjoy visiting that rambling home on the shore of lake. Another time, another place --- but forever \\"home\\" in more ways than one."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I read all the Happy Hollister books when I was a child, and my 9 year old just finished reading this one.

The boxes arrived for my brother (who is six years older) and lay ignored. It would be eight years before they would be handed down to the little sister and finally receive the appreciation they deserved. They lived in my reading nook- my closet floor (with it's pillows and flashlights the mysteries became more thrilling and intense for me). Many moves later the books departed from life via a yardsale. Forward my life to the arrival of my own kids. I began finding these books online. I completed collecting the entire collection sharing them with my kids only to receive news that we were to move across country to WA state. This collection is still in a box waiting to ship to me; and after five years my patience is wore out. Last summer I was at a yard sale and saw 30 Happy Hollister books with dust jackets in like-new condition. Most had never been read. My treasure! I now own the first 30 books with jackets for less than ten dollars. My kids have read all of the books. This is a treasury of stories that will be enjoyed by many generations. I also owned the Bobbsey Twins; and prefer the Happy Hollisters! Happy reading to all!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"This is more than \\"memory lane\\" but a series that has children learning right from wrong and to accept responsibility for their actions not to mention learning from mistakes. You will even find them doing things they are responsible for before continuing their sleuthing (prioritizing). The stories end in the '60's, not '50's (yet, they are timeless). The titles are \\"safe\\" to give children / grandchildren unlike some so called modern children's titles out there that have crass content, at best, but are not previewed by parents / grandparents. The Happy Hollister's series are stories that contain good character examples with children learning to work for things and not just expect things without personal and honest effort. They also exhibit self sacrifice for the benefit of others. I am glad that the titles are being reprinted without editing to include Kindle versions by the late author's family."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I have fond memories of the Happy Hollisters from my childhood!

I have to admit they seem so goody-too-shoes it's a bit thick at times. It just shows you how much of our and our childrens innocence has been replaced with more mature material. The Hollister's were very real to me as a child. I could lose myself in these stories for hours and hours, wondering if these kids were real and if I could ever meet them. If these stories were updated, they would make great reading for todays young readers."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I picked up a copy of this at the suggestion of an Amazon reviewer. It is exceedingly difficult to find good books, especially a series of books, for a very discerning six-year old boy (now seven). A book published in the 1950's -- I figured it's stood the test of time.My son would not read the book past the first 3 or 4 pages. But it was a little advanced for a six-year old so I suggested that I read the book and he listen. No go. He couldn't even sit through the first chapter. He never did read or listen to the story.So I decided to read it myself instead. I was pretty excited to find a children's classic. And having read it, I can say that it is a good, idealized snapshot of the 50's family life. Pretty much, the back cover says it all: \\"Mrs. Hollister is always ready to meet any sudden need -- for a surprise picnic or a helping hand. [Mr. Hollister] is never too busy to play ball.\\"But the writing itself is fairly mediocre and stuff of pulp fiction. There are lots of energetic adjectives (e.g. \\"peppy\\" collie, \\"sparkling\\" blue eyes, \\"lively\\" salesmen) and exclamation points. The story itself isn't terribly interesting but everyone cries out, exclaims, gasps, shouts, etc. to create the feeling of excitement. I liken it to canned laughter on TV sitcoms. The plot is somewhat thin. In one instance, Pete just so happens to sell the most expensive canoe in his father's shop while filling in for his dad. And as it happens, the man also turns up at the river when Pete and the gang find themselves in trouble. After rescuing them, the canoe man disappears for good from the story, having served his purpose.Also, the characters are rather one-dimensional. Joey Brill, the antagonist, is consistently and inexplicably bad. He smashes store merchandise and releases the brakes on an incline-parked car for no apparent reason but to be a menace. In the latter incident Joey, in an attempt to avoid punishment, convinces his parents that he is ill and forces them to return home early from their holiday. And even the motel owner tells Pete that he is happy to see Joey go. It just doesn't make for an interesting story with complex characters.So, to new readers to the series, I would not recommend it. Others who remember it from their childhood, it's probably a nice trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"Fun, simpler times story reminiscent of Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys.

At the time of my review, it was somewhat difficult to obtain to obtain books in this series. Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations. Andrew E. Svenson III is the grandson of the author.This particular book was the third in the series. The reprint has the illustrations and text of the original hardback books. Even better, the reprint is available as a Kindle book.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book. Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. In this book the children receive a ceramic lighthouse from their Uncle Russ. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, their collie Zip accidentally knocks the lighthouse to the floor, breaking it. When the children examine the broken lighthouse, they discover a genuine emerald. Uncle Russ purchased the lighthouse at Sea Gull Beach and soon the Hollister family is off to visit Uncle Russ.When the children get to Sea Gull Beach they learn that a pirate ship called the Mystery disappeared during a storm somewhere near Sea Gull Beach, and treasure hunters had been searching for the ship ever since. The children soon encounter Homer Ruffly and his father, who is mean and is leading a treasure hunting expedition for the Mystery.Though the children are not actually searching for the pirate ship, they seem to encounter items from the ship at every turn. Homer Ruffly follows them around and does mean things to the children constantly, accusing them of stealing things that Homer claims rightfully belong to his father, when in fact the items belong to the Hollisters.The Hollister children do have a lot of fun on their trip. They take boat rides on the ocean, enter a kite flying contest, and fly in a helicopter, along with hunting for the pirate ship Mystery. The pirate theme of this Hollister book is all in good fun and younger children should be amused by the story.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.While the original hardback books have become somewhat difficult to find, as I noted above, this edition is available once again as a paperback and a Kindle edition. With continued interest, perhaps the Svenson family will be able to reprint the entire series and entertain another generation or two of children. Even if my grandchildren do not find these books interesting, I still love them!I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Whistle-Pig Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 28)","review":"I just have to say that as a kid, I loved these books.

This collection of books brings back great memories of all the time I spent reading and pretending I was part of the Happy Hollister family.

At the time of my review, it was somewhat difficult to obtain to obtain books in this series. Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations. Andrew E. Svenson III is the grandson of the author.This particular book was the third in the series. The reprint has the illustrations and text of the original hardback books. Even better, the reprint is available as a Kindle book.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book. Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series, the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. In this book the children receive a ceramic lighthouse from their Uncle Russ. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, their collie Zip accidentally knocks the lighthouse to the floor, breaking it. When the children examine the broken lighthouse, they discover a genuine emerald. Uncle Russ purchased the lighthouse at Sea Gull Beach and soon the Hollister family is off to visit Uncle Russ.When the children get to Sea Gull Beach they learn that a pirate ship called the Mystery disappeared during a storm somewhere near Sea Gull Beach, and treasure hunters had been searching for the ship ever since. The children soon encounter Homer Ruffly and his father, who is mean and is leading a treasure hunting expedition for the Mystery.Though the children are not actually searching for the pirate ship, they seem to encounter items from the ship at every turn. Homer Ruffly follows them around and does mean things to the children constantly, accusing them of stealing things that Homer claims rightfully belong to his father, when in fact the items belong to the Hollisters.The Hollister children do have a lot of fun on their trip. They take boat rides on the ocean, enter a kite flying contest, and fly in a helicopter, along with hunting for the pirate ship Mystery. The pirate theme of this Hollister book is all in good fun and younger children should be amused by the story.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9.

Rawlings, M.D.90 Minutes in Heaven by Don Piper23 Minutes in Hell by Bill WieseThere are others who I believe have had an NDE (near death experience) but they were not mature enough to distinguish between the truth telling and the lying shape shifter beings they met while on the other side when they were dead.The odyssey of reading NDE's might help some Christians who worry that aborted babies are in hell. A couple of these books comment that they saw no children in hell and that no children or people without the mental faculties to choose between right and wrong were in hell. One says that children appeared in Heaven to be about 10 years old.I am suspicious of anyone who dies and comes back with a political story to tell that perfectly fits some modern day political paradigm and other fantasy sounding stories. The books above do the best job of sticking to the experience itself.You can not expect persons who have had an extreme experience such as an NDE to leave out all religious comments relating to their past so you have to put up with some religious comment. After all, dying and seeing \\"the other side\\", is inherently religious whether anyone likes it or not.The writers appear to be Christian but I have no proof of that other than the words in the books themselves. If you want to you can sort out the religion and politics later yet these books do the best at telling the experience itself without apparent embellishment."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"Great book - I highly recommend it for Christians and nonChristians alike.

I must say that I am apalled at some of the criticism leveled against the author.Here is an atheist cardiologist that shares information from his own experience which changed his belief system and he is being attacked by people that don't want to believe what he is saying.Listen folks - the guy was an educated atheist. He was not some rabid fundamentalist from the backwoods of Arkansas. He did not have any preconceived ideas that caused him to blindly accept what he was experiencing. Neither does he have an agenda.You atheists that are distrusting of theists - fine, that is your choice. But when members of your own belief system present counter evidence at least be big enough to listen and not attack the messenger. He goes on to say that he knows of NO agnostic or atheist that has experienced an NDE that remains an agnostic or atheist. This is further testimony for you to consider from your like-minded brethren.Or is all of this talk about being open to truth just a lie??? What will it take for some of you to even CONSIDER the possibility of a God or life after death?"},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"My sister read this book back in 1980. A few months after she read it, she died from a blood clot at the age of 19. At her funeral I heard stories from her co-workers, friends and family members about how Sandy had changed after she read this book and that she told everyone that she was going to go to heaven when she died and that she believed in Jesus. She had been into a lot of trouble and had a hard time finding her way in life until she read this book. A friend of mine came to see me after my sister died and she couldn't believe how calm and peaceful my family was after losing Sandy. She had recently moved out from he husband and was having a hard time with her life. I told her to read this book and she did and it changed her life.

The concept of an afterlife, but especially of hell, was not something I had taken very seriously. It was obvious, to me anyway, that this doctor was totally serious about what he had seen and researched. I found him more credible, for example, than Dr. Moody, though his book was very good as a door opener to nde discussions and research."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"I was impressed with this book because Dr. Rawlings seems so sincere in what he says. Based on what I found online after reading the book, Dr. Rawlings is very active in advocating the message presented in the book. I took Rawlings' accounts of near-death experiences to be hopeful signs in some cases and warnings in others. This book gave me a lot to think about and led me to read other books on the topic and related topics. I highly recommend this short book."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"I have read a few other books by other authors, and by far this is the best I've read. I liked this book because the information comes from an MD who was witness to many of the cases in his book. I also liked how the book was written; the other books I've read were very simple in language, and in one case apologetic; what I mean by this is, the author was very afraid of receiving criticism for his research. Dr. Rawlings on the other hand stated firmly what he heard and saw, and he's a Christian."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"This is a wonderful book. It can be a bit scary at times but this fear can motivate you to seek the Lord Jesus! I get scared thinking about death. I suppose more than anything what I fear most is the actual transition moment from being alive (transition moment) to being dead. I have faith in Jesus and believe that to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord. But the transition moment is frightening. This book speaks of that transition moment between being fully alive and fully dead (as the world defines it). It is very well written and quite the sobering read. I recommend this book to everyone. I believe this book should be required reading in our schools. I thank God for people like Doctor Maurice Rawlings (Hey man, don't fret what you said to the other docs when they chided you for being baptised in the Jordan. Jesus loves you man and He is a gracious and forgiving God... Remember Peter!) And I thank God for allowing me to see the light while still above ground! Thanks God!

The author, a cardiologist, should realize that nde's are just that. Just because your heart stops beating and you cease to breath you are not really dead, yet! That is called clinical death....real or bioligical death is several minutes away. Biological or brain death occurs as the neurons in the brain begin to die from hypoxia or lack of oxygen.

Not one of those people have ever spoken to me, even when specifically asked, about any afterlife experience. Don't get me wrong, I do believe they happen. However, as a Non-Christian in this increasingly Christian fanatic country, I do not appreciate being scare into thinking I must convert or go to hell. I have read many other books that encompass all religions, and their experineces on the after life, from a non-judgemental view. He left out many cultures/religions that are pre-biblical that exist to this day, or are enjoying a renewal under our protective Constitution. So as an educated man, I think he has done a great disservice. He should have added A Christian Man's Stories to the title.

This is a book written by an evangelical Christian for other evangelical Christians, perhaps in particular, those wavering in their faith. Lapsed Catholic? You're covered, too. Scared secular deist? Close enough.Most of the book is padding. It is questionably written. It is poorly put together. It is far from diplomatic in its accessment of the data.On a closing note, scoffers, mockers, and collectors of \\"bulldada\\" will want to own this; it is every bit as collectable as the \\"Christian Satanism\\" books of Rebecca Brown, Mike Warnke, and Michelle Smith.

He doesn't want to &quot;convert&quot; people, but is genuinely concerned that some of us are headed for a hell-ish destiny. So it's not written from the same New Age &quot;We're all going to Heaven&quot; standpoint as most of todays NDE stuff.* Purposely avoids drawing widespread conclusions based on incomplete information. Many NDE books extrapolate wildly about the after-life just because someone saw a bright light and felt loved.* He genuinely wanted to warn people that not everyone has a good experience. He tries to gently compel the reader to consider Christianity - and does it in a non-judgemental, sensative way without bashing other faiths.The Bad:* Too short, - and half of the book is padding (historical views of death and even instructions for how to recessitate someone!)* I appreciated that he didn't try to stuff answers down my throat, but the main drawback was that he didn't delve into the questions raised by these experiences. For example, he points out that even some who considered themselves Christians had hell-ish experiences - but he doesn't try to explain why or what was lacking in their faith or life."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"This isn't one of those books written by some quack out in left field, this one is written by a doctor, and one who has brought the dead back to life on more than one occasion.

There is a Heaven, and there is a Hell, and once you read the true accounts from these ordinary people, you'll understand why you need to make a decision concerning Jesus Christ. Many of the folks in this book detail the horrors of Hell , and many share the warm loving and peaceful experience of Heaven.

At the time, I had been dabbling with out of body experiences, the Tarot, Numerology and Astrology, among others. I had all but become convinced that life after death had more to do with traveling the astral plane than going to Heaven or Hell.I was brought up as a Christian, although at that juncture in my life I had lost my way. I was about 23 at the time and suffering from chronic depression. I had tried many anti-depressants to no avail. I decided, based on the experiences of those whose books I had been reading at the time, that suicide would most likely be the best solution, and life after death would be a much happier journey than the one I was currently experiencing.After attempting suicide (unsuccessfully) shortly thereafter, I ran across this book at a local, used bookstore, and the name of the book caught my interest. After reading it, I decided then and there I would never try suicide again. I decided that even in the worst of times, it was better to try and suffer through it with God's help than what I believe would have lead to my suffering in Hell.This book honestly saved my life, and I can't recommend it enough to those who can, in any capacity, relate with my story."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"This is a short book written by a highly credentialed cardiologist. He also was a self-described atheist . . . until he stumbled onto the information which comprises the theme of this book: Life continues after bodily death, and a few people have a had a peek behind the curtain and have described what they saw.Dr. Maurice Rawlings compiled the stories of the post-resuscitation experiences of his own, and other physicians', patients. CPR is a relatively young technique that has become widely familiar to even lay people during the last 30 years or so. Rawlings goes into possibly a little more detail on CPR than most of us are interested in. I suspect that is what some of the other critcal reviewers are referring to as \\"filler\\". I also found it boring.The recountings of the \\"beyond death's door\\" experiences were riveting. They have great entertainment value, however when one considers the real life implications (or end of life, as it were), the result is profound and terrifying.Make no mistake -- Dr. Rawlings is now what is referred to in American culture as a \\"Born Again Christian\\". He believes what he has written and he offers a simple, available solution: Belief and trust in the Jesus of the Bible. Rejection of Jesus results in passing on to hell after physical death. Rawlings is quite clear about this, and supports his belief using references from the Bible. I found his previous atheistic position, his systematic compilation of \\"experiences\\" for the book, and his subsequent conversion to a STRONG Christian position to be compelling.Obviously, this talk of Christianity and such repels most unbelievers, and leaves many in a frothing at the mouth rage (see other reviews). However, the author has written transparently. Take it as you will, but as Rawlings presents it, THIS IS VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS.He is not the best of writers, but he is adequate. He is apparently a competent scientist, and has done readers a great service by putting this book together.I note criticisms from other reviewers that Rawlings did not fully develop some of the resuscitation stories, or did not explain why some \\"good\\" people, or churchgoers, seemed to have been headed to hell. Perhaps the answer is that the author did not attempt to embellish, or judge, but just report. By his own description, the survivors' memories of these experiences (especially the hellish ones) are fleeting and evaporate completely rather quickly.Rawlings wrote a subsequent book, To Hell and Back. It contains much recycled material, is a little preachy, and contains perhaps MOSTLY filler. I do not recommend it. I do however highly recommend this book for anyone interested in examining and thinking about the life after death phenomenon . . . and shouldn't we all."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"For those that believe that everyone who dies will &quot;go to the light&quot; MUST read this book!

I was 12 years old. I told my parents about it, and they tried to calm me and told me that it was \\"just a dream.\\" They were not familiar with N.D.E.s because nothing had been written about them at the time, no movies or videos, and the term \\"N.D.E.\\" hadn't even been invented.The experience did not exactly fit into the concept of death that I held at the time...that God was an old man with a white beard and angels with bird-like wings. No, there was a tunnel of light, BEing of Light, and door-like portal, that I, incidentally, decided not to go through.The BEing of Light told me that if I went through the portal, then \\"You won't get to see your mommy and daddy again.\\" In a nutshell, Love for my parents brought me back to my physical body.I repressed the memory to a certain extent for many years but always realized deep inside that it was a very important event! In 1984, while attending college, I was miraculously led to discover \\"Beyond Death's Door\\" in a used bookstore. Something \\"told me\\" in my mind (intuitively) to look behind another pile of books on a bottom shelf, and voila, there it was!It was a wonderful revelation because for the first time, I realized that other people had undergone an experience similar to my own, I wasn't alone! Bottom line, there truly is a \\"spiritual\\" level of existence beyond this \\"physical\\" world, and I was given a choice about whether to \\"come back\\" or not!Dr. Rawlings' book is excellent, but so are many others by such authors as Dr. Raymond Moody, Jr; and Dr. Melvin Morse. For believers, and especially skeptics, please note that all three of these authors are medical doctors, men steeped in the traditions of \\"rational\\" inquiry and the \\"scientific method.\\" I'm guessing, however, that some of you may think that they must be quacks.

It's thought provoking, easy to read, in plain and simple english...and best of all a brief look at the &quot;other side&quot;."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"I read &quot;Beyond Death's Door&quot; upon recommendation of my husband. A dear friend of mine was in the process of dying in the hospital. I began reading this book the night before her death and was about half-way through it when I learned she had passed away. I finished reading it later that day.As a Christian, I found this book to be very comforting and reassuring during this time. I had been with this friend nearly every week (sometimes several times a week) for the past 1 1/2 years. Now I was with her the two weeks preceding her death, often at her bedside.Knowing Malinda had placed her faith in Jesus one year ago, I knew where she was headed. Still, I observed during her suffering, her young faith sometimes waned. I read Scripture to her and reassured her of God's love and Presence. I described Heaven as the Bible reveals it. I believe in the last few days, she received this information and believed it for herself.I recommend this book for anyone who has questions about life after death. Since it was originally published in 1978, as a lay person I am not sure how up-to-date the medical information given is and for that reason I give it four stars, rather than five. I hope the author will create an updated version or at least a sequel."},{"Title":"Beyond Death's Door","review":"First of all, I am a firm believer in life after death. I found Rawlings' stories of peoples trips to the afterlife truly fascinating. In saying that, I don't think Rawlings added enough information as to how the \\"event\\" changed peoples lives for the better. Secondly, with respect to those who had died and gone to Hell, Rawlings doesn't give any information as to why those people may have gone to Hell. Where they bad people to start with? Were they general jerks? Background information of this sort would have helped.I agree with another review that some of the book was filler: how to do CPR; what you need to do to change your life for the better; and so on. I would have preferred less filler and more on the lives of those who died with a brief history of their backgrounds."},{"Title":"Global Governance: Drawing Insights from the Environmental Experience (Global Environmental Accord: Strategies for Sustainability and Institutional Innovation)","review":"Something new is going on in the world today. The citizens of planet Earth are trying to solve -- or at least manage -- our common problems of a global nature. And, we're trying to do it without creating a centralized world government. The result is a hodge-podge of treaties, accords, regulations, and inter-governmental organizations that (almost) defy description.This book takes a look at the international environmental regimes in this mix, and it tries to make sense of them. In the process, the reader can ponder a number of intriguing questions. Like, how is our notion of &quot;national sovereignty&quot; changing as the world becomes smaller? What is &quot;governance without government?&quot; What is the role of global civil society in the creation of international regimes? And, is it possible to measure the effectiveness of the various regimes?In the end, the author and his contributors raise more questions than they answer, but that's to be expected. It just shows how much we have to learn about managing our world in a cooperative fashion.As the title suggests, this books is primarily about governance and world order. Don't buy it if you're looking for a description of ecosystems and the natural environment.But, if you want to learn about how nations, NGO's, and other actors are responding to environmental threats -- and if you don't mind wading through the academic prose -- this could be a good book to put in your shopping cart."},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"This is one of those books that will stick with you forever. I read it when it was new here in Scandinavia - which is probably 20 yeas ago or so - and it\`s still one of my favorite books.It has two storylines that go on simultaneously, one which is \\"now\\" and one which is hundreds of years ago. Those two storylines are so cleverly interwoven that you have to be impressed.This is a love story for people who like to have their brains tickled while reading. I can recommend this book with all my heart.I read it in Norwegian so I can\`t vouch for the translation."},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"I was 16 years old the first time I read this book.

Simple and still complex.I recomend this book to everyone and I promise you that it's a book you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"Wiese runs into a problem here: the first twenty or thirty pages are so incredibly intense, rich, and captivating that it's hard to live it up. For the most part, he succeeds, but lets it get a little out of his hands. Overall, this is well worth picking up: I read slowly and yet didn't put it down until I was done. He manages to fit a lot of different themes and topics into a small, yet great read. And the opening is just pure excellence at work. Five years and two degrees in English Lit hasn't found much that rivals this opening"},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"Your world is transformed for a day as you will not be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"What makes a decent girl undress herself in the middle of a plaza in 14th century Italy? She stands right in front of the man she loves and his love for her will never die. It could have been Shakespeare, but it is written in Norway in this century. The power of love AND evil are evident throughout this books, and makes it clear that these themes are eternal, in litterature and in life. A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Naked Madonna (Harvill Panther)","review":"I found the subject matter to be interesting. The author deftly handled his ideas about beauty, love and evil. The ending, however, was unsatisfactory. I thought that Wiese was leading me to an ending that would be almost thrilling. But in the end, he seemed to have left several strands hanging. Maybe, it was Wiese's way of telling us that evil is a mysterious, unknowable thing, much like love and beauty. I am not sure, except to say that I wanted and expected more."},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"I recently had surgery for breast cancer.

I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer and haven't had surgery yet or started chemo or radiation, so I don't know what my taste buds will be like once I'm on chemo. However, I'm a firm believer in the fact that a healthy diet is very important in the overall \\"getting well\\" process. I have eliminated sugar, white flour, refined/canned foods, potatoes, pasta, rice, and \\"crap\\" (sorry, I couldn't think of a better word) from my diet. All of the recipes in this book contain some or all of the above-mentioned items. There are recipes for pasta, macaroni and cheese, pizza, casseroles, desserts, etc. (banana split dessert made with evaporated milk, chocolate syrup, etc. etc.) My oncologist gave me this book because I told her I was on a \\"health kick\\" now so I could get my body strong and healhty to help fight this monster.

Appetite loss, sore mouth & pain make for many challenges when it comes to eating for him. After reviewing this book at one of his oncology appointments he became excited about the different recipes and requested I order this book. We have tried several of the recipes and he has found them to be enjoyable. The wide variety of recipes makes it a easier to prepare a meal(or snack) that he is able to eat without causing mouth pain. At this point our main priority is to maintain his weight so I do modify the recipe to add more calories & protein for him."},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"This book was recommended to me (after I had been diagnosed with cancer) by someone whose daughter was going through chemotherapy treatment. I can not honestly attest to the taste of the recipes since I lost pretty much all taste sensations during this time, but I can tell you the tips for things to eat before, during and after chemo treatments were very good. Other tips that were included was the idea of using plastic utensils instead of metal ones to help reduce the already metallic taste you had in your mouth from the drugs (who would have thought!). We now give this book to those we know who are getting ready for chemotherapy...not necessarily a book you really want to own but when cicummstances demand it, it is one that may help."},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"Of all the cookbooks for cancer patients, this is the one to get. The recipes are simple, clear, and delicious! I love the way it is organized. You can't go wrong with this book, I have ordered it for friends as well!"},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"Knowing several people who have battled cancer, I remember every single one of them talking about loss of appetite being one of the unexpected challenges they faced during treatment. They were hungry, but nothing sounded appetizing and not eating means the body isn't getting the nourishment it needs to get well. Holly Clegg teams up with Dr. Gerald Miletello in this book of recipes and recommendations for addressing this problem.The recipes are simple to make, use regular ingredients easily found in any grocery store, and include snacks, soups, main dishes and casseroles, and desserts. At first glance the recipes weren't what I expected, meaning I thought they would be ultra-healthy as in lots of vegetables, high in fiber, very low-fat, and all the other things we tend to associate with anti-cancer and healthy eating. But as the book points out, a cancer patient who has lost his or her appetite needs nourishing foods that taste good and will sustain body weight for strength during a time when treatment is taking a toll. For some forms of cancer and treatment, high-fiber foods and things like fresh fruits and vegetables aren't recommended because they can cause other risks and discomforts. It isn't that these recipes aren't healthy; just that some include things like refined flour instead of whole wheat to make digesting easier.There is a cross-reference chart for what dishes to prepare to ease specific problems someone undergoing treatment may face such as a sore mouth or bowel upsets, recipes that are good for snacks, and dishes to prepare for pre-treatment as well as post-treatment.Because a cancer patient's nutritional needs vary according to the stage of treatment, the book is organized by topic instead of by food type like a typical cookbook. Chapters include day of chemotherapy, chapters by symptoms, high calorie-high protein, snacks and light meals, healthy eating post-treatment, and a chapter of recipes suitable for someone to prepare as a carry-in dish for a cancer patient.I'm glad to have this cookbook, not only for good recipes I know my family will enjoy anytime, but also as a valuable reference as it relates to cancer treatment."},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"I oftentimes recommend this book to my patients that are at a loss for what they need/should be eating during treatment.

One of his major symptoms was a complete loss of appetite. Within 3 months, he had lost 65 pounds. I was desperate for help in getting him to eat something. ANYTHING. Being in the throes of cancer is no time to be making major dietary changes, at least, not for my husband. This cookbook was given to us at our local cancer center and it has been an enormous help. The recipes are simple to prepare and just familiar enough that I could get him to try them and to eat them. Other cancer cookbooks I have seen have ingredients listed in them that I have never even heard of, and I am a college educated woman. Perhaps later, as he gets better (and, thank GOD, he is getting better), we can try a more radical dietary approach, but for now, this book has been a lifesaver. I especially appreciated the various ways suggested to make dietary drinks like ensure more palatable. The tips on what to eat and not eat on chemo days and the days immediately following were helpful too. In addition, the recipes were tasty enough that I was more than happy to eat them, as well as my 83 year old mother in law who lives with us.

It gives great meals and lets you know what they are good for.

When someone goes through chemotherapy many changes take place within their body. For many they become nauseous after treatment, experience lowered white blood cell counts, diarrhea, constipation or other side effects. The recipes in this book are specifically designed to help with these and other problems.Recipes are organized by symptom (diarrhea, sore mouth, etc.) and by treatment stage (day of treatment, post treatment). Each one that I tried was easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. There is definitely no sacrifice of taste for the sake of nutrition in these recipes.The author answers questions such as \\"What should I eat prior to treatment?\\", or \\"Is there a certain time of day that is better for eating?\\" and similar concerns of the cancer patient. The final chapters include changing eating habits to a healthier style post treatment or prior to having problems.Whether you are undergoing treatment or just want to eat healthier as a preventative measure, this book has it all. With cancer being as prevalent as it is today, even if you don't know someone with cancer sooner or later you will.

The recipes in this book are loaded with both. The author does a disservice to any cancer patient who is really committed to learning about diet, how foods can improve overall health and keep cancer cells from growing, and how chemotherapy can be better tolerated without having to resort to what is essentially \\"junk\\" food.If you want to maintain optimal health during treatment, please research alternate foods to eat in order to manage the lack of appetite, nausea, and so forth that are often side effects of chemotherapy treatments. I did NOT eat these types of food, yet I managed to avoid side effects.

The book is also nicely organized with a chart that summarizes which recipes are particularly good for specific side efects of cancer & cancer treatment.On the negative side, and this was a big negative for me personally, if you are trying to follow an anti-cancer diet that avoids sugar, processed flours, and other ingredients that many believe are at least questionable if not outright harmful for a cancer patient, then this is not the book for you. Many of these recipes include the use of table sugar & other processed sweeteners, processed grains, and higher amounts of animal protein than are usually recommended for cancer patients (or for anyone, for that matter). The author even recommends adding extra sugar to some recipes to make them taste better.I understand firsthand that some, perhaps many, cancer patients' palates change during treatment. When combined with nausea or other side effects, it can be difficult to find any foods that are appealing. At times, simply getting the patient to eat *anything* in order to get some calories must take precedence over ensuring that those meals are truly healthy. If this is the situation you are facing, then this book might provide you with some tasty options. But I believe it is irresponsible for the author to provide recipes and food suggestions that at best are not truly healthy and at worst could feed a patient's cancer.Instead I recommend \\"Nature's Cancer-Fighting Foods\\" as a source of sound nutritional advice (for anyone, not just cancer patients) and simple, health-promoting, and appealing recipes."},{"Title":"Eating Well Through Cancer: Easy Recipes & Recommendations During and After Treatment","review":"I received this book as a gift a number of years ago when my husband was fighting cancer.

One has lung cancer. One has stomach cancer (which had been mis-diagnosed as IBS by two independent physicians over the course of a year). As both began chemo treatments and suffered the seemingly inevitable problems that go along with it, I just happened across this book and am so thankful that I did.This book is full of helpful information that no oncologist or other medical provider has shared with my family. In addition to the general info, the recipes are simple and are divided up in useful categories to suit what may be going on at any particular point in time: what to eat on chemo day, what to eat when your white blood cell count is low, what to eat when you're constipated. The categories go on and on and in the words of my family member who has stomach cancer, she wishes \\"someone had told us about this book months ago. It's been a real life-saver.\\"I don't advocate adopting any new nutrition plans without consulting with a physician. If you have a friend or family member who has cancer, however, I do advocate getting this book for them.

The messages fall into 4 categories. We have the pro-self-esteem messages: \\"It's okay to be short,\\" \\"it's okay to have freckles,\\" \\"it's okay to wear glasses,\\" \\"it's okay to wear what you like,\\" \\"it's okay to have no hair,\\" \\"it's okay to be skinny,\\" \\"it's okay to be big.\\" Second, we have emotional/behavioral themes: \\"it's okay to be scared,\\" \\"it's okay to share,\\" \\"it's okay to try new things,\\" and, in a paraphrase of the great Rosie Grier, \\"it's okay to cry.\\" Third, we also have the tolerance/broadmindedness messages: \\"it's okay to come from a different place\\" (illustrated with a martian in a UFO hovering outside Saturn), \\"it's okay to live in a small house,\\" and \\"it's okay to be a different color.\\" Finally, there is a fourth category of silly, cutesy messages which are sprinkled in to enhance the kid-friendliness and keep it from being too heavy-handed: \\"it's okay to wear two different socks,\\" \\"it's okay to eat all the frosting off your birthday cake,\\" \\"it's okay to hang out in the rain,\\" \\"it's okay to sing out loud,\\" and \\"it's okay to put a fish in your hair.\\"That last one troubles me. Every time I see it, I have a visceral reaction to that. In my mind, it is actually not okay to put fish in your hair. However, take that with a grain of salt. I have been criticized for missing to point of kids books in my reviews when I make comments like that. In fact, in response to my review of \\"Chimp and Zee,\\" where I called for primatological correctness (Chimps are not monkeys and they don't have tails!), Mr. Anholt emailed me and said, in part, \\"I defend the importance of creative invention and I am rarely sloppy - I hope you are not being dogmatic or literal-minded in your judgement. (sic)\\" I should also note that the overall tone of Mr. Anholt's letter was very congenial and charming, and I do recommend his books.The \\"Okay Book\\" is a very nice book, particularly for preschoolers. It delivers important messages of tolerance and acceptance but strikes enough of a balance between goofiness and preachiness to not feel like a lesson. It concludes well with a nice sendoff, \\"it's okay to dream big.\\""},{"Title":"The Okay Book","review":"Yeah, that was corny, but it was too obvious. Anyway, I came across this book in one of those educational toy stores. What grabbed me was the vibrant colors and the simple, yet important values it communicates. There are two basic messages. The first is not to be biased or prejudiced against others because of superficial things that don't reflect who they are as people (like how big their house is or how they dress). The second message is that you should have the courage to be who you want to be and to express that. My son has been captivated by this book since he was only a few months old and I am looking forward to the day when he will be able to take away the important messages from it. It's comforting to have this book as a tool so that I can help my son grow up to be confident, respectful and happy. As do most parents, we have a few dozen books now. None is a substitute for &quot;Okay.&quot; I've evaluated Todd Parr's other books online, but was less impressed and haven't bought any yet. But this one is a gem."},{"Title":"The Okay Book","review":"This is a wonderful little book! My first graders love to read this book over and over. They love the bright pictures and simple drawings.

I can't tell you how many people I see looking at this 'okay book' when I come out to collect them for their appointments! (Then they put it down with a sheepish smile when they see that someone saw them reading it...) :-) It seems to be a whimsical and refreshing reminder for all of us in an occasionally conformity-driven society that we're good like we are.

A notoriously nebulous period, the author's detailed account of the state of this suddenly turbulent European power is tremendous. His research and reporting on the Allies' treatment of this fallen Axis enemy, the mounting strain of German-Italo relations throughout Mussolini's puppet regime, the uncertainty facing Italian armed forces in occupied territories and the relationships between partisans, civilians and the Italian Royal Army is unparalleled. Furthermore, Lamb gives the reader a clear understanding of Fascism's misgivings and failure, portraying a beaten, poweless dictator unable rally a nation under seige. A must read for anyone fascinated with WW II Italy."},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"War in Italy is well-written and excellent book - a good read! It deserves five stars, not biased reviews. This book succeeds in what it set out to do, admirably so. If you want a straight timeline, as one reviewer did, then look for a book written in that fashion. Mr. Lamb writes to inform and educate the reader about a complex situation, with many nuances and turns, and a simple chronological approach is not necessarily the best way to do it. The detailed knowledge exhibited is impressive, and Mr. Lamb fairly handles both the German and Italian aspects - if the former don't come out so well in this enterprise, it is because of the wretched nature of their actions, not Mr. Lamb. Also this is history written by someone who was actually THERE -on site at the time- and who was fluent in the language. Maybe he KNOWS a bit more than some of us looking at this so many years later? The low rating and the reasons given by some reviewers are among the most misleading I have seen on amazon - look at the reviews in the press and academia by the real experts!"},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"Many Americans know that former Senator and Presidential candidate Robert Dole was badly wounded while fighting in Italy in World War 2 but know little else about the conflict there, its history having been overshadowed by the Normandy invasion and the War in the Pacific. For those with an interest in finding out more about this ignored, but important struggle of the Second War World, this book provides a good overview, particularly from the standpoint of the Italians themselves, the author having been a British military officer attached to Royal Italian Army units fighting alongside the Allies.In the wake of the defeat of Axis forces in North Africa, where Italy had played an important role, given that Libya had been its colony, the Allies as their next step launched an invasion of Sicily. After this succeeded and it became clear that the mainland of the country was imminently scheduled for invasion as well, leading military and political circles in Italy, recognizing that an Allied victory would occur in due course, decided that a change of national course was in order. Although Mussolini as the Commander or Duce of the Nation was dictator of the country, the King of Italy was still the nominal head of state and he and Field Marshal Badoglio organized a coup against Mussolini in July 1943 causing his removal from office by the Fascist supreme council. Thereafter followed 45 days of calm before the storm like limbo as Italy, still at war with the Allies, considered its next move opening up secret negotiations with the Americans while the Germans suspiciously looked on. As a result of this process, the Badoglio regime decided to surrender to the Allies and switch sides in the war in early September. The Germans, no fools, responded with alacrity to this maneuver which was badly bungled by the Italians and their Allied supporters as division after division of German troops and armor poured across the Brenner Pass from Austria into Italy as part of \\"Operation Axis\\" forcing the Badoglio's \\"royal government\\" to flee to Brindisi near the southeastern tip of the country. Simultaneously the Nazis \\"rescued\\" Mussolini from his captivity and sponsored him in the establishment of a puppet fascist \\"social republic\\" based at Salo in the far north. Real power, however, much to Mussolini's chagrin, lay with German officials throughout the country, most symbolically at Rome.Many Italian troops, although possessed of a healthy dose of national pride, were hapless in the wake of these events as they viewed obedience to the King as fit and proper, even if they had no strong political views. As a result, although many units went over to the Germans without a fight, many others put up resistance to them to one degree or another but were defeated after a short time except in Corsica and Sardinia where with the aid of the Free French the Germans were driven out. Given that Fascist Italy had been Germany's ally, however, the Germans led by their commander General Kesselring responded with the savagery that had come to be expected of them to captured Italian troops massacring thousands of unarmed POWS they viewed as traitors, both in Italy and in areas of Greece and the Balkans under Axis occupation, and shipping off 600,000 of them to concentration camps, notwithstanding the protests of Mussolini and many Italians who remained loyal to the Axis alliance. In addition, the Nazis launched a wholesale pogrom against the small Italian Jewish community relocating them in their entirety to death camps, something even Italian fascists had little stomach for. In this regard the author seeks to acquit Pope Pius XII, considering that he did the best he could to protect and shelter Jews and other potential victims of Nazi repression but that his public stance was muted under extreme duress as Hitler had made it clear that he was considering invading the Vatican with 10,000 SS troops and pillaging its riches. Calmer heads among the Germans prevailed, however, as they considered gratuitous cruelties of this type, after a certain point, to be a diversion and waste of resources from the real military struggle against the Allies and the partisans.Mussolini, in order to salvage his pride and to hopefully mitigate Germans abuses of Italians, organized a new fascist \\"republican\\" army led by General Graziani. These units, aside from the depredations of the fascist \\"Black Brigade\\" gangs in tandem with the SS against civilians considered to have partisan sympathies, had limited military success and did little to lessen German contempt for Italy which Hitler indicated should be treated \\"like Poland\\" although his personal fondness for Il Duce did result in the latter making two state visits to Germany to consult with Der Fuhrer (\\"The Leader\\") and to review and anoint new fascist divisions being organized there which some interned Italian prisoners were allowed to join. Many of these new recruits, however, deserted at the first opportunity upon reaching their home soil.Of greater military significance than the rejuvenated fascist units, and of the Royal Italian Army that acquitted itself decently in action with the British beginning at Monte Cassino leading to the liberation of Bologna by them, was the guerrilla war launched by the partisans, largely under communist leadership. To this threat, the Germans responded, as usual, with characteristic brutality through the taking and execution of hostages and the burning down of whole villages, the most notorious being the massacre at the Ardeatine Cave in Rome in March 1944 where over 300 civilians were shot as part of the 10 to 1-later raised to 50 to 1-policy of retribution against civilians for the killing of German soldiers by \\"terrorists.\\" Needless to say, such atrocities fueled widespread hatred of the Germans, who had been largely tolerated by the public before 1943, and the partisan movement took on a mass character liberating whole areas in the north and after the defeat of the collapse of the Wehrmacht's \\"Gothic Line\\" south of the Alpine region and its surrender in May 1945, capturing and executing Mussolini himself.A colorful, if brutal, episode in this chronicle is the little known fact that Hitler sent several regiments of White Russian Cossacks into Northeastern Italy which he promised to them as a homeland in return for their aid in exterminating the Italian and Yugoslav partisans that were operating in this area. Although the Cossacks dealt the people they came into contact with a further dose of cruelty, they failed in their objective and they and their camp followers were forced to retreat from their ostensible promised land in an abject condition seeking at all costs to avoid coming into the custody of Soviet forces whose policy, to no surprise, was to deal summarily with such turncoats.The book is very absorbing and readable but often assumes a familiarity with Italian culture and history that most general readers don't have. Thus, for example, one is confronted with untranslated Italian vocabulary wanting of explanation. The overall style can also at times become somewhat terse and schematic, being written in the style of the staff reports and cables that the book quotes from frequently. Nonetheless, the book, both its text and the documents appended thereto, is an accessible and informative look at an important episode in the military and political history of the Second World War in Europe."},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"Richard Lamb has written about a fantastic piece of history that none of born under the Commonwealth will ever hear at school. If you are like me, you would have been indoctrinated with how England won WWI and WWII singlehandedly and saved the world from the fanatical oppression of the emerging fascist regime.The truth is that Italy is and was at the time of WWII a new and emerging nation. The people struggled under a waning dictator who made the gravest mistake of his life by signing a treaty with the greatest lunatic of the 20th century. At the time Italy had limited resources that were already committed in wars previously fought in Spain and Abyssinia, and were not prepared to back Hitler's dream of dominating Europe. Lamb explains how Mussolini was pushed into a pact with Hitler (the Pact of Steel) and explains Mussolini's true personal dislike for Hitler's policies. One such example is where Mussolini falls out of favour with Hitler when he refuses to persecute the Italian Jewish population.Lamb's book opens our eyes to what happened on ground zero on Italian territory during WWII. He reveals the true politics of what went on during such turbulent times while daring to dim the limelight on traditional English heroes that we are often taught saved the world by their sword and wit alone. At the end of the day, you have to remember that victory against Germany would not have occurred without the Italian's overthrowing their own dated government.Specific examples are equally mentioned of Italians' military units victories and defeats while Lamb sheds light on how and why they occurred. After reading, you will find not everything in Italy is as simple as it was we are traditionally taught.If you dare to learn an impartial and objective view of Italy in WWII then read this book. It deserves 4 stars but I will give it 5 to honour Lamb with his daring courage to shake English and American history and tell Italy's story in an honest and reputable manner."},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"(actually I rate this book at 4 Stars but this webpage will not support that correction).Many Americans know that former Senator and Presidential candidate Robert Dole was badly wounded while fighting in Italy in World War 2 but know little else about the conflict there, its history having been overshadowed by the Normandy invasion and the War in the Pacific.

I read the book up to page 112 and the author only talks about Mussolini and Hitler's relationship, the Italian and German Generals and the politics. There is only implied mention of what is going on with the Allies and I don't remember Patton or Montgomery being mentioned in the first 112 pages.The book would probably appeal to someone who wanted to know the details of the politics going on inside Italy and between Italy and Germany. I was looking for a more comprehensive description of events with a single continuous timeline."},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"This book is not worth the read.

As a serious student of history, I was particularly drawn to this book because of the title.I expected a frank, objective historical account with a minimum of organization and coherence. Instead, I found a boring, repetitive, disorganized, personalized account full of nursery-style blasts and outbursts against individuals and groups of people.Mr. Lamb is supposedly a respected \\"historian\\" yet he violates the first golden rule of historical analysis by getting emotionally involved and showing his personal vendetta against the Germans and Fascist Italians. His diatribe of subjective remarks and unprofessional terms pop up here and there, amidts supposed facts so the reader is often fooled into believing the whole paragraph or chapter as part of an honest, objective account based on personal experience (Mr. Lamb served as a soldier in Italy fighting against the Axis) as well as research and documentation.Instead, one comes across terms such as \\"the hated Germans\\", the \\"Brutal Kesselring\\". In regards to Croats, he writes the \\"criminal Pavelic\\" or \\"Ante Pavelic, the terrorist\\" leader of Croatia. Mussolini's letter to Hitler is called \\"pathetic\\" and this goes on as I have only reached the first third of the book. I can say in all honesty I am bored with Mr. Lamb's antics and tactics to deceive the reader in his one-sided English propaganda. Apparently, all fascist Italians were \\"bad\\" and all those who sided with Badoglio or the communists were \\"good\\". One could expect a more intelligent debate from a 12 year old writing a dissertation.Mr. Lamb's black and white subjectivity comes to light when he conveniently brushes aside the murder of more than 60,000 Italian civilians by the carpet bombing tactics of the British and American air-forces, and calls the execution of \\"franc-tireurs\\" terrorists \\"criminal\\" and yet identifies communist saboteurs who shot helpless soldiers in the back while unarmed \\"patriots\\". Naturally, as a typical chauvinisticEnglishman blinded by his own obedience to Queen and country (the same that subjected one fourth of the world to tyrannical rule for centuries) and by very typical English arrogance, Kesselring's decision to treat saboteurs and partisans as criminals was an inexcusable war crime, while Churchill's speech to the commons in regards to charring and flattening Italy from end to end should she stay in the Axis was an act of \\"liberation\\".Other than Mr. Lamb's amateurish writing style and obvious bias which stems no doubt from a deep-rooted inferiority complex towards his opponents in the war, I see a degree of emotional balance that should perhaps be treated before another such \\"historical account\\" is offered to the public.In short, this book, though discusses the crucial episode of WWII that dealt with the Italian campaign, is a complete waste of time and a total zero as far as objectivity and accuracy are concerned. Ironically, Mr Lamb doesn't seem to understand the difference between brigades, regiments and divisions though he served in the war. This should be an indication of his credibility and accuracy as a historian."},{"Title":"War In Italy, 1943-1945: A Brutal Story","review":"This is a most disappointing book about the history of Italy after the 8 September 1943 unconditional surrender. Lamb, who fought with the Royal Italian Army as a British officer, has never cared to disguise his hatred of Germans and his love of all thins Italian. This book, allegedly about the 4 way war fought between the Salo republic, Nazi Germany, the Allies and the Kingdom of Italy has consulted only books in Italian and English, and mostly secondary works at that.Your suspicions of Lamb's qualifications and seriousness as a historian and researcher are aroused when he talked about the German 3. Panzer and 26. Panzer divisions (actually panzergrenadier divisions) and that Walter Reder commanded the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler troops in Italy, that Senger (und Etterlin) was the commander of the RFSS division, which was formed specifically to fight the Italians (the division started life as Himmler's Begleit Battailon, and was never expanded to a division with fighting in Italy or the Italians in mind)!This is trash propaganda billed as serious research."},{"Title":"The Fields Of Athenry: A Journey Through Ireland","review":"\\"In The Fields of Athenry, James Charles Roy leads us through the Irish past and present by way of his own personal struggles and misadventures in renovating Moyode Castle, an old tower house that he purchased more than thirty years ago. While he pieces together its four-hundred-year-old past, the castle becomes a powerful symbol for Roy - it is battered by waves of history, yet timeless and resilient. Roy's personal struggles with the land and its people open for him a wide-ranging historical conversation on Ireland today and our sense of history more broadly. How do we reconcile the historical nostalgia attached to Ireland with the boom times that the \\"Celtic Tiger\\" enjoys today?

It is filled with anti-Irish drivel and false history that has been debunked hundreds of times in the past.

You will understand why.First published in 1924 this book is, perhaps, the precursor of Jeremy J. Siegel's book \\"Stocks for the Long Run : The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies\\"Twelve tests were performed using different well-diversified common stock portfolios comparing them to bond portfolios. The main thesis is that bonds are less conservative than stocks. The metric chosen? Returns after approximately 20 years.He considers basically 2 periods, one when dollar appreciates in real value (1866-1885) and one when dollar depreciates in real value (1901-1922). The results show that, considering capital gains and income from dividends, Commons Stocks ALWAYS beated bonds. The book is well written but some details are missing.But why this book is so special? Stay tuned !Irving Fisher (October 15, 1929):\\"Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel that there will soon, if ever, be a fifty or sixty point break below present levels, such as Mr. Babson has predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher than it is today within a few months\\"Who was Irving Fisher?In one sentence: America's most respected and famous economist, renowned for developing a theory of money that explained the valuation of Financial Assets (from Steve Keen's book Debunking Economics.)Do you remember (from physics course) the Clapeyron's law PV=nRT ?Well, Irving Fisher was the author of a similar \\"law\\" for economics: MV=PT (money mass, velocity of money circulation, price level, number of transactions).Less than two weeks later: Black Monday (October 28, 1929).DJIA closed 12.8% below previous level and fell another 11.7% the following day. Three years later stock indices had fallen 90%.Fisher lost over US$ 100 million in today's dollars and was reduced to penure. His wealthy sister-in-law helped him, saving him from complete bankruptcy, forgiving Fisher's loans in her will. After these facts he was despised, a pariah.What do this all have to do with this book?Irving Fisher authored a paper entitled \\"The Stock Market Panic in 1929\\" published in 29 or 30 (I need to verify the date), when the market was not indeed in the worst condition.Fisher:\\"To my mind the problem of the stock market panic is, and will be to some extent for many years, an enigma, but I think now is the time to gather data and to make preliminary estimates of what really happened and why, because as we wait, those involved are forgetting; and if we wait too long the people whose memories are most important will have died. Some one has said that the \\"perspective\\" of the historian, about which the historian boasts so, is simply due to the fact that all those people who had the data, from which they could contradict him, are no longer living.\\"... And he continues talking about the causes ...In another excerpt:\\"These causes and the flight from bonds to stocks, especially AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF EDGAR SMITH'S BOOK on stocks and long term investments, and the coming of investment trusts that exploited that idea, have led to GREATER CONFIDENCE in common stocks.\\" (the emphasis is mine)To finish, read about 1929 in Holocaust timeline on the site historyplace, concerning depression effects.Is this book one of the causes of WWII ?Poor Edgar Smith. It can be very dangerous to write finance books."},{"Title":"Common stocks as long term investments","review":"I just finished reading Common Stocks as Long Term Investments by Edgar Lawrence Smith. Refreshing!Smith sets out to prove the received wisdom of the day, that bonds outperform stocks, but the results of the research didn't bear out the conventional wisdom. In all but one of the \\"tests\\" stocks beat bonds and in some cases quite handsomely.Despite the difficulty of obtaining data, Smith manages to construct an 85 year long stock market index from 1837 to 1923. The importance of such a long term chart is that it clearly shows the exponential nature of the growth of the market. By fitting a curve to the low points and another to the high points, Smith shows that the market was growing at approximately 2.5% annually. Should this number seem low by present standards, please take into account that back then stocks paid handsome dividends, typically between 4 and 8 per cent per annum as otherwise stocks would not be purchased in preference to bonds.The chart constructed by Smith looks very similar to any modern day stock chart, lots of volatility. Smith then analyzed what he calls \\"The time hazard in the purchase of common stocks\\" how long it would take to break even no matter when you bought your shares and the worse case scenario was 15 years, considerably less that the period Jeremy J. Siegel found in his study Stocks for the Long Run. Essentially Smith and Siegel found the same thing, a patient enough investor won't ever lose money in the market provided the portfolio is well diversified and holds the largest companies in the various leading industries.Smith then sets out to find out why it is that stocks beat bonds as long term investments. His three major conclusions are:First: inflation is more likely than deflation and bonds don't have any protection against inflation. In inflationary times bonds lose purchasing power even as the face value remains the same. Stocks, to the contrary, grow in value often beyond inflation as I will explain below.Second: for a bond to qualify as high grade, the issuing company has to have earnings above and beyond what is required to pay off the interest and the principal of the bond and this extra income accrues to the stockholders, not to the bond holders.Third: population growth requires growth of products and services and the companies that provide them grow accordingly. Improving standard of living has the same effect, people demand more and better products and services and the companies supplying them grow accordingly. This growth is above and beyond inflation as otherwise there would be no improvement in the standard of living, quite the contrary.Earlier I called the work refreshing because it goes back to first principles instead of relying on the hocus-pocus of charting and complex crystal ball gazing. In essence, when you own stocks you own a piece of the productive capacity of your country and, if the economy is growing, so does this productive capacity.Where Smith falls short is in his stock picking. He talks generally about \\"investment management\\" but does not offer a superior method of picking stocks. His \\"tests\\" were based on generic methods so as not to induce bias: \\"In the test that follow, the only principle of sound investment that has been applied to the selection of stocks is that of diversification. Without diversification, the purchase of common stocks cannot be considered.\\" That task, better stock picking based on price charts, was left for BuildMWell to discover. Smith looked at the tops of the price index chart to determine how patient an investor would have to be. On the contrary, BuildMWell looked at the bottoms of the price index chart and came to the brilliant conclusion that if these were indeed the bottoms then there was no better price point at which to buy."},{"Title":"Textual Interaction: An Introduction to Written Discourse Analysis","review":"In this slender and thoroughly enjoyable volume, Michael Hoey provides an intimate introduction to the mechanisms of interaction and interactivity in texts via some choice examples. Hoey hypothesizes a four-fold model comprising writer, author, audience, and reader, all of whom interact in complex but systematic ways within textual interaction. The thread running through the work is that coherence is a sine qua non for texts, and it is around and against coherence that the most germane questions about interaction - via the threat of incoherence - are posed.Hoey's reader is not overburdened with technical vocabulary, but is lead through the material by the author's enlightened voice, and plenty of illustrative illustrations. While he makes no claim to uncover universals of text reading behaviors, Hoey does succeed in illuminating many aspects of writer signalling and reader expectation in English texts. The approach, I have found, is particularly useful to anyone studying text analysis in order to support the development of educational materials.One section of the book I found fascinating is the chapter titled \\"Interaction in text - the larger perspective,\\" in which Hoey uses a neat little trick molded in the spirit of Objective Hermeneutics. By taking just 2 sentences from a feature article (73 sentences long, on British dormouse ecology) he demonstrates the power of textual signals to set off reader expectations and activate standardized schemas. Hoey presented his 2 sentences to an ecology expert and a classicist, and asked each to anticipate what questions they thought the remainer of the article would probably answer. Surprisingly, both readers anticipated the majority of topics that would be addressed, and still more surprising to me, the classicist anticipated the higher number - 78 percent. This shows the integrity of the text-form, the embeddedness of reader expectations, and perhaps the superior rhetorical ability of the classicist to anticipate where the text is going - irrespective of subject-matter expertise. Hoey also reminds us that \\"the successful predictions of the two informants are a measure of the writer's own success at predicting what his writers will want to know. Either way it would seem that the whole development of the article is already enshrined in embryo in its beginning\\" (p. 43). I have used this test when developing scientific features for the Web, and the questions generated are indispensable in ensuring that the text answers the questions readers really want to know. It also moves us away from traditionally narrow notions of \\"targeting an audience\\" toward more stable generic forms of text, especially for informative discourse.Another central concept presented by Hoey is the idea of the \\"colony\\" text - a theoretical model that is useful in describing texts such as till receipts, phone books, classified ads, and other non-linear, non-narrative texts such as database reports and dynamic Web pages. Colony texts often emerge from multiple authors, or are generated completely automatically, and readers of colony texts know that the \\"metaphysics of presence\\" is suspended, or at least disjunctive with respect to space-time. While the idea cannot be done justice here, the theoretical concept of the colony is an extremely useful one that will become more so as text analysts focus increasingly on dynamically-generated content from systems such as XML-based content- and document-management systems. Coherence, intertextuality, and reader expectations within colony texts are likely to be a growing research area in applied text analysis.Hoey also treats culturally specific and scripted text forms, such as Problem-Solution patterns, Goal-Achievement patterns, and Desire-Arousal-Fulfilment pattern. His treatment here, as well, is erudite and interesting, and fortified all the more by his concise illustrations for support.All in all, a fun book that is likely to inspire research and keep one asking questions. What's more, it's cleverly written, sharp, and self-referentially one step ahead of its critics. What critics?"},{"Title":"Textual Interaction: An Introduction to Written Discourse Analysis","review":"Michael Hoey has written an excellent introductory level book to the method of discourse analysis of written texts. First off, Hoey is an excellent writer--masterfully defining and describing the method in a way that is very accessible and lucid. Further, he chose excellent texts upon which to demonstrate the craft.I appreciate his point of view regarding the separation of author, writer, audience, and reader. Further, his chapters on text as a 'site' for interaction (ch. 2) and Interaction in text (ch. 3) were worth the price of the book for me.I recommend this book to anyone looking for an introductory text to written discourse analysis."},{"Title":"Two months in the camp of Big Bear: The life and adventures of Theresa Gowanlock and Theresa Delaney","review":"Teresa Gowanlock, a cousin of this writer, records in a diary-like format, her escape from death at the hands of Chief Poundmaker and his fellow Cree. Dragged helpless through endless miles of western overburden, she and her companions are portrayed as the hapless victims of the Natives. It is a book full of emotional-blood letting and a must read for all &quot;family&quot; members and those who would know the full extent of what happened to cause this monumental event in Canadian History. Teresa is not vindictive in her words but neither is she forgiving. She and her family suffered much but were the pawns of a government which held little love for any &quot;force&quot; which stood in its way. Upon her rescue she informed the authorities of her trial and soon set to telling her tale. Like her cousin Laura Secord, she became a part of the historical Canadian fabric and a noble example of all that was the strength of our early ancestors.

General programming concepts like proper use of control flow selection, proper initialization, and passing by reference versus passing by value are covered sufficiently and efficiently. C# language features are made clear with example code. The debugging environment in .NET was also covered, explaining the whole set of menu options for debugging.You are not going to get any programs of that put together all the concepts, but your going to build the foundation to taking that step on your own. The authors are remarkably clear and to the point, usually giving an example where necessary. I'll be interested to try their C# for Windows Programming book next.

Michael weaves hue, heartbreak, Wordsworthian joy, tenderness, and the occasional sucker punch into his singular and beautiful vision, and contemporary poetry is the richer for it.

Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one.

Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes.

I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As I was in the middle of the book, I was so drawn to the characters I felt full. Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were \\"wow - what a wonderful journey.\\" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote \\"St John is a failure I think but a good failure.\\" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is \\"fact is stranger than fiction.\\" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated \\"such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.\\" Ms. Bronte responded saying that Helen Burns was a real person and that Ms. Bronte exaggerated nothing about Helen. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: 1800s England. Published 1847. Genre: historical romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a great book to read! I really love the voice of Jane throughout the whole story, making me really feel that I was reading her journal rather than Charlotte writing fiction. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this in high school (oh, gosh...25 years ago!). I remember liking it then, though at the time I think I preferred Emily's Wuthering Heights. But as another reviewer mentioned, classic books really should be re-read from time to time. In some ways I think they're wasted on the young! Now I find Wuthering Heights a good story, though a bit melodramatic. However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world. She addresses religious hypocrisy, women's rights, and the mistreatment of children, among other things. And it's a very good read. I find I am staying up late at night because I want to read on, rather than go to bed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"With this novel Ms. Bronte crafted what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful works of the English language. One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term \\"Plain Jane,\\" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the \\"mad\\" Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Mason."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a reprint of the famous Bronte novel that even now after so many years can thrill and captivate the reader.We are introduced to the heroine Jane EYRE on the first page and we soon realise she is a most put upon child, unwanted by Aunt, cruelly treated by her spoilt cousins and mostly ignore by the servants, save for Bessie who perhaps has the best understanding of the sufferings that Jane has to ensure under her Aunt Reed's indifferent care.We follow Jane from her miserable home life in Gateshead to her time spent at a charity school, her friendship with the doomed Helen Burns and her elevation to student teacher, a role that allows her to eventually take up a post as a governess for the child Adele, the possible illegitimate daughter of the enigmatic Mr ROCHESTER who owns the eerie Thornfield Manor.From Jane's first day at the Manor we are treated to a mystery story that slowly grows and grows with each passing day, soon Jane realises that all is not well at the Manor but she is not sure what the problem is, it has something to do with the enigmatic Grace POOLE and the attic where she works, but who cries out at night and why does Mr ROCHESTER almost get burnt to death in his bed in what is obviously not an accident but which he insists is the case.Ms BRONTE'S book is suspenseful and daring, in that she talks about illegitimacy, marriages of class, and the abuse of children in charity schools to name but a few subjects she incorporates into Jane EYRE.This particular edition is excellent because it is a faithful reproduction with no abridgement and is also can be purchased for a pittance, one way of getting the classics on your shelves, I will certainly be going out and buying myself more of these editions and look forward to re-reading Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey and Jekyll and Hyde."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"After reading the last words of this novel, the only word that escaped my mouth was WOW! Jane's character is so real. In one way or another, every woman can relate to her passage from the insecurities of childhood to the life defining moments of adulthood.For me, Bronte's main characters Jane and Mr. Rochester mirror the traveler in Robert Frost's Poem \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" as they struggle between raw human desire and moral righteousness. Jane chooses the \\"road less traveled,\\" where as Mr. Rochester takes the well worn path. In both cases, their choice defines the fiber of their spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is the template for many books that followed. We find Jane Eyre the orphan child soon to be abandoned by her uncaring aunt to a stern stark girls school. Jane has a spirit that does not quake in the face of dangers. She is the model for feminists in years to come.Charlotte Bronte the author of the book was born in 1816 and like Jane had experience as a governess. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847. By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms. Throughout the book Jane maintains an integrity of being and an independent spirit. She demands that others, who she cares for respect her as an individual as well as a woman. Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings. The plot is one that has been used repeatedly in novels yet to come. Any reader of romances or gothic stories should first read this to find the source of the story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is, hands down, one of my favorite books. It is not the typical romance story - the heroine is not a gorgeous, delicate, flower and the hero is not a young, virile Hercules. The characters are more realistic, allowing the reader to be more sympathetic. Jane Eyre is described as being the plainest of the plain, but her strength and independence make her a rare individual. She is a dynamic character whose love transforms her in the end.This is book really moved me. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially anyone who has the time to read it in one or two settings and not have to worry about writing a paper on it. It'll be worth your time!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Brontes classic novel has ignited a love of literature, although I admit I first read it for a school assesment 6 months ago, the next 4 times was out of love for every word in the book!!! Being a romantic the Jane-Mr Rochester saga was the main page turner, but also the intrege of Grace Poole and her secret as well as the way we see Jane grow in mind, heart and soul. As a buildingsromand it shines, it was one of the first modern (if you can call it that!) novels to use such a technique. Truly beautiful. I reccomend it to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\". . .no one ever sleeps here: one would say that if there was a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.\\" This a quote from Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre', a marvelous masterpiece set in the 1800s filled with suspense, action, and a pinch of romance. Orphaned when she is a small child, Jane Eyre is left in the clutches of her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her bullying cousins at Gateshead Hall. So marks the reader's advent into Jane's dreary world. Sent to Lowood School at the of ten, she eagerly expects a genial environment only to be met by a cold, hostile institution plagued by Mr. Brocklehearst, the arrogant headmaster. Despite two high points in her stay at Lowood (she is befriended by Miss Temple, a solicitous music instructor, and a saint-like pupil named Helen Burns), they are brutally taken away from her. Helen tragically dies from typhus, and Miss Temple marries a minister and moves away. Jane's only escape from Lowood is a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall eight years later (when she is eighteen) that she accepts. When she arrives at the manor, she is heartily greeted by the housekeeper, Miss Fairfax. Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner, usually travel abroad and is absent most of the time. Jane's duty is to tutor his foster-child Adele Vareans, an adorable six-year-old French girl. It finally seems as if Jane has discovered a home for herself and is at last distinguished as a bona fide person. However, her tranquility and niche are suddenly threatened when the brooding Mr. Rochester returns home. Odd events occur, such as screams in the night, crazed laughs echoing in the halls, blazing fires, and the presence of an unexpected guest. To worsen matters, Jane finds herself falling in love with her master despite the fact that she suspects he is concealing a secret past of himself from her and others. Exactly what is it and will Rochester ever be romantically interested in &quot;plain&quot; Jane? To unearthen the answers, one has to enter the allure, intrigue, and enigma of Charlotte Bronte's delightful story of the struggles, identity, and emotions of a heroine on a quest for her destiny: Jane Eyre. --P. J. Persad"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One of the greatest love stories ever told. If you haven't read this novel yet, you don't know what you are missing. The language is beautiful, and the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane will surely make anyone's heart melt. It will rekindle one's belief in true love. Once you read it, you will want to read it again right away! Don't miss actor Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the BBC adaptation! Also, Timothy's performance as Heathcliff in the 1970's Wuthering Heights adaptation is excellent as well! Highly Highly reccommended!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book.

It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!!

Little did I know that this novel would capture my attention and hold it steady for three days. The character development was excelent. I felt like I was going through the trials and tribulations with Jane. I wanted to walk up to her and tell her my opinion of what to do. The story winds in ways I didn't think possible. I would be half-way through and wondering what could happen next since there was so much book still left to read. The reading was slightly complicated for me and I would have to stop and ask my parents what this (or that)old english word meant.

One of my favorite novels of any I have ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book's main plot, Jane's growing love for her student's caretaker, seems almost fluffy. But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the &quot;classes&quot; of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future. There is no such thing as a &quot;plain Jane&quot;.

You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now, but... Anyway, this is a wonderful book. The more I read the Bronte sisters' novels, the more I like them.The eloquence in language throughout this novel doesn't dilute its greatness by hindering the reader of today by having to decipher the meaning of each sentence. The story, though incredible, is also believable because it is told through the eyes of the one who experiences it. The characters are well-rounded, the plot is juicy, and the climax is fabulous. I love how, even though it is told in past tense, it is as though Jane is reliving each moment and her moods inside the narrative correspond to whatever is happening in her life at that time. It makes her seem even more real.It is a long book, but definately worth picking up!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Ive got a paper back of Jane Eyre, have owned it many years now, it certainly has alot of \\"miles\\" as I've loaned it out quite a bit.

(I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child.

I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \\"judgment and feeling\\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \\"good\\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY! Nonetheless, there's a few great moments, and it's a fun book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here. My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth.

The writing, shockingly, has held up through the many that have passed since this book was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read an abridged version of Jane Eyre when I was 6 years old. I reread it 4-5 times, and finally read the unabridged version when I got to high school and have reread it about 3 times since. Jane Eyre never ceases to amaze and delight me. Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine. That is a power that we possess that men don't."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The book is written in an interesting way, but it was also very difficult to read.

Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Just imagine. You're reading along, you come to a place in the bok that captures your attention. You're completely engulfed by the story, you're not reading it, you're living it! The &quot;real&quot; world is gone. You hear neither phone nor voice. You feel neither hunger nor thirst. You feel only what the author's pen tells you to feel. You are eager to read on. Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases. Jane Eyre is such a book. It is one of three or four books who contentend for the multiple-crack champion.I was assigned to read this book for an AP English class. Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural!

I appriciate the classic nature of this story, and I like the heroine, but there is just a self righteous tone to the entire book. ---- Jane Eyre was raised by her terrible and cruel aunt who cares not a wick for her. This was possibly her earliest hardship, yet she persevered the tough childhood years, and becomes even stronger when her aunt puts her in a terrible boarding school. Eventually, she takes a position as a nanny in the house of a rich man where she finds what it is to be loved.------ The problem I had with this story was the &quot;love&quot; between the rich man and Jane Eyre. I didn't feel that the Rochester and Jane loved one another at all, but rather had a need to have control over another person, and they provided one another with this powerful position. They both seemed ver"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting. A lot of neat stuff happens if you pay close attention.The reason why I give this book a three is that I don't see it a as a great work of literature. The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I was 12 my aunt gave me a copy of Jane Eyre. It was a favorite of hers as a young girl. It quickly became a favorite of my own. It encouraged me to seek out other books like any one of Jane Austen's great novels, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. So I am eternally grateful to my aunt who handed me a small paperback that opened my mind to a world I never knew!

So please, read this book it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book in on a narrow shelf in my library that is for my idea of selected classics. Its beautiful. It taught me that you don't have to be perfect or beautiful to find true love. Reading it, I feel my soul open."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had always heard good things about Jane Eyre, right? The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, \\"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.\\"Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: \\"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.\\" (From 'Jane Eyre')This book is TRULY one of the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. \\"\`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, \`you have my full and free forgiveness'\\" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. \\"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love\\" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. \\"I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless\\" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple \\"no\\" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"We read this book last year in my English class and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved it's mix of love, mystery, misfortune, blandness, and phychological struggles. There is much to learn from this book in the ways we see Jane grow and learn to love Rochester. We see all the different kinds of people; for example, Helen; the religious one, Jane; the rebel, Bertha; the insane wife who is a foil of Jane and many other suncharacters in this book. It is an absolutely brilliant book and it's worth the time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"You have to read this book.Why? Because you may love it.Or, you may understand it.And it's well worth the investment to pick up this book in order to do one or the other, or, with luck, both.I read this book as a child, and it changed my life. Had I never read \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I suspect I would be a different person, a lesser one.When people ask me, \\"How did you come to travel the world ... write ... survive ... \\" there are many answers, but one of the most important is, \\"I read 'Jane Eyre.'\\"As you quickly learn from other reviews, or from the jacket cover, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is about a girl who isn't much to look at, and hasn't any material wealth.If you can't identify with that kind of a person, why should you read this book? There are two reasons.You should read it because it is a classic of Western Civilization, and you should read it because it articulates, in an historically important and artistically excellent way, the insistence of one lowly born female on being a full human being.When this book was written the words \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\\" had already made history -- for men.We still await the world where women are men's equals.\\"Jane Eyre\\" has the courage to say, in relentlessly feminine language -- Jane never has to resort to a karate kick to make her point -- that women have just as much value as men. Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.\\"Jane Eyre\\" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being. I've read of other reviewers who read this book at an early age and felt it changed their lives.I'm part of that club.Now, stop reading this and go read \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book was an amazing piece of literature that's exquisitely written. The characters seem to come alive off the page, especially the heroine, Jane Eyre, who seems to have a very twenty first century frame of mind. While the plot line is fairly hard to believe, the thoughts of the heroine is what makes this piece of work a true literary masterpiece. She deals with the perils facing her with an open mind, and is willing to stand up for her beliefs and morals even in a time when this wasn't acceptable for a woman. She's a true role model for all young girls and women, and a real figure of the ages.I would recommend this book to anyone, but you have to have an appreciation for good, in depth description and old-fashioned style of writing. You also must have patience, because this is a fairly long book with many twists and turns, and there were definite times in this book that I didn't think anything good could come of it!! You must also have faith in the writer, because I was afraid for a while when I was reading that it would end horribly.I have heard many negative things about this story, but I truly don't agree with any of them. Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, Mr. St. John, they are all fabulously written, almost as though this story was written about actual people instead of fictional. I loved this book and will read it many more times."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It seems silly to say that a book can affect you on a profound level. well I definitely believe in this power that a good book has. Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many \\"sophisticated readers.\\" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why the keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most.Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there.This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In many ways, \`Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of \`good' over \`evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.\`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote \`Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre was authored by the inimitable Charlotte Bronte of the Yorkshire writing Brontes of Haworth Parsonage. The novel was written under the pen name \\"Currer Bell\\" in fears that it might be thought to have been by a woman. Bronte dedicated the book to one of her literary heroes William Makepeace Thackery whom she met on a London trip. Little did Charotte know that Thackery had to deal with a wife gone mad as had Rochester in her novel!Jane Eyre suffers through a miserable childhood. She is raised by a cruel aunt Mrs. Reed after the death of her parents. Jane is sent to the odious Lowood Academy where she lives for eight years from age 10 to 18.At Lowood, Janes befriends the older girl Helen Burns. Helen dies at an early age; Jane remains at Lowood. Miss Eyre eventually becomes a teacher at the school as she has learned French, sewing and social skills.Jane departs Lowood to become the governess of Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Rochester. Rochester is a Byronic figure who has a madwife named Blanche living in the third story of his estate Thornfield. Jane leaves Rochester at the wedding altar when it is discovered he has a living wife. Jane flees to a home of evangelic Christians where she is courted by the future missonary Mr. St.John. He rejects the wealthy Rosamund Oliver for Jane. Jane, however, loves Rochester. In a dramatic ending the little Miss Eyre is reunited with her lover and weds Rochester. Jane comforts Rochester who has become blind and maimed due to the burning down of Thornfield. The fire had been set by his mad wife Blanche who leaped off the roof of the building. Daphne Du Maurier would use a similar ending of her novel \\"Rebecca.\\"The name \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be interpreted in many ways. Jane was the middle name of Charlotte's sister Emily. Eyre may refer to her desire to fly freely in the independent air of personal freedom. Eyre also hints at the fact that Jane is an heiress. Jane also \\"errs\\" in some of her decisions as she makes her pilgrim's progress through northern England. The book is a Cinderella story in which a poor and plain young woman wins her lover. The dialogue is sharp, witty and the scene is populated by interesting rural servants and domestic animals such as the dog Pilot.The book contains elements of Gothic terror, romance and a defense of the rights of women. Bronte is often taught in courses on Feminism. Charlotte Bronte writing in the first person uses a rich language drawing on Biblical, Classical and Shakespearean language and metaphor. Bronte knew how to tell a good story for her life was similar to that of Jane Eyre. Bronte saw many of her sibling die young and lived in genteel poverty as a governess and teacher.Jane Eyre is an immortal classic which will continue to be read and enjoyed by future generations. It is the kind of book which will hook you on reading. Excellent and deserving of several rereadings.

One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre in 1847, she was forced by the ideals of the time to publish it under a man's name: Currer Bell. However, the novel's accurate depiction of a woman on a quest of self-discovery and love would correctly identify the author as a woman herself. In it, the title character leaves her childhood school to serve as governess at Thornfield Park, where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. However, the discovery of his insane wife makes it impossible to be with him, and Jane must leave to gain her own independence before the two can be reunited. This exquisitely written novel is truly a classic, but don't let that be a deterrent: Bronte's style remains consistently readable and lucid throughout. Add this to the effortless relatability of the title character, and we have a completely compelling novel on our hands. Throughout her master work, Bronte uses literary techniques like characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme to make Jane and her story highly relatable to nearly all girls and women.From the outset of the novel, the reader is given a very good idea of Jane and her character. In fact, the main traits mentioned by Bronte in the narrative are what make Jane so immediately relatable to the audience (which, by merit of its basic plot as a 19th century gothic romance, would logically be made of older girls and women of all ages that would find it intriguing). Jane, from the beginning, describes herself as, \\"poor, obscure, plain, and little\\" (272). These descriptors are reinforced throughout the novel as Jane and others describe her in terms of wealth, popularity, looks, and stature; as Jane has very little of all four of these things, she is often looked down upon by herself and others. Very rarely are fictional heroines depicted in such terms; add this to the fact that Jane has a heart of gold and Bronte has given us one of fiction's most relatable characters. Even if the reader is not poor, obscure, plain, or little, they have felt that they were each of these things at least once in their lifetime. Because Jane is so far from the ideal, the reader, as another person very far from the ideal, automatically relates to and invests in the story of Jane Eyre.Charlotte Bronte also makes Jane incredibly relatable though her usage of appeals to pathos. She makes these appeals from the outset of the novel, when Jane is sent from her relation in order to live at Lowood School, a strict institution that treats the students there terribly. Here she feels lonely and suffers lashings for offenses as quizzical as not standing when a teacher enters the room. It is when Jane starts teaching at the school that we get one of the most relatable appeals to pathos. Jane narrates, \\"I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication. For change, stimulus. That petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space.\\" (88). There isn't a person in the world hasn't longed for some sort of freedom for a change in their life only to find it not forthcoming. Jane's desire for something new and the ability to do what she wants rather than what others want her to do is relatable on all levels of life -from a girl's elementary school years to her advanced womanhood.These appeals to pathos are also apparent in regard to Jane's love for her employer, Mr. Rochester: she believes it is unrequited for the first half of the novel and then, when he reveals that he shares her feelings, discovers that he already has a wife, insane though still very much alive. Jane's moral standards make it impossible for them to be together, and so for a large portion of the text Jane has lost her love and her dearest friend. Bronte writes, from Jane's perspective, \\"It shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle: sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not what I had thought him\\" (319). Throughout this passage and many others in the text, Bronte creates a sense of loss, specifically of a loved one; this is also an emotion which can be considered relatable on all levels of the board, because every woman or girl has lost a loved one, be it romantic or platonic, and this awareness of commonality between the reader and Bronte's Jane is the obvious result of appeals to pathos made throughout the novel.Finally, the theme of the novel is perhaps what makes it most relatable: Jane Eyre is, essentially, a woman's quest to be loved on her own terms. Only when Rochester's wife has died in a house fire and Jane has achieved her own economic and emotional independence do the two marry and be together. In essence, Jane completely succeeds at her quest. \\"Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and the clerk, were alone present\\" (488). In their previous engagement before the discovery of Rochester's wife, he had sought to bedeck her with jewels and expensive fabrics, and he had been proud and arrogant in her love for him. It is different and far more agreeable to Jane now that he spurns the luxuries and arrogance that were once so integral to his happiness. Far more than that, the last chapter focuses on Jane's happiness with her marriage, which is in direct, though welcome opposition to previous chapters, in which her struggles, sacrifices, and hardships are chronicled. Jane, who had been a loveless orphan, now has a husband, children, and familial ties; similarly, each girl or woman who reads this fantastic story wishes for each of these things. Jane's desire to be loved on her own terms is a direct reflection of the readers; the theme Bronte creates from this--a quest to be loved--sustains Jane Eyre's relatability to modern readers.This marvelously crafted novel is truly a classic which remains highly readable in both style and plotline. Additionally, Bronte assured its immortality when she made the main character, Jane Eyre, such a relatable character. Using characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme, Bronte created one of fiction's most relatable characters. I would highly recommend this to girls and woman passed the age of ten; it truly is"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \\"Amphigorey,\\" among others.

What can I say other than I loved it all? I when I got through half of the book I couldn't believe my luck that I still had 321 pages of adventures left. It was totally different from all the other books I've ever read -- it was shocking, it was romantic, it was haunting, it was disturbing, it was joyful... It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself. It had all different emotions and troubles, and Charlotte Bronte really wrote the book well, taking from her own life experiances. There have been sentences in the book that I have never been able to forget because of the energy and passion that the author wrote into them. \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be called a haunting tale about one young woman's conflict between two different worlds. This is certainly a read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Though she writes in the Austin era, Charlotte Bront's style is unique, more mysterious (and a little darker) and less predictable than many of Jane Austen's works.I enjoyed this book because it portrays a harsh, plain, conservative, hard-working girl (like me) in a setting and a story so unlike what I live in. Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it. I am always disappointed when I reach the end.I don't think I need to explain much more about why I like it. I think it is a very well-written book.

I was very sympathetic towards Jane Eyre from the first- I appreciated how honest and true to life a character she turned out to be, and her less-than-stunning appearance was a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) compared to some of the stereotypical heroines of that time period.What was more surprising to me was that I actually liked Mr. Rochester, because at first I admit my reaction was something like \\"Oh No!, not another Heathcliff!\\" He may have had some kind-of odd quirks, but I thought that he was rather endearing in a way- especially at the very end.Considering that I came into this novel expecting another Wuthering Heights (a book that I despise), I am very happy that I was proven quite wrong. Bravo, Charlotte Bronte!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" because I'd had for a long time some vague sense that I'd like Jane Eyre as a character.

I don't think I've ever quite connected so well with a character before - and I've never before understood so clearly why people still read great literature - because it still resonates, like \\"Jane Eyre,\\" over 150 years after it was written.

(A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact. As a modern woman I respect this character's moral uprightness and her strong sense of self--I wish more modern young (and not so young) women would learn from her example, and thus avoid much heartache and regret\\"Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.'--Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a really interesting book if you are interested in sad, mystery, and love books.

This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read is a set with selected works of all the Bronte sisters, so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Since I had read the book Jane Eyre, I had an urge to see the movie.I was impressed and fascinated by the classic English language, thereforemy choosing of the actors \\" Tomothy Dalton & Zelah Clarke \\".A real enjoyment !!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Hard to believe that JANE EYRE was written over 150 years ago since women of all ages still fall in love with its hero, Mr. Rochester, today.

The beginning part of the book is reminiscent of Dickens since Jane survives a horrible childhood of mistreatment. And when she meets Mr. Rochester and against all odds he falls in love with her (for her character and intelligence as she is \\"plain and poor\\") the book really gets interesting for most of its fans.

The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes.

She teaches a young French girl, and gradually falls in love with the master of the house, but the love is that sort of \\"forbidden love.\\" Jane struggles with this love and her low position in life. It's a classic, beautiful romance novel, full of love, and the complications in love. I've read many Victorian romance novels, but this one tops them all. I loved it.

The passion and surprises are well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it.

Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a \\"plain Jane\\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \\"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \\"good child,\\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte is a classic gothic romance story. Its intense, thrilling, and disturbinging details are told from the autobiographical standpoint of the narrator, Jane Eyre. A definite feminist novel, Bronte created an untraditional character who defies the expectations society has of her. Jane is no Disney character; Bronte's heroine is not blessed with beauty nor money, but she is a fiercely independent character with remarkably complex emotions.The novel begins with Jane Eyre, as an orphaned child, living at Gateshead with her Aunt Reed. From the very beginning, readers understand that Jane does not and will not have an easy life. Bullied and suppressed by her aunt and cousins, Jane is an outsider. She is sent to the Red Room as punishment one day by her Aunt Reed. In defiance, even at a young age, Jane exclaims to Mrs. Reed, \\" I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I love you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed.\\" Appalled by her outburst and fueld by her hatred for Jane, Mrs. Reed a decides to sent Jane to Lowood School, an institution for orphaned girls. After years at Lowood, a glimmer of hope appears later when she becomes a governess at Thornfield, home of a certain Mr. Rochester. Since the story is told from the memory of Jane, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the heighted emotional state of Jane and troubles she suffers through.At Thornfield, Jane becomes governess for a little French girl, Adele, and soon becomes entrapped in a spiral of emotions when confronted my Mr. Rochester. It is clear that Jane is the subordinate and Mr. Rochester is the master, but one cannot help but root for their romance and love to endure. Bronte's story of dark gothic elements, insanity, and dark lingering secrets make up this tragic romance story. Bronte draws attention to the cultural assumption of the Victorian woman's role and the relations between a man and women in the 19th century. Her novel calls for women's equality and equal treatment.The characters are very thoroughly developed. From the point of view of Jane, as a reader, we learn every bit of detail about Jane: her plainness, her loyalty, and unwavering independence. When confronted, Jane demands, \\"'Do you think I can stay and become nothing to you? do you think I am an automaton? - a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong! - I have as much soul as you - and full as much hart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.'\\" Such an exclamation defied the stereotypes of a subdued and quiet lady.Interweaved throughout her novel, Bronte obviously develops the major theme of female independence and strength. However, Bronte also employs several motifs, one being the constant appearance of wings and birds. At the very beginning of the novel, Jane reads Bewick's History of British Birds which wrote of \\"the solitary rocks and promontories by them [the sea-fowl[ only inhabited,\\" symbolizing the independence of birds and the ability to fly away that she wished she had. Then at Thornfield, Jane describes a party of guests as \\"a flock of white plumy birds.\\" Upon seeing the ladies and gentlemen at Thornfield, Jane is even more aware of her dependence of others and the lowly status she has claims to. Still, she admires the freedom the guests have to come and go and indulge in frivolous activities. Even Rochester tells Jane to \\"be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Each instance, Jane is struggling to find her freedom, her own independence.Jane Eyre is a tantalizing novel deserves to be read. Be prepared for a complex and nuanced plot. Written in true Victorian style, Bronte writes in long, elegant sentences that sometimes takes a few reads to truly understand. The plot she weaves is enrapturing, leaving reader on the edge of his or her seat, just waiting to read what happens next. However, Bronte takes her time developing her plot and ends up writing a three-hundred page book that could have easily fit into one hundred, but perhaps the Victorian readers of her generation had the time to sit down and read longer novels. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, it's a story you won't regret reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In this gripping novel, Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a fiery young governess who finds love in an unlikely place. Through the use of descriptive and flowery language, Bronte successfully writes a prize winning book with extremely well-developed characters, a dramatic plot, and thought-provoking themes. Jane, the protagonist, is a young orphan living with her cold-hearted and widowed aunt, Sarah Reed. She is taken to Lowood School, where, among severe circumstances, she manages to find a friend called Helen Burns. Later, Jane decides to be a governess so she travels to Thornfield to work for the tall, brooding, and menacing Mr. Rochester. This book is considered to be one of the first feminist books because of Jane's unconventional personality and sense of independence. Jane, although physically plain, surprises and wins the heart of both the reader, and Mr. Rochester through her witty dialogue and frankness. Mr. Rochester maintains the reader's interest with his passionate and strong personality that often shows a soft side when it comes to love. It is most entertaining to read their playful and clever back and forth, as well as to see their fondness for each other grow. The characters in this novel are delightfully well-developed. Bronte does a thorough job of giving all characters life, including the minor characters like Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Temple. She uses foils to really differentiate between characters and to emphasize specific traits that are important, for example, Mr. Rochester and St. John are foils, contrasting St. John's \\"handsome Grecian features\\" yet cold personality with Mr. Rochester's unhandsome looks and passionate and emotional personality. The title, even though it may not catch the reader's attention, really reflects how Jane thinks of herself as just plain Jane. So don't be fooled by the simple title and long-winded sentences. Jane Eyre will certainly be a surprising, and delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the quintessential feminist novel. Jane is faced with and ultimately opposes her traditional role as a woman in the 1800's as she is subordinate to her love interest, Mr. Rochester. Beforehand, Jane endures a tough childhood as an orphan living with her deceased uncle's family at Gateshead. She is sent away to an \\"orphan school\\", Lowood, and eventually works as a governess at Thornfield. That is where she meets Rochester, and soon learns of a dark secret that threatens their budding romance. Later on, Jane rejects the love that she feels for Rochester, and leaves Thornfield. She faces trouble and is rescued by a second love interest, St. John. A multitude of events ensue, and this novel closes with an unorthodox, but fitting end.Jane is not the typical female character, as she is outspoken and quite independent. She does not allow herself to be pushed around, which is evident through the incident in which she physically fights with her cousin, John at Gateshead. Jane is confronted with themes of gender roles, social class, love, etc.Rochester is Jane's superior, and their romantic relationship almost replicates their professional relationship. Since he is of wealthy status, and Jane is not, they aren't on equal ground and she is portrayed as his subordinate. This is evident when Rochester refers to Jane as \\"my little friend\\" among other monikers.St. John is a foil to Rochester in every sense. He is a morally upright individual, who is devoutly religious and appeals to Jane as a cold person overall. This is in stark contrast to Rochester, whom Jane views as warm and has \\"flaming\\" eyes.In my opinion, the plot was excellent, but was a bit drawn-out. Jane's journey is full of riveting twists, but the build-up was a bit long, and the intricate language of the novel left me uninterested at times. However, regarding the major events and Victorian/Gothic elements, the language/rising action was appropriate, just not as appealing from a modern perspective. The ending was unorthodox, although I did somewhat expect it. Nevertheless, Jane's words reassure that in the end, Jane is not a subordinate, but an equal. She states \\"we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result\\" which lets go of all of their societal/gender role burdens, and assures that they were meant for each other because of their match in personality/character. There are a multitude of themes present in this novel that require an approach from a wholly different perspective. For example, one cannot understand the importance of the character Jane Eyre within literary history, without considering the fact that she was the first strong/independent female protagonist. This novel, overall, is timeless and is a suitable example of feminist ideals."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean.

It was a bit slow for the first 100 pages or so, but still good to read. I just caution people who love good love stories to stick with it if they find it slow."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"** spoiler alert ** After my extreme disappointment with Shirley, I returned to Jane Eyre, which I first read as a 'tween and from time to time afterwards would dip back into the romantic bits no St. John!) to finally read it again cover-to-cover. In this novel, Bronte writes like a pro, opening the story with a conflict that immediately engages her readers' interest in Jane and quickly follows up with another that firmly cements that affection. When the evil Rev. Brocklehurst asks Jane what she must do to avoid the eternal torture of hell, she replies, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die,\\" and her immortality as a literary character is secured. One strength of this novel is the first-person narration with everything seen through Jane's eyes. Although we know her to be a passionate individual, she is also absolutely trustworthy,and the generous and smart woman she becomes plays no games in telling her tale in simple, straightforward narration. We burn with indignation at Aunt Reed and Rev. Brocklehurst, grieve over Helen, share her growing affection for Sophie and Mrs. Fairfax, and rejoice in her discovery that in Rochester she has at last found someone who is her intellectual and emotional equal, the first true friend since leaving Lowood School. In short, in the first two-thirds of Jane Eyre, Bronte's work is close to a masterpiece. However, her story goes off the rails in the St. John Rivers section, the part of the book that many readers dislike and the section most film adaptions do their best to diminish or eliminate. In earlier readings, Jane's decision to flee Thornfield with a few shillings and a small bundle of clothes made perfect sense, and her subsequent discovery that the Rivers siblings were actually family -- her first cousins -- adequate explanation for her decision to share equally with them the fortune left to Jane by their uncle in Madeira. But on this reading I saw how unnecessary, how unJane-like, her flight actually is. Jane has already learned from her Aunt Reed that her uncle intends to leave her his fortune, and it is that uncle who sends his solicitor to crash her wedding and prevent her bogus marriage to Rochester. The solicitor explains exactly that before leaving Thornfield. Above all else, Jane Eyre is smart and capable, smart enough to recognize that her uncle's solicitor will provide her with necessary support and capable enough to get herself to London to receive it. However, a few hours later, Bronte sends Jane rushing across the moors in a coach heading god knows where, a destination that will be determined by how far her meager money can pay for transport. Is this the young woman who ably advertised for a post when she wanted a new life? Is this the young woman who traveled to her aunt's deathbed and remained long enough to help her hateful cousins settle their affairs following their mother's death? Absolutely not. While Jane's flight makes sense, her decision to flee blindly to parts unknown is ludicrous, given everything else we know about her. And so the results of that flight -- her fortuitous discovery of her cousins and the jousting with priggish St. John over his desire to have her join him in his missionary work as his wife -- are ludicrous as well. No wonder readers recoil from that section of the book. Having written Jane out of character and into a tight corner with Rivers, Bronte comes to her rescue with a hokey gimmick -- the sound of Rochester's voice calling her name across the vast moors that divide them. Jane's dear readers are certainly happy that she has found a loving family and secured an income that provides independence. And they're happy that Rochester has proven himself a man of honor in sacrificing his vision and his hand in attempting to save his mad wife from the burning battlements of Thornfield Hall. So they forgive Bronte the flaws of the St. John Rivers section of the novel, glossing over it as quickly as possible to arrive at Jane's well-deserved happy ending. But while not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I just finished reading this for the first time.

Jane Eyre is one of many phenomenal books that will cling to your memory long after you have completed them.Now, in full disclosure, I read this, partly because I was never forced to in college; and partially because I wanted to write a piece of bizarro fiction that was centered around Ms. Eyre (one that does not involve zombies or vampires). But I found myself drawn into the novel and captivated by the storytelling. Even as a man, I found myself empathizing with Eyre, feeling the mud as it clung to my clothes in that desperate moment of dangerous hope and determined self-reliance.

Her new employer harbors a dark secret that Jane doesn't learn until her wedding day - a secret that threatens to change her life forever.Written in an older world style with &#34;million dollar words,&#34; one can excuse the sometimes awkward writing style n favor of an outstanding story that shines through and tugs at your heart.

Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain \\"no significant interest\\"), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (\\"Reader, I married him.\\"--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match.

The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick.

To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy.

These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students. Girls who gravitate toward love stories with sweet sentiments might find the tale of Jane Eyre more enjoyable than others who are not such romantics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story of a young orphaned girl, raised by her uncaring aunt.

The school proves to be of little comfort to as she finds that the conditions there, under the brutal Mr. Brocklehurst, are barely an improvement on her living conditions at home. The school embracing the poverty as way of life and the girls barely getting by was completely under the thumb of Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane's only relief from the burden of hardships at the school is her dear friend Helen, a kind young girl, who imprints in Jane a measure of Christian patience for the pain, which she has endured in her childhood. An outbreak of typhus prompts many of the girls to leave, but Jane to remain as a teacher at the Lowood School. To expand her horizons, she accepts the position at Thornfield manor, caring for the sweet, French ward of the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite her best efforts to the contrary, Jane falls in love with her employer. What secrets lie in Thornfield manor? Why does Jane often feel like she isn't getting the whole story? As Jane begins to realize that things aren't as they appear in Thornfield, she is forced to leave the manor, her young pupil, and Mr. Rochester behind. But can she stay away from her true love for long?Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who was born on 21 April 1816. In 1824 Charlotte and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. Within a year her sisters died of consumption and their father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. The critical depiction of the school at Lowood in Jane Eyre drew on Charlotte's experiences at Cowan Bridge and her eldest sister, Maria, was the inspiration for the character of Helen Burns. In 1847 she published Jane Eyre under the pseudonym of Currer Bell. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls and died shortly after due to complications with pregnancy.Jane Eyre is definitely a book everyone should consider reading. It helps define some many things including: love and independence. The entire time Jane pulls you on the emotional roller coaster of life. You go up and down with her through her love of Rochester. This book brings you into it so quickly that before you know it you are crying at the end too! And that's the kind of book you want, the kind that makes you feel like there is nothing quite as beautiful as the relationship between the characters. This book inspired me to read more from the entire Bronte collection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter.

While the first couple of chapters are somewhat boring, after that the pace never flags, despite the 500-odd-page length. Many chapters in the book are very intense and moving, and it is not too hard to feel for Jane. I thought she might be a very righteous, prim-and-proper person, but was surprised and delighted to discover that she's very flirtatious with Rochester once they declare their love, and playfully delights in her hold over him. Their conversations are fascinating and very revealing. It is always clear that she is passionatly in love with him and no one else, but still more than willing to leave him once the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed. While not quite as strong and feminist a character as I expected, she nonetheless does show an iron will and desperate desire to do what's right more than once. When someone in the book was talking about a Mr. Rochester and made it sound like he'd died, my heart literally stopped for a minute until I (and Jane) realized the man was talking about Rochester's father. That was near the end, and by then I'd become so caught up in it I really couldn't put it down. It is not just a romance novel for women; I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoyed it immensely.

(I'll get to him later, though) This is only the second novel I've read that has a main protagonist that is quite similar to me in personality, which is refreshing in itself. (Most novels have spirited, strong-willed people as the main character--not that it's wrong, it just gets boring after around 500 readings.) I identify with Jane because in many ways, for she acts and reacts as I would in her situation. And Mr. Rochester....I fell in love with him with the first chapter I read (which was Chapter 27; I cheated) and have not stopped since. *Sigh, Giggle*These characters are so brilliantly drawn out--no other classic has done a better job of making me feel as if these characters are dynamic people.The prose sparkles--especially Mr. Rochester's, who I find has the gift of turning me into a pile of mush.In short, this is the best classic I've ever read, and the only one that I will definitely read over again and again and again.....(The only one that came close was Pride and Prejudice) No other story has made feel as this one did--this gothic story of passion and love captivates me and will continue to do so.P.S. The only problem I had with Jane's character is when my darling Edward is singing to her, and she is fairly unaffected. I was sobbing on the floor and yelling at Jane at why she was not doing the same thing. Any one else feel the same way?PPS: Some people might say that she is strong and strong-willed, but she is not. Rather, she is strong-principled. She does not have to have her own way, but when it comes to God's way, she is more spirited about it.PPPS: And I am not Dwight Rhodes. I'm his daughter. Couldn't you tell?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Since it was penned by Charlotte Bronte in 1847 (under the male pseudonym of Currier Bell), Jane Eyre has been adapted to the screen several times, including a beautiful BBC Television production scheduled to air soon on PBS, and a musical. I even seem to recall an abridged comicbook version of Jane Eyre. I read the novel when I was 12 years old and was so inspired by it that I read it over many times that year, and never, never forgot it. Interestingly, I am now reading it for the first time since. I have little to add to the other reviews here, but recommend this book to everyone! The author develops Jane's tremendous character, childhood to young adulthood, with economy and care. The early chapters of the book are both painful and lovely to read. The love story that follows is passionate and terribly hard fought. Told in the first person, much of what I experience reading this book, due to our author's skill, is not written on the page, but felt as my own experience. And Mr. Rochester is, if possible, a more brilliant revelation this time around. He is completely compelling and magnetic, humorous and desperate, and sympathetic. The book also provides a portrait of how life was at that time, by the aristocracy and the common man. I have edited this review to add my advice that if you have never read the book, whether or not you have seen any of the film versions, choose an edition without an added \\"forward,\\" or save comments for last, so that do not encounter spoilers and can form your own impressions.Reader, .... read Jane Eyre!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job of creating a strong female character, the strongest I've read, with a good heart and unbreakable morals. Jane is smart and witty, and her dialogue makes for a very enjoyable read. The language, however tricky it may be, is wonderful and wraps around you, taking you back to 1800. The romance between Jane and her master Mr. Rochester is a classic, and Jane's story is one that all should be a part of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a truly excellent book. I find that I enjoy Charlotte Bronte's writing more than Jane Austen (who is very wordy and could have used a good editor). The strange circumstances surrounding Mr. Rochester and his first wife, and the romance between Jane and Rochester make this book a very enjoyable read. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I gather this is required reading at a lot of high schools these days, and I'm sure that a lot of today's high schoolers do indeed think of it as a drag. It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I will be honest, the first fifty pages of Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are tough to get through, the story moves slowly as Bronte sets up the plot and introduces us to many of the major characters. I will get back to this in a minute...&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; tells the story of Jane, who is orphaned as a child and must live with her terrible aunt, who decides to send her off to Lowood School in order to learn discipline. Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic. I guarantee it will have you in tears.Charlotte's writing is beautiful, moving, and descriptive. She is unmatched as a mistress of character development."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte created quite an admirable heroine. Jane Eyre is, without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Also, the love story has a modern quality that tells the reader that this book was ahead of its time.As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre had to endure many adversities in order to secure her status as a governess in the home of Mr. Rochester, a temperamental man with a dark secret -- a secret that could destroy the powerful bond he'd had with Jane Eyre.This novel has revolutionized romantic fiction; it has influenced many writers. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite heroines; I will always admire her courage and independence. I applaud Charlotte Bronte for having invented such an unforgettable character.

Well here's one! I am 23 years old and have just finished it for my literature class, but it's not unprobable I would have read it otherwise anyway, sience it is a classic. Anyway, I first of all think it was very well written with a fluent language. The main reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, is because of the way the writer seems to understand and symphatise with her characters (which are all very real), even for the ones that have faults she condemns. You might think I, being a man (or a boy), could not identify with Jane, but in many ways I could. Maybe because Charlotte Bront is so superb in making her literal world coming alive, that I almost feel I'm there myself, or maybe just because Jane Eyre is the kind of person you'd want to be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a plain woman in looks, but her intelligence, strength, and feistiness make her a heroine who I think gives much-needed justice to women of her time. She is a spitfire who makes you want to know her and hear her story, and she tells it in a clear, first-person fashion that makes it an easy story to read.Orphaned at a young age, Jane is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who abuse Jane physically and mentally for ten years. Eventually ejected from her aunt's household on false charges of thievery, Jane is then packed off to Lowood, a charity boarding school whose conditions were deplorable; students were scarcely provided with food and clothing (think Oliver Twist), and were regularly terrorized by the school's cruel headmaster. If that weren't enough, Jane's only real friend at Lowood dies during an outbreak of Typhus.Fast-forward eight years - Jane, still nearly penniless after a two-year stint as a teacher at Lowood, ventures out to make a life for herself as a governess. Her charge is a precocious French child named Adele, with whom she develops a fast friendship. But the real story of Eyre lies in her relationship with the child's foster parent, Mr. Rochester, the dolefule, aloof, yet passionate and somewhat mysterious master of Thornfield. Despite their differing castes and the 20 years separating their ages, their feelings for each other grow deep, and they decide to marry. But it doesn't go exactly as Jane had planned - their wedding ceremony is stopped when it is revealed that Mr. Rochester is already married - to a madwoman whom he has kept locked up in one of Thornfield's bedrooms for years!Horrified, Jane flees Thornfield, ending up a beggar on the streets because she spent her entire savings to leave. Eventually taken in by a clergyman, St. John Rivers, and his two sisters, Jane makes a new life for herself as a teacher. During this time, Jane finds herself the sole heir of her father's estate. Soon after, St. John proposes marriage to her repeatedly, but Jane finds his cold demeanor lacking in comparison to the man she truly loves, Mr. Rochester. (She also finds out that St. John is actually her first cousin - a staple of this genre, it seems.) Prompted by hearing Rochester's voice calling her name during a prayer for guidance, Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find it burned down, and Mr. Rochester blinded by the fire his wife set before killing herself. Naturally, Jane and Mr. Rochester live happily ever after, but if you think this is merely another sappy love story (which I am no fan of!), you would be wrong. In Eyre, Charlotte Bronte shows us a depth and realness of characters which you would be hard-pressed to find in any other novel.Do yourself a favor by reading it - you'll understand why it's considered one of the finest examples of English literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \\"Reader, I married him\\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"It is best to be yourself, imperial, plain and true.\\" Robert BrowningAnother chick Brit classic that I had been eluding since my teen-age years and finally got around to perusing this past month. In all fairness to our fellow reviewers who panned this one, I wouldn't have enjoyed this when I was in high school (nor even in college for that matter) either and would have needed a dictionary along with a barf-bag if I was required to read it back then. I have no idea why teachers continue to shove such classics as this down their student's throats when the great majority of their budding brains, inexperienced hearts and raging hormones make it virtually impossible to fully digest at such an age. However, that is a topic better tabled for another time...To describe this beautiful work as simply a love story would be doing it a grave injustice. While it is arguably one of the greatest love stories ever known in literature (I actually prefer \\"Jane Eyre\\" over her younger sister's classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\"), it is so, so, so much more than that. This 1847 masterpiece is an important history lesson as well on what it was like living in provincial England way back when. It touches upon such common themes as morality, religion, gender relations, Social status, friendship, education, etc... A story such as this can relate so much more about the past than most text books will ever tell us, while at the same time making the whole learning experience a joy as well.Of all the past heroines I have had the pleasure (or sometimes the disdain) of being introduced to through my literary travels, it is almost impossible to think of one that possessed a bigger heart and more passionate soul than C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. I found her to be much more interesting and even brighter than James' Isabel Archer, without the latter's pretentiousness. She is way more down-to-earth and less judgmental than Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. She is much more grounded and has a much stronger backbone than Hardy's Tess. However, what really separates her from all the other heroic belles of invention is simply her burning, incessant quest to find love and to be loved in return. Not just romantic love, like Flaubert's Emma B. and Tolstoy's Anna K. but REAL sustaining love, the kind that brings value and a sense of belonging. The sincere kind that comes from not having to sacrifice (as the above mentioned did) one's own principles and ethics. It is this noble and true love that never dies or withers, because it is genuine and magnanimous, without any kind of contrivances whatsoever. Jane never sold out and held steadfast to her beliefs and values, and in the end, well... you'll have to discover that on your own!You don't need me to rehash the book's plot. You can read other people's reviews to do that. All you need to know is one thing - if you haven't had the pleasure yet of meeting Ms. Eyre and you love literature, then please do yourself a favor and order this one today.

Can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is an exciting coming-of-age tale that spans her life from age 10 to about age 30. This is a classic that I think young women will enjoy because it presents a strong heroine in Jane, who faces hardship and temptation as she grows up and later deals with romance and creating a secure, stable position in life for herself.As a man, reading the book for the first time, I enjoyed watching the story unfold through Jane's eyes. Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Nope, I've never read this book until now. Can you believe it?! One of my goals for 2011 was to finally read the classic Jane Eyre and I am so glad I did! I get nervous reading classics. Alas my concerns were for naught because I thoroughly loved this book and I would highly recommend that everyone read this classic novel if they never have before (or re-read it if they haven't read it since high-school)!Having enticed my book club to join me in reading it since the movie adaptation was coming out in March as well, we had Jane Eyre as our March book pick, so with that I settled in for a classic read. Every time I sat down to read this book it would take a few pages to get back into the language but once I did, it didn't bother me and I totally understood everything that was going on, I just let it wash over me.Jane, how I loved you. You were strong at a time when many women were not. Your life sucked! If you are ever feeling down about yourself, pick this book up because it will make you feel better about your own lot. Poor little Jane did not have an easy start in life but she dealt with her hand and got through it, becoming quite the young little lady.Then she met Edward Rochester. Oh my goodness, brooding, ugly (as defined by Jane), kinda mean to his ward Adele, hiding crazy wives in the attic, Rochester. And guess what, even with all of this against him? We still kind of love him! Jane wants Rochester and Rochester wants Jane, but there are twists in the plot to keep them apart so will they be together? Oh so much angst and pining in this book will be had!Like I said, I am so glad I read it and would heartily recommend it to others. Everyone in my book club really enjoyed it as well, some more than others, and all seemed glad they read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I thought I would never read Jane Eyre. I'd seen the old Joan Fontaine-Orson Welles film - very nice - and that seemed to be enough for me. But Amazon's generous list of free or nearly free classics for Kindle got me to thinking I might try some of the Victorian novels I had long resisted. And I'm so glad I did.Jane Eyre turned out to be a surprisingly exciting, even thrilling read! It was very hard for me to put it down, and I was up many nights until 2AM because I wanted to know what would happen next. I can't believe a 160-year old novel could cast such a spell on me, but it did.This is a very satisfying, very exciting and emotional book. It is not so simple as any of the movie versions would lead you to believe. Jane is a wonderfully complex and compelling character, especially as she endures the struggles between her heart and her reason, between her desires and what she feels is right.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was not familiar with Charlotte Bronte's works so I decided to give it a go, and the fact that it was free was helpful. However, I did enjoy the story.I do like period novels, but sometimes they just don't cut it. This being a period novel, written by someone that experienced it themselves was helpful. Also, the romantic aspect was wonderful. The plot was quite simple, but yet, beautifully written all at the same time. That is what really made this an enjoyable read.I found myself routing for Jane and Mr. Rochester at the end. I truly wanted a very happy ending for her.

Until she came across this illustrated version with the font that someone else complained here about. :) Funny, but \\"gothic-like\\" illustrations in Tim Burton style and wiggly font attracted my 15 years old child. I am very greatful that classic book had been re-introduced in a way that she could relate to it.The language is not simple. I found a good solution for my daughter.

Even though I did not entirely understand the words used, I became involved in the book emotionally so that I understood how the character, Jane Eyre, felt. I related to the book based on my teenage dating years and fell in love with the story and the poetic writing.

Consider me hooked."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The introduction includes a dedication and thanks to William Makepeace Thackery, author of Vanity Fair. Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"one of my favorite romances. i reread jane eyre at least once a year. just about wear out my copy. good read for all ages.... look for the movie with orsen wells and joan fontain excuse name spelling.. windy"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read Wuthering Heights a number of years ago and never was very interested in it. I didnt think to explore the other Bronte sisters' works till now - and this book is incredible! The way Jane's emotions are described, her moral struggles, her strength, and the depth of her love, is just moving. I finished this book in two days. The language is beautiful, character development rich, and scenes dont move too slow. Anyone who's been prematurely judged in life or has loved to the point of heartbreak will see themselves in Jane. Amazing.

It is a classic that combines mystery and romance effortlessly, in a writing style that is beautifully unique.Jane Eyre is not a heroine, at least in her own opinion. She's orphaned, but educated; penniless, but not without family: just none that would claim her. She accepts a job as a governess to a young French girl named Adele, a Mr. Rochester's ward, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter.Thus begins the epic romance between the young, plain governess and her grizzled, older employer. But the question remains: can the overcome the greatest obstacle of all - Mr. Rochester's best-kept secret?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved this book. I can say that the begining was a little boring but as you keep reading you feel captivated by all the obstacles that Jane has to overcome in life. It is a beautiful reading that promotes real love and not just superficial love, the characters are not beautiful or perfect and even thought they are described as ugly, you can not help but to fall in love with them and cry or laugh with them. In general a great reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Somehow I managed to get through high school and a minor's worth of Brit Lit credits in college (including a Victorian literature class) without ever having to have read this book or seeing any of the movies, numerous as they are. Oddly enough, a facebook quiz is what prompted an interest in this book that I knew close to nothing about beforehand.This book really captured my attention and it has been years since I have loved a book such as this. I usually don't take an interest in novels where love is a major theme of the book, but this is a fine exception. The author captivates the reader so thoroughly through the titled character it is like being told a story with a literary painting. The style of Charlotte Bronte's writing is beautiful, and despite predictability at times, it does not withhold any suspense.As for the edition of this book, the illustrations in both black and white and in colour from artist Darcy Dame made this a great edition. I really can't say how much I loved the illustrations. There is something dark, haunting, and paranormal to these illustrations which is so fitting of the Victorian era, well-known for their high interest in the occult. When I saw this edition in a store, I knew immediately that this was the perfect edition for me, as I love interesting pictures in books. I also have a certain love for ink drawings, so the images within the pages are very welcome as well. This certainly beats many of the dreary looking versions of this book. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, in it's most literal sense, but an interesting exterior never hurts a good novel.As for other aesthetics of this edition: the paper is good and the colour illustrations are printed on glossy paper. This is of course in paperback, but it is very nice for paperback and I'm surprised that it did not cost more. A typical edition of Jane Eyre seems to be in the 300-page mark, but this one nears 550 pages due to the slightly larger font which is very welcome when reading heavier works."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the most fabulous book ever written.

Then you go back to it years and years later and find that not only does it maintain its quality, but it reveals an even further message you might have missed the first time- almost like a whole different story that just helps to illuminate the story you gleaned from it the first time you read it. While I don't find it \\"gothic\\" in the traditional sense, I do see those elements, but most predominate is a story that can be believeable and one which people can relate to on some level with one character or another in today's world. That is why its still a favorite for me after all these years. I consider it a romance novel told through the eyes of a character who does not want to speak about romance; just experiences it. Subtle and refined, but outgoing and with strong convictions at the same time. Same as the character of Jane. And same as Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is wonderful!

Once of the strongest female characters I have ever read - loved it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As a caveat I must say that I am not a huge fan of the \\"Regency\\" novel. And this novel is so typical of that style of 19th Century British Literature. There is a different view of virtue in the Regency novel. In some novels, virtue is defined as heroism in battle, in others virtue is fidelity to one's morals and integrity. In Jane Eyre, virtue is defined as fidelity to one's class or station in society. And this woman, an orphan and governess by profession, is at the bottom of rural English aristocratic society.The character Jane Eyre is best described, at the risk of being crude, as a doormat. Her only concern is to do whatever is necessary to please those around her. In this heart breaking story, Jane goes from being a student in a school for orphaned little girls to being governess to a Mr. Rochester, who is a rude and self-centered man. Rochester takes a liking to Jane because of her never-wavering devotion to his comfort and ego, so he asks her to marry him. And on her wedding day, she finds out that Rochester already has a living wife, a woman who is chained up in his attic because of her madness. Despite the fact that Rochester already has a wife, he asks Jane to live with him as though Jane were his wife. To her credit, Jane does not agree to this. She has enough self-esteem to run away at this insistence, although she takes nothing with her and is impoverished in her flight.So Jane ends up as a pauper on the doorstep of a random rural English family, only to fortuitously discover later that this family are actually her long lost first cousins. They accept her as family after requiring her to spend a cold winter night asleep outside on their doorstep. Ultimately the young man, who is a parson at the local church, asks Jane to marry him. Jane refuses, not because he is her first cousin (interesting how family relationships were viewed so much differently in 19th century rural England than they are today), but because he thinks of Jane more as a colleague than as a romantic partner. Despite her refusal to marry him, she agrees to travel with him to India as a fellow missionary, but he refuses because he wants her as a wife. She is willing to give up her life in the service of a man who wants only to use her, but then this is the same attitude she had toward Rochester. It is definitely a trend in Jane Eyre's life.In the meantime, Jane learns (also fortuitously) that she is the sole heir of a foreign fortune left to her by a long lost uncle. The fortune would elevate her to a member of the gentry, but Jane, being true to her station and her self-identity as a doormat, splits the fortune with her undeserving cousins. However, at least now she is not destitute. She returns to Rochester to discover that Rochester's crazy wife has escaped her chains, burned down the house, killing herself and blinding him. His future is bleak, but this only makes him more attractive to Jane Eyre. She marries him and rebuilds his house and estate. And, at long last, Rochester sees her as more than a tool. It is a nice ending, I suppose, at least as good as it gets for the Regency novel.It is difficult for a 21st century American to relate to the kind of self-degradation that Jane Eyre not only endures but actively works toward in the face of the prospect of a better life. Perhaps it is a tale of true love, unconditional in the face of adversity. It is also a sad commentary on the social values of a bygone era. If nothing else, Jane Eyre offers an answer to those silly nostalgic people who see 19th Century rural England as some sort of golden era. We can be thankful that, in our era, these kinds of values of self-debasement are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"THIS IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT AND GRIPPING STORY.

Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull.

There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In the 156 years since its publication, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been a source of controversy - first, over its suitability for and, later, its portrayal of women. When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, \\"Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus\\".Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years laterbetween ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitable relationship.Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?The final third of the book - the \\"Whitcross section\\" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.The book's epilogue, beginning, \\"Reader, I married him\\" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as \\"free as solitude\\", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Tis story had a little of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and more. I love this book and could not put it down. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a beautifully romantic and riveting experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In this timeless first-person narrative, Jane Eyre --a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan-- recounts her childhood and latter years leading to her marriage to the mysterious Edward Rochester.What make the story fast-paced, fascinating, and ultimately admirable are not the mundane events and incidents that happen to her, but the manner in which she tells them. Within a few pages it becomes obvious that the narrator is a character who is a master of the English language. Her sentence openers are well thought out, well measured, and well balanced--a veritable fountain of wisdom.In addition, Jane owns a terrific imagination, which coupled with her lust for life, will get her to where she wants to go--but only after she experiences hurt, physical abuse, and much suffering.The novel goes through five distinct stages:1. Gateshead. This is the residence of Jane spends of her childhood, and where she experiences the cruelties volleyed at her by her aunt (Mrs. Reed) and cousins.2. Lowood School. In this school she meets the mystic Helen Burns and Maria Temple, whom Jane admires and sees as a role model. In this school she also endures the headmaster's humiliations and gratuitous abuses.3. Thornfield Manor. The manor is owned by Edward Rochester, who is her employer and with whom she falls in love.4. Moor House or Marsh's End. Owned by the Rivers family who happen to be her relatives. Here Jane received a marriage proposal from her passionless clergyman-cousin St John Rivers.5. Ferndean. A second house owned by her beloved Rochester.While we enjoy child characters such as Dickens' David Copperfield, Little Dorritt, and Pip, we admire Jane Eyre much more because she is proud and shows a fighting spirit. She fights back. \\"I resisted all the way: a new thing for me,\\" she tells us as Bessie takes her to be locked in the red-room, following a fight with the brat John Reed.She doesn't just let things happen to her; and the fact that very same spirit gets her in trouble, she also fights extricate herself from her predicaments. Resourceful is the word that fits Jane. I always admire the passage in the novel in which she wants change in her life and how an epiphany comes to her: Advertise! And that single action gets her not only her first employment, but also her first and only love: Mr. Rochester. But little did she know the mystery that engulfed the manor, and much less the source of the hideous laughter: \\"While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ears. It was a curious laugh - distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped\\"The author, Charlotte Bronte, a magician of the English language will take you back to England as it was in the 1840s, making you experience the highs and lows of life in England during that period.Jane Eyre is true work of literature that will introduce readers of any age to memorable characters and a story that is inexhaustible in its wisdom. Not long ago I was moved by all the attention given to J. K. Rowling and her lovable character Harry Potter. Moved I was but not fascinated as I am every time I re-read Jane Eyre. While J. K. Rowling is an entertainer, Charlotte Bronte is a literary artist.If you like low-brow romances you won't find it here. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn't quite fit. While the novel may be read as a critique of both gender and social class, it contains a strong feminist stance:Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.Or,And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude and many associates, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.The protagonist and narrator has no amazing qualities, she's a plain girl and it says so, many times in the novel, but she shows some endearing qualities --which I won't mention-- that readers inevitably discover.Ahead of her times, Charlotte Bronte, hints and unveils as much as it was permitted then, erotic tensions, boundless passions, and hateful marriage ironies. These were not qualities encouraged in Victorian women writers, and Jane Eyre was offensive to many a contemporary. That a woman should expose her inner most feelings, was unheard of:I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.Jane Eyre is a trans-formative book from which we can all learn. I always say that the depths of human emotions one doesn't find in either in psychology book or philosophical tracts--but only in fiction. \\"Reader, I married him.\\"Read it!The writing techniques I use in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:Sentence Openers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved the cover to this book.

The novel, dense, surprising and powerful, is illuminated in these remarkable illustrations by Fritz Eichenberg. (You are able to view a sampling of them on this page.)

Although it may be a classic, it is one tough book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the \\"confusing\\" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, \\"Jane Eyre\\"."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"because this book deserves it. I first read it in the 9th grade, and it was literally a struggle to the very end. Summoning all my effort, I laboriously read this book with a lack of interest unsurpassed to this very day. It was useful only when I had trouble falling asleep.Each page of this dull, overly dramatic book felt like an eternity. There are pages upon pages of meaningless and increasingly uninteresting rambling. Plain Jane gains no sympathy from me. Apparently, she enjoys suffering, as evidenced by her constantly changing opinions and the way she strives to make her life more difficult when handed easier options. (Ex: When the guy finally admits his love for her, she goes off into the rain, poor and near-death, upon the advising of some voices she hears.)The plot is long and unbelievable. For example, how can you hide a woman in your house for years, a woman who, by the way, screams, throws fits, and sets things on fire? And nobody notices this? The ending is no better -- sappy and contrived, it left me ill.Absolutely hideous, I would not even recommend this to the worst of my enemies. This book fails to become even briefly captivating. It starts off horribly and, impossible as it may seem, only gets worse throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be \\"Plain Jane\\", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, I was glad to be done with this book. Most women enjoy and appreciate Jane Eyre, but since I am 15 I have a different opinion.Jane Eyre is 641 pages of a woman trying to find herself. Jane, the main character, goes to a charitable school for 1/4 of the book. During school, nothing really happens. Yes, Jane and her classmates are treated poorly, but it didn't hold my attention. The book does pick up until after Jane leaves school.From there Jane meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. The only thing about their relationship is Jane is 19 or 20 and Mr. Rochester is almost 40. I felt that I could not relate to these characters because today such an age difference is looked down upon by people. Of course Jane and Mr. Rochester plan to get married, but Jane finds out about Mr. Rochester's deepest darkest secret. THEN SHE RUNS AWAY! What a stupid girl. Jane may have been an independent woman, but big deal; so many women today are independent. Is that why so many people love this book? When Jane runs away, this part of Jane Eyre is so unbelievably boring. Jane meets her cousins, but realizes that she still loves Mr. Rochester. Not much happens except Mr. Rochester is blind. Jane and Mr. Rochester get married and live happily ever after.You might love this book, but as I said before I am only 15 and can not appreciate Jane Eyre, the character and the book. If you are a teenager like me do not read Jane Eyre or even waste your time. Maybe if you are older and found your true love, you might love every minute of this book. I recommend if you are young, read a book that takes place during the present, not the past."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't. You'd be better off guessing on the test than being utterly confused and bored to tears."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book should not be placed in the same class with other &quot;classic&quot; authors who deserve their place. This book is a bore, the main character is a whiny cry-baby and the book goes nowhere for a long time. Jane has a very thick skull and all the obvious things fly over her head. This book should not be a classic, and I do not understand why it is one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"You've probably heard the expression that a million monkeys typing for a million years eventually will reproduce the works of William Shakespeare. I give \\"Jane Eyre\\" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is \\"This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\\" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This was a Book club suggestion.

Both of her parents died when she was little, so she was raised by her wealthy Aunt Mrs. Reed. Like Cinderella, Mrs. Reed favors her own children rather than Jane. This book shows how the need for Love can cause so many complications in Jane's life.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane off to a school named Lowood. This gave Jane a chance to be independent and live her own life. She soon made a good friend named Helen, who always encouraged her when she feels down. When Jane found out that Helen is sick from a disease called consumption, she rushes to see her. Helen soon died in Jane's arms, which made her feel sad because she had just lost a good friend. There was no one there to make Jane feel better anymore. This was the first complication in her life.After a couple years at Lowood, she became one of their teachers. After two years of being a teacher at Lowood, she wanted to experience something new, so she arrives at Thornfield to teach an eight-year-old French girl Adele. Mr. Rochester was the owner of Thornfield. Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire caused by a servant and secretly falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester brought back a beautiful young woman Blanche to his house, Jane developed a huge tub of jealousy towards her. Jane couldn't stop thinking what would happen with Mr. Rochester and Blanche. Jane was forced to attend a party where Blanche and her mom were there also. They didn't treat her very nicely causing her to leave the party. While watching Mr. Rochester and Blanche together, she thinks they would get married soon. This made Jane think that she should maybe let go of the feelings she had for Mr. Rochester. Her love for Mr. Rochester was the second complication in her life.Jane founds out later on that her Aunt Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke. Jane tries to relieve the hatred her aunt has for her, but she didn't want to and soon died. This made Jane sad because she barely had a chance to talk with her aunt and say good-bye. Jane didn't want things to end how it did with her aunt because it's not a good feeling knowing someone still hates you after they die. This is another complication to her life.Mr. Rochester bumps into Jane in the garden, and they started walking together. Mr. Rochester tells Jane that he is thinking about asking Blanche to marry him. This caused Jane to turn into a jealous woman. She quickly tells him how much she loves him and stunned to find out that Mr. Rochester actually wanted to marry her and not Blanche. She didn't believe his words. Mr. Rochester explained that he only said he wanted to marry Blanche to see what her reaction would be. Jane happily accepts and agrees to marry Mr. Rochester. Mrs. Fairfax doesn't agree with the marriage because she views Mr. Rochester as a proud man and too old for her. Jane was very uncomfortable hearing those words from Mrs. Fairfax. Jane began to have weird dreams of her children dying or crying for help which causes her to be more uncomfortable for she doesn't know what is happening and why she is having such dreams. Despite what Mrs. Fairfax said or the dreams she's been having, she still wanted to marry Mr. Rochester because she loved him very much. They were walking down the aisle ready to be announced husband and wife when someone announced a secret that ruined the whole evening.Will Jane ever find happiness and love or will she be lonely with no one to care for her? Read to find out if this will be the end of Jane and Rochester's love for each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester... I KNEW IT WS HIM!!! and when she finds out he ******** ( dont wanna ruin anything!)and i was like... woa...wow...no way... and then they all ******* ( oh, there i go again, i'm horrible!)i thought it was allvery interesting.i recomend this book to someone who likes to read. and someone whos interesed in england in the 1800's, or even someone who likes love stories.i think anyone would like i really.BYE! its past my bed time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first tried to read this book in 3rd grade. I got through 200 pages but couldn't take any more.Now I'm going into 7th grade, and I've actually read it. This book really isn't that reader-friendly, and you have to (really)force yourself through some parts. But the rewards are great. Right after those long, monotonous sequences are over, you'll run into a really unexpected twist in the storyline that will shock you.I can understand why people give this book bad ratings, but in my opinion, the highs are worth the lows."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"While Jane Eyre is supposed to be one of the greatest novels of all time I can't say that I liked it nor disliked it. I don't think that I liked the character of Jane very much. I understand that she was mistreated and that she also lived in the 1700's but I still think that she was rude. She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick. Maybe I didn't like her character because I have self confidence and am very opiniated. Neverthless, I still believe that Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, I don't love or hate many characters, but I hated Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book for an english project and I got a 60% on it cuz I trashed the book. All i said was that the classics are not going to be so appealing to modern &quot;young&quot; readers like myself today because the &quot;novel&quot;(not jane eyre, read this literaly) has suddenly risen so much in content, state and depth. I dunno, perhaps if i was living during that era i would have appreciated the book more, but living in the 90's where you have authors such as atwood there's no competition and you really can't compare novels written before the 20th century to novels written in the 20th century anyway. Like a majority of the classics, the plot is almost always predictable and characters are indeed relatable but hell, boring! charles dickens is probably the most boring writer i've ever come across (no offence to all u dickens fans out there) and jane austen comes pretty close to him,though her books have a longer attention span. And the brontes, they're on the same level. I am not saying that the classics are bad cuz i know that if it weren't for these authors, we'd be nowhere in literature as we are now. However, my argument in my project was that books have suddenly become more interesting thru the years.

Why the heck would she marry that weird, bad-tempered, hairy scary man? If I found out that my fiance had kept his insane first wife in the attic and not told me, I'd file for divorce! He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram?

I was squirming around and restless for Jane to get over herself and her ridiculous moral stand--I just wanted her to get her a** back to Edward where she belonged! I was TOTALLY against her when she refused to marry him--it really made no sense to me. I just didn't think that he had done anything wrong. He was such a victim. Poor Edward Rochester.

Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a really good book. It's a little hard to read because Charlotte Bronte describes everything in such great detail, but that adds to the image of the book.

English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others \\"critically acclaim\\" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic. It is not as fabulous as they say.The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved. Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says. She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above. The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy. The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel. I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will. It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it. If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'. If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'. If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Like all great literature JANE EYRE can be read again and again revealing new truths and raising fresh questions. For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane EyreJane Eyre is a novel set in 1800's England. It is about a young girl, Jane, who wants to escape her horrible life with her aunt and abusive cousins. Her parents died when she was a little girl. She wants to go to school and eventually teach. Jane is a smart girl who loves to read, but is not very fond of her appearance. Jane Eyre tells the tale of a woman's experiences in life, about men, friendship, and hardship. When taking a job as a governess, Jane stumbles upon a love she did not intend, and a mystery she's determined to solve.Although Jane Eyre is not exactly my cup of tea there were some positive points to the book. The character Jane Eyre is a very good role model for young women. She is not some stunningly gorgeous princess in a castle, she's very real in the sense that she has insecurities like everyone else. She may struggle with her appearance, but she is very smart and articulate, and does not rely on men to take care of her. She's very independent and uses her brains, not her looks to get what she wants. Appearance is something almost every adolescent girl has struggled with, despite what time period they've grown up in. Jane Eyre presents a positive message to girls.Unfortunately, the rest of the novel was not quite as inspiring. In general, I found Jane Eyre to be very dull and boring, and far too long. The literature style was very bland. When reading Jane Eyre the voice in my head became monotonous, I was ready to fall asleep! With so much detail when describing the characters or setting, it seems like it takes Charlotte Bronte two or three pages just to describe a chair.Extremely long and boring at times, Jane Eyre captures the time period well, almost too well with the amount of detailed description on every page. The character Jane is very interesting, complex, and well-written, but she needs a different author to put her into a better story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"These days there are a lot of these 'trashy' romance novels being published. But the ovels written by Jane Austen, The Brontes(Charlotte, Ann &amp; Emily),Georgette Heyer (all are English)have nothing trashy in them. They're so good that I wish that I was there in England during the 16th &amp; 17th century. Jane Eyre was one of my all-time favourites, thoough I didn't realise it back then when I 1st read it. I had the misfortune of reading the abridged version &amp; I'm sure many of the beautiful English phrases would've been deleted. I don't really remember the whole story in detail, but I do recall a brief outline. It's about a lady Jane Eyre, who falls in love with Mr.Rochester(I THINK he's her employer, I'm not really sure) But later, it's revealed that Mr. Rochester has a wife, who is also mentally deranged. I really don't remember what happens in the end, but I DO remember one thing. At the beginning, when the novel unfolds, I thought it was kind of scary. There were these wierd sounds coming from above, but later it was all explained.(I won't tell u how. You've got 2 read it &amp; find out!) All in all, it's one of my favourites &amp; I recommend it to anybody who loves romance novels set in ENgland."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This review has to do with this edition for Kindle.

For once, here is a woman who is intelligent, independent, vulnerable, wise, naive, cold, passionate, practical and creative all at same time. She is not someone who is easily placed in a nice, neat category and labeled, and those who call her \\"depressed\\" really miss the point. Although the language may not be modern the topics that Charlotte Bronte discusses are very relevant. What really surprises me is that so many people feel so threatened by such an \\"old\\" book. Why is the theme that you have to follow your own heart rather than the dictates of society so confrontational a subject to some people? It has nothing to do with either sex or gender, just a very human desire for freedom. Maybe some of the book's critics should wait a few years and re-read it when it isn't a required reading.

The majestry of the characters that Charlotte Bronte offers us is near perfection. With this it is also good to see a refreshing and different perspective of the upper class and its ways during this time period.

Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It was still well written and CB is good at keeping her readers interested in the characters and the plotting of the story. The ending was rather a bit too predictable for me and after investing two sleepless nights into this book, I was extreamly disappointed in the ending of this story. It is also a romance novel. I am not a great fan of romance novles without a complicated and intensely created plot so this element of the book did not appeal to me at all. I should've read this book as a young adult, as this is the audience the book is geared to. I would've enjoyed it more then. But if you are a fan of romance novels with many trials and tribulations of course thrown in, this is an elegant tale for you.Now in assessing the art of this book. When I first looked through this book and read it I was not happy, though not disappointed in the artwork. After reading this book and looking at the artwork of other versions of this story, I was a little miffed. The artwork is mostly of Jane Eyre, and none of the artwork really captured her features and personality at all. This cast a darkned element over the book and almost \\"forced\\" a victorian viewpoint of this story. I think the artwork of other versions are much better by comparrison."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Of all classic female authors (Jane Austin, Mary Shelly, for instance), and of all classic novels with a female protagonist, I find Charlotte Bronte as the most brilliant, and Jane Eyre to be the most memorable. I first read this book when i was a freshman in highschool, and loved it. Now I'm reading it as an upcoming college freshman. I not only still love it as I did then, but I'm deeply moved. I'm touched by how I personally connect with Jane Eyre, who not only has the wit, intelligence, honesty, and flourishing independence that constitutes the spirit of many female characters, like that from Jane Austin, but who stands the test of time as more than just a witty, intelligent female. Jane Eyre is a woman, a woman that all can relate to. Also, I love how the novel itself was written. Charlotte Bronte weaves in all the elements of a good story--suspense, passion, mystery, gothicism-- while entwining emotions like love, hate, death, regret, sadness, rebirth, and forgiveness. This is more than just a gothic novel, more than just a novel with a statement about Victorian society. It's a novel with heart, courage, and a journey that never ends in the heart, mind, and spirit. This is what real literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love nineteenth century British literature as much as anyone. This book, however, is mediocre at best. The symbolism is blatant and contrived to the point of being distracting. In fact, the whole story is extremely contrived, even for a romance. Neither are Charlotte's characters endearing enough to make the novel worthwhile. Jane, Rochester, and Adele are all a bit annoying rather than charming or good or even evil. And I have no idea why this novel would be considered Gothic, the only thing that qualifies that idea is all the ridiculous magic that's going on. Actually, the second half of the novel reads more like an Austen husband hunt with a little bit of weirdness thrown in.The Lowood section is redeeming, however. The description smacks of Dickens, chiding the English for their treatment of the helpless. The characters of the Brocklehursts are beautifully rendered hypocrites.Emily's Wuthering Heights is by far the better read if you're after a Bronte. All of her characters have depth so that even the villains become loved. Wuthering Heights is also fairly contrived and full of obvious symbolism, but unlike Jane Eyre, the mechanics of the story add to it rather than distracting from it. Above all, the pathos and darkness are delightful, especially coming from a nineteenth century British woman. Charlotte herself wrote in the preface to WH that she didn't understand why Emily had to write something so dark. My opinion is that Charlotte could have used a little bit of that darkness herself. Read WH if you want something really complex to savor; JE just makes a good beach read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It seems to me Bronte's schooling of her own mind rather than the schooling depicted in the book (which are the same thing) depend more or less likely on your inclination to the subject of respect.The willingness to let go all sanity and resume mental thought at a moment's whim is the virtue displayed here.Like most books of this type, not much thought is given to plot or to the romance of being in a plot as much as to the figures at play here, right and wrong, moral and honest, truth and lie-sayer. I would probably say this is the best way for a young girl to grow up, having written a work like this. This is more a study in her life than in the life of a person blessed with any gifts. Growing up modest has taught her something: that she made modesty.The gift of the unique insight of creation in each and every line is apparent and is a unique challenge to the reader to contemplate the meaning of suffering she has placed into every line."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Ok... so truth be told, I only started to read this book because of the movie \\"Definately, Maybe\\". The way the character in the movie described the book made me think I might like to read it. I was not disapponted. I find that some of the \\"classics\\" are a bit borning and hard to follow. This one was neither. The orphaned girl hated by her family finds love. And love finds her as well. But it wouldnt make for an interesting story if there werent hills to climb. Over all I would say that this is one of those classics that has most definately earned the classification."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Very old fashioned and, for some, I suppose difficult to read due to the antiquated dialog - but a gem worth sticking with! Like Jane Austin, Charles Dickens and all their contemporaries, there is a very good reason that these classics are still widely read even by those of us not in need of a good grade in English Lit. It's because they are wonderfully intricate and well told tales, fabulous stories for those of us hungry for the next line, the next challenge and the next twist of fate. The Book is ALWAYS better than any film, so read this instead of downloading the old Orson Welles film to get all the nuances the writer intended... then definitely watch the film too!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am 63 and KNOW when I was in high school was instructed to read this book.

The beginning isn't that interesting but after she gets to thornfield hall and hears about the ghost that wanders the hall and meets the mysterious mr.rochester its a page turner. so dont hesitate to pick this wonderful book up!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre needs no review. It is classic literature which we all almost always read in high school. But it is one of the best Edwardian times novel there is. Jane falls for the the messed up Mr. Rochester. The story is a gothic romance and full of twists and turns. The best book out there."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have just finished reading this book in school (I'm in year 10, and im glad Ive read it now before it was too late; all adults who have read this always say they wish they had done when they were a teenager). As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on. Thats what defines Jane Eyre as a classic; it has the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a book that reveals, the complexities of a woman's mind, her struggle for independence and her search for a separate identity. It is a journey beginning with the innocence of a young girl, an orphan, and unfolds to show us the growth of the female protagonist in her search for an identity, helping us to see the world through her eyes.Bronte's style of writing is such, that the confusion and bewilderment young Jane feels is palpable, as is her hunger to be loved and the hurt she feels, on being ill-treated. The novel cannot be called an autobiography, but many of the incidents that go into the making of the novel have been taken from the life of the author. There is also an element of the supernatural, which appealed greatly to the readers of the time but does not invoke the same response today.The book also gives us an insight into the age in which the author wrote. The position of women, in the society or rather the lack of it. The portrayal of Rochester's wife in the attic at Thornfield can be interpreted as the darker side of Jane's personality. The part of her that she suppresses after being locked in the \\"Red Room\\" at the Reed mansion. Mad bertha is that part of Jane that she has to lock away in order to be accepted in a stifling and prudish Victorian society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Well, I can't call Charlotte Bronte another Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens. But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book in Hungarian, but I know it is as good in English as in my mother language... A beautiful love story, with a remarkable young girl. It is a &quot;Have to read&quot; book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This famous book is magnificant.Jane is a women to give all women inspiration to succeed and make a life from nothing. I laughed and cried this book is a must read for any girl or woman who think they can do nothing with their lives, Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures. Mr. Rochester has to be the greatest male figure in literature! Move over Heathcliff! I got goosebumps by the end of the book and wanted to immedietly flip it over and begin again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This was a good novel with an unpredictable plot, but I found it incredibly slow moving in some parts (Jane's stays at Lowood and Thronfield that had little action). In other parts, I felt the story flashed by and I missed it (the ending where Jane went back to Rochester, Saint John's marriage proposal, Jane's botched wedding with Rochester). I do NOT think the woman in the attic (Bertha, Rochester's first wife) is a lunatic. I think her actions, although violent, are justified (ripping Jane's veil to shreds- She doesn't want her husband marrying another woman while she is locked in the attic). Though this review appears negative, I really did like the book. I, too, was assigned this as an AP English reading assignment (as JACKIE from Rotterdam, NY), and I am glad I was assigned it, for had I not been, I might not have ever read the timeless story of thencredible heroine, Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was assigned to read Jane Eyre for school, but I did not realize that it would take me forever to read! Although many disagree, I think that Jane goes into too much detail about every single thing that goes on in her life. We could understand the story and enjoy the themes of it without reading so many detailed descriptions of unimportant things! Overall, I would recommend this book to people, but I would suggest to skip the things that do not seem important."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for my grade twelve English class. I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront. I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved this book. It's one of those books you can read over and over, and never get tired of it. It's a wonderful love story full of exciting twists. The Bronte sisters are a couple of my heros. I would encourage anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had recently been channel surfing and saw that Jane Eyre was going to be on television. I was curious, being an English Lit major and never having read anything by the Bronte sisters, I figured I would watch the movie and see if the story line was anything interesting. I loved it. So, that night I ran to the store and bought the book. The book was ten times more vivid and wonderfully told than the movie (as was expected). I was delighted to revist the characters that I had briefly been introduced to through the movie. C.B. tells the tale wonderfully through the life of Jane. Her trials become your trials. Her love becomes your love. It was very intense and riveting. I can't wait to read it again in a few years!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved this book because I felt the struggle Jane Eyre went through, being an abused, poor orphan forced to reside all year around at the Lowell School under a harsh headmaster. Then being forced to endure the harshness of her employer, Mr. Rochester.I pitied Mr. Rochester because he was &quot;stuck&quot; with a mad woman he locked on the top floor with Mrs. Pool. In a sense, it was sort of like a living death. As long as she remained alive, he could not remarry or have a family. I loved it when Orson Wells played this role because his large, brilliant, black eyes really showed his torment in the film. Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre was no slouch either. Her blank stare after ten years at the Lowell school was great. I really felt their emotions in the book too, especially after Jane Eyre's friend at Lowell died of pneumonia and when her wedding ceremony was cancelled after discovering Mr. Rochester was already married.The tense part in the book and film was when Mr. Rochester's bed was set ablaze by his wife. I don't know how a man could let his mentally ill wife remain under the same roof with a child and so many lit candles to be knocked over but Mr. Rochster did it. I mean, the man must be as daft as his wife.I thought this book was a thrilling read because both of the main characters over came their problems. Yes there were consequences, but they were temporary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I found Jane Eyre to be a delightful read and a book that can be read again and again. It is the story of a young orphan girl who struggles to find her place in society. The story begins with Jane as child living with her aunt and cousins. Jane is a spirited girl and is disliked by all, especially her aunt, who constantly belittles her, despite the fact that Jane's cousins are horrific. Jane's only friend is the maid, who gives her comfort from time to time.Finally it gets to the point where Jane fights back and her aunt chooses to send her to boarding school. Lowood is a place of discipline and seriousness. The girls are educated in harsh conditions. It is here that Jane makes her first friend and learns much from her. After many years at school, Jane decides she wants to work and make money. There are not many options for a woman of her time who desires a career, but she lands a job as a governess for a young, French girl. Jane enjoys teaching and looking after her, but she also longs for something more in life.After being there for some time, Jane finally meets Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who spends little time there. He is a short, rather ugly man and Jane piques his interest as a girl with intelligence. After numerous encounters, they profess their mutual affection and plan on getting married. Although Jane loves him, she cannot ignore their obvious class difference.On the day of their wedding it is revealed that Rochester is already married to Bertha; a crazy Jamaican woman living on the top floor of the house. Jane is shocked and decides she cannot marry Rochester despite his pleas. She packs up her things and runs away.Jane spends time homeless and starving until strangers take her in. St. John is a missionary who is later revealed as Jane's cousin. The death of Jane's uncle leaves her with a fortune, turning her into a financially independent woman. Despite the fact that he's her cousin, St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India to do missionary work. What does Jane decide? Read the book and find out!Jane Eyre is novel filled with passion and symbolism. Fire appears time and time again, symbolizing the heat that exists in Jane's life. I found Jane to be a strong and admirable woman, though there are times when her sensibility gets a bit annoying. Rochester is a little odd as well, but together I find them charming. This story is unique because the heroine is a plain, poor girl who triumphs over class barriers, which is why she is so likable. She is not a beauty queen who is swept off into the horizon by prince charming. Altogether, a passionate story of courage and triumph."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre has been hailed by many to be the original romance novel and after reading it, I am inclined to agree.Jane is an abused, forgotten child who is sent away to a boarding school after standing up for herself against her cruel cousins and unjust aunt. While at school, Jane learns disicpline and becomes a very religious person.When Jane finally leaves the boarding school, it is for a governess position at the home of Rochester. She teaches the child in his care, Adele.Through the story, she and Rochester face many dilemmas in their search for true love. A true love that is right in front of their noses.If you like romance novels or if you just want to rediscover your hope for love, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is one of my favourite books ever! I must have read it about a thousand times and I'm still not fed up of it. For those of you who are under the impression that this is a boring, dried up dull book, you could not be more wrong. I have never read a book so rich, so passionate and so moving. The love of Jane and Mr.Rochester is wonderfully depicted by Charlotte Bronte into true love's deepest and richest form. Her language is vivid, descriptive and romantic, and the dialogue (especially between the two protagonists)is poetic and eloquent. This is a book for all tastes, and the characters are so well portayed that they come alive in the imagination and stay there. I actually found myself crying towards the end. And Jane, though she appears meek and mild, is actually resolute and fiery and follows her religious principles dutifully to the extent of losing her only happiness. She is, in short, possessed of a strength and fortitude both reamrkable and admirable. As for Mr.Rochester,he is an archetypal Byronic hero: dark,enigmatic,cynical,sardonic and sternly attractive, suffering from some mysterious sorrow which renders him aloof and forbidding and forms the basis for the 'secret of the attic. This book has everything: romance, tragedy, intrigue and humour and is a classic in the true sense of the word."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In the novel Jane Eyre, Bronte wants the reader to perceive the main character, Jane Eyre, as an independent young woman trying to make her way through life by herself. Jane is even given a line &quot;I do not think, sir you have the right to command me, merely because you are older than I...&quot;(139) to help understand her independent way of thinking. Bronte tries to give and describe Jane through feminist characteristics. Throughout the novel, however, Bronte uses a literary motif of birds. In this motif everytime Jane is compared to a bird it is a bird such as a turtle dove which can be compared as weak and delicate to that of a raven which is how the main male character is described. This novel is an enjoyable one and I would recommend it to anyone who reads only for pleasure purposes. If you try to find a deeper meaning in this novel you may get confused on how the author really wants the reader to portray the main characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a classic, loved by many, and may be just the book for you.

I suppose humanity will never be free of conservatives and their never-ending quest to jail us all in rigid little gender cages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story. This is my favorite book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"JANE EYRE WAS A BOOK OF WONDERFUL DESCRIPTION.

Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel. The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails. However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it. For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.This is a must-read for anyone.

While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class.

This novel is a classic, all respects to the word. I, a man, find this book to be one of my favorites.The book is strong in creativity, contains a remarkable flow from word to word, and has a grand notion of human emotion. What gives this book these qualities? READ IT!!! The three qualities revolve with each other. Creating a self powering novel that easily controls the moments of you emotion through the revealing of the plot to the audience with superb timing.Only one problem, a little too ironic at times, don't ya think.My small speal isn't even close to giving the novel any justice.&quot;It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, &quot;the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.&quot;I primarily choose this because of its connectiveness to the traits mentioned prior and because it won't ruin the book.

The language is beautifully woven, showing the character's feelings and giving way to shocking occurrances. The tale is not quite original but it does strike the heart--showing society at the time while weaving the tale--the plots just grasp you harder and harder within each chapter--like glue, if you don't try to get out of it, you can't get out--carefully developing the plot with questions, the language, and subtle events that makes the book--not quite original--but giving it a place of its own in the romance genre, getting better and better every time.

There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \\"syrupy-ness\\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"if i had to say anything about jane it would be that she seems to revel in pain. the injustic of her childhood caused it i suppose or, perhaps, she was always that way. was rodchesters wife crazy before she was locked up? or did locking her up make her that way? well, jane seems to like to be in pain and rodchester seems to like to cause it, they make a happy pair. it was a dark book with a happy ever after, as happily ever after as a dark book can be.the book was interesting, clear and well written though something of a slow read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The plot revolves around Jane as a child to adulthood. Orphaned since an infant, she grows up with her harsh aunt and unpleasant cousins. Around the age of ten, she gets sent to charity-school, where they provide education for the poor and orphaned. The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her \\"impassioned self-respect and moral conviction.\\" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested. The book has it all - a blend of passion, romance, mystery, drama and suspense. I believe this to be one of the everlasting classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of the best readings of this book I've heard - and I've heard (and read) the book many times.

Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I really want to tell you what happens because I thought it was so good! But of course I won't because it would spoil it for you.I will say that I have been avoiding 'the classics' for a good long time (except for The Scarlet Letter which I actually enjoyed way back in High School). And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one. I really loved it.My copy of Jane Eyre has an introduction by Joyce Carol Oats and I would caution those who don't know this story; do not read the introduction! It will spoil the story. Thankfully I didn't read it until after I finished the book and I am so glad, it tells everything that happens!Jane never forgets that she must love and respect herself first and foremost. She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression. Bronte creates a wonderful symmetry and balance within this story, I loved it, it moved me to tears."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Recieved this book along with another book and 2 cds.

I always wanted to go ahead and read some literature and some classics but didn't know where to start so out of the blue I saw a message in email one day that Jane Eyre was free so I downloaded it and began to skim through it. I ended up reading it right away and devouring it. I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had wanted to read Jane Eyre since I was a little girl because, for some strange reason, I was always drawn to the novel. It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me. I felt that I too grew in some ways and what more could one want from a novel?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen years old, I was captured by the powers of Jane Eyre's life and struggles. Every couple of months since then I take out my used Jane Eyre book and am again mystified. The novel is a story about a woman's journey and finally to true love. Both Jane and Rochester are the best of kindred spirits, and it is Jane's own bright spirit that is never tainted by \\"passions\\" and whims. She follows the path that is hers alone and one that is full of independence.

In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it. They were especially faithful to the characters. A few of my favorite scenes got left out, but I liked the characters so much I forgave them. The Gothic themes in the novel were played up as well making it a little spicy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had ordered two DVD's of Jane Eyre.

The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his \\"ward,\\" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, \\"What amd I doing reading a gothic romance\\", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \\"passionate\\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \\"coincidences\\" which might have been classed as \\"providence\\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \\"coincidences\\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Got this book for my daughter.

The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \\"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed reading this gothic novel. The story takes place in England, during the 19th century. Jane Eyre is orphaned at a young age. Raised in Lowood school, her only friend is Helen She is annoyed by the headmaster Brocklehurst. She is employed as a governess at an estate, where she falls in love with her employer, Rochester. This is a fine example of a coming of age novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is truly a classic. I read it for my A.P English class over the summer. It's just very long.

I reccomend reading wide sargasso sea afterwards for it is a novel from Bertha's point of view!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month.

We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \\"Peek inside\\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane was orphaned as a baby and thrust upon her widowed aunt, to raise alongside her own three children. Her aunt, resentful of Jane and distrustful of such a quiet and sad child, makes her life miserable. When Jane is ten and the opportunity for her to go away to boarding school arises, she jumps at the chance. Aside from not being constantly harassed by her aunt and cousins, things are not much better at school, at first. The teachers are strict, uniforms are painfully plain, food is scarce and sometimes inedible. However, Jane feels at peace with her life there, even staying on to teach when she is too old to be a student.When Jane is eighteen, her dear friend and former teacher leaves school to marry. Jane decides it is time for a change in her own life. She advertises herself out as a private tutor, and is soon hired to be the governess and teacher for young Adele, a little French girl under the guardianship of Mr. Rochester, who lives in a grand English manor.Mr. Rochester is moody; he is more often grouchy and irritable than pleasant. He insults Jane, and seems surprised and charmed when she returns his barbs without taking offense. Jane begins to dare to hope for a relationship to develop between them. But Mr. Rochester is a society man. He is wealthy, and he surrounds himself with other wealthy folks, including some very eligible young ladies who look down on Jane. Furthermore, Jane can't be certain Mr. Rochester is always truthful with her. Something very strange is going on at Mr. Rochester's manor, something certain to shock Jane.I liked the fact that the protagonists of this story are not beautiful people. Jane is small, thin and plain. Mr. Rochester is often described as ugly, and certainly fierce. It's nice to read a love story about people who are more normal than the usual cast of characters in a romance. I also liked Jane's resolve in staying true to herself. She is confident in who she is and even her love can't make her betray her morals. However, despite her decision to become independent, she still knows that Mr. Rochester has a claim on her heart, and she isn't ashamed of that fact.The weakness of this story is simply that of time and style. It was written in the 1800s, when writers had a tendency to focus on description and long dialog, sometimes at the expense of action. As a result, there are parts of this book that are tedious and require skimming in order to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte beautifully constructs each sentence in \\"Jane Eyre\\" with an exacting precision that is at once dated and elegant.While the story can be a bit overwrought in almost a parody like way--it hasn't aged especially well--all of that is a minor distraction to enjoying the exquisite craftsmanship with which Bronte writes.Bronte is as much an architect as a storyteller--every sentence and event ties to an often unexpected event or occurance later in the book. She doesn't just churn out prose in the assembly-line fashion of hacks Janet Evanovich or Stephen King. When you read Bronte, you understand what is meant by \\"classic.\\" She is the difference between junk food (Evanovich/King) and a gourmet meal.This isn't airplane reading and you won't breeze through it in days. It's the sort of book you savor for 20 or 30 pages and perhaps return to a week later.And if you are not a student who resents it as \\"required reading,\\" you'll truly thank yourself for voluntarily finishing a book of such style and class."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there.

I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I needed this book for a school project.

I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One of the things that I liked most about \\"Wuthering Heights\\", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the \\"scenery\\", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.\\"Jane Eyre\\" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the \\"red room\\", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but \\"strange\\" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, \\"Jane Eyre\\", like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous.

Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book was a complete surprise to me. I started the book not knowing anything about it, and finished with a new favorite book. The story is captivating, the characters are distinct and well realized, and I simply could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A young girl is orphaned as a baby and is entrusted to her uncle and his family. When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being \\"in love,\\" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it. Those of us who find Gothic romance dull and dreary will find this novel less than enchanting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Beware when you buy this tape.

Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read. Unfortunately, this novel is required reading in certain parts of the nation. This bland, boring novel is not the way to spark reading with young adults."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was forced to read this book for summer reading. No ways around it.

The numerous movie versions of it, including the most recent, never do Bronte's prose justice. I believe all modern romance novels sprang from the Bronte sisters' great works, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Jane Eyre is the more tightly wound of the two. Charlotte spins Jane's interior monologue and her emotional dialog with Rochester into a taut emotional web at the core of Jane, who is a complex and powerful lead character. Rochester is painted as an aloof, arrogant elitist, who is then humanized as Jane's gentler character opens him up.The story itself is masterfully plotted with the same craft and care as the characterizations.

It has romance and action. Everything you could want in a good book. This is one of those rare classics that are actually cool."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Whew...I finally finished! I have been holding on to this book since April 2011. It's not because the book was loathsome but because I began to feel as if Jane and I had become friends. As crazy as that may sound, I really hated for this book to end because it felt as if I was parting ways with an old friend.We are introduced to Jane Eyre as a young orphan residing with her uncle's (deceased) wife, Mrs. Reed, and three cousins. Jane was not welcome in their home and was sent to Lowood boarding school. The conditions at Lowood were horrible. Lowood was about survival and Jane soon found out that some didn't. Jane remained at Lowood until she was nineteen where she then transferred to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is at Thornfield Hall where Jane's strong resolve and concrete emotions are put to the ultimate test. Here is where the love story begins. Jane and her new employer Edward Rochester fall in love but not without challenges. Even though it was the perfect fairy tale \\"rich man falls in love with lonely orphan,\\" this is where the story takes a turn. Mr. Rochester has a secret. Just when you think nothing else bad can happen to Jane worse knocks the door down.Needless to say Jane had to flee Thornfield Hall abruptly without any direction or much else. She was stranded, starving, and sick when she ended up on the door step of a family that would nurse her back to health. The Rivers family took Jane in and she began to gain her strength mentally, emotionally, and physically. The family was made up of two sisters and a brother. Jane became instant friends with them all. The brother, St. John Rivers, actually discovered the destitute Jane who had been turned away initially by the family servant. During her season with the Rivers family, Jane received one of the best revelations of her life. Her ending up on the door step of the Rivers home was not a coincidence it was \\"divine\\" intervention. St. John Rivers had other plans for Jane once he had studied her for a while. St. John is very stoic and manipulating individual all under the guise of \\"minister.\\" Jane does not fall for his manipulative tactics and follows her heart back to Thornfield Hall. When she arrives at Thornfield Hall she stumbles upon a shocking and horrifying surprise.Jane Eyre is just a \\"boss\\" type chick (if can describe her in hip-hop terms). She faced some insurmountable odds but all these back to back hardships birthed a certain unexplainable resilience in her. Jane was not easily broken because she was grounded in her faith. Bronte developed a character that we need to encourage all young women to read and get to know. Jane didn't succumb to fleshly temptations but instead she fled and this led to a great rewards. Jane's valley experiences let her to a mountaintop of blessings and real love.This book is a classic that has been reviewed numerous times. Most that read Jane's story count her as an old friend because they have been reading her story since high school. Prior to reading this book, I saw several references to it being \\"gothic\\" and there is even a goth illustrated edition. As I read, I began to think it should be categorized as \\"Christian\\" fiction. I absolutely fell in love with all the Biblical references and how grace and faith played major roles throughout the entire story. Jane Eyre started out an orphan who was pressed on every side by adversity but she grew to be a strong woman that one could liken to the mythical phoenix."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"AHHHH! I simply love this book. It has been many years since I first read it, and yet, it still has the ability to sweep me away. This is a true classic in my opinion. If you have never read it, you are truly missing out on one of the most engrossing stories ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I throroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Although it was quite lengthy, it was filled with suspense and excitement. I feel that Jane Eyre was a strong, independent and proud character which makes her a great role model for women and children. From when she is only ten years old she already possesses courage, honesty and generosity despite her unpleasant life. Going to Lowood School only adds to her miserable childhood, but somehow she has the strength to overcome it and move on. Even though she is a poor, unattractive woman in the Victorian era she believes in economic and social equality. When she meets Rochester he is amazed at her intelligence, wit and frankness and though he is a man, she is his intellectual equal. When she realizes she must leaves Edward, she is able to resist the temptation of being with him to uphold her strong morals. This is also a very commendable quality that Jane Eyre possesses. Through her determination, she is able to survive poverty and loneliness and find a home with the Rivers. Here she exhibits true generosity when she divides her fortune among her new found friends. Again, she resists the temptation of a good home and safety and leaves St. John to find her lost love. Jane shows compassion when she decides to stay with Rochester for he rest of her life, and nurse him in his unhealthy state. Reading about a woman like Jane Eyre is very empowering and it makes you want to be a better person. Cudos to Charlotte Bronte for a novel very (long and) well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Lost yet somewhat hopeful, Jane Eyre spent some of her child hood with an evil aunt after her parents had past. Troubled by the haunted shadows that lurk in her mind, young Jane decides that she needs change in her life. Slowly yet surely she does find some happiness which appears to be a struggle. The character, Jane, seems vulnerable throughout the telling of the story. At the age of eighteen, Jane finally presents herself in a newspaper as a governess. As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre is appointed as a governess at Thornfield Hall by the mysterious Mr. Rochester. Her integrity and independence are tested to the limit as their love for each other grows, and the secrets of Mr. Rochester's past are revealed.This story tells of a young woman, Jane Eyre, who makes modesty and plainness appear to be the most noble and admirable qualities in a young woman. She learned over time to be independent and had developed a strong mind. It's almost a romance novel underneath all the inner searching. She struggles through many obstacles and when faced with them, she does what is right for her and no one else. What I liked about it the most is that it was a real person's story to some extent. It glorified female independence and seemed almost like a fairy tale. Jane Eyre becomes someone because she puts in her best effort, not because of a wish, or a dream, or someone else's pity. She made herself beautiful in the way she saw fit.This incredible book brings detail of what's written and both love and sadness that people can relate to. An example of this would be Jane as she was experiencing friendship for the first time when she started school and then had lost someone she's close to. If you're a person who loves romance novels then I recommend this book to you. She is a great role model for women today. And this should be read if over the age of fourteen and up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week. When i first picked up this book i felt i would not beable to finish it because of my ablity to get bored really quick. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone! I keep on going back in the book to a part i liked best or a place in the story that captivates me. It seems i will never grow tired of this book. I hope all that have read it feel the same!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre was truly an enjoyable novel for me to read. Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre has an odd place in literary history. It is one of the most compelling reads ever written, and in my opinion, it uncovers so much about the nature of being a human. The novel's a page-turner for its entertainment value as well as for its ability to enlighten.Jane is a poor orphan born in a society that fights her ability to attain financial, emotional, sexual, and spiritual freedom. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is on a quest to gain her liberation. Of course, she cannot do so by herself. She must retain enough fortitude to be her true self, and she must be an instrument of grace, of change, in the life of Rochester.Everything in the novel conspires toward the creation of a near-perfect novel. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience this masterpiece, but I will certainly be returning to it over and over through the rest of my life. This novel cannot be missed by anyone who wants to read truly great literature or by anyone who just wants to experience a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen, and I fell in love with it almost instantly as soon as I finished the first chapter.

Don't be intimidated by the length, because you will certainly get so enraptured, and taken in, that you wont even notice it. I must say that Jane Eyre is one of the most endearing and enjoyable characters that i've encountered. Charlotte Bronte develops her perfectly. I love her ability to poke fun at and tease her admired one, Mr Rochester; it's refreshing, and my idea of love. It develops at a nice, steady pace, never lagging. The tone and the references to the reader suit the book quite well, and I believe that the story was far ahead of its time. Why four out of five? Well, i found certain parts of the story far too unbelievable, and Mr. Rochester seemed to go from stern and haughty, to love-sick and passionate all too quickly, that I found it somewhat ingenuine. I believe that the end is what really made the story worthwhile, when Jane goes back to see her beloved once more. That is when i started to tear.

Yet, yes, this book is at an advanced level, but so many girls between 12-15 read this book.

For the most part ;)!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One of the reasons Jane Eyre is such an enduring piece of literary excellence is because of it's simple theme, in a book of numerous themes battling for #1, is of the ability of one human being with absolutely nothing to rise above hell and survive. Yet anyone can write about that, but only a true talent can make you give a damn about it all.Going back to those other themes, they consist of feminism, morality, personal blindness, social reform, and more. A plethora of characters that you'll despise or love or feel like kicking at one moment and hugging the next, it's a breathtaking array of humanity drenched in dysfunction, and one woman who's known nothing else and with great difficulty can still find those rungs on the ladder.Jane is appealing because of her complexities and endurance. Bronte's contemporary audiences found Jane a bit of an enigma, she's a moral strength in the toughest sense but so independent and (has been called) the first feminist in literature. Bronte gives us ample opportunity to see what the social climate was back then, and it only adds to the atmosphere of difficulty for Jane's saga as a poor governess in a male dominated world. Yet Jane is realistic because we see how she evolves from being an free spirited child to a beaten down teenager/adult who strives only to escape to follow her dreams and follow God's word, and eventually the governess who must come to terms with the man she loves and the dark secret that he carries. That's Rochester, who represents everything Jane isn't. He's immoral, crude, nasty, and is inexplicably held down by a bundle of secrets and one rather large one that keeps him a captive of his own life. They have one thing in common, they have thick shells they don't know how to get rid of.And yet Bronte weaves us a story that is full of passion and shows us the cracks in the dams that keep these characters apart, and as the numerous events and intrigues take place, we see how they grow and finally come to terms with their reality and whatever tragic consequences must occur. And at the root of it is Jane who leads us through decision and pain and her intense desire to just be a good and fully human person in a society and situation that won't allow her to.Jane Eyre is a book about us, and is an inspiring book even 160+ years later, not just because of the quality of Bronte's talent, or the brilliant plot weaving and what not, but because it's a masterpiece look at the strength of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane may be a meek, rather plain, dull young girl...not to mention shy and quiet.

I have read it on and off for years now, along with hundreds of other books. When I was younger, I admired everything Jane did; every decision she made was the right one. Jane was the heroine of the story and I didn't question her decisions. But.. after much reflection on the outcomes of her decisions, I have come to the conclusion that she was TOO strong, too determined that she must lead a faultless life. It was almost creepy, how iron willed she was. I think the true victim of the novel was not Jane herself, but the rich and powerful Fairfax Rochester, who was so much in love with her that even Jane hoped her leaving would not drive him to madness and despair.. His plea, \\"You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?\\" .. but Jane, in her determination to be true to her morals,walked away and left him in a near suicidal state. \\"Oh, Jane, this is bitter. This is wicked.\\" These words fell from Mr Rochester's lips when he saw that she meant to leave. I tend to agree. It DID seem wicked to leave him on the verge of madness. He ask no more of her, at that time, than to just stay in residence until some alternative plan could be embarked upon. However, she didn't want to be suspetible to the worldy temptations embodied in Mr Rochester...She almost died because of her decision to tear herself away, and what happened to Mr. Rochester will make the reader shudder. But.. Jane's \\"integrity\\" and strength remain intact,and supposedly that is the lesson the reader is supposed to carry away.

I had no idea what was going to happen, and when something didn't go the way I had expected, I was worried about how it would turn out. I enjoyed the basic plot, but I liked the unpredictablility the most. This book took me a lot longer to read than I had expected. This was because Jane Eyre is at a high reading level. It had many vocabulary words that confused me. This was the only drawback to this book. I would recommend this book to ages 14-20 and to people that enjoy classical literature.

All these are included with much more in the edge-of-your-seat novel: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.The main character, Jane Eyre, is first pictured as a poor, neglected, mistreated ten-year-old. Her temper is yet wild and uncontrolled, so she gets into many scraps, consequentially landing her in a boarding school fifty miles away. After a bad epidemic of typhus, the unhealthy structure of Lowood school is discovered. It is at once put to rights.After eight years at Lowood (two total as a student and six as a teacher), Jane discovers that she longs for a different life. She puts an ad in the paper, and soon receives a letter from an old lady named Mrs. Fairfax. This lady writes to hire Jane as governess of a little French girl. Upon taking the job, Jane presently meets the owner of the house, Mr. Rochester, and falls in love. However, while at the altar, about to make their vows, a disruption occurs.Jane runs away with nothing but a few pounds, which she accidentally leaves in the coach. After three days out in the open with hardly any food or sleep, she encounters a happy family, which takes her in. Se doesn't give her true identification, but soon becomes at home and gets a job as the local girl's schoolmistress.However, not very long after, Jane meets a bend in the road. No sooner does she get settled in, but she finds that she does have family and a large fortune after all! She begins to feel restless and uneasy to have left Mr. Rochester, and sets out to find him.I won't say the ending, but I will say that I loved this book! It is so romantic and sweet.

Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book.

Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is probably my favorite that I have ever read. The story is about a young governess who grew up as a neglected orphan. When she moves to the home of Rochester, her life takes quite a turn.

Jane is one of my favorite characters in literature. It is an incredible, beautiful story, one of the best ever written. Jane Eyre is a plain, unattractive, poor orphan. She goes through a difficult childhood, first in the house of her abusive aunt, then as a student who endures the harsh and unjust conditions of Lowood School. At eighteen, she takes up the post of governess at Thornfield Hall, meets and falls in love with Mr. Rochester, her employer.Despite the wrongs and harsh treatments she recieved as a girl, despite having no family and few friends, Jane at eighteen is strong, thoughtful and intelligent when her character meets the nasty and sarcastic Mr. Rochester. Their conversation is so full of wit, humour and hidden meanings. There is nothing more charming than how Mr. Rochester attempts to provoke Jane and tries to bully her a bit, but his efforts miserably fail as he finds he has met someone who is quite his equal. In her novel, Bronte stresses that their relationship is based on 'sympathy' and 'a likeness'.A dark secret of Rochester's past impedes their marriage, and after an emotional and heart-breaking scene, Jane adheres to her morals and leaves Thornfield in the night. What follows are two days of degredation, neglect, and pain, as Jane finds herself in an unfriendly town where none will help her. An unusual twist of fate brings salvation at last, in the form of the handsome St. John and his sisters. Again Jane's strength of character is tested when St. John (is it me, or is he a lot like Enjolras of Les Miserables?) makes her a difficult proposal. She has to make a final decision of either sacrificing her heart or seeking Rochester again.The novel is full of heart-warming moments, suspense and intrigue. The narrator, Jane herself, constantly addresses the reader, and makes you feel like you know her personally. Through this and the beautiful use of language I've found a friend and an idol in Jane. She is a wonderful character, and you come to realize she is not at all plain, she is interesting, complex, and passionate.When speaking of her Rochester says \\"Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage...And it is you, spirit - with will and energy - and virtue and putiry - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.\\"Did I say the language is beauitful and thrilling? My copy of the book, although new, is quickly wearing out! Again and again I pick it up to read my favourite passages, which I've marked. Although I absolutely adore this book, I must say if you are not a fan of the genre and don't read classics, you might think it slow. But with some patience, your efforts will be rewarded. Read this book if you think yourself unlucky, Jane's courage and faith will inspire you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I was little, my mother would always read this to me. I was named after the writer, who my mother loved. This book is a classic. You must read this to be considered a true reader or &quot;book lover&quot;."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutly loved this novel. It does not matter how long ago it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester. What a formadable opponent she was has an adult to Mr. Rodchesters wit and saracasim. The end of the book is full of surprises and twists. I hate to sound cliche but it is true.

Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . ."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've had a like/dislike relationship with this book since my college days. All right- mostly dislike.Everyone knows the plot by now, since they at least watched the televised versions, so I'll be brief- neglected orphan who grows up with abusive aunt and cousins is sent to charity school, where she experiences more misfortunes, grows up to become a governess in a gothic countryside mansion and falls in love with her Byronic employer. Eventually she finds fortune and happiness through various plot twists, some completely implausible.I've read this book several times since I was 19 and seemed to dislike it more with each reading. I think that what has always put me off this book is Charlotte Bronte's prose. It's just so cumbersome and long-winded and I find the imagery and descriptions heavy-handed and awkward- sorry, when she describes the \\"bonny beck\\" I just don't feel it. I much prefer her sister Anne Bronte's simpler but clearer writing, not to mention Emily Bronte's masterful prose. Additionally, Charlotte is completely humorless. What passes as humor just isn't very funny. By contrast, again, Wuthering Heights has surprisingly funny moments for such a dark gothic tale, once again demonstrating Emily's superiority as a writer.I additionally dislike Jane--somehow, I can't feel much liking for her. I appreciate that Bronte broke the mold with having a poor, plain heroine, but it's stressed so frequently that it loses its effect. She was also stupendously blind not to suspect that maybe, just maybe, there's another person there with the stony-faced Grace Poole who was the source of that mad laughter. And Rochester is a manipulative git. He really is. And he says \\"Jane, Jane!\\" too much and has an irritating tendency to compare her to elves and fairies.What's most surprising is that St. John River is actually a much more interesting character than Rochester. He's a strikingly handsome, repressed ascetic who directs his passion to his religion. Nowadays he would have made either a splendid villain or a disillusioned hero. Rochester and his angst are boring by comparison.If you think that Bronte is a good writer I dare you, just dare you, to read any of her other works. \\"Shirley\\" is painful and I heard that \\"The Professor\\" isn't much better. The only work where I felt that Charlotte finally got a handle on her art was her last novel, the emotionally difficult and thereby much less popular \\"Villette.\\"The best thing about Jane Eyre are the television and movie productions. There's a million of them and I find myself compelled to watch every single one. So I guess there is still something in the story that appeals to me. This is why I give this book three stars rather than two."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a young woman, grown from a rash girl in a harsh life and boarding school, working as a governess to a French girl. This is Bront's romance novel, though it is somewhat vague to call it that, for there is much more involved than just a petty romance. Through some sticky language, and some boring sections-whole chapters, even-Bront relays the life of Jane Eyre through Jane's own eyes tastefully and with flexible, rich language, stringing the reader along.We begin with Jane Eyre's childhood. Through some difficult wording, we find that Jane lives with her Reed cousins and aunt. Her Aunt Reed sees her as a vile child compared to her own vile children, who she sees with a golden halo above their heads. Jane is often tortured physically by Reed's children, while taking the brunt of anger and blame from her aunt. We are brought through the agonizing years of her childhood, making her a rash young girl with dreams of a new life, which comes in the form of a boarding school that she is to be sent to. With such a rush of feeling, she spills out her heart to her aunt about how she really feels, but at such the young and tender age of 10, begins to discover truths about the world that normal 10 year old children do, such as what vengeance and anger could bring about. As Bront describes the feelings and compares them to some rather unrelated things, \\"Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic as wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after flavor, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned,\\" I gained a sense of familiarity, for of course, when I pursue revenge, it's often a cold and empty attempt, leaving me cold and empty as she describes.The boarding school is anything but lovely, but Jane often refers to it as better than her previous surroundings; of course, as I, the audience, felt, it was. She begins to accept the discipline and conform rather well to the strict rulings of Mr. Brocklehurst, and, lonely at first, finds someone that she can relate to - Helen Burns, who also often gets lost in her own fantasy world as Jane does. The next chapters are really just an explanation of time in the boarding school, and though rather boring, explained her transition from a brash young girl into something more disciplined. The only truly interesting thing I found in this piece of the book was how Bront utilizes the technique of the \`drop' sentence. To explain it, she builds and builds up to a heavy-impact event, and then uses one sentence to release the suspense, in a rather harsh way, making the impact of the shock all the stronger. In the end of her explanation of Jane's childhood, she uses this here: \\"\\"...my face against Helen Burns' shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep and Helen was - dead.\\" Of course, one thinks that there would be much more of a draw out here to Helen, her best friend, dying, but really, it was just a dropped ball, and I found myself shocked. Even so, there was a good five chapters of useless plot that I found to be quite tiresome.As Jane herself transitions to the next chapters, she explains the things that happened the eight years after that that she stayed in the hall, and how things improved, she improved, etc. This seemed to be one of the least confusing parts of the book, since it was straightforward and not so tangled up in language. Either way, she decides that she needs a change from the boarding school that she now taught at, and advertises herself, quickly replied to for a young girl. She immediately accepts and takes her journey to Thornfield. She is to teach a little girl named Ad&egrave;le in a large manor in which the master never seems to be around. There is an in depth, albeit easy to skip over, description of the lavish home that she now resides in, and Jane quickly falls into the routine. Before Mr. Rochester, the owner or Thornfield and a main character, shows up, I enjoy the passage (and the many after them) when Jane falls into her own fantasy world and fails to realize that something is happening, like this, \\"...Bessie's Gytrash,-a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head... with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would... The man...broke the spell all at once.\\" They often occur, but they're so shrouded in incomprehensible old language, usually, that I can't catch them until I realize that I haven't understood a thing I've read, and read it over again. Once Mr. Rochester shows up, the actually romance novel-esque story begins, the true heart of Bront's novel. The two begin to seduce and fall in love with one another, though not right away like in a woman's fantasy, but over time as if it did in reality. There are many events after this, but I've said enough already!Jane Eyre is an entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing and boring, read. This is more of a novel for a person with an in-depth knowledge of the English language (and perhaps a little French) and that's looking for a satisfying read. Bront places foreshadowing and certain events with elegance and not without reasoning, for those small events begin to fall into place for what comes in the end, but are something the reader may skip over, for they're shrouded behind a tangled language and wordy sentences."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 and I loved it. I love Mr Rochester and the playful way he has about acting with Jane. I loved the way their love was the perfect romantic love, not Mills and Boon but a more sedate, beautiful, mature love.As an afterthought though it has shaped my view of love and at 17 am shocked to find out that most people's idea of love is a prenup and till death to you part while I have a view of love as never part and don't need a prenup because you should love someone so much that you couldn't consider getting divorced.

I read it when I was in seventh grade and have read again at least once a year and I'm now in 12th grade. Each time I read it, I understand it better and the love and depth of emotions of Jane and Mr. Rochester becomes so overwhelming. When I saw that 3rd and seventh graders were reading it and finding it \\"odd\\" at times, and boring perhaps, it's because of the age thing. You've got to wait a few years and read it again. Trust me, after all those idiotic teen movies, you'll develop a priceless love for Jane Eyre. The only book I've ever found that was so harshly honest and real was Gone With the Wind. And that book I really don't recommend to young readers. I've once saw a reviewer say Jane Eyre wasn't original at all and the parts that were original were bad. I can't possibly fathom how J.E. isn't original. This book is one of the few books in the world where a normal, poor, average girl finds love that usually happens to supermodel types (Dickens was a big fan of the supermodel love). Jane's life has been anything been peachy, but she has the courage and determination to make the most of everything and let bygones be bygones, and she does. If anyone deserves love like Jane and Edward's, it's the both of them. And even in books and movies of the 21st century you'll rarely see a girl as independent as Jane.

Jane Eyre. New York: Penguin Books, 1996 (reprint edition). Genre: Classic Victorian literature; gothic romance and suspense. Age range: Middle school to adult.It is sad that only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun. Clearly, the sun rarely shown at Haworth Grange, or anywhere near the wind-blown Yorkshire Dales--it might have reversed the unfortunate Bronts' madness. Page for page of gothic drama and angst, Jane Eyre can be a frustrating read. Jane's insecurity, low self-esteem, and then dramatic personality change near the end of the (very long) story hardly seem worth the agony for the dubious benefit of the love of Mr. Rochester. Those Bronts were all mad as hatters, and the unfortunate Mrs. Rochester wasn't the only one who should have been kept under lock and key. Be that as it may, the Bronts wrote classic British literature in the early Victorian Age, and therefore should be read, if only to see where gothic romance has come since then (not too far, unless you include &quot;Rebecca,&quot; by Daphne DuMaurier, a far tighter story, with as much spinelessness in the heroine, but at a far faster pace), and to understand that women did not have much else to write about in those days--thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say.

It has some helpful introductory material, if you are teaching this novel in an English class.One thing that's different about this is it divides the book into volumes, which my previous copy didn't do.I think this book will be very useful as I teach the novel this year."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I love a good book and this is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, \\"'Goodnight my --\\", and Bronte adds, \\"He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me\\". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, \\"Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!\\" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, \\"I LOVE this book!\\"When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards. The strong characters you fell in love with while reading her book, are the same strong characters in this wonderful screen adaptation. Bronte would be proud as was this reader/viewer."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This copy of Jane Eyre, \\"The Illustrated Jane Eyre\\", from Penguin Classics, is a truly lovely book to read, and look at.

It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in.

So don't let that put you off!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Words simply can't express how much I love this book. I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my!

You become aware that love is never simple and only the strong will survive. I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece. You follow a young woman striking out into the world working a lower class job for an upper class family. As the governess at Thornfield Hall Jane becomes entangled with Mr. Rochester's dark secrets, and she also begins to find her heart intangled with his in a way that would disrupt the social order of the time. Yet, as you progress through this story you understand every choice Jane must make, even ones that seem so difficult and painful.Yes, at times it's melodramatic and very dark. Once you place yourself in Jane, a very plain young woman who lives a very hard life, you will find yourself searching within the passages and dissapearing into the English countryside.I love to loose myself with in these passages time and time again.

Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius.

The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda.

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his \\"wife:\\" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall. Leaving her belongings in a stage coach by accident, she has no other option other than to become a beggar or die on the streets.She finnally is taken into the Rivers residence.

During this, she learns that the Rivers are her cousins. She shares the fortune with them.St. John repeatedly asks her to marry him and join him as a missionary during her time there. They both know he does not love her, but he thinks Jane would be a good missionary wife.One night, Jane hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling to her, and runs from St. Johns house to Thornfeild Hall.

Bertha had set fire to it and Mr. Rochester was blinded when he unsuccessfully tried to save her life.Jane and Mr. Rochester, never losing any feelings for each other during their time apart, then marry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance.

A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest.

I LOVE this story!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a suspensful novel that includes new excitements on every page. It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui.

So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'm not sure what made me - at 37 - decide to read Jane Eyre. It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic \\"tale of woe\\", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like \\"she gives me my meed liberally\\" and \\"collecting all she says with assiduity\\", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.\\"Am I hideous, Jane?\\"\\"Very, sir: you always were, you know.\\"\\"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.\\"(Aside.) \\"Damn him!\\"--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (\\"a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects\\") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The \\"madwoman in the attic\\" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time. Jane would be considered somewhat feisty by today's standards."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This was my first Charlotte Bronte novel, and I want to read it again and again!

Very suspenseful, entertaining and intriguing."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is my first time reading any classic (im 33yrs old). I was always afraid that I would not be able to understand the language of the time well enough to enjoy the story..WAS I SORELY WRONG! I am a beginner reader and I did just fine after the first 30 pages. This was such a dark read that I do not recommend it for everyone but I enjoy dark, gothic love stories. I also love Mr. Rochesters way of drawing out Jane from her own self imprisonment of her spirit. I suggest everyone to read this atleast once and then see the new movie out! I just saw the movie today and it was the best yet!! Mia played the part of Jane SOOO WELL!! I was just mad that they left the gypsy scene out,,that was my favorite in the book.I must warn however that this particular copy of the book has extremelly small and strange print which was okay for my eyes but I can see older people having an issue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is utterly incredible. The expression \\"page-turner\\" usually isn't associated with Victorian literature, but Charlotte Bronte created just that when she penned this masterpiece. With a fast-paced plot and a couple jaw-dropping surprises, Jane Eyre is a fascinating read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys literature of the very highest quality."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"We had to choose between 5 novels in my english 10 honors class and I choose this one. I definitley advise you to read this book, but only if you're up for a challenge. This is a great novel a great story of a woman fighting her way into society and finding out that she must only marry for one reason pure and simple love. I would recommend this novel for age 14+ I dont think others younger than this age would most likley enjoy it. I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions. The plot though is one very well planned and thought out and the last 9 or 10 chapters you race through. If you can get through a few dry parts you will enjoy a truly gem of a book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely love this romantic classic. Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times.

This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him.

Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try.

I've loved Jane Eyre since I first read it in Jr. High! What a read. From mean to good. From despair to finding the goodness of mankind.

It is the type of book you can read and re-read and still be entertained by it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, is a great reading experence. Their are many ups and downs to keep the reader engaged. I would only sugest reading this book if you enjoy 19th century English literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I suppose it's needless to review the story. It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational. This edition's minor (and - it seems to me - the only) shortcoming is the impossibility of going to any specific chapter via &#34;go to&#34; option."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Why did I wait until I was 57 years old to read this book? Wonderful story every page of the way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Excellent book, reading with the Kindle version is such an experience, which I have never had before.

I was looking for romance and some action."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyer is a great book, have read it before, will surely read it again, one of the great books"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book in high school and remembered really liking it. It is a wonderful book and a great love story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am not one to cry when reading a book, but this one made me cry, laugh and love. I have seen movies of Jane Eyre and they never do it justice. Very moving and so sad that a child should ever go through such things but I know that they do. This Jane show so much strength and honor. I only wish that I had read it years ago. This is a must read. If only the people of today would show this kind of strength our world would not be in the mess that we are in."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre was a wonderful experience for me. I too like Jane was faced with challenging start. It is a refreshing remainder that God does answer prayers. All he requires is our faith. Wonderful read!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was sick for a week when I was in college, and picked up this book for lack of anything better to read. I was sucked into the world of drama and romance and couldn't put it down. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Definitely one of my favorite books of all time. Beautifully crafted, sweeping in its majesty, an unforgettable story. No surprise it's a classic!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In England in the 1800's, a young orphaned British girl is brought up by a cruel aunt. The spunky girl goes to boarding school, where she learns sums, but also gains experiences that will last a lifetime. Once she is educated, she becomes a teacher, and then a governess at an estate in the countryside. She loves the master of the estate, but will he love her? You must read this classic to find out, and you will be rooting for this story's heroine all the way. I loved the depth of this character's relationship, not just one of those dime-a-dozen love stories like Twilight. She was a fallible human being, and I admired her for it. Also, the author's description made me see and smell the scenery. This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Still a classic love story, this was the first book I selected to read on my Kindle.
