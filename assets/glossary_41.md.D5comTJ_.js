He wears his bad boy image like a favorite old hoodie; that is until he's recruited by Super Villain Academy - where you learn to be good at being bad. In a school where one kid can evaporate all the water from your body and the girl you hang around with can perform psychic sex in your head, bad takes on a whole new meaning. Jeff wonders if he's bad enough for SVA. He may never find out. Classmates vilify him when he develops good manners. Then he's kidnapped by those closest to him and left to wonder who is good and who is bad. His rescue is the climactic episode that balances good and evil in the super world. The catalyst - the girl he's crushing on. A girlfriend and balancing the supers is good, right? Or is it...bad? Polar Opposites The supers are balanced. Academies have altered their curriculum to teach both sides of the super power spectrum. All's well in the super world. Right? When Mystic kidnaps Oceanus, Jeff learns it isn't all right. Turning to the newly balanced supers for assistance, he panics to find they've done nothing to rescue Oceanus. When no ransom request follows, he worries Mystic's plan never included returning his girlfriend. Frustrated, he's forced to work with the only super willing to help. Oceanus' ex-villain, ex-boyfriend, Set. Mystic isn't the only one hiding something. Nothing about Jeff is balanced. Temper flares result in scorched clothing or flying furniture, and his charm has become an indiscriminating people-magnet. Jeff is convinced, or maybe just hopeful, that his lack of control is directly related to Oceanus being gone. But will he and Set find her before Jeff loses control completely and will they find her alive? Super Bad The world is in chaos. Violence and thievery reign. And with the supers still balanced, it's only getting worse. Without good versus evil, the supers care less and less. In order to restore purpose, the world needs its super heroes and its super villains, but the one who balanced them in the first place is missing. Sandra's concern over finding her brother Jeff, isn't her only problem. Her pathetic excuse for super powers has left her needing a new ankle. And though she's still very much committed to her boyfriend, Source, she's growing unreasonably attracted to Set, the boy who double-crossed Jeff by stealing his girlfriend. When Sandra is taken and held as bait by some kids who want to unbalance the super world, it becomes the inciting event that changes things for supers everywhere and forces them to answer the question, \\"Hero or villain?\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nu-VCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clean New World: Culture, Politics, and Graphic Design","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Christmas Books of Mr. M.

Gonzales (18421921) was more than a gifted metalworker. A man of varied talents whose poems and songs complement his work in punched tin, Gonzales transcends categorization. In The Artistic Odyssey of Higinio V. Gonzales, Maurice M. Dixon, Jr., who has spent more than thirty years studying New Mexico tinwork, describes the artist s signature techniques. Featuring translations of Gonzales s poetry, this book restores a long-forgotten New Mexican innovator to the prominence he deserves. Recounting the scholarly detective work that revealed the full scope of Gonzales s art and career, Dixon tells the story of a craftsman who was also a poet. He begins with Gonzales s first signed literary work, a handwritten birthday poem decorated with beautifully drawn flowers and birds, dated 1889, and then pieces together the artist s life and career. Through meticulous research into manuscripts and the dates of tin cans that Gonzales repurposed into elegant, fanciful frames, niches, sconces, and religious decorations, Dixon identifies as Gonzales s numerous pieces of poetry and tinwork once attributed to anonymous poets and artists. His most important discovery served as a Rosetta stone: an ink wash and watercolor drawing in an ornamental tin frame (housed at the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos), whose documented provenance helped Dixon to identify Gonzales s other artwork. More than 100 color photographs of Gonzales s tinwork and more than a dozen translations of the artist s poetic and musical works punctuate the narrative. Both a catalogue raisonn  of a hitherto little-known artist and an anthology of his writings, this book reconstructs the creative life of a long-overlooked talent, one whose quest for beauty resulted in a prolific body of art and literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eBbyCgAAQBAJ&dq=William+Becknell:+Father+of+the+Santa+Fe+Trade+(Southwestern+Studies+(El+Paso,+Tex.),+Monograph+No.+68.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the opera","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sypbXED5Bk8C&dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+opera&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tudor Roses","description":"This volume of Tudor Roses presents new and reimagined garments based on the original Tudor Roses published in 1998.

Through garment design, Starmore and her daughter Jade tell the stories of fourteen women connected with the Tudor dynasty.

Tudor Roses includes fourteen patterns for sweaters and other wearables that follow the chronological order of the Tudor dynasty. A different model portrays each of the Tudor women, from Elizabeth Woodville, grandmother of Henry VIII, through Mary, Queen of Scots.

Suddenly, McGarr must face a malevolent plot of IRA gunrunning, betrayal, and conspiracy--all aimed at not just killing one unhappy sailor, but framing a certain Chief Inspector, and keeping him away from secrets even more dangerous than murder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZP7dbs5yUhUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy Adult Magazine: April 1991","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mose (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The King's Rangers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kisses (Little Nugget)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sam Chance: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beneath a Dakota Cross (Fortunes of the Black Hills, Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Poems Retrieved","description":"A reissue of this classic, essential companion to Frank O'Hara's Collected Poems, with a new introduction by Bill Berkson.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_3bGAgAAQBAJ&dq=Poems+Retrieved&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Job ( the New Int'l Commentary Set on The Old Testament)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXrpAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Job+(+the+New+Int%27l+Commentary+Set+on+The+Old+Testament)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking From the Infinite","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: mastering the language of Web design.

Weiner calls  juridical racialism.  The book follows the history of this civic discourse by examining the legal status of four minority groups in four successive historical periods: American Indians in the 1880s, Filipinos after the Spanish-American War, Japanese immigrants in the 1920s, and African Americans in the 1940s and 1950s. Weiner reveals the significance of juridical racialism for each group and, in turn, Americans as a whole by examining the work of anthropological social scientists who developed distinctive ways of understanding racial and legal identity, and through decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court that put these ethno-legal views into practice. Combining history, anthropology, and legal analysis, the book argues that the story of juridical racialism shows how race and citizenship served as a nexus for the professionalization of the social sciences, the growth of national state power, economic modernization, and modern practices of the self.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EiUUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Americans+Without+Law:+The+Racial+Boundaries+of+Citizenship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NLP: The New Technology of Achievement","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nice Girl Like You (Silhouette Yours Truly, No. 33)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Downscaling: Simplify and Enrich Your Lifestyle","description":"Discusses how one can simplify and improve one's life by re-evaluating priorities, values, and needs and placing family above material goods, and offers suggestions for creating and maintaining happiness","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=edgnC7qOYikC&dq=Downscaling:+Simplify+and+Enrich+Your+Lifestyle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not In Our Stars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7TvZuwEACAAJ&dq=Not+In+Our+Stars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bandanas and October Supplies: A Memoir","description":"An offbeat personal account by the author of Little New York Bastard finds his life placed on hold when his mother is diagnosed with cancer, a diagnosis that prompts their shared cross-country car journey in search of peace and sustenance.

Their assault developed into a full-blown advance towards Singapore, the main defensive position of the British Empire in the Far East. The defending British, Indian, Australian and Malayan forces were outmanoeuvred on the ground, overwhelmed in the air and scattered on the sea. By the end of January 1942, British Empire forces were driven back onto the island of Singapore Itself, cut off from further outside help. When the Japanese stormed the island with an an-out assault, the defenders were quickly pushed back into a corner from which there was no escape. Singapore s defenders finally capitulated on 15 February, to prevent the wholesale pillage of the city itself. Their rapid and total defeat was nothing less than military humiliation and political disaster. Based on the most extensive use yet of primary documents in Britain, Japan, Australia and Singapore, Brian Farrell provides the fullest picture of how and why Singapore fell and its real significance to the outcome of the Second World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rh7fDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designs and Patterns for Embroiderers and Craftspeople (Dover Pictorial Archive)","description":"A collection of the outstanding turn-of-the-century embroidery designs permits creation of original needle-painting compositions by combining elements from different plates","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W14-DwAAQBAJ&dq=Designs+and+Patterns+for+Embroiderers+and+Craftspeople+(Dover+Pictorial+Archive)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago's Midway Airport (Illinois)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ebZfewAACAAJ&dq=Chicago%27s+Midway+Airport+(Illinois)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chinese at the negotiating table style and characteristics (SuDoc D 5.402:C 44)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Waiting for Yesterday","description":"A family's package holiday to Spain proves to be an even greater change from Blackpool than expected.7 women, 4 men","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YbryAAAAMAAJ&dq=Waiting+for+Yesterday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cisco Networking Academy Program: Lab Companion, Volume I (2nd Edition)","description":"The Only Authorized Journal and Workbook for the Cisco Networking Academy Program Cisco-approved study materials for the Networking Academies course Written by the course developer!

Originally designed to spread the cost of government fairly, our tax code has turned into a gold mine of loopholes and giveaways manipulated by the influential and wealthy for their own benefit. If you feel as if the tax laws are rigged against the average taxpayer, you're right: Middle-income taxpayers pick up a growing share of the nation s tax bill, while our most profitable corporations pay little or nothing. Your tax status is affected more by how many lawyers and lobbyists you can afford than by your resources or needs. Our best-known and most successful companies pay more taxes to foreign governments than to our own. Cities and states start bidding wars to attract business through tax breaks taxes made up for by the American taxpayer. Who really pays the taxes? Barlett and Stelle, authors of the bestselling America: What Went Wrong?, offer a graphic expos  of what s wrong with our tax system, how it got that way, and how to fix it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7Eiy1Fo9lC4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man of God: Saint John of Shanghai & San Francisco","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thaddeus Kosciuszko: The Purest Son of Liberty","description":"The definitive biography of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, hero of the American Revolution and the Polish revolt against Russian control in the 1790s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7_xoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Thaddeus+Kosciuszko:+The+Purest+Son+of+Liberty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romance of Two Worlds","description":"After meeting a mysterious stranger, a sickly woman drinks a powerful potion that opens her eyes, heart and mind to the wonders of the supernatural.

For family, even the girls' own father, it was a constant guessing game. For strangers, the surprise was overwhelming. And for the twins Olivia and Victoria Henderson, two remarkable young women coming of age at the turn of the century, their bond was mysterious, marvelous, and often playful--a secret realm only they inhabited. Olivia and Victoria were the beloved daughters of a man who never fully recovered from his wife's death bearing them in 1893. Shy, serious Olivia, born eleven minutes before her sister, had taken over the role of mother in their lush New York estate, managing not only a household but her rebellious twin's flights of fancy. Free-spirited Victoria wanted to change the world. She embraced the women's suffrage movement and dreamed of sailing to war-torn Europe. Then, in the girls' twenty-first year, as the first world war escalated overseas, a fateful choice changed their lives forever. It began when Victoria's life was about to become a public scandal. It led to a painful decision, and brought handsome lawyer Charles Dawson into the Henderson's life and family. Hand-picked by the twins' father to save his daughter's reputation, Charles was still mourning his wife's death aboard the Titanic, struggling to raise his nine year-old son alone, determined never to lose his heart again. Charles wanted to believe that, for the sake of his son, he could make an unwanted marriage work. But in an act of deception that only Olivia and Victoria could manage, the twins took an irrevocable step, which changed both their lives forever; and took one of the twins to the battlefields of France, the other into a marriage she longed for but could not have. From Manhattan society to the trenches of war-ravaged France, Mirror Image moves elegantly and dramatically through a rich and troubled era. With startling insight, Danielle Steel explores women's choices: between home and adventure, between the love for family and the passion for a cause, between sacrifice and desire. But at the heart of Mirror Image is a fascinating, realistic portrait of identical twins, two vastly different sisters who lead their lives and follow their destinies against a vivid backdrop of a world at war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5vpxga_n0-wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Semiotics of Peasants in Transition: Slovene Villagers and Their Ethnic Relatives in America (Sound and Meaning: The Roman Jakobson Series in Linguistics and Poetics)","description":"In Semiotics of Peasants in Transition Irene Portis-Winner examines the complexities of ethnic identity in a traditional Slovene village with unique ties to an American city. At once an investigation into a particular anthropological situation and a theoretical exploration of the semiotics of ethnic culture in this case a culture permeated by transnational influences Semiotics of Peasants in Transition describes the complex relationships that have existed between and among the villagers remaining in Slovenia and those who, throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio. Describing a process of continuous and enduring interaction between these geographically separate communities, Portis-Winner explains how, for instance, financial assistance from the emigrants enabled their Slovenian hometown to survive the economic depressions of the 1890s and 1930s. She also analyzes the extent to which memories, rituals, myths, and traditional activities from Slovenia have sustained their Cleveland relatives. The result is a unique anthropological investigation into the signifying practices of a strongly cohesive yet geographically split ethnic group, as well as an illuminating application of semiotic analyses to communities and the complex problems they face.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nCF3MtARqxsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning at Casino Gambling (Signet)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Prankster and the Conspiracy: The Story of Kerry Thornley and How He Met Oswald and Inspired the Counterculture","description":"One of the 1960s counterculture's most fascinating characters was Kerry Wendell Thornley -- a writer, philosopher, Zen dishwasher, enlightened prankster, and, possibly, an Oswald double with disturbing ties to the Kennedy assassination.

Diagnosed with cancer, the acclaimed painter, and rival of Picasso, seemed to be facing his demise. Then something unexpected happened. After a life-saving operation that left him too weak to paint, and often too frail to even get out of bed, Matisse invented a ground-breaking and effortless new way of making art. The results rank among his greatest work. In an astonishing blaze of creativity, he began conjuring mesmerising designs of dazzling dancers and thrilling tightrope walkers, sensuous swimmers and mythical figures falling from the heavens. His joyful and unprecedented new works were as spontaneous as jazz music and as wondrous as crystal-clear lagoons. Their medium? Coloured paper and scissors. This book, by art critic and broadcaster Alastair Sooke, focuses on Matisse's extraordinary final decade, which he called 'a second life', after he had returned from the grave. Both a biography and a guide to Matisse's 'cut-outs', it tells the story of the valedictory flourish of one of the most important and beloved artists of the twentieth century. Published in time for a major Tate Modern retrospective. 'Sooke is an immensely engaging character. He has none of the weighty self-regard that often afflicts art experts and critics; rather he approaches his subjects with a questioning, open, exploratory attitude' Sarah Vine, The Times 'His shows are excellent - clever, lively, scholarly, but not too lecturey; he's very good at linking his painters with the world outside the studio, and at how these artists have affected the world today' Sam Wollaston reviewing 'Modern Masters', Guardian Alastair Sooke is art critic of the Daily Telegraph. He has written and presented documentaries on television and radio for the BBC, including Modern Masters, The World's Most Expensive Paintings, Treasures of Ancient Rome and, most recently, Treasures of Ancient Egypt.

Now in its tenth year of publication, the book remains the clearest, most inviting and readable guide to the Hebrew Bible around and a profound meditation on the effect that modern biblical scholarship has had on traditional belief. Moving chapter by chapter, Harvard professor James Kugel covers the Bible s most significant stories the Creation of the world, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, Abraham and Sarah, Jacob and his wives, Moses and the exodus, David s mighty kingdom, plus the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other prophets, and on to the Babylonian conquest and the eventual return to Zion. Throughout, Kugel contrasts the way modern scholars understand these events with the way Christians and Jews have traditionally understood them. The latter is not, Kugel shows, a na?ve reading; rather, it is the product of a school of sophisticated interpreters who flourished toward the end of the biblical period. These highly ideological readers sought to put their own spin on texts that had been around for centuries, utterly transforming them in the process. Their interpretations became what the Bible meant for centuries and centuries until modern scholarship came along. The question that this book ultimately asks is: What now? As one reviewer wrote, Kugel s answer provides  a contemporary model of how to read Sacred Scripture amidst the oppositional pulls of modern scholarship and tradition.

By the time you actually buy a stock, professional investors have already been there, bought the stock, driven up the price, and are just waiting to unload it at an inflated price. All That's About to Change. . . . In Ahead of the Market, Mitch Zacks shows investors how they can spot stocks that are poised to take off long before the rest of the crowd learns about them. How? By unlocking the gems of priceless information buried in Wall Street's often self-serving research. Ahead of the Market is the first book, ever, that enables you to profitably use the analyst stock research for which Wall Street firms pay more than one billion dollars annually. Many investors have rightly felt misled in the past by analysts who continued to hype stocks as prices plummeted. You may have even concluded that Wall Street research is totally worthless. But it's not. In Ahead of the Market, Mitch Zacks shows that analysts actually provide a wealth of market-moving information that can generate exceptional returns if interpreted correctly.The key is to use the research produced by Wall Street analysts the same way the professional money managers do. Pioneered by the firm Zacks Investment Research and based on more than twenty years of intensive analysis, the investment strategies revealed in this book are indeed the same ones used by successful professional investors everywhere. In these pages you will learn how to form an investment plan by locating stocks that are poised for price appreciation and avoiding stocks heading for a fall. Zacks shows how you could have prevented being burned when the recent bubble burst, if you had known how to use analyst research correctly and teaches you the rules of the research game so you will not fall victim the next time around. In sum, this book is your guide to picking the right stock at the right time. Mitch Zacks's groundbreaking research provides new insights and new strategies to: Use revisions to analysts' earnings estimates to predict the rise and fall of stock prices Interpret the real meaning behind analysts' stock recommendations Employ the \\"cockroach\\" phenomenon and other methodologies to predict earnings surprises before they occur Determine how to react when a company reports earnings and how to profit from \\"post-earnings announcement drift\\" Understand and profit from \\"analyst creep\\" the reason that earnings estimate revisions occur incrementally over time Avoid being duped by the games that companies play with their earnings reportsWhether the economy is healthy or stalled, whether the market is up or down, by focusing on the strategies contained in this book you will always come out ahead. Well-picked individual stocks will always carry the day. Now with Ahead of the Market, you will finally have the same tools institutional investors have and will be able to find great stocks in any market environment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JiJpD0Qs9c8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Werner Museum, Inc.: Inside the Global Art World.(Shorter notices)(Book review): An article from: New Criterion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f29UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Paul+Werner+Museum,+Inc.:+Inside+the+Global+Art+World.(Shorter+notices)(Book+review):+An+article+from:+New+Criterion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture Shock!

On one hand is the notion that Christianity is superior to Islam and that Muslims are warmongers. On the other is the notion that all religions basically say the same thing and are peaceable. Theologian and critically acclaimed author Lee Camp argues that both these extremes are wrong. He introduces Christian and Islamic views on war and peacemaking and examines Christian and non-Christian terrorism to help readers confront their own prejudices. Camp shatters misconceptions about religious violence, arguing that American Christians often opt for an ethic that has more in common with the story of Muhammad than with the story of Jesus. This book shows readers how to respond faithfully and intelligently to Muslims in today's world as well as to the New Atheists who suppose that all religion is inherently violent.

Based on the three-volume first edition that shocked readers when first published in 1891, this edition includes as appendices: Hardy's Prefaces, the Landscapes of Tess, episodes originally censored from the Graphic periodical version, and a selection of the Graphic illustrations.

The Nazis may have given eugenics its negative connotations, but the practice--and the \\"science\\" that supports it--is still disturbingly alive in America in anti-immigration initiatives, the quest for a \\"gay gene, \\" and theories of collective intelligence. Tracing the historical roots and persistence of eugenics in the United States, Nancy Ordover explores the political and cultural climate that has endowed these campaigns with mass appeal and scientific legitimacy. American Eugenics demonstrates how biological theories of race, gender, and sexuality are crucially linked through a concern with regulating the \\"unfit.\\" These links emerge in Ordover's examination of three separate but ultimately related American eugenics campaigns: early twentieth-century anti-immigration crusades; medical models and interventions imposed on (and sometimes embraced by) lesbians, gays, transgendered people, and bisexuals; and the compulsory sterilization of poor women and women of color. Throughout, her work reveals how constructed notions of race, gender, sexuality, and nation are put to ideological uses and how \\"faith in science\\" can undermine progressive social movements, drawing liberals and conservatives alike into eugenics-based discourse and policies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5qHGELC_h-4C&dq=American+Eugenics:+Race,+Queer+Anatomy,+and+the+Science+of+Nationalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honey, Honey, Miss Thang: Being Black, Gay, and on the Streets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wind Storm Rising","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ten Great Preachers: Messages and Interviews","description":"Crossing denominational, gender, and ethnic lines, here are interviews with ten of the most effective preachers in the English-speaking world plus a message from each.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xXIFAAAACAAJ&dq=Ten+Great+Preachers:+Messages+and+Interviews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane VS the Tooth Fairy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Clymer Suzuki Bandit 600, 1995-2000","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"12,000 Miles in the Nick of Time: A Semi-Dysfunctional Family Circumnavigates the Globe (An Evergreen book)","description":"A different kind of politics for a new kind of society--beyond work, scarcity and capitalism In the twenty-first century, new technologies should liberate us from work. Automation, rather than undermining an economy built on full employment, is instead the path to a world of liberty, luxury and happiness for everyone. Technological advance will reduce the value of commodities food, healthcare and housing towards zero. Improvements in renewable energies will make fossil fuels a thing of the past. Asteroids will be mined for essential minerals. Genetic editing and synthetic biology will prolong life, virtually eliminate disease and provide meat without animals. New horizons beckon. In Fully Automated Luxury Communism, Aaron Bastani conjures a vision of extraordinary hope, showing how we move to energy abundance, feed a world of 9 billion, overcome work, transcend the limits of biology, and establish meaningful freedom for everyone.

Green returns to the Nightside with this landmark collection of short fiction. Welcome to the Nightside.

It's the place to go if you're looking to indulge the darker side of your nature--and to hell with the consequences. Tales from the Nightside presents ten macabre mysteries that shine a dim beam into the neighborhood's darkest corners to reveal things that should never come to light. Take a walk with such deadly and dangerous denizens of the Nightside as Razor Eddie, Dead Boy, and Larry Oblivion as they encounter things even more inhuman and inhumane than they are. And join John Taylor, the PI with a knack for finding lost things, as he confronts Sir Francis Varney, King of the Vampires, in a novella-length adventure.

Baldwin makes delightful mischief in her debut Regency romp.\\" - Elisabeth Fairchild, RT Lifetime Achievement Winner Lady Fiasco, Book 1, My Notorious Aunt Completely revised for eBook A Humorous Traditional Regency Can a lady with a reputation for disaster, stumble into love? An unusual heroine, Fiona Hawthorn grew up running free. Without a mother to restrain her, she spends her days riding her horse neck or nothing across her father's fields and swimming like a sea nymph. But inside a prim and proper Regency sitting room Fiona is bound to overturn the teapot or accidentally trip the footman. Her notorious Aunt Honore decides to take the hoyden in hand, but amidst the strictures of the Beau Monde, Fiona is a fish out of water. When she was younger, Lord Wesmont was her hero. Sadly, he came home from fighting Napoleon a hardened man. Nothing can breathe life back into his cold heart, nothing except, perhaps, the love of an unusual young woman who regularly turns his life upside-down. Lady Fiasco is a Sweet Traditional Regency Romance. ,p.AUTHORS' NOTE: Lady Fiasco was my very first full length novel. Over the years, I've gotten many letters from readers asking where I got the idea for the story. As with all ideas, it was a fusion of elements. First, I drew from real life. My one and only aunt was as wildly unpredictable and outrageous as Lady Alameda. Maybe worse. One never knew what to expect when she blew into town. It is only natural that her bigger than life personality seeped into my creative id and played havoc there, too. A compulsive history buff, I ran across a book of lampoons by the amazing George Cruikshank making fun of the famous people of the day, including the Prince Regent. I could not resist including one or two lampoons in this book. Political and social lampoons were wildly popular in the Regency era even though the drawings were surprisingly bawdy and scandalous. I also loved reading Georgette Heyer's adventurous Regency Romantic comedies. Georgette Heyer inspired me to leave off writing short stories and tackle a Regency. She opened the door to other writers like; the amazing Julia Quinn, and Marion Chesney with her quirky characters, and the incomparable Elisabeth Fairchild, who later became a close friend. I also fell in love with the early writings of Loretta Chase. Ms Chase wrote some very funny traditional romances before she became famous for her iconic long historical Regency romance, Lord of Scoundrels. It is with deepest respect, that I pay homage to all these great writers and say a hearty thank you for the inspiration. I must also mention Jane Austen, whose dry wit and tongue in cheek humor had a profound effect on my writing as far back as High School. I devoured Jane Austen's writing not long after I was introduced to my beloved Oscar Wilde. A rascally fellow in real life but an amazing literary genius. In college, I studied the humorists: P.G. Wodehouse and O'Henry. Wouldn't it be marvelous to arrange a netherworld tea party and invite Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer, Wodehouse and O'Henry? I'd put on my best frock and sit quietly listening to them shoot barbs at one another. What fun! You'd come too, wouldn't you? So there you have it, these few hundred things went into the making of Lady Fiasco. Drop by my website, and let me know what you think of it.

The author, a former member of the British Diplomatic Service, was brought up as an agnostic and embraced Islam at an early age after writing a book (commissioned by T.S. Eliot) on Eastern religions and their influence upon Western thinkers. As a Muslim he has retained his adherence to the perennial philosophy which, he maintains, underlies the teachings of all the great religions. The aim of this book is to explore what it means to be a Muslim, a member of a community which embraces a quarter of the world?s population and to describe the forces which have shaped the hearts and the minds of Islamic people. After considering the historic confrontation between Islam and Christendom and analysing the difference between the three monotheistic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the author describes the two poles of Muslim belief in terms of ?Truth? and ?Mercy??the unitarian truth which is the basis of the Muslim?s faith and the mercy inherent in this truth. In the second part of the book he explains the significance of the Qur?an and tells the dramatic story of Muhammad?s life and of the early Caliphate. Lastly, the author considers the Muslim view of man?s destiny, the social structure of Islam, the role of art and mysticism and the inner meaning of Islamic teaching concerning the hereafter. Throughout this book the author is concerned not with the religion of Islam in isolation, but with the very nature of religious faith, its spiritual and intellectual foundations, and the light it casts upon the mysteries and paradoxes of the human condition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VhXtpwCM8g8C&dq=The+Destiny+of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indian tribes of the lower Mississippi Valley and adjacent coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Smithsonian Institution.

Crime historian extraordinaire Jay Robert Nash has left no stone unturned in his search for the gunmen, train robbers, gangs, desperadoes, range warriors, gamblers, and lawmen that roamed the frontier. Contrary to popular myth, the Wild West was not a glamorous land where chivalry and courage were the custom and a man died with his boots on. It was a land of incredible hardships brutal weather, hunger and disease, and the constant threat of violent death. Everyone carried a six-shooter, neutrality was impossible, and violence unavoidable; lawmen and outlaws lived side by side, and often there was no telling one from the other. Into this land came pioneers lured by promises of great fortunes, ex-Confederate soldiers embittered by the outcome of the war, greedy cattle barons, and merchant princes. It was truly an explosive mixture.Included in this volume are all the great Western legends Billy the Kid, Jesse and Frank James, Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Judge Roy Bean,  Wild Bill  Hickock and a host of lesser-known figures who, though they may have missed notoriety, were equally lethal. And while the West was very much a man's world, several women managed to shoot, steal, or gamble their way to fame including Belle Starr, Pearl Hart, and Calamity Jane.A compelling read, Encyclopedia of Western Lawmen & Outlaws will be the standard reference for years to come. In addition to alphabetical listings, it offers a glossary of lawmen and a glossary of outlaws, a magnificent photo and illustration appendix, and an extensive bibliography of books on the American West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L_vuswEACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Western+Lawmen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Challenges for Champions (Super Hero Role Playing, Stock No. 404)","description":"Atlanta magazine s editorial mission is to engage our community through provocative writing, authoritative reporting, and superlative design that illuminate the people, the issues, the trends, and the events that define our city.

He assumes little knowledge of Chinese history or culture and compares the Chinese experience with books with that of other civilizations, particularly the European. Yet he deals with a wide range of issues in the history of the book in China and presents novel analyses of the changes in Chinese woodblock bookmaking over these centuries. He presents a new view of when the printed book replaced the manuscript and what drove that substitution. He explores the distribution and marketing structure of books, and writes fascinatingly on the history of book collecting and about access to private and government book collections. In drawing on a great deal of Chinese, Japanese, and Western research this book provides a broad account of the way Chinese books were printed, distributed, and consumed by literati and scholars, mainly in the lower Yangzi delta, the cultural center of China during these centuries. It introduces interesting personalities, ranging from wily book collectors to an indigent shoe-repairman collector. And, it discusses the obstacles to the formation of a truly national printed culture for both the well-educated and the struggling reader in recent times. This broad and comprehensive account of the development of printed Chinese culture from 1000 to 1800 is written for anyone interested in the history of the book. It also offers important new insights into book culture and its place in society for the student of Chinese history and culture. 'A brilliant piece of synthetic research as well as a delightful read, it offers a history of the Chinese book to the eighteenth century that is without equal.' - Timothy Brook, University of British Columbia 'Writers, scribes, engravers, printers, binders, publishers, distributors, dealers, literati, scholars, librarians, collectors, voracious readers   the full gamut of a vibrant book culture in China over one thousand years   are examined with eloquence and perception by Joseph McDermott in The Social History of the Book.

He joined Aleister's Crowley's Mystical Order A A (Astrum Argentum) at 23, and was acknowledged by the 'Great Beast' as his 'magical child'. Jones took the title Achad (Unity), and it was as Frater Achad that he published most of his most famous occult studies, including the ground-breaking 'Q.B.L., The Bride's Reception'. This work is a masterpiece, an occult investigation into the profundities of Qabalah, its arcane symbolism, and links to other esoteric systems such as the Tarot. But it is more than this - it is a book that offers both novice and adept alike a remarkably clear and understandable exposition of this otherwise recondite, confusing, and seemingly contradictory worldview. As The Occult Review stated on the book's publication in 1922 \\"we can only advise those who are able to do so to study Frater Achad's essay.

For the first time in three years of bloody trench warfare, epitomized by the slaughter at Passchendaele which was then reaching its climax, tanks brought about a breakthrough of the massive German defense system of the Hindenburg Line, followed up by British infantry and cavalry divisions. They were supported for the first time by low flying fighter aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps. The initial victory at Cambrai brought cheering crowds into the streets of London and the ringing of church bells in celebration. In seemed possible that the success might bring about the final defeat of Germany. But the British High Command failed to exploit the success. Generals who still dreamt of massive cavalry charges had not had much faith in this strange new weapon that had been brought to them funded initially by the Royal Navy at the behest of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty and did see its value. The High Command did not really believe the breakthrough was possible and tragically miscalculated the necessary steps to follow it up. Within days the Germans counterattacked and regained much of the ground that the British had won. What could have been the final victory was delayed for another year.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6jsRBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Border: A Novel","description":"ONE OF THE MOST ACCLAIMED BOOKS OF THE YEAR Contains an excerpt from Don Winslow s explosive new novel, City on Fire!

When the lines you thought existed simply vanish? How do you plant your feet to make a stand when you no longer know what side you re on? The war has come home. For over forty years, Art Keller has been on the front lines of America s longest conflict: The War on Drugs. His obsession to defeat the world s most powerful, wealthy, and lethal kingpin?the godfather of the Sinaloa Cartel, Ad n Barrera?has left him bloody and scarred, cost him the people he loves, even taken a piece of his soul. Now Keller is elevated to the highest ranks of the DEA, only to find that in destroying one monster he has created thirty more that are wreaking even more chaos and suffering in his beloved Mexico. But not just there. Barrera s final legacy is the heroin epidemic scourging America. Throwing himself into the gap to stem the deadly flow, Keller finds himself surrounded by enemies?men who want to kill him, politicians who want to destroy him, and worse, the unimaginable?an incoming administration that s in bed with the very drug traffickers that Keller is trying to bring down. Art Keller is at war with not only the cartels, but with his own government. And the long fight has taught him more than he ever imagined. Now, he learns the final lesson?there are no borders. In a story that moves from deserts of Mexico to Wall Street, from the slums of Guatemala to the marbled corridors of Washington, D.C., Winslow follows a new generation of narcos, the cops who fight them, street traffickers, addicts, politicians, money-launderers, real-estate moguls, and mere children fleeing the violence for the chance of a life in a new country.

Invented by English schoolboys in the 1850s, squash first came to the United States in 1884 when St. Paul's School in New Hampshire built four open-air courts. The game took hold in Philadelphia, where players founded the U.S. Squash Racquets Association in 1904, and became one of the primary pastimes of the nation's elite. Squash launched a U.S. Open in 1954, but its present boom started in the 1970s when commercial squash clubs took the sport public. In the 1980s a pro tour sprung up to offer tournaments on portable glass courts in dramatic locales such as the Winter Garden at the World Trade Center. James Zug, with access to private archives and interviews with hundreds of players, describes the riveting moments and sweeping historical trends that have shaped the game. He focuses on the biographies of legendary squash personalities: Eleo Sears, the Boston Brahmin who swam in the cold Atlantic before matches; Hashim Khan, the impish founder of the Khan dynasty; Victor Niederhoffer, the son of a Brooklyn cop; and Mark Talbott, a Grateful Dead groupie who traveled the pro circuit sleeping in the back of his pickup.

It gathers a wide range of evidence from the second century B.C. to the second century A.D.--above all from such literary texts as courtroom speeches, love poetry, philosophy, epigram, and history, but also graffiti and other inscriptions as well as artistic artifacts--and uses that evidence to reconstruct the contexts within which Roman texts were created and had their meaning. The book takes as its starting point the thesis that in order to understand the Roman material, we must make the effort to set aside any preconceptions we might have regarding sexuality, masculinity, and effeminacy. Williams' book argues in detail that for the writers and readers of Roman texts, the important distinctions were drawn not between homosexual and heterosexual, but between free and slave, dominant and subordinate, masculin and effeminate as conceived in specifically Roman terms. Other important questions addressed by this book include the differences between Roman and Greek practices and ideologies; the influence exerted by distinctively Roman ideals of austerity; the ways in which deviations from the norms of masculine sexual practice were negotiated both in the arena of public discourse and in real men's lives; the relationship between the rhetoric of \\"nature\\" and representations of sexual practices; and the extent to which same-sex marriages were publicly accepted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kf4cs5Y0fiIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everyman Book of Nonsense Verse (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","description":"Presents a collection of nonsense rhymes by both well known authors and anonymous ones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3QkJIIIuX6gC&dq=The+Everyman+Book+of+Nonsense+Verse+(Everyman%27s+Library+Children%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Other Women: A Novel","description":"THE REESE WITHERSPOON X HELLO SUNSHINE BOOK CLUB PICK AND NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \\"One of the most twisted and entertaining plots.\\" Reese Witherspoon \\"Whiplash-inducing.\\" New York Times Book Review \\"Such fun you'll cheer [Emily's] chutzpah.\\" PEOPLE \\"This thriller will hit close to home.\\" Refinery29 The most twisty, addictive and gripping debut thriller you'll read this year.

The book traces their artistic development from the early 1930s, when the two met in Berlin at the Bauhaus, through the mid-1950s, by which time they had firmly established the foundations of modern photography in Buenos Aires. While twentieth-century photography has a fair number of important teams, Stern and Coppola are unique in that they managed to share their avant-garde ambition while maintaining their autographic styles and individual practices. The couple effectively imported the lessons of the Bauhaus to Latin America, and revolutionized the practice of art and commercial photography on both sides of the Atlantic by introducing such innovative techniques as photomontage, embodied in Sterns protofeminist works for the womens journal Idilio, and through Coppolas experimental films and groundbreaking images for the photographic survey Buenos Aires 1936.

He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy fabliaux, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology. Chaucer s accomplishment is unequalled by any poet before Shakespeare and in The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida ranks with that of the great English novelists. Both The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida are presented complete in this anthology, in fresh modern translations by Theodore Morrison that convey both the gravity and gaiety of the Middle English originals. The Portable Chaucer also contains selections from The Book of Duchess, The House of Fame, The Bird's Parliament, and The Legend of Good Women, together with short poems. Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hy3q85lptAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charmides","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When I heard the learn'd astronomer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aromatherapy: A Complete Guide to the Healing Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Router Basics (Basics Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The age of fable (Literature of yesterday and to-day)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Becoming Jewish: A handbook for conversion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The watch that ends the night","description":"George and Catherine Stewart share not only the burden of Catherine's heart disease, which could cause her death at any time, but the memory of Jerome Martell, her first husband and George's closest friend.

This book considers how a host of other ethical traditions define civil society. Unlike most studies of the subject, which focus on a particular region or tradition, it considers a range of ethical traditions rarely addressed in one volume: libertarianism, critical theory, feminism, liberal egalitarianism, natural law, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Confucianism. It considers the extent to which these traditions agree or disagree on how to define civil society's limits and how to evaluate its benefits and harms. A variety of distinguished advocates and interpreters of these traditions present in-depth explorations of how these various traditions think of ethical pluralism within societies, asking how a society should respond to diversity among its members. Together they produce a work rich with original insights on a wide range of subjects about which little has been written to date. An excellent starting point for a comparative ethics of civil society, this book concludes that while the concept of civil society originated in the liberal tradition, it is quickly becoming an important focus for a truly cross-cultural dialogue. In addition to the editors, the contributors are Michael Banner, Hasan Hanafi, Loren E. Lomasky, Richard Madsen, Michael A. Mosher, Michael Pakaluk, Anne Philips, Adam B.

The book suggests that everyone seeks psychic complementarity with an Other in intimate relationships as a way of supporting personal growth and development. A complementary partner is one who is different in some individually meaningful way, not necessarily in terms of gender. Drawing upon interviews with individuals and lesbian couples, literature on lesbian psychology, and contemporary psychoanalytic theory, Beverly Burch observes a special attraction between primary lesbians - women who have been attracted to other women from an early age - and lesbians who formerly were heterosexual. This difference may be a source of tension for lovers, but it also attracts and bonds them in conscious and unconscious ways. The intimacy between lesbian partners permits interpersonal exchanges that foster the continuing development of each, according to Burch. This development can occur in three areas, with the significance of each varying from couple to couple. It can be a source of both conscious and unconscious psychosexual exchanges, a way in which each partner can experience \\"the road not taken\\" through her relationship with the other. The partners' different histories can reflect different ways of negotiating difference itself, a pivotal theme in the development of adult women. And gender role identities related to different developmental experiences can be played with, expanding the experience of being female in a way that can challenge gender categories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6-HQWn3hsAQC&dq=Intimate+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucky","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Safecracker Suite: Drumming and Storytelling","description":"A close friend of physicist Richard Feynman chronicles his relationship with the scientist and describes their ten-year quest to reach the remote country of Tannu Tuva.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eDL697nY3UwC&dq=Safecracker+Suite:+Drumming+and+Storytelling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jannaway's Mutiny","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Orbit Unlimited","description":"Seeking freedom from their oppressive government on Earth, a ragtag group of idealists embark on a perilous journey to found a new world light-years from home On a future Earth, gone are the halcyon days of the early space program, when the universe held endless promise and excitement.

At this time, Aiso was introduced to Akira Oshida and Shigeya Kihara, who worked with Aiso as civilian Japanese instructors. Together with Oshida and Kihara and several other civilian instructors, Aiso prepared teaching materials and the school was formally opened on November 1, 1941. Following the outbreak of war on December 7, 1941, and the forced removal of Japanese Americans from the Pacific Coast to incarceration camps, the school was transferred from San Francisco to Camp Savage, Minnesota, and placed directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, Military Intelligence Division. The army provided personnel, logistical, and administrative support, but the doctrine, development, and implementation of the program remained with John Aiso, now the director of training. By the end of the war in 1945, Aiso had turned out over 6,000 military intelligence specialists. General Charles Willoughby stated that the MIS men shortened the war by two years and saved a million lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ufSEAAAAIAAJ&dq=John+Aiso+and+the+M.I.S.+Japanese-American+Soldiers+in+the+Military+Intelligence+Service,+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evelyn Waugh Portrait of an Artist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=trRjyAEACAAJ&dq=Evelyn+Waugh+Portrait+of+an+Artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TRUE BLUE FOREVER (Large Print)","description":"The Jonas Brothers have gone from obscurity to superstardom in the course of a year, and there's simply no stopping them.

Whether he is in search of a foolproof formula for sourdough bread (made from wild yeast, of course) or the most sublime French fries (the secret: cooking them in horse fat) or the perfect piecrust (Fannie Farmer--that is, Marion Cunningham--comes to the rescue), he will go to any length to find the answer. At the drop of an apron he hops a plane to Japan to taste Wagyu, the hand-massaged beef, or to Palermo to scale Mount Etna to uncover the origins of ice cream. The love of choucroute takes him to Alsace, the scent of truffles to the Piedmont, the sizzle of ribs on the grill to Memphis to judge a barbecue contest, and both the unassuming and the haute cuisines of Paris demand his frequent assessment. Inevitably these pleasurable pursuits take their toll. So we endure with him a week at a fat farm and commiserate over low-fat products and dreary diet cookbooks to bring down the scales. But salvation is at hand when the French Paradox (how can they eat so richly and live so long?) is unearthed, and a \\"miraculous\\" new fat substitute, Olestra, is unveiled, allowing a plump gourmand to have his fill of fat without getting fatter. Here is the man who ate everything and lived to tell about it. And we, his readers, are hereby invited to the feast in this delightful book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YkkhgGoE3_cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Edge of Apostasy : the Evangelical Romance With Rome","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MnmXAAAACAAJ&dq=On+the+Edge+of+Apostasy+:+the+Evangelical+Romance+With+Rome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Delhi, town forgotten","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QxToHAAACAAJ&dq=Delhi,+town+forgotten&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So You Want to Write a Book: How to Write, Self-Publish and Sell Your Own Non-Fiction Book (First in My How-to Series-Prior Series Title Is \\"\\"Gone Fishin'\\"\\", 2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Weekend Chef : 192 Smart Recipes for Relaxed Cooking Ahead","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Winds Of Destiny (Harlequin Historical)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Buddha in Sri Lanka: Remembered Yesterdays","description":"Combining memoir, history, and present-day narrative, this book describes how Buddhism is lived in Sri Lanka.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cYrQnZT9JREC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes from Medieval Halls: Past-Life Memories from the Middle Ages (Did you live then?)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Curious George's Dream (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Curious George (Prebound))","description":"Like The Magic School Bus for a younger set, this new series is all about discovery, adventure and having fun with learning!

But for the Asian world the Korean War was a generations-long struggle that still haunts contemporary events. With access to new evidence and secret materials from both here and abroad, including an archive of captured North Korean documents, Bruce Cumings reveals the war as it was actually fought. He describes its origin as a civil war, preordained long before the first shots were fired in June 1950 by lingering fury over Japan s occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. Cumings then shares the neglected history of America s postWorld War II occupation of Korea, reveals untold stories of bloody insurgencies and rebellions, and tells of the United States officially entering the action on the side of the South, exposing as never before the appalling massacres and atrocities committed on all sides. Elegantly written and blisteringly honest, The Korean War is, like the war it illuminates, brief, devastating, and essential.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ASa9WCcIHFkC&dq=The+Korean+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Petersburg (Eyewitness Travel Guides)","description":"True to its name, this guide covers all of St. Petersburg's major sights and attractions in easy-to-use top 10 lists that help you plan the vacation that's right for you.

The aim of this volume is to present Berkeley's two most important scientific texts in a form which meets contemporary standards of scholarship while rendering them accessible to the modern reader. Although editions of both are contained in the fourth volume of the Works, these lack adequate introductions and do not provide com plete and corrected texts. The present edition contains a complete and critically established text of both De Motu and The Analyst, in addi tion to a new translation of De Motu. The introductions and notes are designed to provide the background necessary for a full understanding of Berkeley's account of science and mathematics. Although these two texts are very different, they are united by a shared a concern with the work of Newton and Leibniz. Berkeley's De Motu deals extensively with Newton's Principia and Leibniz's Specimen Dynamicum, while The Analyst critiques both Leibnizian and Newto nian mathematics. Berkeley is commonly thought of as a successor to Locke or Malebranche, but as these works show he is also a successor to Newton and Leibniz.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i43SBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Federal Taxation Statutes and Regulations 2005","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Il4vqGbL5TMC&dq=Selected+Federal+Taxation+Statutes+and+Regulations+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters from Father Seraphim","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Postal Exams Book","description":"\\"A guide to Post Office employment is included.\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6C4ijwEACAAJ&dq=Postal+Exams+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Big Horn (Dramatized)","description":"The Battle of the Little Bighorn remains one of history s most famous and most controversial events. Lieutenant Colonel George Custer, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, the Seventh Cavalry, the Sioux, and the Cheyenne were all there on June 25th, 1876. This battle, which was a shocking disaster for the U.S. army and a triumph for Native Americans, continues to fascinate us more than 125 years later. Often when people are shocked by an unexpected event, they want to understand exactly why and how it happened. In the case of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, these questions have yet to be answered completely satisfactorily, due to the lack of totally definitive evidence regarding some of the details. As a result, some controversy still surrounds the battle. A Day to Remember introduces the reader to the many aspects of this battle.

Taken captive by the Sioux, Judith is given to Scarlet Plume, one of the many warriors who know their cause is lost. Caught between the men who would wage war ruthlessly and his own judgment, which tells him how dearly the Sioux will pay for every white person killed, Scarlet Plume tries to save as many as he can.

Despite her stepfather's claim that it was a deliberate act, the Juvenile Court ruled the death an accident. Many people, however, agreed with Foster and tabloids compared Liza to the infamous murderess, Lizzie Borden, pointing even to the similarity in name. Growing up with adoptive parents who tried to erase every trace of her past, her name is changed to Celia. Always, though, the fear hung over her and the family - that someday, her vengeful stepfather would reappear to harm her. Aged 25, a successful interior designer, she marries a childless sixty-year old widower and they have a son. Before their marriage, she had confided her earlier life to her husband. Two years on, on his deathbed, he tells her that he would want her to re-marry, but makes her swear never to reveal her past to anyone, so that their son would not carry the burden of this family tragedy - a promise that plunges her into a new cycle of violence. Three years later, happily re-married, Celia is shocked when her second husband presents her with a gift -- the house where she killed her mother. When the real estate agent who has made the sale recognises her and, soon after, is murdrered, Celia is accused of the crime. Once again, she is home -- the place where she is stamped as a murderess.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZ3NBAAAQBAJ&dq=No+Place+Like+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Controversies in International Relations Theory: Realism and the Neoliberal Challenge","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tidepools","description":"Adam Nicolson explores the marine life inhabiting seashore rockpools with a scientist s curiosity and a poet s wonder in this beautifully illustrated book. The sea is not made of water. Creatures are its genes. Look down as you crouch over the shallows and you will find a periwinkle or a prawn, a claw-displaying crab or a cluster of anemones ready to meet you. No need for binoculars or special stalking skills: go to the rocks and the living will say hello. Inside each rock pool tucked into one of the infinite crevices of the tidal coastline lies a rippling, silent, unknowable universe. Below the stillness of the surface course different currents of endless motion the ebb and flow of the tide, the steady forward propulsion of the passage of time, and the tiny lifetimes of the rock pool s creatures, all of which coalesce into the grand narrative of evolution. In Life Between the Tides, Adam Nicolson investigates one of the most revelatory habitats on earth. Under his microscope, we see a prawn s head become a medieval helmet and a group of  winkles  transform into a Dickensian social scene, with mollusks munching on Stilton and glancing at their pocket watches. Or, rather, is a winkle more like Achilles, an ancient hero, throwing himself toward death for the sake of glory? For Nicolson, who writes  with scientific rigor and a poet s sense of wonder  (The American Scholar), the world of the rock pools is infinite and as intricate as our own. As Nicolson journeys between the tides, both in the pools he builds along the coast of Scotland and through the timeline of scientific discovery, he is accompanied by great thinkers no one can escape the pull of the sea. We meet Virginia Woolf and her Waves; a young T. S. Eliot peering into his own rock pool in Massachusetts; even Nicolson s father-in-law, a classical scholar who would hunt for amethysts along the shoreline, his mind on Heraclitus and the other philosophers of ancient Greece. And, of course, scientists populate the pages; not only their discoveries, but also their doubts and errors, their moments of quiet observation and their thrilling realizations. Everything is within the rock pools, where you can look beyond your own reflection and find the miraculous an inch beneath your nose.  The soul wants to be wet,  Heraclitus said in Ephesus twenty-five hundred years ago. This marvelous book demonstrates why it is so.

Powered by the Rolls Royce Vulture, it was the only British aircraft to use this engine operationally. The design was revised and amended several times, with three enlargements of the flying surfaces required to provide an adequate flight envelope. Nevertheless, Manchesters entered service without adequate type-testing, leading to four groundings in the first ten months of use. Aircrews were faced with airframe and engine challenges, and the Manchester continued to evolve as the war was being fought. Despite this, seven RAF squadrons would eventually use 202 Manchesters (with 538 Vultures) on 1,260 sorties. Manchesters may have contributed to Bomber Command failures (as set out in the Butt Report of August 1941), but they also contributed to its success in denying German capital ships the naval base at Brest. Bomber Command s persistence with the type was soon shown to be wise, as the Manchester was developed into the famous and war-winning Avro Lancaster. This second edition of The Avro Manchester: The Legend Behind the Lancaster retains the keen analysis and gripping narrative of the first, but it also fills many gaps, revises key passages, and provides six appendices for references. It is richly illustrated with 200 images, many of which are previously unpublished.

One of Kentucky's most significant African American artists, Wilson graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1923. He spent five more years in the city before moving to New York, where he lived for the rest of his life. Aside from his participation in the WPA's Federal Arts Project and a Guggenheim Fellowship, he was never able to support himself fully by painting. Yet his work has long been praised for its boldness and individuality. Black workers were a favorite subject: field hands, factory workers, loggers, fishermen, and more. Of his 1940s series of black factory employees, Wilson stated, \\"That was the first time I had ever seen my people working in industry, so I painted them.\\" Over time his documentary style gave way to one that emphasized shape and color over pure representation. Despite exhibitions in New York and elsewhere, Wilson considered a small show at the public library in his hometown of Mayfield in 1947 to be \\"one of the high points\\" of his life. This catalog accompanies the first major retrospective of Wilson's paintings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G80eBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An-My Le","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crystal Reports: A Beginner's Guide","description":"Fourth Edition - The Beginner's Guide to Crystal Reports 2016 was written as a quick start guide for beginners, and not intended as a comprehensive reference manual.

Laurie Beth Kalb examines the role and meaning of tradition in the work of a number of artists, both living and deceased, including Luis Tapia, Patrocinio Barela, Marco and Patricia Oviedo, Enrique Rendon, and many others. For each of these artists, the meaning of tradition varies, and the issues of self-representation, cultural expression, preservation, innovation, and market demands are all complex, powerful, and delicate. It is both troublesome and rewarding to be able to support a family on the sales of religious images to Anglo buyers. The mainstream fine art world, tourism, religion, and ethnic politics all play roles in the creation of traditional works in a contemporary world. For all the santeros, the tangle of religious, commercial, political, and aesthetic forces requires complicated choices far beyond the basic relationships between themselves and their saints. Laurie Beth Kalb tells a fascinating and revealing story about a unique art form and its significance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AhPaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Crafting+Devotions:+Tradition+in+Contemporary+New+Mexico+Santos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eloise;: A book for precocious grown ups","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mercury/Mariner Outboard Shop Manual: 2.5-60 Hp Two-Stroke 1998-2002 (Clymer Marine Repair)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Five Star Expressions - Matchmaker, Matchmaker","description":"Four romantically minded high school girls, besties forever, vow to find one another husbands in the laughably unlikely event any of them are unmarried at age thirty.

Battle Cry of Freedom, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the Civil War, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in The New York Times Book Review, called \\"history writing of the highest order.\\" In that volume, McPherson gathered in the broad sweep of events, the political, social, and cultural forces at work during the Civil War era. Now, in Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution, he offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on aspects of Lincoln and the war that have rarely been discussed in depth. McPherson again displays his keen insight and sterling prose as he examines several critical themes in American history. He looks closely at the President's role as Commander-in-Chief of the Union forces, showing how Lincoln forged a national military strategy for victory. He explores the importance of Lincoln's great rhetorical skills, uncovering how--through parables and figurative language--he was uniquely able to communicate both the purpose of the war and a new meaning of liberty to the people of the North. In another section, McPherson examines the Civil War as a Second American Revolution, describing how the Republican Congress elected in 1860 passed an astonishing blitz of new laws (rivaling the first hundred days of the New Deal), and how the war not only destroyed the social structure of the old South, but radically altered the balance of power in America, ending 70 years of Southern power in the national government. The Civil War was the single most transforming and defining experience in American history, and Abraham Lincoln remains the most important figure in the pantheon of our mythology. These graceful essays, written by one of America's leading historians, offer fresh and unusual perspectives on both.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYdpAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlikely Angel : The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero","description":"In April 2005, Ashley Smith made headlines around the globe when she miraculously talked her way out of the hands of alleged courthouse killer Brian Nichols after he took her hostage for seven hours in her suburban Atlanta apartment. In this moving, inspirational memoir, the 26-year-old widowed mother of a six-year-old girl shares for the first time the little-known details of her traumatic ordeal, and expands on how her faith and the bestselling book The Purpose-Driven? Life helped her survive and bring the killer's murderous rampage to a peaceful end. Just as she told her 6'1\\", 210-pound captor that his ultimate \\"purpose\\" in life was to end up spending the rest of his life in prison, preaching the teachings of Jesus Christ to his fellow inmates, Smith believes her own purpose is to spread that message of love to the rest of us.

Many older Americans dream for years about what they'll do once they retire - catch up on their reading, complete projects around the house, take up gardening, travel - only to find that six months later they have accomplished most of their goals! Now what? With people living longer or retiring earlier, the post-retirement period can extend to 25, or even 35 years. Those extra eight hours a day, every day, add up to as many as 50,000 hours of unplanned time! The constant \\"togetherness\\" of spouses after retirement can put a severe strain on relationships, and often exposes conflicts that have been hidden by the demands of childrearing and work routines. Many people have their personal identity tied up with work, or in a profession, and they discover that the dismanteling of the social and business structure of a career is more difficult than expected. It is important that people plan for this new and exciting phase of their life just as seriously as they prepared for a career. In The Adventure of Retirement, consultant and researcher Guild A.

Yet many moralist critiques misconstrue the full moral message of a show due to a restrictive focus on sex, violence, and profanity. Televised Morality explores the nature of moral discourse on television by using Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a case study. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has simultaneously been heralded as one of the most morally sophisticated shows on television and one of the most morally corrupt. The program offers a fascinating look into the divergent issues involved in the moral evaluation of television today. Stevenson argues that analysis of this show's moral vision, its methods of moral reasoning, and its narrative function reveal the complexity of moral discourse on television and provides a good model for the moral critique of other television shows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s4-FAAAAIAAJ&dq=Televised+Morality:+The+Case+of+Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mysterious Realms","description":"The na?ve though rather fumbling Eddie Bear and the smart and feisty Micki MacVitie share a comfortable life in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.

This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning. Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb. How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system. Topics include: How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain. How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn. What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach. The amazing learning potential of infants. The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace. Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.

Utilitarianism traces the 'doctrine of utility' from the moralists of the ancient world, through the Enlightenment and Victorian utilitarianism up to the lively debate of the present day. Utilitarianism today faces challenges on several fronts: it cannot warrant the drawing of adequate protective boundaries around the essential interests of individuals, and it does not allow them the space to pursue the personal concerns which give meaning to their lives. Geoffrey Scarre considers these and other charges, and concludes that whilst utilitarianism may not be a faultless moral doctrine, its positions are relevant, and significant today.

And yet it's a cool, controlled, formal film, unsensational, more analytic than titillating, a brilliant expos  of modern pathologies. It has almost none of the violence and explicit sexual content of the J.G. Ballard novel from which it is adapted. What is the relationship between Ballard himself and the character 'James Ballard' in Crash? In this book, which includes an exclusive and revealing interview with Ballard, Sinclair explores the uncanny temporal loop which connects film and novel. If Cronenberg's 'adapted' Crash, he also absorbed it, ingested it, made it into something new. But, on the other hand, the novel controls the film, or uses the film to disguise its truly subversive intent. And, for Sinclair, there are more startling permutations still. To what extent, for example, is Crash a premonition of some of the more remarkable media events of recent times?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ozn8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PAINTINGS OF EDNA HIBEL- FROM THE COLLECTION OF ETHELBELLE AND CLAYTON B.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and--after his murder--three more with his prot g . Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since. Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff 's is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dKIo6D9yh3cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Vol 12) Hebrews through Revelation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Corel Quattro Pro 8 for Windows 95: Computer Training Series","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Communication and Communication Disorders: A Clinical Introduction","description":"An introduction to speech, language, and hearing science.

They stand in contrast to better-known romantic fiction in that they endeavor to address the world of daily, empirical experience rather than that of more explicitly self-referential, fanciful creation. Among them are genres that have since the nineteenth century come to characterize many aspects of modern life like the periodical or the psychological case study; others flourished and enjoyed wide-spread popularity during the nineteenth century but are much less well-known today like the almanac and the diary. Travel narratives, pamphlets, religious and theological texts, familiar essays, autobiographies, literary-critical and philosophical studies, and discussions of the visual arts and music all had deep historical roots when appropriated by romantic writers but prospered in their hands and assumed distinctive contours indicative of the breadth of romantic thought. SPECIAL OFFER: 30% discount for a complete set order (5 vols.).The Romanticism series in the Comparative History of Literatures in European Languages is the result of a remarkable international collaboration. The editorial team coordinated the efforts of over 100 experts from more than two dozen countries to produce five independently conceived, yet interrelated volumes that show not only how Romanticism developed and spread in its principal European homelands and throughout the New World, but also the ways in which the affected literatures in reaction to Romanticism have redefined themselves on into Modernism. A glance at the index of each volume quickly reveals the extraordinary richness of the series  total contents. Romantic Irony sets the broader experimental parameters of comparison by concentrating on the myriad expressions of  irony  as one of the major impulses in the Romantic philosophical and artistic revolution, and by combining cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies with special attention also to literatures in less widely diffused language streams. Romantic Drama traces creative innovations that deeply altered the understanding of genre at large, fed popular imagination through vehicles like the opera, and laid the foundations for a modernist theater of the absurd. Romantic Poetry demonstrates deep patterns and a sharing of crucial themes of the revolutionary age which underlie the lyrical expression that flourished in so many languages and environments. Nonfictional Romantic Prose assists us in coping with the vast array of writings from the personal and intimate sphere to modes of public discourse, including Romanticism s own self-commentary in theoretical statements on the arts, society, life, the sciences, and more. Nor are the discursive dimensions of imaginative literature neglected in the closing volume, Romantic Prose Fiction, where the basic Romantic themes and story types (the romance, novel, novella, short story, and other narrative forms) are considered throughout Europe and the New World. This enormous realm is seen not just in terms of Romantic theorizing, but in the light of the impact of Romantic ideas and narration on later generations. As an aid to readers, the introduction to Romantic Prose Fiction explains the relationships among the volumes in the series and carries a listing of their tables of contents in an appendix. No other series exists comparable to these volumes which treat the entirety of Romanticism as a cultural happening across the whole breadth of the  Old  and  New  Worlds and thus render a complex picture of European spiritual strivings in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, a heritage still very close to our age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tU89AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wild Coast and Lonely: Big Sur Pioneers (Tetra)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YdojAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Wild+Coast+and+Lonely:+Big+Sur+Pioneers+(Tetra)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Take the Bait","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Beginning Filmmaker's Guide: Everything You Need to Know to Make Your First Film","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Turkey Pox","description":"Charity is disappointed when she comes down with chicken pox and will miss Thanksgiving dinner.

In the politics of skin color, Carmit Delman is an ambassador from a world of which few are even aware. Her mother is a direct descendant of the Bene Israel, a tiny, ancient community of Jews thriving amidst the rich cultural tableau of Western India. Her father is American, a Jewish man of Eastern European descent. They met while working the land of a nascent Israeli state. Bound by love for each other and that newborn country, they hardly took notice of the interracial aspect of their union. But their daughter, Carmit, growing up in America, was well aware of her uncommon heritage. Burnt Bread and Chutney is a remarkable synthesis of the universal and the exotic. Carmit Delman s memories of the sometimes painful, sometimes pleasurable, often awkward moments of her adolescence juxtapose strikingly with mythic tales of her female ancestors living in the Indian-Jewish community. As rites and traditions, smells and textures intertwine, Carmit s unique cultural identity evolves. It is a youth spent dancing on the roofs of bomb shelters on a kibbutz in Israel and the knowledge of a heritage marked by arranged marriages and archaic rules and roles. It is coming of age in Jewish summer camps and at KISS concerts and the inevitable combination of old and new: ancient customs and modern attitudes, Jewish, Indian, and American. Carmit Delman s journey through religious traditions, family tensions, and social tribulations to a healthy sense of wholeness and self is rendered with grace and an acute sense of depth. Burnt Bread and Chutney is a rich and innovative book that opens wide a previously unseen world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FlhLCZqKW1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the looking glass","description":"All the \\"muchness\\" of Wonderland captured in one book!

As this finale opens, Tasmin and her family are under irksome, though comfortable, arrest in Mexican Santa Fe. Her father, the eccentric Lord Berrybender, is planning to head for Texas with his whole family and his retainers, English, American, and Native American. Tasmin, who would once have followed her husband, Jim Snow, anywhere, is no longer even sure she likes him, or knows where to go to next.

But even they are unable to prevent the Mexicans from carrying the Berrybender family on a long and terrible journey across the desert to Vera Cruz.

Pamela Klassen introduces a surprisingly diverse group of women, in their own words, while also setting their birth stories within wider social, political, and economic contexts. In doing so, she emerges with a study that disrupts conventional views of both childbirth and religion by blurring assumed divisions between conservative and feminist women and by taking childbirth seriously as a religious act. Most American women who have a choice give birth in a hospital and request pain medication. Yet enough women choose and advocate unmedicated home birth--and do so for carefully articulated reasons, social resistance among them--to constitute a movement. Klassen investigates why women whose religious affiliations range from Old Order Amish to Reform Judaism to goddess-centered spirituality defy majority opinion, the medical establishment, and sometimes the law to have their babies at home. In considering their interpretations--including their critiques of the dominant medical model of childbirth and their views on labor pain--she examines the kinds of agency afforded to or denied women as they derive religious meanings from childbirth. Throughout, she identifies tensions and affinities between feminist and traditionalist appraisals of the symbolic meaning of birth and the power of women. What does home birth--a woman-centered movement working to return birth to women's control--mean in practice for women's gender and religious identities? Is this supreme valuing of procreation and motherhood constraining, or does it open up new realms of cultural and social power for women? By asking these questions while remaining cognizant of religion's significance, Blessed Events challenges both feminist and traditionalist accounts of childbearing while broadening our understanding of how religion is ''lived'' in contemporary America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PuU9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Blessed+Events:+Religion+and+Home+Birth+in+America.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It must be magic","description":"...humor, emotional intensity, and sensuality with a touch of the supernatural, Must Be Magic is a highly recommended read and a 'keeper.'\\"- RT Book Reviews, 4 ?

In theory, the occupant is expected to establish an effective and impartial administration, to carefully balance its own interests against those of the inhabitants and their government, and to negotiate the occupation's early termination in a peace treaty. Although these expectations have been proven to be too high for most occupants, they nevertheless serve as yardsticks that measure the level of compliance of the occupants with international law. This thoroughly revised edition of the 1993 book traces the evolution of the law of occupation from its inception during the 18th century until today. It offers an assessment of the law by focusing on state practice of the various occupants and reactions thereto, and on the governing legal texts and judicial decisions. The underlying thought that informs and structures the book suggests that this body of laws has been shaped by changing conceptions about war and sovereignty, by the growing attention to human rights and the right to self-determination, as well as by changes in the balance of power among states. Because the law of occupation indirectly protects the sovereign, occupation law can be seen as the mirror-image of the law on sovereignty. Shifting perceptions on sovereign authority are therefore bound to be reflected also in the law of occupation, and vice-versa.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f19hVb54_s8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hannah Gets A Husband (Bridal Fever!)

The two radio plays were commissioned by the BBC; All That Fall  plumbs the same pessimistic depths [as Waiting for Godot] in what seems a no less despairing search for human dignity  (London Times), and Embers is equally unforgettable theater, born of the ramblings of an old man and his wife. Finally, in the two pantomimes, Beckett takes drama to the point of pure abstraction with his portrayals of, in Act Without Words I, frustrated desired, and in Act Without Words I, corresponding motions of living juxtaposed in the slow despair of one man and the senselessly busy motion of another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PLR6GhORntYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theme Birthday Parties for Children: A Complete Planning Guide","description":"From a $250,000 f te for a seven-year-old Florida girl, complete with helicopter rides, to $100,000 first birthday parties as reported in the New York Times, this is rapidly becoming the gilded age of children's birthday parties.

Remarkably, his propagandists broadcast this fact, convinced that it would reveal not his callousness but his sensitivity: the destruction had failed to crush his artist's spirit. It is impossible to begin to make sense of this thinking without understanding what Wolf Lepenies calls The Seduction of Culture in German History. This fascinating and unusual book tells the story of an arguably catastrophic German habit--that of valuing cultural achievement above all else and envisioning it as a noble substitute for politics. Lepenies examines how this tendency has affected German history from the late eighteenth century to today. He argues that the German preference for art over politics is essential to understanding the peculiar nature of Nazism, including its aesthetic appeal to many Germans (and others) and the fact that Hitler and many in his circle were failed artists and intellectuals who seem to have practiced their politics as a substitute form of art. In a series of historical, intellectual, literary, and artistic vignettes told in an essayistic style full of compelling aphorisms, this wide-ranging book pays special attention to Goethe and Thomas Mann, and also contains brilliant discussions of such diverse figures as Novalis, Walt Whitman, Leo Strauss, and Allan Bloom. The Seduction of Culture in German History is concerned not only with Germany, but with how the German obsession with culture, sense of cultural superiority, and scorn of politics have affected its relations with other countries, France and the United States in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYD7uTP7Qh4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crimson Dreams","description":"The Crimson Dreams Journal is a paperback journal to fill with your greatest secrets or ideas.

For three hundred years, sailing ships sufficed to carry cargoes and people, but the demands of Steam Age business and commerce demanded more regularity. Just as the steam engine had allowed railroads to replace the unpredictability of stagecoaches on land with dependable schedules, steamships promised to bring this reliability to crossing the Atlantic. This is where the story of the Cunard Line began. The greatest influence Cunard would ever have on world events would be the leading role during the last half of the 19th century, when the great migration of millions of emigrants transformed the populations of Europe, the United States, and Canada. Wars devastation came to the Cunard Line with WW1 and WW2, as the power of the German submarine fleet -- built with one purpose in mind, to sever the North Atlantic shipping lanes -- threatened Great Britains very existence. By 1963, more people chose to travel by airplane than by steamship -- and it was the beginning of the end. Sir Winston Churchill observed, \\"You came into great things by the accident of sea power... By an accident of air power, you will probably cease to exist.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jVYUMUmOYaIC&dq=Age+of+Cunard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jarnegan","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ub7rcz3tY4oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angry Marriage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IhqNVGyTtw4C&dq=Angry+Marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Howling 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide to Developing Documentum Desktop Applications: Techniques and Solutions Using Visual Basic and the DFC","description":"Would you like to design and build your own custom Documentum application, but don't know where to start?

This is the true story of an obsessive pursuit of acting fame. It is a life marked by occasional hard-fought successes and routine helpings of ritual humiliation: scout hut Gilbert and Sullivan, dodgy rock operas, sewage farm theatre workshop, Christmas panto hell, straight-to-video film flops, leading roles in Crimewatch reconstructions and dressing up as a chicken to advertise TV dinners.

In the 1940s, when FDR opened up the defense industry to black workers, it inspired a massive wave of black migration to a small area of Los Angeles along Central Avenue and cultural ferment in the arts, culture, and politics. In a neighborhood densely packed with black musicians, independent labels and after hours spots, rhythm and blues was spawned. Chester Himes fathered the black detective novel and a noir sensibility. Black comics took off minstrel blackface for the first time and addressed audiences directly with socially-tinged humor. And, Smith suggests, the civil rights movement helped get its start, as the strategy of building mass movements and giving power to ghetto dwellers gained favor in opposition to the top-down strategies of the NAACP and the Urban League. Harlem's Renaissance had been driven by the intellectual elite. In L.A., a new sense of black identity arose from street level. But when the moment was over, many hopes and lives were swept away with it. Based on original research and interviews, told through an engaging narrative, this book shows convincingly that much that we take for granted today, from hip hop and slang to modern-day street fashion, all flowed from the 1940s scene along the Great Black Way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xdBwswEACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Black+Way:+L.A.+in+the+1940s+and+the+Lost+African-American+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unseen Forces","description":"Writer, consultant and speaker Chris Rabb coined the term invisible capital to represent the unseen forces that dramatically impact entrepreneurial viability when a good attitude, a great idea, and hard work simply aren't enough.

In this one-volume edition, modern readers are introduced to one of the best nature writers of the last century. As we read Peattie's eloquent and entertaining accounts of American trees, we catch glimpses of our country's history and past daily life that no textbook could ever illuminate so vividly. Here you'll learn about everything from how a species was discovered to the part it played in our country s history. Pioneers often stabled an animal in the hollow heart of an old sycamore, and the whole family might live there until they could build a log cabin. The tuliptree, the tallest native hardwood, is easier to work than most softwood trees; Daniel Boone carved a sixty-foot canoe from one tree to carry his family from Kentucky into Spanish territory. In the days before the Revolution, the British and the colonists waged an undeclared war over New England's white pines, which made the best tall masts for fighting ships. It's fascinating to learn about the commercial uses of various woods -- for paper, fine furniture, fence posts, matchsticks, house framing, airplane wings, and dozens of other preplastic uses. But we cannot read this book without the occasional lump in our throats. The American elm was still alive when Peattie wrote, but as we read his account today we can see what caused its demise. Audubon's portrait of a pair of loving passenger pigeons in an American beech is considered by many to be his greatest painting. It certainly touched the poet in Donald Culross Peattie as he depicted the extinction of the passenger pigeon when the beech forest was destroyed. A Natural History of North American Trees gives us a picture of life in America from its earliest days to the middle of the last century. The information is always interesting, though often heartbreaking. While Peattie looks for the better side of man's nature, he reports sorrowfully on the greed and waste that have doomed so much of America's virgin forest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0fpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Car Inspector","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EIk5AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Towns: Deep in the Heart","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Interpretive Introduction to Quantum Field Theory","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Littlest Frog (Littlest Series)","description":"Pharaoh is surrounded by dozens of frogs who have the audacity - and the playfulness! - to sit on his nose, hide under his bed, and even try on his crown.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t0JLzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Littlest+Frog+(Littlest+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terapia de Juego = Play Therapy (Spanish Edition)","description":"The Routledge Spanish Bilingual Dictionary of Psychology and Psychiatry contains over 100,000 entries making this the most comprehensive and up-to-date dictionary of its kind.

The aim is to bring the reader through basic acoustics, spectrum analysis, vowel and consonant acoustics, and into the research literature of speech perception technology. The basic acoustic theory of speech production, the Source-Filter Theory, is clarified via text and diagrams. This knowledge is then applied to interpreting spectrograms of speech examples that sample all the phonetic distinctions among vowels and consonants. Distinctive acoustical patterns for vowel and consonant perception by listeners are summarized in detail based on the research literature. Critical discussions provide theories of motor, auditory, and computer recognition of speech. Consonant and vowel recognition by the hearing-impaired is described in relation to acoustic phonetic distinctions. Techniques of speech synthesis, recognition analysis by machines, and speech technologies are thoroughly explained.

We see in this letter a pastor guiding his people through questions of salvation, theology, and ethics. The more we read, the more we realize that many of the same questions facing the Galatian Christians continue to face us today: Are we still under the Old Testament Law? What happened to the Law when Jesus came? Who are the people of God? From Law to Logos: Reading St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians is a primer for reading Galatians for all it is worth. The focus of this book is preparing lay Christians to understand Galatians by reading it as a letter, in its entirety, over and over again. At the end of each chapter, the reader is better prepared to read and study Galatians in its literary, historical, and theological context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVoQDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Open Man: The Championship Diary of the N.Y.

A bear sharpens her claws on a tree trunk. The scratched bark chips; a tiny hole forms. Timber beetles tunnel inside. The hole grows bigger and bigger. In lyrical prose, Barbara Brenner reveals the fascinating happenings in one small place. She explains how, over many years, the rough hole transforms into a cozy hollow -- home to salamanders, tree frogs, a family of white-footed mice. Tom Leonard s absorbing illustrations take you beneath the bark to a hidden world. His warm, lifelike depictions of squirrels and bluebirds, snakes and spiders show the splendor that dwells in the most unexpected places. So stop. Observe. Explore your natural world.

It was the year that began with the publication of James Joyce's Ulysses and ended with the publication of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, two works that were arguably \\"the sun and moon\\" of modernist literature, some would say of modernity itself. In Constellation of Genius, Kevin Jackson puts the titanic achievements of Joyce and Eliot in the context of the world in which their works first appeared. As Jackson writes in his introduction, \\"On all sides, and in every field, there was a frenzy of innovation.\\" It is in 1922 that Hitchcock directs his first feature; Kandinsky and Klee join the Bauhaus; the first AM radio station is launched; Walt Disney releases his first animated shorts; and Louis Armstrong takes a train from New Orleans to Chicago, heralding the age of modern jazz. On other fronts, Einstein wins the Nobel Prize in Physics, insulin is introduced to treat diabetes, and the tomb of Tutankhamun is discovered. As Jackson writes, the sky was \\"blazing with a  constellation of genius' of a kind that had never been known before, and has never since been rivaled.\\" Constellation of Genius traces an unforgettable journey through the diaries of the actors, anthropologists, artists, dancers, designers, filmmakers, philosophers, playwrights, politicians, and scientists whose lives and works over the course of twelve months brought a seismic shift in the way we think, splitting the cultural world in two. Was this a matter of inevitability or of coincidence?

In The Rustic Table, IACP Award-winning author Constance Snow re-creates flavors from more than twenty-five different countries with more than 200 recipes for starters, sides, entr es, and desserts.

In Still Life with Brook Trout, John Gierach demonstrates once again that fishing, when done right, is as much a philosophical pursuit as a sport. Gierach travels to Wyoming and Maine and points in between, searching out new fly-fishing adventures and savoring familiar waters with old friends. Along the way he meditates on the importance of good guides (\\"Really, the only thing a psychiatrist can do that a good guide can't is write prescriptions\\"), the challenge of salmon fishing (\\"Salmon prowl. If they're not here now, they could be here in half an hour. Or tomorrow. Or next month\\"), and the zen of fishing alone (\\"I also enjoy where my mind goes when I'm fishing alone, which is usually nowhere in particular and by a predictable route\\"). On a more serious note, he ponders the damaging effects of disasters both natural and man-made: drought, wildfires, and the politics of dam-building, among others. Reflecting on a trip to a small creek near his home, Gierach writes, \\"In my brightest moments, I think slowing down...has opened huge new vistas on my old home water. It's like a friendship that not only lasts, but gets better against the odds.\\" Similarly, Still Life with Brook Trout proves that Gierach, like fly-fishing itself, becomes deeper and richer with time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G0QHGyLLWiQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STANDING ON HOLY GROUND: A TRIUMPH OVER HATE CRIME IN THE DEEP SOUTH.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Start Your Own Business on a Shoestring and Make up to $500,000 a Year, 3 rd Revised Edition","description":"Make a Mint by Mail Order!

Because no two children are exactly alike in their development, we have designed the Bank Street Ready-to-Read series in three levels to accommodate the individual stages of reading readiness of children ages four through eight. ? Level 1: Getting Ready To Read  (Pre-K to Grade 1) Books are perfect for reading aloud with children who are getting ready to read or are just beginning to read words or phrases. ? Level 2: Reading Together (Grades 1 to 3) Books are written especially for children who are on their way to reading independently but who may need help. ? Level 3: I Can Read It Myself (Grades 2 to 3) Books are designed for children able to read on their own. They also can be enjoyed as read-alouds.. Our three levels make it easy to select the books most appropriate for a child s development and enable him or her to grow with the series step by step. The Bank Street Ready-to-Read books also overlap and reinforce each other, further encouraging the reading process.

A starry-eyed young beauty, Marjorie Morgenstern is nineteen years old when she leaves home to accept the job of her dreams--working in a summer-stock company for Noel Airman, its talented and intensely charismatic director. Released from the social constraints of her traditional Jewish family, and thrown into the glorious, colorful world of theater, Marjorie finds herself entangled in a powerful affair with the man destined to become the greatest--and the most destructive--love of her life. Rich with humor and poignancy, Marjorie Morningstar is a classic love story, one that spans two continents and two decades in the life of its heroine. \\"I read it and I thought, 'Oh, God, this is me.'\\" --Scarlet Johansson","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JMzKPtgCsm0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Killing House","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Live hands: A key to better golf","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Baby James Brown","description":"The comic so funny they named him twice.

Based on intuition as much as on specific linguistic principles, Roget's book has been a bestseller ever since and is one of the most widely-used reference works ever published. In this book Werner H--uuml--;llen gives the first history of its genesis and publication, and investigates the principles of its structural design. The author opens with an account of Roget's life and his background in natural science. He then charts the parallel histories of dictionaries of synonyms and concepts within the general context of lexicography. Synonymy, he argues, is a necessary feature of languages without which communication would be impossible. He traces its theory and practice from Plato to the emergence of French and English synonym dictionaries in the seventeenth century. Roget's was the first such book to be arranged by topic and the first to encompass the semantic network of the entire language. The author examines the manner and method of its compilation, the practical outcomes of the traditions on which it was based, and the ways in which the Thesaurus reflects and reveals Roget's beliefs and background. A History of Roget's Thesaurus will interest students and scholars of linguistics, semantics, and lexicography, as well as anyone wishing to know more about a great literary achievement and an astonishing publishing phenomenon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bxK_ATYUCp8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campfires and game trails: Hunting North American big game","description":"Learn about arms and equipment, scouting, specialized hunting techniques for various kinds of game in various kinds of habitat and terrain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G-wOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Campfires+and+game+trails:+Hunting+North+American+big+game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Eyecare, Eyeglasses and Contact Lenses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wisconsin Atlas and Gazetteer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tm3qAQAACAAJ&dq=Wisconsin+Atlas+and+Gazetteer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whatever Became of...?","description":"Sketches the present-day lives of individuals who achieved prominence in bygone eras","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ksXAQAAIAAJ&dq=Whatever+Became+of...%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Journal of Hildegard of Bingen: Inspired by a Year in the Life of the Twelfth-Century Mystic","description":"\\"Royal and saintly women are well-represented here, with the welcome addition of women from the Mediterranean arc...Garland has done a solid job of presenting this book.\\" -- Arthuriana \\"The Anthology gives a fine sense of the great range of women's writing in the Middle Ages.\\" -- Medium Aevum","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L8gmCRzXWt4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to IMS: Your Complete Guide to IBM's Information Management System","description":"IBM's one-stop guide to the newest versions of IMS: the database used by the world's largest companies for their most mission-critical data * *The ideal resource for every IT professional who is new to IMS or upgrading to a current or recent version. *Updated, authoritative coverage of IMS Versions 12, 11, and 10: components, architecture, database and transaction managers, application development, system administration, security, recovery, tools, and more. *95% of Fortune 1000 companies rely on IMS.

And then, of course, the next thought: What, exactly, am I doing now?  John Larson, Former NBC National Correspondent  When people ask me how they can possibly make a difference fighting a problem as big as  global poverty , I tell them about a boy named Austin who, like David, stared Goliath in the eye without flinching. This young man has done more to make a difference in the lives of children orphaned by AIDS than most American churches, let alone individuals. If you are older than 10 and you haven t yet done your part to change the world, read Take Your Best Shot and be inspired. Austin Gutwein shows us the way . Richard Stearns, President, World Vision US, Author of The Hole in Our Gospel  When people ask who has most impacted me over the last year, without hesitation I can say Austin Gutwein and the story of Hoops of Hope.

The work was aimed at promoting the Interna tional Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), sponsored by the International Council of Scientific Unions (lCSU), of which nASA is a member. Our study was designed to provide initial guidance in the choice of approaches, data sets and objectives for constructing global models of the terrestrial biosphere. We hoped to provide substantive and concrete assistance in formulating the working plans of IGBP by involving program planners in the development and application of models which were assembled from available data sets and modeling ap proaches. Recent acceptance of the \\"nASA model\\" as the starting point for endeavors of the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems Core Project of the IGBP suggests we were successful in that aim. The objective was implemented by our initiation of a mathematical model of global vegetation, including agriculture, as defined by the forces which control and change vegetation. The model was to illustrate the geographical consequences to vegetation structure and functioning of changing climate and land use, based on plant responses to environmental variables. The completed model was also expected to be useful for examining international environmental policy responses to global change, as well as for studying the validity of IIASA's experimental approaches to environmental policy development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G8bkBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures of a Continental Drifter: An Around-the-World Excursion into Weirdness, Danger, Lust, and the Perils of Street Food","description":"In October 2002, Elliott Hester sold his car, abandoned his apartment, and took off alone on a trip around the world, during which he drifted to over fifty destinations.

This analysis of Carpenter s films includes a historical overview of his career, and in-depth entries on each of his films, from 1975 s Dark Star to 1998 s Vampires. Complete cast and production information is provided for each. The book also covers those films written and produced by Carpenter, such as Halloween II and Black Moon Rising, as well as Carpenter s work for television. Appendices are included on films Carpenter was offered but turned down, the slasher films that followed in the wake of the highly-successful Halloween, the actors and characters who make repeated appearances in Carpenter s films, and ratings for Carpenter s work.

There are hundreds of books on parenting, and with good reason -- becoming a parent is scary, difficult, and life-changing. But when it comes to books about parenting identity, rather than the nuts and bolts of raising children, nearly all are about what it's like to be a mother. If you're looking for information about what it means to be a father, you'll find the bookstore shelves surprisingly bare. Drawing on research in sociology, economics, psychology, cultural history, and the author's own experiences, FATHER-FIGURE sets out to fill that gap. It's an exploration of the psychology of fatherhood from an archetypal perspective (Think: Women Who Run With The Wolves for fathers) as well a cultural history of fatherhood that explains how we got to where we are. What are the paradoxes inherent in our current understanding of dads? Might it be time to rethink some of the current aspects of fatherhood? Gender norms are changing, and old economic models are facing disruption. As a result, parenthood and family life are undergoing an existential transformation. And yet, the narratives and images of dads available to us are wholly inadequate for this transition. Victorian and Industrial Age tropes about fathers not only dominate the media, but also contour most people's lived experience. FATHER-FIGURE offers a badly-needed update to our collective understanding of fatherhood -- and masculinity in general -- that highlights what's essential about fatherhood while guiding us to an image of manliness reimagined for the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tFDYzQEACAAJ&dq=Father+Figure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Spark in the Dark","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mEmtAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Spark+in+the+Dark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Works of Benjamin B.

Located in late prehistoric times in eastern Tennessee, they played an important historical role at various times during the last five centuries and in many ways served as a bridge between their southeastern neighbors and Native communities in the northeast. First noted by the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, the Yuchis moved several times and made many alliances over the next few centuries. The famous naturalist William Bartram visited a Yuchi town in 1775, at a time when the Yuchis had moved near and become allied with Creek communities in Georgia. This alliance had long-lasting repercussions: when the United States government forced most southeastern groups to move to Oklahoma in the early nineteenth century, the Yuchis were classified as Creeks and placed under the jurisdiction of the Creek Nation. Today, despite the existence of a separate language and their distinct history, culture, and religious traditions, the Yuchis are not recognized as a sovereign people by the Creek Nation or the United States. ? Jason Baird Jackson examines the significance of community ceremonies for the Yuchis today. For many Yuchis, traditional rituals remain important to their identity, and they feel an obligation to perform and renew them each year at one of three ceremonial grounds, called ?Big Houses.? The Big House acts as a periodic gathering place for the Yuchis, their Creator, and their ancestors. Drawing on a decade of collaborative study with tribal elders and using insights gained from ethnopoetics, Jackson captures in vivid detail the performance, impact, and motivations behind such rituals as the Stomp Dance, the Green Corn Ceremony, and the Soup Dance and discusses their continuing importance to the community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yUTMxVWY3gMC&dq=Yuchi+Ceremonial+Life:+Performance,+Meaning,+and+Tradition+in+a+Contemporary+American+Indian+Community+(Studies+in+the+Anthropology+of+North+Ame)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Childbirth Education: Practice, Research and Theory, 2e","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teens Fight Adult Corruption","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dGvZGFiay3YC&dq=Teens+Fight+Adult+Corruption&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wisconsin Atlas and Gazetteer (Wisconsin Atlas & Gazetteer)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver","description":"Collects stories of men who spent their lives searching for legendary hidden treasures in the Southwest.

Samuel Rodriguez Racial tensions had long simmered in Benton Harbor, a small city on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, before the day a white narcotics officer more focused on arrests than justice set his sights on an innocent black man. But when officer Andrew Collins framed Jameel McGee for possession of crack cocaine, the surprising result was not a race riot but a transformative journey for both men. Falsely convicted, McGee spent three years in federal prison. Collins also went to prison a few years later for falsifying police reports. While behind bars, the faith of both men deepened. But the story took its most unexpected turn once they were released when their lives collided again in a moment brimming with mistrust and anger. The two were on a collision course not to violence but forgiveness. As current as today s headlines, this explosive true story reveals how these radically conflicted men chose to let go of fear and a thirst for revenge to pursue reconciliation for themselves, their community, and our racially divided nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TEbKDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roads from Gettysburg","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Making Your Own Jewelry: Creative Designs To Make and Wear","description":"Shows how to make earrings, bracelets, brooches, necklaces, and jewelry sets","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1ndTRWeFajcC&dq=Making+Your+Own+Jewelry:+Creative+Designs+To+Make+and+Wear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reminiscences of a Rebel,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dq-FPwAACAAJ&dq=Reminiscences+of+a+Rebel,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emotion to enlightenment","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Secret Trauma","description":"Presents the results of a study on sexually abused girls based on in-depth interviews with 930 women from a variety of backgrounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oUYbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Secret+Trauma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Personal Letters That Mean Business","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"C.

Ella Rubenstein is forty years old and unhappily married when she takes a job as a reader for a literary agent. Her first assignment is to read and report on Sweet Blasphemy, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mir-rors her own and that Zahara like Shams has come to set her free.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tvUJYTBNt-sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crystallizing public opinion","description":"From the author of the best-selling Propaganda, Crystallizing Public Opinion is the first book ever written about public relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4t4dvgAACAAJ&dq=Crystallizing+public+opinion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Check Point Firewall-1 Administration and CCSA Study Guide","description":"Discover the complete FireWall-1 administration manual and CCSA prep guide!

In exploring this rich theme, he undertakes the psychological portraits of six representative figures whose thought and work have influenced modern man: Descartes, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, and Sartre. The scientific revolution of the last 300 years has yielded, in Dr. Stern?s view, a de-ferninization and de-humanization of society, in the sense that it is a rejection of the kind of wisdom, called sophia, the man comprehends intuitively. \\"If we equate the one-sidedly rational and technical with the masculine,\\" he states, \\"there arises the ghastly specter of a world impoverished of womanly values.\\" A deeply original work, The Flight from Woman goes far beyond psychology in its analysis of the malaise of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P2lEAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Flight+From+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cave Birds: An Alchemical Cave Drama","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Six-Pack: Mopar Street Muscle in the 60's (S-A Design Performance History)","description":"There is no automotive decade in history that matches the '60s.

Founded by kamasqa curandero don Oscar Miro-Quesada from Lima, Peru, this traditional wisdom is expressed through the ceremonial use of a complex altar system, known as a Pachakuti Mesa. This book functions as a compendium of this altar's ceremonial use amidst the backdrop of Peru's rich pre-Columbian history, cosmology, mythology, and centuries of healing artistry. The Pachakuti Mesa tradition is a living, breathing, evolving, holistic spiritual practice that is designed to build bridges between cultures, while honoring the universal wisdom of nature itself. This book seeks to unveil the methodology of this particular form of tribal shamanic practice in a way that is accessible to the western aspirant by offering parallels and cultural comparisons as well as references from leading scholars in the field of anthropology. Ultimately this book is designed to provide a \\"behind the scenes\\" account of the ritual practices and teachings of this tradition, while also offering the reader practical and pragmatic tools for applying this traditional wisdom to one's modern day life.

In spite of the wide application of questionnaires in the second language field, there does not seem to be sufficient awareness in the profession about the theory of questionnaire design and processing. The usual--and in most cases false--perception is that anybody with a bit of common sense can design good questionnaires, and the practice of questionnaire design and use has remained largely uninformed by theory. As a consequence, it is all too common to see that studies which start out with exciting research questions are spoiled by the application of badly designed questionnaires and/or a lack of reliable and valid results due to faulty processing. One reason for the lack of sufficient awareness of questionnaire theory among language researchers is the absence of relevant summaries and training materials in the second language literature. The purpose of the current book is to fill this gap. The book is motivated by very practical purposes, namely to help researchers to increase the efficiency of their questionnaires and to avoid possible pitfalls. Accordingly, special care has been taken to avoid unnecesary jargon, to make the text accessible, and to relate everything to real-life situations. Illustrated by concrete examples, the book offers a thorough but accessible overview of the theory of questionnaire design, and administration and processing, with a special view on second language research applications. The conclusion summarizes the main points of questionnaire theory in a straightforward checklist that offers an easy-to-use tool for researchers. Researchers and students in TESOL and second-language programs and applied linguistics, with secondary markets in other language research (e.g., child language) will find this book useful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G62PAgAAQBAJ&dq=Questionnaires+in+Second+Language+Research:+Construction,+Administration,+and+Processing+(Second+Language+Acquisition+Research+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off Message","description":"From the ashes of the Penguin Australia Poetry Series, a new publishing house took wing.

Mary Anning was only twelve years old when, in 1811, she discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. Until Mary's incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, \\"She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore.\\" She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary's peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin drew on Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. A story worthy of Dickens, The Fossil Hunter chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: \\"The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it.\\" Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is \\"probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology,\\" to her deserved place in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korean (Hippocrene Handy Dictionaries)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A1ApzwEACAAJ&dq=Korean+(Hippocrene+Handy+Dictionaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mass Communication Law - Cases and Comment","description":"This text provides a comprehensive survey of media law.

Analyzing a wide range of sources - landscape paintings, stereographs, tourist photographs, advertisements, and art photography - Vermaas traces the transformation in American views of the natural environment from the nineteenth century to today. When Americans first explored the Sierras and saw the sequoias in 1852, they were awestruck. They viewed these trees not just as wonders of nature but as American possessions - symbols of the nation's strength, nobility, and endurance - whose significance was made more poignant by the sectional issues that threatened the nation's very foundation. Lacking an ancient history and troubled by secession scares, Americans turned to the landscape for signs of a durable heritage. The giant trees proved to be ideal elements - ancient monuments comparable to the cathedrals of Europe, the pyramids of Egypt, and other sacred Old World artifacts. Inspired by the trees' notoriety and grandeur, artists and illustrators since the nineteenth century have depicted these giants in masterful landscapes from artists like Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Hill; in stunning tree portraits by lithographers like Edward Vischer and tourist photographers like Yosemite's Julius Boysen; in stirring logging photography; and in powerful scenes in Hollywood films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. In Sequoia, Vermaas looks at the trees' depiction and how they reveal the often-fraught relationship between Americans and nature. The result is an eye-opening history of Americans in the West and their interactions with the land. Americans perceived the wilderness as a vast, open preserve destined to be conquered and controlled, but around the time of the trees' discovery and celebration, Americans were beginning to see the Western landscape (and the sequoias) through very different lenses. Some Americans, especially businessmen and railroad companies, endeavored to put the trees to commercial use, seeing them as the source of tremendous profits. Others, like tourists and early environmentalists, fought to preserve them, often because they saw the majestic trees as their nation's natural inheritance. Sequoia presents a perspective on both the environment and America culture, offering a new understanding of the contentious battles over nature today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z6NpQgAACAAJ&dq=Sequoia:+The+Heralded+Tree+In+American+Art+and+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"R.I.P.: Memorial Wall Art (Street Graphics / Street Art)","description":"This classic collection of photographs documents the best of New York City's memorial murals, which were painted for the victims of tragic and untimely deaths.

Eliza was nineteen, already with an ex-husband, and he was the young son of Paraguay s dictator in Europe recruiting engineers for South America s first railroad. By the time he returned to Asunci n in 1855, Eliza was pregnant with his child. In less than a decade, L pez plunged Paraguay into a conflict that would kill over half its population.

Brandeis","description":"Widely regarded as a leading progressive reformer as well as a major figure in Constitutional history, Louis D. Brandeis was an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939. Liberals and conservatives alike consistently rate him as one of the few truly great jurists to serve on that court. Until now, only Brandeis's professional correspondence has been available in print. Here, Melvin I. Urofsky and David W. Levy present the private correspondence between Brandeis and his immediate family, particularly his wife and two daughters, Elizabeth and Susan. Not only do the letters reveal much about progressive politics and personalities, they also reveal Brandeis the person. Author of the \\"right to privacy\\" doctrine, Brandeis jealously guarded his personal life. He enjoyed the stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He liked to hike and canoe.

Thousands of financial executives, managers, and sophisticated investors want to understand it, but most books on arbitrage are far too abstract and technical to serve their needs. Billingsley addresses this untapped market with the first accessible and realistic guide to the concepts and modern practice of arbitrage. It relies on intuition, not advanced math: readers will find basic algebra sufficient to understand it and begin using its methods. The author starts with a lucid introduction to the fundamentals of arbitrage, including the Laws of One Price and One Expected Return. Using realistic examples, he shows how to identify assets and portfolios ripe for exploitation: mispriced commodities, securities, misvalued currencies; interest rate differences; and more. You'll learn how to establish relative prices between underlying stock, puts, calls, and 'riskless' securities like Treasury bills -- and how these techniques support derivatives pricing and hedging. Billingsley then illuminates options pricing, the heart of modern risk management and financial engineering. He concludes with an accessible introduction to the Nobel-winning Modigliani-Miller theory, and its use in analyzing capital structure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SgJ7eUXIGuIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Tough Mother: Success in Life, Business and AP","description":"When a heart attack claimed Gert Boyle's husband in 1970, the forty-six-year-old housewife and mother of three found herself at the helm of Columbia Sportswear, a small outerwear manufacturer in Portland, Oregon, that was struggling financially. With no business experience whatsoever, Boyle was faced with the challenge of running Columbia, which had been founded in 1937 by her father a Jewish immigrant who had fled Hitler's Germany. Boyle and her son Tim persevered, turning a company that in 1970 had forty employees and less than $800,000 in annual sales into the leading seller of skiwear in the United States, with more than 2000 employees and over a billion in annual sales. Along the way, thanks in part to a creative marketing campaign that billed her as \\"one tough mother,\\" Boyle established herself as an industry icon, and the first woman ever inducted into the International Sporting Goods Hall of Fame. \\"One Tough Mother\\" presents an honest and often irreverent account of Boyle's journey from a childhood in Nazi Germany to incredible success in America. She offers insights into succeeding in business and in life, and shares many of the advertisements and strategies that have made her so recognizable. \\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUdnPwAACAAJ&dq=One+Tough+Mother:+Success+in+Life,+Business+and+AP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Night Engines","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Trashing the Economy: How Runaway Environmentalism is Wrecking America","description":"A documented profile of more than sixty environmental organizations, including histories, sources of funding, boards of directors, personal biographies of leader and how they kill jobs and trash the economy, detail by detail, fact by fact.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zuoJAQAAMAAJ&dq=Trashing+the+Economy:+How+Runaway+Environmentalism+is+Wrecking+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sylvia's Soul Food","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Disturber of the peace;: The life of H.L.

The fIrst wave was the well known \\"quantitative revolution\\" which propelled geography from a mainly descriptive discipline to a scientifIc discipline using formalism such as probability, statistics, and a large-number of mathematical methods for analyzing spatial structures and processes under certainty and uncertainty. The second wave is the recent advancement of geographical information systems which equips geographers with automation in the storage, retrieval, analysis, and display of data. Both developments have significant impacts on geographical studies in general and solutions to real life spatio-temporal problems in particular. They have found applications in urban and regional planning, automated mapping and facilities management, transportation planning and management, as well as environmental planning and management, to name but a few examples. Both developments have one thing in common. They one way or the other use computer to process and analyze data. However, not until recently, there has been very little interaction between the two. Quantitative models have largely been developed independent of the underlying data models and structures representing the spatial phenomena or processes under study. Display of analysis results has been primitive in terms of the utilization of computer graphic technologies. Formal models, in addition to their technical difficulties, have poor capability in communication with users. Geographical information systems, on the other hand, have originally been developed with a slight intention to entertain powerful analytical models.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U63tCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"These Rare Lands","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christian Home Cook Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S8ExHAAACAAJ&dq=Christian+Home+Cook+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India","description":"White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time. James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa 'Most excellent among Women' the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company. It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant. In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A4_IeMMLgdkC&dq=White+Mughals:+Love+and+Betrayal+in+Eighteenth-Century+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Loons: Thirteen Tales of Mystery By Minnesota's Premier Crime Writers","description":"In this collection of 13 short stories from Minnesota̡s top crime writers, you̡ll be treated to an array of whodunits.

Here the older worlds of the Algonquians and of various Europeans overlapped, and their mixture created new systems of meaning and of exchange. Finally, the book tells of the breakdown of accommodation and common meanings and the re-creation of the Indians as alien and exotic.

Lang Lang was born in Shenyang in north-eastern China just after the end of the Cultural Revolution. He began piano lessons at three years old and by age ten had been awarded a place at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. In order to continue his studies he moved thousands of miles from home, living with his exacting father in a cramped, shared apartment, while his mother stayed at home to earn the money to pay his fees. At fifteen he moved to the United States to take up a scholarship at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia; by nineteen he was selling out Carnegie Hall. His tutor and mentor Daniel Barenboim was perhaps the first to describe him as  extraordinarily talented ; today his assessment is shared by millions. Now in adulthood, Lang Lang tours relentlessly, delighting sell-out audiences with his trademark flamboyance and showmanship. Journey of a Thousand Miles is a tale of heartbreak, drama and ultimately triumph. His inspiring story demonstrates the courage and self-sacrifice required to achieve artistic greatness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IYs_BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistics in Human Genetics (International Relations and the Great Powers)","description":"No scholar better exemplifies the intellectual challenges foisted on the Neorealist school of international relations than prominent scholar Stephen Krasner (Graham H. Stuart Professor of International Studies, the Senior Associate Dean for the Social Sciences, School of Humanities & Sciences, and Director of Policy Planning at the US State Department 2005-2007). Throughout his career he has wrestled with realism's promises and limitations. Krasner has always been a prominent defender of realism and the importance of power understood in material terms, whether military or economic. Yet realist frameworks rarely provided a complete explanation for outcomes, in Krasner's analyses, and much of his work involved understanding power's role in situations not well explained by realism. If states seek power, why do we see cooperation? If hegemony promotes cooperation why does cooperation continue in the face of America's decline? Do states actually pursue their national interests or do domestic structures and values derail the rational pursuit of material objectives? Krasner's explanations were as diverse as were the problems. They pushed, to use his phrase, \\"the limits of realism.\\" Edited by Martha Finnemore and Judith Goldstein, Back to Basics asks scholars to reflect on the role power plays in contemporary politics and how a power politics approach is influential today. The arguments made by the authors in this volume speak to one of three themes that run through Krasner's work: state power and hegemony; the relationship between states and markets; conceptions of the nation state in international politics. These themes appeared regularly in Krasner's scholarship as he wrestled, over his career, with fundamental questions of inter-state politics. Contributors largely agree on the centrality of power but diverge substantially on the ways power is manifest and should be measured and understood. Many of the contributors confronted the same intellectual dilemmas as Krasner in struggling to define power and its relationship to interests, yet their responses are different. Together, these essays explore new ways of thinking about power's role in contemporary politics and demonstrate the concepts continued relevance for both policy and theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gRtUIxvF0rwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"125 Best Cupcake Recipes","description":"Learn to make a variety of cupcakes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zlLSAQAACAAJ&dq=125+Best+Cupcake+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Managers: Project Management (Essential Managers Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Catholicism & Ethics Text: A Medical - Moral Handbook","description":"Describes the elements of Catholicism, focusing on the life, incarnation, and teachings of Jesus Christ; the sacraments; worship and prayer; Mary, the Apostles, and the Saints; and grace, salvation, and heaven and hell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=48dvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Catholicism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pentax ZX-7 and ZX-30","description":"No wonder these two Pentax models are so popular--they're among the lowest in price and easiest to use.

The eleven stories are told from the point of view of young and old, male and female--characters confronting a chaotic and corrupt society torn between changing religious and social values, economic decline, and the encroachment of superficial popular culture--cinema in particular. In the epistolary title story, an elderly Indian woman s letter to Hollywood epitomizes the ironic distance between her Hindu faith and her addiction to popular film and television: she writes a rambling missive about many aspects of her long life, including the fact that she s just met the reincarnation of the actor James Dean in Bombay. In \\"Trivedi Park,  a father s pangs of conscience over his part in his \\"slow  daughter Radhika s suicide are manifest in his certainty she s \\"haunting  him and in his desperate need to cleanse his guilt one rainy day.

Today's parents often feel that they have too little time in their busy schedules to handle such an important task. They're not even sure where to begin. In 20 Teachable Virtues authors Barbara C. Unell and Jerry L. Wyckoff, Ph.D. demonstrate the simple ways that you can teach your children to care about others and about themselves. By using everyday time together, however brief, you can pass on the lessons of virtue that are most important to your familytoday and for generations to come. At a time when values seem to be on the decline and children are looking to their parents for guidance, this new book argues that the building of a more moral society begins in the home. Through numerous anecdotes and examples, Unell and Wyckoff show parents how a select group of 20 virtues can be instilled, and warn how easily kids can be sent the wrong message. \\"To learn to live in society,\\" write the authors, \\"all children must learn to balance their personal wants against the needs of the social group (family, neighborhood, school, society). Today we see far too few examples of this kind of balance as people put their own wants and needs above all othersall of the time.\\" Through the use of numerous anecdotes which illustrate each virtue, 20 Teachable Virtues shows how common occurrences can become \\"teachable moments\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zJpPEAAAQBAJ&dq=20+Teachable+Virtues:+Practical+Ways+to+Pass+on+Lessons+of+Virtue+(Perigee)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beat Speak: An Illustrated Beat Glossary Circa : 1956-1959","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KxaONwAACAAJ&dq=Beat+Speak:+An+Illustrated+Beat+Glossary+Circa+:+1956-1959&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Benjamin's Box: A Resurrection Story","description":"Are you looking for the perfect Easter picture book and a way to engage your children with the biblical story of Holy Week in a way they ll remember?

Christine Stansell shows how a new concept of womanhood took shape in America as middle-class women constituted themselves the moral guardians of their families and of the nation, while poor workingwomen, cut adrift from the family ties that both sustained and oppressed them, were subverting through their sudden entry into the working and political worlds outside the home the strict notions of female domesticity and propriety, of  woman s place  and  woman s nature,  that were central to the flowering and the image of bourgeois life in America. Here we have a passionate and enlightening portrait of New York during the years in which it was becoming a center of world capitalist development, years in which it was evolving in dramatic ways, becoming the city it fundamentally is. And we have, as well, a radically illuminating depiction of a class conflict in which the dialectic of female vice and virtue was a central issue. City of Women is a prime work of scholarship, the first full-scale work by a major new voice in the fields of American and urban history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c2g4_EjRnnYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Keeping Livestock Healthy: A Veterinary Guide To Horses, Cattle, Pigs, Goats & Sheep","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Real Bravo Two Zero","description":"The true story of the most famous SAS operation in history.
