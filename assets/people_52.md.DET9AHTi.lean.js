For that act of inhumanity, I humbly beg forgiveness, though I know full well that the teacher who betrays his students' trust in such a way can no more expect absolution than can the Nazi underling, who, acting on his superior's orders, sends a cowering Jew to the gas chamber.And don't you dare tell me I didn't get the book. Since I was supposed to be teaching the thing I read it three times (well, to be frank, two and half times; midway through my third reading, I gave up in disgust, both at myself, for having persisted so long, and at the novel itself). I mean, who really gives a fig for any of the characters in the book? Or for that stupid green light? Oooh, ah, and the Valley of Ashes! How very apocalyptic! And T. J. Mecklenburg, or whatever his name was. How could anybody really give a fig for any of it?I've also seen lots of reviews where high-school students (probably with plenty of help from their teachers) say they must not be smart enough or mature enough to get Gatsby. Not at all, my friends! Believe in yourselves, youth of the world force-fed Gatsby by illiterate curriculum writers! You are neither too stupid nor too immature. Gatsby, at any age, is simply awful.

Unfortunately, they end up killing everyone on Earth.Although many believe it to be a masterpiece, I thought this book was retarded."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The great gatsby is probably the best book I have ever read, and certainly the most life changing. I read it recently in class, and connected so well with the characters. It is a book that takes multiple reads to understand fully, because of the amount of symbolism in it. Fitzgerald's words are so beautiful, and his descriptions paint verbal pictures that are truly magnificent. The Great Gatsby is a book I intend to read over and over again. It is am american classic that every person should read at least twice."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There is this handful of books where empathy is actually possible with the first person narrator: Catcher in the Rye, The Bell Jar, Invisible Man, All the King's Men, god forbid - Lolita, throw in Bukowski for good measure, but also The Great Gatsby. These books throw us into their subject by allowing us to understand what it would be like to be in the same scenario, and we can better understand that type of life. I am uncertain what it is that links these, but perhaps the narrators' fear, uncertainty, and continuing effort to figure life out in spite of the knowledge that the effort will inevitably end in failure make them human and part of us. The Great Gatsby lets us live for a moment in the twenties without engaging in any truly great events, despite the title. If only there were one of these for every decade."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a novel centered around obsession, extravagance, and the perils associated with these things. The narrator is Nick Carraway, whose seemingly dull life is meant as a contrast with the lives of the other characters. Jay Gatsby is the title character, whose true identity remains hidden for most of the novel. He has created a life for himself: a new identity, a disreputable job, and elaborate parties, all a front to impress the woman of his dreams. Daisy Buchanan lives in fashionable East Egg, with her husband Tom. Their life is consumed by maintaining an outward faade of wealth and perfection. The truth, like Gatsby's life, is much less glamorous. Daisy is bored and restless, and Tom keeps a mistress in the City.Nick, at the beginning of the plot has rented a house on Gatsby's property, and conveniently is also Daisy's cousin. Gatsby comes up with the brilliant idea of recruiting Nick to help him seduce Daisy. Daisy is immediately attracted to the excitement that seems to surround Gatsby. The dangers of his business dealings, and the constant flow of strangers that attend his parties seem so different from her calm life with her husband. Both of them are desperate for some change, and believe that all their dreams will be realized when they are together.Fitzgerald in this novel has created an American classic. His tale of decadence and destruction is an essential work of fiction. He has taken the \\"roaring 20's\\", and shown the negative side of luxury and wealth. Although at times he seems to be advocating lewd parties, or adultery, he is merely trying to show what ends come to people who partake in these activities. One cannot help but sympathize with Gatsby. He is a man who is convinced that he must be something other than himself in order to impress the woman he loves. Yet all his efforts prove in vain when he realizes that Daisy would never make him happy, and still his pursuit of her still leads to his death.In reading this I felt that one could not help but enjoy it. The plot lacks dramatic action scenes, but this is made up for with the complex social situations that Fitzgerald showcases. Its appeal also lies in the readers' strange attraction to a character who is less than perfect (Gatsby), and distaste for a character who seems to have the least flaws (Nick)."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It tops more than one list of the greatest novels of all time. Sure, it's subjective, but everyone should read this book. I somehow didn't read it in high school, so I picked it up recently. It's great. And the movie with Robert Redford did a nice job of adapting it too."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is one of America's greatest literary achievements. This ranks on any short list of the greatest novels of the century. The tragic tale of Jay Gatsby is a character study, with every chapter a different facet of a manufactured persona. Gatsby never comes into complete focus, but that, oddly, is one of the strengths of the book. And Gatsby's love for his prewar flame Daisy rings true (a love she doesn't deserve). The other characters also are striking and brilliant. The plot too is poignant and tragic. And Fitzgerald's style and voice fit the story perfectly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is written in beautiful language, perfectly describing the events it depicts. When I read a book I get very frustrated with superfluous words and unnecessary narrative. Fitzgerald somehow describes a situation, and does so in a way that leaves you with no doubt as to what he is descrbing, without any excess. The levels of thought this book touches upon are amazing. To me its theme is simply that of disillusionment. Fitzgerald shows both a world we see and assume to exist and the things that lay beneath it. This is a book that by the closing pages you can easily feel it is a masterpiece even if you can't put your finger on why. Subsequent readings show the depth it reaches. It is truly a work of art."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book The Great Gatsby was a wonderful book which told the story about one mans desire to win back the heart of his one true love. That man is Gatsby who is trying to win back Daisy's heart and make her leave Tom.Tom is the one who Daisy married when Gatsby left, so Gatsby reinvented himself and became rich hoping that Daisy would come back. One night Tom and Gatsby got into a fight leaving Daisy scared because she loved them both, she ended up doing something that Gatsby had to take the blame for. This book tells the story of tragic love and loss. I gave this book a 4 stars because I thought that it was a great book and it shows that people will do anything for true love. I would have to recommed this book for people in Middle school and in high school."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"what makes this book so great?it is what fitzgerald is able to do with the story and the characters in such a short book. the story deals with love of daisy and the love of money. the winner is money. the 4 main characters are fully drawn. the relationship of tom and daisy could not be more clearly portrayed in so few words. the only mystery is the way gatsby makes his money. it seems to be on the fringe of being illegal. but what motivates gatsby, love and money, are obsessions. he literally dies pursuing them. although he has both, he needs more. he wants to have the power and prestige of long term money and gazes forlornly at the green light of the east egg. he also has the love of daisy, but it must be pure and she can't have ever loved tom. when daisy's world crashes about her, she runs not to her lover, gatsby, but the power, influence, and safety of tom.great introduction to classic literature! the ironies of the ending bring a smile to your face."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great novel! I would first like to tell you that upon my first reading of the novel I was not impressed. My first reading of the novel was when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't enjoy reading nor did I appreciate writing at that time. My disliking of reading contributed and affected my views on the book drastically. I decided to give the book another try again seven years later and I love it! I think if the book is read by an experienced reader at any age, then one could appreciate the book for the many great aspects and details provided for the readers.This novel brings to us many feelings. It demonstrates to us how greed, wealth, love, ambition, success, lover's triangles, and one's desire can change life. Once all those things are linked together the plot becomes very intense. I enjoyed that the novel included all of those life's happenings.The plot to the novel is very exciting. It portrays the early 1900's and the Jazz Age beautifully. I enjoyed that the plot was directed towards what daily life could bring to one's self. The characters, plot, daily occurrences, opportunities, employment, and the struggles in the book were all a very good representation of early American life. I feel the book portrayed real life, real problems, and real people. While reading the book I never thought or found what I was reading to be far fetched.I enjoyed that the book was told by a character that wasn't the main character. I enjoyed the perspective that it gave by looking into Gatsby's life and not Gatsby simply being informative about his life story. I also enjoyed that the main characters were not the only focus in the book! There were additional characters that were linked in many different ways to the main ones and were introduced and then continuously followed upon. The book became to be a story about many people and how life\`s obstacles affected their decisions, choices, and life in general.I think anyone who enjoys reading should read this novel at least once. The novel has a very nice story line that I think most everyone should enjoy it! I give this book 4 stars!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald takes place during the hot New York summer of 1922. On the surface the book is a romance between two estranged lovers, Gatsby and Daisy, but the heart of the book is a metaphor of the time. The symbolism is directly parallel to the disintegration of the American dream.The book is a wonderful read if you like the spider webs Fitzgerald weaves. The Great Gatsby is full of symbolism related to the time period, and a love story that is nothing short of ridiculous. I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spend reading The Great Gatsby. The book allowed my imagination to play out wonderful scenes with every page. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about undying love, and the lengths some people will go to obtain their dreams."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Modern Library declares that this is the 2nd greatest novel of the 20th century?Are you serious?

I believe this is the books ultimate weekness. The theme is &quot;you can't relive the past&quot;. Okaaay, and? It just sort of stops there, comes to a sudden halt. To me, the Great Gatsby doesn't have any true deep thinking in this area. I feel that the development of themes throughout a novel are very important so I have to say the Fitz just doesn't cut it for me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"That way he cannot write something this trite and boring again. &quot;Slow to start&quot; and &quot;ambling&quot; are such understatements when describing this thing I can barely call a book, yet alone a novel. The overflow of useless and uneeded information in this thing makes it several chapters longer than need be. In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- &quot;I'm rich.&quot; and &quot;Oh, boo hoo.&quot; The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely &quot;Let's sit around and whine about being rich. Next we'll get drunk and call each other names, fight, and run each other over!&quot; SHUT UP ALREADY!) I can rarely can say this, but I HATE HATE HATE HATE this book!

The last chapter says it all, the rest is filler. It is considered a literary masterpiece according to the preface. What makes it a masterpiece is the rewrite Fitzgerald did to make it so boring. It is a tale of monied people leaving shattered lives behind for someone else to pick up, but written with priggish, even highhanded prose."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"If people read this book without knowing its history of success, what would they think of it? My guess is that it would be forgotten very quickly. If you are a high school student assigned to read this book, then unfortunately you have to suffer through it. If you are a teacher, please save the children and assign them a more interesting book. For those reading for pleasure, I recommend skipping this poorly written book. The characters are cartoons. They behave in a predictable manner and have no depth. Perhaps at the time it was written, people saw something in it that made it a worthwhile read but it has not passed the test of time. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To put it short, The Great Gatsby is a soap opera with depth. This book is obviously more than just a boy meets girl who is married to another boy book, but it is not much more. Sure, it raises interesting issues of consumerism and 1920's post war culture, but it never sets its heart on it. It touches it half heartedly, but it doesn't attack it like it should. Or as english teachers would say, it doesn't \\"commit murder\\". Fitzgerlad is too busy telling the story which happenes to be dull and unexciting at the most.The plot, the storyline, the story, and the execution of it is just poor. It's boring. It's futile. It's dumb. I fail to understand why Fitzgerald chose to use Nick, this incredibly dull and uninteresting character, as his narrator when he could have written it third person, or used a more interesting character for the narrator. Even the conversation and dialogue is quite useless. Take this for a sampler, \\"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...or wait a minute- it's ust the opposite- the sun's getting colder every year.\\" And this quote comes from nowhere and has to do with nothing.Gatsby was obviously drunk, or smoking marijuana when he was writing this book, and must have thougth that this book was pretty clever. It isn't. All I can say is that, I don't consider it a classic. It's just so haphazard and bad that people mistake it for being good."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I absolutely hated this story. All the characters did was moan about their lives and do stupid things. Daisy was a complete waste of oxygen and the rest of the characters just cried.

This book should never have written!..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In my time I have read many novels, most of which were at least pleasing and gave me a sense of having learned something. In this soap-opera-like &quot;classic&quot; nothing is accomplished except reviewers making themselves look good by calling the book good.

Inspired me to get back to writing my own book!By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I suppose it's arguable that this is a great novel but it's certainly one of the best written in English in the first half of the twentieth century. It's the story of a man who fell in love with a flighty young girl five years earlier, lost track of her while trying to become worthy, then tried to \\"recapture the past\\" although she had reverted to flirtatious and materialistic form and married an enormously wealthy buffoon.Fitzgerald really hit it out of the park with this one. Nothing of his that I've read elsewhere -- excepting a few short stories and essays -- approaches the quality of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" It's an immense literary achievement, though it's short and sweet.It's not a wildly experimental exercise in style -- not Joycean or Faulknerian. Fitzgerald's prose flows along in its own simple, comprehensible, ironic way, with occasional decorative adornments -- fractured sets of impressions here and there, but nothing to impede our interest in the plot.What I mean is that stuff HAPPENS in \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Let me think. Adultery, illegal drinking, a horrible automobile accident, a smashed nose, impolite snubs, unabashed greed, suicide and murder.It's not a simple love story. Gatsby's love for the shallow Daisy is one of the few things that propel him. It's as fundamental to his character as the air he breathes. He's harnessed to it.Then there is the covert theme -- not very covert -- of social distinctions, the gap between the awesomely rich and the rest of us. Gatsby is marked as nouveau because \\"he wears a pink suit\\", drives a gaudy car, and hangs with the wrong people. \\"Rich girls don't marry poor boys,\\" is the way Daisy puts it, but she's wrong about that. She might better have said \\"old money doesn't marry new money.\\" It would still have been off the mark, but less so. And I'm compelled to mention the quietly comic observations that the narrator, Nick Carraway, makes from time to time.All this, and more, is given to us in some exquisitely genteel prose. Is it okay if I quote some examples? Fitzgerald is describing the desolate neighborhood near the gas station where his mistress lives. \\"This is a valley of ashes -- a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendant effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men spring up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\\"What he's done in this paragraph (I could have chosen a dozen others) is move subtly from the metaphorical to the real with our hardly being sensible of it. Of course, piles of ashes aren't really houses and chimneys, but the men with the spades are material enough. Yet the whole thing fits together like a painting, the laborers barely discernible among the clouds of ash.Fitzgerald can give us a flash shot of character. The narrator, Nick Carraway, visits Tom, an arrogant, cruel, self-indulgent ex-football player he met at Yale but hasn't seen for years. Tom waits for him, legs apart, at the stop of the stairs. Then he puts his arm over Nick's shoulders, turns him around, and sweeps his hand across the vista presented by the estate he lives in. Tom's first sentence: \\"I've got a nice place here.\\"Fitzgerald can write \\"pretty\\" too. Daisy and Tom live in an atmosphere that's constantly compared to champagne, wedding cakes, icing, filigree, and white toilet powder. Gatsby's night-time social brawls: \\"In his blue gardens, the girls and men came and went like moths among the champagne and the whispering and the stars.\\" One sentence gives us everything we need to know. \\"Blue gardens.\\" \\"Moths.\\"It's not just the style that makes this an outstanding novel. It's the structure too. In Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho,\\" the major star, Janet Leigh, is murdered half-way through the film. One gasps, killing off the star with a brutal murderer who comes out of nowhere. Fitzgerald does pretty much the same thing with the mystery that constantly simmers behind Gatsby's real identity. Who is Gatsby? Where does he come from? How did he make his fortune? Did he kill a man? The answers are traditionally saved for the climactic ending but Fitzgerald throws them at us half-way through the story, as the maniac sweeps aside the shower curtain and puts an end to the heroine in the bath tub. A daring and risky step.When Gatsby finally begins to grasp Daisy's true nature, \\"he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is....\\" And, of course, the book's last sentence is one of the best remembered in American literature, drawing our attention in the direction of dead visions, and not just Gatsby's."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I absolutely love this book. It's one of my all time favorites, the paradigmatic story of romantic obsession (which, like all true romances, ends in betrayal or death--in this case, both). What raises this romance far above the genre is its profound insights into both human nature and America as an ideal and a culture, and the quality of Fitzgerald's writing: from his masterly employment of literary tropes and his gorgeous prose to his unforgettable characters and evocative descriptions of places and events, Fitgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" sets unsurpassed standards for great fiction. It has a permanent place on my bookshelves and in my heart.The San Val hardback edition is a step up if you want this for a home library. But if I were going to buy a hardback and also wanted a great scholarly introduction to the text, I'd invest in the Harold Bloom critical edition."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read Great Gatsby back in Junior High and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were unloveable/unredeemable.Finally getting around to re-reading it with more literature behind me, I have a much different take. While still not a favorite read of mine, I found it more entertaining than I remember and I actually came away engaged in the story and the characters.Reading it this time, I was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions. The drinking/partying took on a new aspect. It also gave me a greater perception into Gatsby's character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to 'break into' (Daisy's).There was still plenty of superficiality to the characters...but that doesn't mean these characters are flat. On the contrary, I saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens. I was very impressed by the way Fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance.I enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy and the way the various relationships worked. Now that I've actually dated and married, I viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension, jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on.I would like to have seen more development of the pseudo-relationship between Nick and Jordan, but I think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in-depth thinking than if Nick and Jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them.I seem to remember there being significant discussion about the East/West geography in my Junior High English class...but reading it this time, I just didn't see that as a main motif. Sure, we had \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\" and various New York parties and excursions. But when you get down to it, the East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the \\"true culture\\" of established Eastern money or whatever.I had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled. Parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped, but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc, even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled (which is part of the intent, I believe).My initial rating from my Junior High memories was 2 out of 5 stars. With a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more, I can give a better rating and say that I can see now why this book is held up as a classic. It's not the action packed thriller or adventure novel that I may have wanted as a young teenager, but it is a thought provoking and engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world.****4 stars"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"My daughter's AP English teacher assigned Gatsby to her as a summer reading project.

I strongly believe that everyone who rated this classic novel below a 3 stars didn't fully grasp the symbolism in the characters, the location (East/West Egg, Dr. T's Eyes), the green light or the meaning of any of the relationships. It's a really quick read, 180 pages, you can do it in one day...but read with much concentration! Go back to your college days and remember that legendary authors, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, crafts his work so that NOTHING is written by mistake. The setting, the colors, the dialogue, they all have an underlying meaning.I would also recommend reading a little biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald before reading \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" because then you'll know that it's somewhat autobiographical, being that he is from the Midwest and he was a solider.Overall, reading The Great Gatsby requires immense concentration and an understanding of literature/symbolism. If you do some prior research, then you'll realize WHY it is a classic.And don't just skip the book and watch the movie (with Robert Redford), because the book is MUCH MUCH better."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I found a copy of this book in a very small, very messy book store in my area and decided to give it read. Fitzgerald from the start is extremely descriptive yet brief and poetic. What I find so very impressive about this book is it's ability to make you understand the depths of both the 1920's and the place this story has in it; yet the story and themes are not just easy to relate to, they are fresh even after 90 years. I am an actor and while reading the last 4-5 pages I found myself reading aloud from the book because the conclusion and final thoughts of the character telling the story are written in a profound way; one that makes me feel they should be spoken so that the meaning won't be lost."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Aside from the narrator, Mr. Carroway, who chances to be Gatsby's perceptive neighbor, we are the only ones who ever come to know the man. Everyone else sees only a fragment of him... if that. And he is far from what he appears to be. We ultimately know him as delusional, obsessive, pitiable, and needy. The fact is he's quite a bit like many of us; the difference is in the contrast between his external persona and his internal one. Fitzgerald's remarkable achievement in this book is in portraying Gatsby's dimensionality so completely in 180 pages. From shadowy playboy to abandoned corpse in 180 pages. And in the process Fitzgerald treats us to his remarkable craft:\\"Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside - East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.\\"\\"...there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\\"\\"Everyone suspects himself of at least one cardinal virtue...\\"\\"He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths - so that he could \`come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\\"\\"...I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.\\"\\"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind...\\"\\"At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the room.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"by far, the best novel i have read in my 20 years of existence. i ask every girl i'm interested in if she's read it. a response of yes=we'll keep in touch and no=no love"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"How can you define classics in a literature of a nation who was born a bit more than two hundred years ago? A tale like TGG could be the right answer. Even if I have found the track a bit boring, it is the most representative subject that can be defined American epics. But what I really appreciate about Fitzgerald is his style of writing, the best I have ever met in American and English literature, which also retains its meaningful form (but in that case I have to pay much credit to the translator) in the Italian version. The final short digression about the green light is one of the most often seen quotations."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There is something about Jay Gatsby that is quintessentially American. When I was a younger reader, I simply put the character down as shallow. He's a phony, sure, but it comes from the idea that he can remake himself in his own image, godlike, into something better than he really is... and even reshape his own past. What is the American Dream, but the idea that you can transcend your background and origins to become whatever you want? To transcend barriers of class, wealth and breeding? Of course, the cost of such a dream sometimes ends up as more than most of us would be willing to pay, and the dream often crashes upon the rocks of reality. F. Scott Fitzgerald does not shy away from that."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In this book a certain Jay Gatsby has accumlated a vast wealth from nothing, having any material possession he might ever need. Yet, he lacks love. This is about his attempt at capturing his love, and all the strange things that a man might do to get it. The flashiness and greatness of the 20's are represented well in this book, with lavish parties and care free guests. It shows that the rich have problems as well, and many times their lives are more empty than the lives of those that are poor. Fitzgerald's writing style kept me very entertained, being very calm and relaxed throughout the whole book. The oddity in Gatsby's &quot;style&quot; kept me interested and thoughtful, such as the constant use of the phrase &quot;old sport.&quot; I think this book deserves to be considered the classic that it is, and has earned its place among other greats."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby has many twists and turns, chock full of phrases and situations that make sense as the story unfolds that beckons you to go back and reread this story. The story meshes the characters and their setting very well. However, as good as the story was, it was difficult to feel anything but disappointment with any of the characters.The narrator, Nick, is never fully fleshed out. He seems to be a prop brought in from the Midwest only to be used as an observer of the strange goings on of the rest of the characters. Even his relationship with Jordan is blandly glossed over. With so many different characters to juggle, one wonders if the narrator character could have been dropped completely.Jordan is ... a golfer, was it? She appears to be another peripheral prop in a mad dash to bring the only three characters who have any flesh together.Which brings us to Daisy. A girl who one begins to feel a warmth towards but who destroys any goodwill as events reach their climax. She is childish and numb to all but her own feelings. She is beautiful and fascinating, but wholly boring and empty.Her husband Tom, on the other hand, was a powerhouse of a character. Full of energy and passion and endowed with the wealth of his forebearers, this man has the ability and nature to lead corporations or governments. He squanders it all buying into pop psychology and wrestling with the 'ash' of society. What is most disappointing in Tom is that one can see this gargantuan man slowly turning himself into a stupid ape. How many times did I feel like wrapping my fingers around his thick neck and telling him to shut up?Finally there's Gatsby. A boy in a man's body. Building himself into the man that he is by careful planning and determination, he finds himself at the crest of adulthood used as a doormat for those who he might consider his friends. He confuses serfdom for gentlemanliness. He throws off the shackles of his past but builds for himself a house of cards. One almost feels happy for him when Wilson makes his housecall to Gatsby's mansion.All in all, this is a great book. Even without sympathetic characters, the story flows along quite well with little eddys of brilliant storytelling that come together at the end and urge the reader to go back and reread what may have been missed on the first outing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I love this book. On one level, it is a burning love story about obsession, yearning, and unrequited love, but on another level, this book is an interesting look at life in the Roaring Twenties. I love the vivid character discriptions, symbolism, and vocabulary. Come on, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock... Doctor JT Eckelberg's eyes looking down about man... supercilious and vaccuous... ha... it's a classic. Love it and reread it every few years. Also, this edition has notes in the back that explain some names and history (such as Gatz being slang for gun, etc.) very helpful"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A wonderful book that has aged gracefully. I enjoyed the simplicity thereof, and the beautiful prose that the author applied in just the right amount. Also appreciated was the humour- an element that is sorely lacking in many older books.If you enjoyed this, do try Remains of the Day by Ishiguro and anything by Julian Barnes."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's words are like waves and I was only along for the ride. There was certainly more to get out of this book than I did, but it left a strong, satisfying feeling with me when I finished. When I awoke I was face-down in the sand."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Like most high school students I read this in English class. Like most students I dreaded it (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Steinbeck, what's the difference?) This was one of the first books to open my eyes to use of almost perfect prose while telling a story of less than perfect people. It helped that I had an instructor who led us on a hunt for the symbols within the story. She expalined the use of the symbols whether they were conciously put there by the author or whether they are a manifestation of societal mores and structure.The basic story line is that a poor boy falls in love with a rich girl. The poor boy goes off to make his fortune, the rich girl marries someone else. The poor boy comes back rich and finds the unhappily married girl. Chaos ensues. At first he is one of the &quot;in&quot; crowd. But Jay Gatsby still seems like the man trying to buy his way into high society. His attempt to woo Daisy from her philandering husband ends in tragedy for one of the &quot;little people&quot; in the story. As usual the old monied beautiful people are untouched by the petty problems of the rest of world, even if they are the cause. The entire story wrapped in beautiful prose as if to emphasize that with the proper wrapping even the ugliest present can look beautiful. The light of hope only blinks off once the contents are fully revealed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is my all-time FAVORITE book. I was required to read it for my English class in high school. I had seen the movie with Robert Redford, and I thought it was okay. But after finding the way Fitzgerald portrays symbolism and foreshadowing, is just amazing. Also, he spends time on the little things about each character, making his writing exquisite. I read the Fitzgerald was a drunk while he was writing this, but he sure was smart! My English teacher pointed out some amazing things that I would never be able to think of in my whole life! This book is truely amazing, I highly reccomend it for anyone. It isn't a long book, and it is for anyone interested. You will be very happy after you read, and you'll know why people consider it to be the Great American Novel of the century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"From reading reviews, it looks like I'm in the minority in being unimpressed with this book. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I found this modern classic to be just plain boring. The lives of upperclass Long Islanders in the 1920's was not interesting to me. I'm not sure how people consider this to be one of the best books written--what about Tolstoy, Dickens, Dostoevsky, etc.?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I walked away very disapointed with 'the Great Gatsby'. Its said to be one of the best American novels of all time, yet I found it lacked maturity as well as development. The novel is about Nick Carraway's friendship with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious wealthy 30 year-old who throws lavish parties where most of the guests are not even invited and don't know the host at all. Gatsby reveals to Nick through a mutual friend named Jordan that the reason he has been throwing parties for years is because he hopes that the love of his life will somehow walk into one...Gatsby is a generous but painfully removed man who cannot forget Daisy,the love of his life who he hasn't seen in years, since before her marraige to another man named Tom. I thought that the plot was good, but it need more development and the characters needed more depth. 'The Great Gatsby' is a short read, I read it in a day, and found that Fitzgerald's style is continuous from that of his first novel, 'this Side of Paradise'. The only credit I do have to give to Fitzgerald is that his word flow is very readable and his revised sentences are nearly perfect. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you are an absolute fan of Fitzgerald, you want to learn about the Roaring Twenties, or want a short and hardly romantic and at times boring read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This can hardly be called a novel. It is, at best, a novella at roughly 150 pages. The craftsmanship that went into choosing words is obvious, but it is equally obvious that Fitzgerald didn't have much of an ability to create and tell stories. The novel moves ahead predictably, with nary a twist. Similarly, the characters are flat, each painted with an overly broad brush. None of the characters is multifaceted enough to maintain reader interest beyond the bounds of this tiny book.Clearly, this novel deserves the lack of attention it received when first released. It's too bad the 1950's gave rise to a class of pretentious persons who lifted this book up from the slime into which it had deservedly descended. It is thanks to them that school children across America are subjected to this tripe in the name of education.How many more children will have their budding love of reading destroyed by being forced to read such purile and juvenile garbage as this?Fortunately, I had been reading much longer, more complicated novels for many years by the time I was required to read this one in my Sophomore year of High School. I hated it then, but I thought at the time that it was I who was at fault. Now, some 15 years later, I've re-read the novel, and I find it to be almost completely without merit.It's a good thing I was already a reader by the time this garbage was inflicted upon me, or I might never have acquired a taste for books, thinking this was representative of the works available. Not many children have been so inoculated against poisonous works such as this one.Is it any wonder why American kids don't like to read?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"THIS PARTICULAR EDITION OF THE FITZGERALD CLASSIC IS SUBLIME. TO REVISIT THE STORY OF JAY GATSBY AFTER THIRTY PLUS YEARS WAS QUITE THRILLING. F. SCOTTS' VERBIAGE IS SO LYRICAL , SO POETIC , I READ SEVERAL PAGES OVER AND OVER. TO MOST OF US THIS IS A VERY FAMILIAR STORY AS IT WAS REQUIRED READING IN SCHOOL. HOWEVER I WAS TAKEN ABACK AT THE FRESHNESS AND NEWNESS OF THE WRITING...IF YOU HAVE NOT READ GATSBY IN AWHILE , OR IF NEVER, YOU ARE MISSING AN ENORMOUS, TANTALIZING READ."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Brilliantly written, yes, but the story I was not quite satisfied with. It seemed to lack depth. No real conflict. Fabulous people living fabulous, rich lives in the Hamptons. A nice escapist novel but not quite enough substance for me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's a small paper back book, but a classic non-the-less. Originally I was looking for this book in hard cover, but this one fits better in our bookshelf anyway."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is my first review, extremely trite, admittedly, but about 100 pages into it, I couldn't see the point to this book. I finally gave up. Maybe I was looking for too much meaning into it. I know this is a classic, but it just didn't resonate with me."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I always hated reading in high school, until I read this book in like 11th grade. I loved it! It's pretty much my favorite book ever."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What is there to say? \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is, of course, one of the Great American Novels. My comments assume the reader is familiar with the book; if you don't want to know how it turns out, etc., don't read any further...I read it with my son; this year's High School English theme - aside from the trite \\"tolerance\\" theme that has plagued English Lit courses for years now - is apparantly \\"obsessive love,\\" because the previous title he was assigned was \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" In that work, a character named Ishmael spends years obsessing over a lost love, as Jay Gatsby does over Daisy. Well, my review of that book points out that the object of Ishmael's love, Hatsue, was no great prize... but let me tell you, Hatsue is a Living Saint compared to Daisy!Talk about a cold, unfeeling bitch: Daisy uses Gatsby for the sole purpose of making her unfaithful husband Tom jealous. She knows the full measure of Gatsby's obsessive love for her, but doesn't even bother to drop him a line after deciding to stay with Tom after all (despite having announced just the opposite a few hours earlier to everyone!). Hell, she doesn't even go to Gatsby's funeral mere days later.The circumstances of that decision - Daisy accidentally runs over Tom's mistress (I had to laugh out loud at that - figures that of all the people in the world she could hit, it would be the mistress!) while in a car alone with Gatsby - and its aftermath underscore just what a really despicable person she was. Nick Carraway (the narrator) catches a glimpse of Tom and Daisy together the evening of the accident, when Gatsby is waiting outside their house to make sure Tom isn't abusive to Daisy after her announcement that she would leave him. And what does Nick see? Why, Tom and Daisy are apparantly \\"not happy, but not unhappy.\\" Well, EXCUSE ME? Not unhappy?? Daisy just killed somebody... somebody that just happens to be Tom's lover... and, Daisy a mere few hours earlier told Tom she was leaving him for Gatby. But they've NOT \\"unhappy?!!\\"What a couple of cynical, unfeeling, uncaring, cold blooded creeps. And the mistress is not the only person they kill: as it so happens, the mistress's husband wants revenge, and Tom sics him on Gatsby (omitting the small point that it was Daisy that was driving). The book doesn't say so explicitly, but I have to wonder if Daisy wasn't aware that Tom had just sent the husband after Gatsby... and doesn't even bother to warn him - just like she doesn't even bother to show up for his funeral after said husband shoots him dead. Truly, a mind numbing, nauseating omission on her part.Truly, Gatsby spent that night \\"watching over nothing,\\" as Nick puts it.(Nick narrates that when he watched them, it appeared as though they were \\"conspiring.\\" About what? Putting blame for the accident on Gatsby? Sending the widowed husband his way? After the glimpse into the the sort of people they are, one wonders...)Nick is quite right when he narrates that Daisy and Tom were careless people that hurt others and then retreated \\"into their wealth\\" or \\"whatever it was that kept them together.\\" What a couple of miserable losers, even if they were rich.Oh, and let me add... one of the other reviewers stated that the book \\"shows signs of Fitzgerald's racism.\\"I have no idea what this reviewer means by that. In point of fact, Fitzgerald takes pains to create anti-stereotypes: A Jewish gangster - and indeed, there were WERE Jewish gangsters during the Prohibition Era - turns out to be one of the few decent people in the book. Rich black people chauffered by a white driver - what an image, for the 1920's! - make an appearance in New York City. Tom Buchanan, rich scion of a WASP patrician family turns out to be brutal, boorish, dishonest... and a racist fretting over too many non-white people. The narrator even specifically calls his racial ideas \\"stale.\\"Sorry, calling Fitzgerald racist is slanderous.This is a great book, astonishingly well written and plotted. If anyone has ever mourned a \\"lost love,\\" I think the character of Daisy is a great remedy: \\"There, but for the Grace of God\\" and all that come to mind."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I dismissed this novel back in high school as one of those indisputable books that safely sits above the reach of criticism-- a novel readers are obligated to admire because of its untouchable 'classic' status. As it turns out, it is a legitimate classic, and I consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read.I won't dispute the fact that Fitzgerald's racism sneaks into the novel, but we have to accept that the pseudoscientific basis for that racism was a part of the times (and an aristocratic trend to boot). Beneath that trivial detail there is a sea of worth to be gleaned from The Great Gatsby. It addresses a very human (and perennially American) desire to return to better and happier times of the past, and a feeling that very much embodies the 20s.The modern reader should have little trouble discerning the distasteful qualities (which appropriately only appear in Tom); racism certainly isn't condoned with any validity here. The same goes for other great American writers of the time like H.P. Lovecraft.So, give it a shot sometime when you aren't forced to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Deceptively simple...beautiful language, memorable story and characters, many layers...i've read this three times. very quick, enjoyable read. learn something new every time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Surely everything has been said before. BUT, I shall point out that if you like Gatsby, you will probably love Fitzgerald's short stories as well. Also, there are several interesting books written about F.Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda--two truly compelling people who lived somewhat reckless rock star lives long before we watched rock stars burn out on MTV reality shows."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Frank Muller was a fantastic narrator. He reads Gatsby fabulously - and I enjoy the writing very much.I've listened to this book 3 times and I have listened to many other books read by Frank Muller. Amongst these books were some of the Dark Tower series (which are fantastic). Frank is easily one of my favorite performers and was a truly great loss in the field."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a small, quick read classic novel. While many consider it to be the finest of American novels, I personally didn't find it to rank quite that high. It is however a very good book, and although I somehow did not read the book until my 30's, I can understand why it is so widely required in many high school and college courses.Mr. Fitzgerald paints a vivid picture of the \\"Jazz Age\\" of the 1920's and most of the book is centered on New York City and Long Island's North Shore. I found a lot of parallels to today throughout the book. The Great Gatsby gives a detailed development of how the never ending quest for material objects and riches can corrupt someone to their soul if a proper grounding in what is truly is important isn't present.Mr. Fitzgerald also provides excellent character development; creating characters that can be rooted for and loathed at the same time. In the end it is shown how shallow pursuits can lead to a road of destruction and dismay."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just finished reading this book for honors english class and i actually enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect so i was really surpised at how good the writing is. I agree with the reviewer who said the genius of this book is not just the story but the meanings hidden within the text. It really is extraordinary writing. You could analyze almost every sentence in this book and find a hidden or alternate meaning. The story wasn't edge of your seat action but it was still very interesting. The book really makes you think Fitzgerald was far ahead of his time. It's a book that deserves its place as one of the greatest American fiction books of all time. I would definitely recommend it to any one interested in reading a book that makes you think a little."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby along with The Sun Also Rises is one of the most alluring and fantastic portrayals of a certain time-period of thought and decadence in American history. The roaring 20s, the Jazz Age, is captured in all of it's wanton desires, greed, and debaucherous elegance. Throwing lavish parties and stopping at nothing to make his idealized relationship come true, Jay Gatsby chases his dream girl with reckless abandon. Despite the lavishness of his monetary wealth and possessions, the end produces tragic consequences, broken relationships, and broken dreams that leave the protagonists mending their emotional and physical wounds.The use of symbolism and double-meanings is truly profound as Fitzgerald creates a canopy of subtle messages of the dangers present in the pursuit of illogical desires. Much of this novel parallels Fitzerald's own tumultuous relationship with his wife Zelda and the fragments left behind from the real-life counterpart year's later are stunningly analogous to the results explored in this novel. A masterpiece of literature that continues to stimulate the mind and interest of the reader in its exploration of deep seated human foils."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'm somewhat taken aback by the number of negative reviews of a work that has a quite well-deserved reputation as a classic of American literature. Its prose may seem dated to the MTV generation, but it was certainly \\"modern\\" for its time. Treating \\"Gatsby\\" as a curious historical or sociological artifact misses all but the bare surface of the work. I recommend a careful re-reading to those who found it difficult to digest - perhaps paying more attention to how Gatsby's dream shaped what he did throughout his life, and what the final result might tell us about human nature in the context of the American ethos."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Very easy read; a book that I've always thought of reading, but just recently did.How interesting that Gatsby accumulated a fortune and styled his entire life in the hopes of regaining Daisy.I liked the symbolism of the eyes on the billboard.

Scott Fitzgerald brings forth an extra ordinary tale of love. Fitzgerald was made to write a smooth and entertaining novel such as, The Great Gatsby, which became a classic of the twentieth century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald carefully selects his characters' words as he describes the astounding and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his strong, innocent intentions as he strives to exalt his love to the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby is a tragedy amongst the wealthy and the poor. It is irresistibly melancholy but funny, while light but sensible from beginning to the end.The story depicts Gatsby's obsession with his one true love, Daisy, whether he was right or wrong to love her, his love for her robs life of all its meaning and purpose. Fitzgerald writes a phenomenal novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he embodies in every sentence is pleasurable for all readers. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become a part of the novel and connect with the characters. He writes to make his readers be aware of their imaginations, while making them picture the narration perfectly down to the very last detail. Fitzgerald creates fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can fascinate to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing once you start you just have to finish it!. The book is so dramatic and entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written.A work to remember, for I usually have trouble connecting with other books I read for Literature class. The Great Gatsby was such a breakthrough, and a good attempt to get my fascination of dramatic, and suspenseful novels into place. I highly suggest for anyone who would like to read a dreamy, classy, and an outstanding story to pick up The Great Gatsby. The story gives a new thrill of a Shakespearean story \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" with a sensational twist at the end. It proves that not every love story ends beautifully, or the way the main character would like it to, which makes Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby an even more sophisticated and like no other.This story is not like your average \\"love story\\", it gives away more than you expect. And that clearly shows how an author develops his master piece as he progresses with his writing. I am sure that many young adult readers that come across The Great Gatsby will surely enjoy reading it. It is surely a dramatic novel at it's best!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book arrived to me before I expected it, which was great! And it was in perfect shape.

I think, due to my procrastination, I had to do so just a few days before a paper on some aspect of it was due. Can't remember what the topic was, but I know I turned it in late and Dr. Johnson was not pleased. I got a \\"C,\\" I think. Now, 25 years later, I read it again at the suggestion of Robert Girardi, author of several books and a collection of short stories (\\"A Vaudeville of Devils,\\" which I liked very much - a shameless plug).Wow. Did I even read this book then? I must have done so quickly and without much attention because it was a very good novel. A bit slow at the beginning, but as I learned about the characters and their connections to one another, I had to keep reading to see how it would all end. Tragically, by the way. And you see it coming, though I wasn't expecting to end as tragically as it did. Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens...So many people lying, living in a dream world: Gatsby, holding on to a past love/infatuation, believing he can re-create it years later, with a new name, a false front and all the trappings of a cultured, wealthy young man (actually gained through criminal activity); Daisy, aware of her husband's affair with someone, yet not confronting him, and engaging in an affair of her own with Gatsby that is really doomed from the start; Myrtle, who thinks Tom loves her more than his wife, but that illusion is \\"crushed\\" along with her nose; the guests of Gatsby, attending his parties only to get drunk and have some fun, most not knowing their host and not caring if they don't, parties only held so Gatsby can see Daisy again. And then there's Nick Carraway, the narrator, a self-described \\"honest man\\" who fails to confront these illusions with the truth. He doesn't tell his cousin Daisy about the details of her husband Tom's affair. Shouldn't he have, out of love for her? And he never really confronts Gatsby about his fantasy about re-connecting with Daisy, the long-lost love of his youth. Couldn't he have \\"talked some sense into him,\\" again, if he really cared about Gatsby? And when they all have it out at the hotel in NYC, why doesn't Nick call Tom on the carpet about his second life with Myrtle, as Tom is attacking Gatsby for his affair with Daisy? Finally, Nick could have told Wilson the truth about Myrtle and Tom after the accident, so Wilson's rage and desire for revenge would have not been misplaced. He could also have told the police that it was Daisy, not Gatsby, who was driving the car, and that it was Tom that was having an affair with Wilson's wife. Tom and Daisy make off like bandits, though not without scars, the illusion of their marriage apparently safe and sound; Myrtle and Wilson and Gatsby all experience the ultimate fantasy killer, death. Even Gatsby's dad is allowed to believe that he had a good boy, a smart boy, a successful boy. And Nick doesn't shatter his illusion. Out of compassion? Fear? Indifference? Speak up Nick; have some courage. You're \\"one of the most honest people you know.\\" So tell the truth to the people around you and maybe you can help them face reality and have better, honest lives, even if the price is the death of their fantasies and pretense. Your silence helped kill these people, in a way.My two cents. Dr. Johnson, are you out there? I read it for real this time. What do you think? The makings of a decent paper?Mike Haigerty"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I consider myslelf well read. I bought this book knowing it was a classic (I love classics).

The way mister Wolfheim was portrayed (a shady selfish businessmen) is an obvious anti-semantic stereotype. I couldn't get myself into the story because the characters were unlikable.

They both go over the interesting characters that at some point merge to become a conflicting story of right and wrong. Wait, isn't that the main storyline for almost all books. I guess they seemed more alike since I read them back to back. Well, The Great Gatsby did seem to be on the verge of all of the modern convienences of the 1920's. I wonder if changing cultures brings about different thoughts on the definition of a classic book. This book was a so-so read and wasn't real captivating.

Sure, it's been heaped with praise since the critics of the mid-1920s were thinking about worshipping a new messiah. But let's face it: their enthusiasm was on the right mark.The Great Gatsby is a swift, gorgeously written story about people we don't seem to have anything in common with. These are confused, wandering, sub-stratispheric members of an even more deeply ingrained sub-culture that, for the modern reader, also has no bearing on anyone they will ever encounter. And yet the prose and the narrative force of this novel imbues these alien characitures with the sweet and stunning glow of life. They transform into very human beings caught up in much of the youthful pain and torment of anyone who ever dreamed of success. It is a tragic, heart-rending story of broken-hearts and insincere love as well as an epic portrait of nearly an entire generation of people embodied in the character of their greatest ambitions. This book soars higher and higher with the passage of time and continues to force students, sometimes, to realize that they can enjoy reading a novel.A wonderful, extraordinary book that tends to stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Age, was a very American response to World War I. Until 1917, America had kept her distance from the commotion on the European continent, and it was indeed the Great War that pushed America out of her hesitant isolation and onto the world scene. The tremendous moral confusion and psychological disillusionment thus unleashed by America's involvement in the gruesome war of attrition hailed a new generation of artists. F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the most prominent writers to have emerged from this generation of artists, framed his generation's struggle in The Great Gatsby. By placing his protagonist in the midst of Long Island, NY's dazzling elite and glamorous parties, Fitzgerald presents to us a son of the Jazz Age whose post-WWI pursuit of the \\"short-winded elations of men\\" is so characteristic of that era. But Gatsby, a decorated hero from the indecisive battlefields of WWI and also a fabulously rich man, is not a character whom Fitzgerald intends for the readers to admire. Instead, Fitzgerald hints that there is a considerable distance between the man that Gatsby is and the man he is capable of being. Thus it appears only ironic that Fitzgerald should choose to title his novel The GREAT Gatsby. But in the wake of America's political readjustment on the world scene and internal social shift, Gatsby comes to symbolize an age of great aspirations that ended in hollow grandeur. And as a protagonist who successfully embodies \\"an unbroken series of successful gestures\\", Gatsby captures Fitzgerald's own great vision of a complacent American society, numbed by shallow pleasures, and ultimately betrayed by the very dream of greatness his generation hoped to achieve.Intrigued yet? Read the novel and find that green light beyond the foul dust of all that's tangible. Welcome to the world of Jay Gatsby."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged audio version of The Great Gatsby. I have started listening to the audio version of books, that I may never get time to read, on my drive to and from work each day.I have to say that while listening to &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; I actually loved driving to and from work. The commute was the best part of the day and strangely I was actually glad when I got caught in traffic.F. Scott Fitzgerald's writting style and use of words was beautiful and the story was very interesting as well. I found the Great Gatsby's desire and methods to reunite with the lost love from his past quite touching. The last page of the book was so well written I kept rewinding the tape and listening to it again and again.Don't ask me why I am not giving it five stars. It was close to five, but just did not make it, and I can't quite put my finger on it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway is an unsuspecting Long Island-dweller living in a small house that is sandwiched between mansions. Through two old acquaintances, Tom Buchanan and his wife, Daisy, he learns that one of his neighbors is the rich, extravagant Jay Gatsby, who soon invites him to one of the periodic late night parties on his property. At this party, he befriends Gatsby and soon becomes intertwined in his story. He finds that Gatsby's money was earned through illicit methods, and sees his friend's incongruously idealistic character. Finally, he watches as Gatsby is confronted by his past in the form of Daisy Buchanan.During WWI, five years before the events recounted in The Great Gatsby took place, Jay Gatsby was a soldier stationed in Louisville. There, he met Daisy, and in his romanticism, he believed that it was everlasting, mutual love at first sight. Four years later, when Gatsby discovered Daisy's marriage, he moved to Long Island, where his past lover and her husband were now residing.We see Jay Gatsby's incredible idealism, inharmonious with the rest of his character, which is, to me, the most significant characterization in the entire novel. It is the one aspect of the story that allows the reader to keep reading, feeling that everything might be eventually work out. How Gatsby hopes against hope, believes against belief, that Daisy, after five years, still loves him, is a tribute to the human spirit. His complete confidence during his confrontation with Tom Buchanan shows the incredible ability within us all to trust in a reflection of the past. It makes us all Gatsby's friends, makes us hope with him, wish with him, have faith in him. Gatsby's romanticism makes readers aspire to or even believe that they have this incredible love of \\"a green light at the end of the dock\\", a symbol of the hope that has been lost and yet is still there.I would recommend this book to everyone, although some slight racism and sexism common at the time the novel was written may discourage sensitive readers. The literary style and word usage is, for lack of a better description, incredible, and the book's plotting is superb. The Great Gatsby realistically portrays both the best and the worst of human attributes and allows any reader to identify with the characters, no matter how far-fetched this might seem. F. Scott Fitzgerald's book is the epitome of American literary accomplishment and a must read for any serious booklover."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I gave Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby a shot recently outside of school. There are both things I love about the book and things that I found a little tedious. On the positive side, I enjoyed the social insight, the lyricism, the story in general. Fitzgerald was truly blessed with the gift of words, and the use of imagery gives this classic much staying value. It is just so real it comes alive in your head. The story of Jay Gatsby, who has grown wealthy (on the shady side of the law as it turns out) and his love for Daisy Buchanan is still affecting today. I disliked how it took a while for the story to get really moving, it was a little tedious sometimes. But don't let that spoil it for you. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recall one of my friends complaining about our English course cirriculum and its obstinate emphasis on mediocre American Literature. Upon finishing &quot;Gatsby&quot; this semester, he said it was the first book by an American author he found to be unequivocally beautiful. Fitzgerald, in his classic novel about Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, and the American Dream, not only delivers a message with which every American can identify, but writes with such an amazing lyricallity that at times I simply had to stop reading to visualize the beautiful descriptions he gives in the novel. This book is a classic; a must have for anyone who was not fortunate enough to read it while still in school, but even those who did should own a copy."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is one of those novels that I love to come back to and reread. It's really a writers' textbook that teaches by example how to extend, invent, and use language in new and effective ways. For it's a rare book that gets this amount of meaning into a sentence and it's a rare book that has the dimensions and extraordinary intensity of impression that its paragraphs carry. Scenes blaze with life and it all goes by so fast I always end up with the feeling that I have finished a short story not a book. In Gatsby Fitzgerald is more in command and control than he is in all his other novels put together including The Last Tycoon, Tender is the Night, The Beautiful and the Damned, and This Side of Paradise. Gatsby is a novel with few false moves, a simple story and a simple plot. One might say almost perfect in structural simplicity, but the meanings are complex creating the suggestion that there is more, much more, under the surface, which incidentally there is. Part of the subtext is brought out by rich symbolism. Who will ever forget the weird eyes of T.J. Eckleburg looking over the wasteland of ash and what that means? Who will ever forget the green light at the end of Daisy's dock and what that means? If you haven't read this classic of twentieth-century literature, please read it. If you have read it, you might profit by going back after you have matured some more and rereading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a novel that breeds contrasting opinions from readers throughout. That is definitely a sign of a great, classic piece ofliterature. If a novel was written and full of adulation and honour, it would not be a good book, because human thinking seeks entertainment and the literal sense of words, therefore a book that is both loved and hated at the same time proves to be one which offends and intrigues audineces in such a vast, drastic way, that its ablty to do this makes itself a masterpiece. The myriad themes in this novel are what sets it apart from all others. The rise and fall of the American Dream is portrayed in which we can all see the rise and fall of success in our lives and forces us to think whether we should proceed with our lives, living in superficiality and materialism as Daisy and Tom did. The passion and obsessive love that Gatsby hold for Daisy is unrecognizable today, and it brings a sort of mystery and wonderment of what it could be should it be refelcted at present. The Great Gatsby is based upon equality, socail discrimination and our human ideals. It revolves around what we perceive is important, happiness or materialism and while we go about careless of others and absorbed by ourselves, what are we trying to prove? God is in fact watching us and as we try to achieve success and beconme happy using guidelines other than those of reaching the genuine American Dream, we are doomed to failure. This book is touching.... read it... do not expect excitement... look for depth, meaning, symbolism and those lessons that could change your perspective of the world."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had to read this book for school. I really enjoyed it and would like to recommend it to anyone who has a dream. The book is very clear and I only had a minor problem with the vocabulary which I found a bit difficult. Apart from that, on the one hand I was very happy to finish reading the book because it was extremely interesting but, on the other hand, I was sad because I had got involved myself with the characters and now I \\"miss\\" them. It is important to know what the book is about in order to know why everyone admires its beauty. Fitzgerald wrote this novel as an example of the famous \\"American Dream\\". The story is based on a man who has devoted his life to the fulfillment of his platonic conception of himself. Jay Gatsby had chosen Daisy to incarnate this dream, but nothing would be easy for him. The book's plot is well developed and suspense is kept till the last chapter. Moreover, many of you will feel identified with one of the characters and will not regret at all having read \\"The Great Gatsby\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was very reluctant in reading this book for my Honors English class. I had heard from many people that is was really boring. As it turns out, it's one of the best books I have ever read. It's well written, a good story, haunting symbolism, and a good read. The beginning is slow but as you learn more and more, everything falls into place. Recommended to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby took about a month to ship, barely sliding in under the deadline. When it arrived, there was a tear in the front top of the cover. I was not impressed by both the quality of the product and the speed of the service."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought The Great Gatsby was an ok book. I didn't like how the whole time people were just sleeping around and not acomplishing anything. I also didn't like how Gatsby only held such partys because he was trying to impress someone. I think people need to be themselves and not revolve their life around other peoples lifes. I didn't like at the end how WIlson thought it was Gatsby who was having an affair with his wife and he killed him. The whole book was a mess and very boring. When you thought it would get exciting it didn't."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I was going to high school, I determined that no matter how good or how poor the book, I would always read the English novel assigned to us twice. I was assigned F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in grade 11. And after reading it over, I concluded that if Mr. Fitzgerald's personality was reflected in his characters, it is quite understandable that Zelda Fitzgerald ended up in an asylum (sp?). That book was the poorest excuse for literature I ever had the displeasure of reading. I did read it twice, but each time, I was disgusted with it. The characters in the story were worthless wastes of human flesh. Daisy was a ditz, Gatsby himself was a possessive stalker and everyone else didn't have enough brains to realize that they were all being used!!Tom, Daisy's idiot husband, actually took Nick to meet Tom's mistress! How much more stupid is that? Yes, I'm sure everyone with a brain cell wants his wife's family to know he's having an affair. And his mistress, well, all she wanted was to seem important, when everyone knew she wasn't.Nick was used by everyone, but he did nothing about it. Tom used him, Daisy used him and even Gatsby used him. And all the while, he thought Gatsby was God. He worshiped him.I wrote my report on the novel and passed it into my professor. I wish I still had a copy of it, because I would post it here. Unfortuneatly, I do not.In the end, I would recommend this book only to the person who likes to read about stupid people sleeping with each other just to seem important. Or as a cure for insomnia (sp?). I was greatly disgusted with this novel, but that's just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was astounded that one other person rated this book as lowly as I did--I thought that all sense had completely drained out of the world.Walking into a room of pseudo-intellectuals and proclaiming &quot;Gatsby sucks!&quot; isn't the best idea these days, it seems. But crimony. Read the thing. I've read the thing. I don't understand what the big deal is about. This isn't good prose. It's self-help. It's also pretty insulting. How agonizingly elementary does symbolism have to be before a reader realizes that the author has taken him for a fool? Fitzgerald writes with all the subtlety of a locomotive. He sounds like he's trying way too hard, and in the end, what was intended as verbal sweep and style reads as tackiness. &quot;Gatsby&quot; is the work of a bad juggler--it would have been so much better if he'd tried fewer balls. (If you want to see a man drop twenty metaphors on a page and actually get away with it, thanks to God-given writing genius, read Shakespeare or Robert Penn Warren's &quot;All the King's Men.&quot;)What we have here is a book that for some strange reason has been ranked for all time with &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I think it's enough to acknowledge that Hemingway, Faulkner, and Steinbeck weren't the only American writers of their day--there was also a lightweight pretender named F. Scott--and move on. Gertrude Stein was around in those days, too, and Hemingway couldn't stand her, either. One star--actually make that one green light."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't know why i hate this book so much but i do. I'd give it negative infinity stars if i could.This era is not boring, but this author is! There is no possibility off me ever caring about the characters, the reliance on symbolism and the intense feeling of \\"I'm writing something important! Pay attention damn you, and how dare you not like my work!\\" In the place of true character and plot development makes this book so dull that I feel the only thing it's good for is inspiring the sandman.The prose is mediocre at best, contrary to popular opinion of 5 star reviewers, one can be smart and still hate this book. No, I don't read goosebumps, never could get into them.If anything, this book is twilight without the vampires, which by the way is an equally horrendous affront to intelligent readers.My favorite books tend to be fantasy or sci-fi, though I did like Huckleberry Finn, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found deadline by Chris Crutcher insightful, and enjoyable.I don't need a book about the treachery of stupid rich people who are only friends because of money, back stabbing at the slightest perceived insult, masked by story of foolish lust which resulted in a mediocre affair, it's beyond dull, it's an insult to writing. And I already know that humans freed from pursuit of basic needs, and without some balance or check, devolve into petty, egotistical, self-absorbed jerks.If this book is a classic because it's a story about choosing ones friends wisely then fails miserably, if it's about the stupidity of lust and affairs and their danger, then again, it fails to adequately convey the point to young adults who are required to read this and draw such conclusions without the necessary insight or life experience to read between the lines and dullness of the fictional tale of foolishness woven here.There are authors who have managed to convey such points much more eloquently, clearly, and in far more interesting ways. At this point history itself would be able to convey such points in a superior fashion and with greater frequency. Hah, stories in the old-testament bible about Saul, David, and Solomon would convey the point better.If you read James Cleavland's review of this crime against the united states and humanity in general i think he may have hit a few reason why i dislike this book so much. http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C16SDV4PXLR4/"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read The Great Gatsby for school in my American Lit. class, and I never wanted to come home and read it. Fitzgerald uses to much symbolism and to many big words, so it keeps you from being focused on the plot. I don't reccomend this book to anyone, expecially to any teenagers."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Even though I'am in 10th grade and was forced to read this i still think it was bad. The beginning started out way to slow and i already hated it. Then i just goes into a bunch of affairs that are happening in the 1920's. Then when Daisy runs over Myrtle you knew Gatsby was in trouble. I think this book was too much like a soap opera. I did not like it at all. But then again I'm in 10th grade."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby contained nothing more than can be found in a TV soap opera. All of the characters where one sided and underdeveloped. The book makes a poor attempt at exploring human nature, which pales in comparison to great novels such as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. It was one of the most boring and shallow books that I have ever read"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The fact that some of the 5-star reviews for this book claim that those of us who do not like it \\"don't get\\" literature is just rude. Also, the fact that anyone would rank this book next to Faulkner, Woolf, Joyce, etc. offends me deeply. But that is your opinion, and you have every right to it.As many have said, this book is immature. It takes a fairly basic outline (long-lost love, people cheating on spouses, an \\"outsider\\" comes in and has no true responsibilities) and throws in some symbolism that any high school student could conjure and then acts pretentious (which is probably why so many people like it, because they think it makes them look good). And that is all. I know that many people claim that was how it was in the 1920s, but please, no other piece of \\"literature\\" I have ever read has come off so shallow.But back to those who act like not appreciating it means that you do not know much about reading. That is just inconsiderate. I truly hate this book, but if you like it, fine, I'll argue with you about it (and the fact that I've had to read three times now for school as an English major means I know quite a bit about it) until I faint. However, this does not mean that I will write you off and not listen to any of your other opinions. Because once someone did this to me when I told them I truly disliked \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and then they sarcastically asked what my favorite book was, expecting me to say something in popular fiction like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". And, at the time, it was \\"Crime and Punishment\\" from my Russian Literature course. Furthermore, if this book is The Great American Novel, then American Literature is pathetic when standing next to most other countries, including Russia."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I always can find something good about a book, no matter how bad it is. The Great Gatsby, however, is probably one of the only books I've read that I hate.It is the story of a man who, basically, talks about nothing. The plot is nonexistent, just the ramblings of a man who's confused about society. The characters are either boring or not developed enough. The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great, dramatic, thought-provoking ending, and nothing happens at the end. When I finished, I was left with the feeling of &quot;Okay, what was that all about?&quot; I can understand that it is a reflection of the 1920s, but certainly not a very good reflection.This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read. If there is anything else at all, read that instead."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book took me by surprise. The first two chapters didn't really get me into the book, and I found myself feeling awkward as I followed a seemingly pointless beginning. But, trust me, it's worth it. The book took off and left me gasping for air. The Great Gatsby is truly a modern day tragedy, and a very well written one at that. As the story progresses, you get drawn into the conflicts and the characters. You feel bad for some characters, feel angry at others, and become all the more attached to the words that Fitzgerald has written. This is a book that, once it takes off, you cannot put down. Not that it's intense, but that it's involving. It's depressing, but amazing at the same time. Truly a masterpiece of literature that everyone should read at least once!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"That quote sums up the book for me.I don't think I would have appreciated this book as a young person. Now, however, I understand the folly of chasing castles in the sky. In Gatsby you see a man who could have done so much but wasted his precious life chasing an illusion. Daisy embodied everything he thought he wanted: beauty, wealth, and a name. Yet we see (and I don't think Gatsby ever understood) that it was all a mirage. For all of their wealth and breeding, Daisy and Tom were vapid, shallow, cruel people who deserved each other.Anyone unfortunate enough to enter their sphere would be crushed and cast aside."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was a memorable way to \\"read\\" the F.

Thank God for Amazon and it's incredible books at reasonable prices. Amazon makes reading the classics easy, accessible and affordable. What more could I ask for?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Ah, THE GREAT GATSBY. The defining novel of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's masterpiece. The Great American Novel. I first read this in High School and then again in a College course called \\"Literature of the Jazz Age\\" which also featured Hemingway'sA Moveable Feast. Hem and Scott were friends who despised one another. Hem once crushed a glass in his bare hand and in a fit of machismo said, \\"Scott can you do that?\\" Fitzgerald answered, \\"Hem, you're such an @$$40/#.\\" Hem, on his side, thought Scott was a \\"powder puff.\\"Having re-read it several times since, I'll say that THE GREAT GATSBY is great. It is a beautifully crafted prose poem in which every word serves a purpose; there's no excess here.If you haven't read it, it is the story of Jay Gatsby, a Long Island millionaire who is hopelessly in love with Daisy, married to Tom Buchanan, as told to us through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who watches as their insular world unravels.Almost everybody who dislikes this book seems to focus on the negativity of the characters. They miss the point. The characters ARE negative and shallow by design: Tom is cruel, Daisy is a b**ch, Jordan is vapid, and Jay is a phony. They aren't supposed to be likeable. THE GREAT GATSBY's only sympathetic character is Nick. If you read this book carefully, you'll see that this is Carraway's autobiography. Notice that Carraway walks away from all the false glitter of Gatsby's time, leaving behind all the wreckage the others have caused.Another huge complaint I see in the reviews is how BORING the book is, and how impenetrable it seems. The atmosphere of the story is one of stultifying heaviness. With all their money, the characters have no idea how to exist, much less live and thrive. At one point Daisy asks a general question about having plans with friends, \\"What do people plan?\\" Jay, Daisy, Tom and the others are suffocating, and it is a mark of this book's excellence that that airlessness impacts the reader. Some readers may, however, find it a slog.Is Carraway Fitzgerald? Very possibly. As a younger man, he fell in love with his future wife, the less-than-stable Zelda, and suffered through her various crazinesses. He strove to impress her and satisfy her endless wants (much like Gatsby with Daisy). THE GREAT GATSBY (originally titled AMONG THE ASH-HEAPS AND THE MILLIONAIRES) is in part a recounting of his own maturation.AMENDED REVIEW 10/7/10"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"First and foremost, this is a great book. Anyone who enjoys literature will fall in love with Fitzgerald's examined manipulation of the English language that can be called nothing else but art. Every word speaks volumes in this tale of minimal pages but endless emotions. It is a book to be savored and one that continues to get better with age."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have heard it said that English is not a beautiful sounding language and that American prose in particular seems tone-deaf. I submit that people that say these things have never read Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"But if the beautiful sentences were simply that, the book would not work on the deeper level that gripped me within a couple pages. There has been criticism of, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" that its overly romantic but I think the book is tapping into something more than that. It embodies and presents the American yearning for identity which is part wealth, part status, part beauty and part awe. This yearning goes beyond anything attainable and into the dangerous realm of self-delusion to which even someone as strong and decent as Gatsby succumbs.Gatsby isn't a tragic hero because want he seeks isn't monumental - the adulterous love of Daisy but the way he pursues her is heroic because it consumes his whole life. Everything he is and does is aimed at gaining access to the social strata in which she lives. And the novel shows that elite society to be superficial, empty and thoughtless but Gatsby can't see that because he is so consumed with obtaining Daisy.And someone could write an entire dissertation (and probably several people have) on the role of the automobile in Great Gatsby. When the book was written in 1923-24, the automobile was just on its way to becoming mainstream. They weren't a luxury but neither had they yet become commonplace. Fitzgerald was able to see the car not just as a symbol of his character's reckless disregard but as embodying both the rush to freedom and the ugly ruin of American life. The ash heaps and haunting eyes staring out from of the Dr. T.J. Eeckleburg billboard is where autos refill and where a pedestrian is run over by Gatsby's car. The automobile allowed the characters impulsively decide to drive to New Yok City for drinks they don't even consume but to do so they must travel through industrial and commercial blight. Isn't this the devil's bargain we have all surrendered to?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"4 stars means: It was a great book and I would recommend it to almost anyone.This novel best epitomizes the 1920s in New York and the U.S. as a whole. Although it starts moderately slow, as a lot of 'classics' sometimes do, at least to the modern reader, it is a engaging read with genuinely interesting and extremely complex characters.On the characters: Few novels manage to create this depth of personality in such a large number of characters over so few pages. You come to, if not like, at least be interested in the fate of everyone in the novel. Although there are very few people you could honestly root for this becomes part of the fun of the book.The party scene is a seminal moment in fiction. It is one of the best captured moments through so few words.The prose is not fluffy but well crafted and meaningful. Fitzgerald manages to illuminate deeper issues in the plot through brilliant diction and subtle analogies.This and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are the only works of Fitzgerald which I have read, but both have made me want to enjoy more of them. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good, but not to easy, read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This class novel was mandatory reading material sophomore and senior year of High School, but I continued to read this book through out college in my leisure time bc I love it so much.Such a good story"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"doesn't matter how many times you read it, F. Scott Fitzgerald knows how to write a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've just reread THE GREAT GATSBY for the first time since high school. It's amazing we had to read it in high school. How could a teenager understand all this stuff about adultery and materialism? I remember my eleventh grade teacher said that F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;wasn't a first rate writer, but he was a very good second rate writer.&quot; Even in eleventh grade, I found that horrific. Why labor at all to write a book in the first place, pouring all your life blood into writing what would become a 20th century classic, just to have some high school English teacher dub you &quot;a very good second rate writer&quot;?In my English teacher's defense, we were a very trying class. She was trying to get us to elucidate the symbolic meaning in the scene where Jay Gatsby stands on his dock and stares at the green light across the water. She said, &quot;The dock scene . . . what comes to your mind?&quot; The jocks who sat in the back of the class yelled, &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock.&quot; The poor woman literally banged her head into the brick wall of our classroom.Rereading THE GREAT GATSBY all these years later, I am struck with how fresh and utterly relevant it is. In essence, it isn't dated at all. What happened in West Egg in the Long Island Sound in 1923 could just as well have happened in Silicon Valley in the Dot Com Nineties. There are many Jay Gatsbys. Fitzgerald created an essential American archetype with Jay Gatz, the boy from North Dakota who wanted to reinvent himself and turn himself into something grand, based on the dreams he had for his life when he was 17. We catch a poignant glimpse of him as a thirty-year-old man who woos and impresses his long lost love with his swank mansion and his English tailored shirts. All glitter and glamour, the most important thing is that gaudy surface and facade that dazzles the eye. It says a lot about our culture, about the quintessential American dream."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've probably read this book 3 times, listened to it on audio tape once, and read it aloud while on a car trip. What can you say about such a powerful and classic book, a book that has come to be symbolic of the Jazz Age with all of its excess and smarmy decadence? The enigmatic and subtly evil Jay Gatsby, self-made man and millionaire, and his passion for Daisy, the wife of the man who lives across the bay from him, are at the center of this novel, which is told from the point of view of Nick, an occasional guest and neighbor on East Egg, who is able to tell the story, eventually, with some degree of detachment and cynicism. There is the inevitability of a Greek drama to the cadences and pacing of The Great Gatsby, a tragedy lying in wait for all involved.Exquisite and spare prose, tight plot, and wonderful characters. It's as good as a novel gets."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"How this is an American classic, I will never know. The book is short and barely has any character development. You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself. The book does do an ok job of portraying that \\"rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation\\" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic. There is one part of the book that has some \\"action\\" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable. For those that poo-poo Twilight for \\"stalker\\" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well. I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book. The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as \\"Wuthering Heights\\".

As another reviewer mentioned, it is even better to read later in life, even if you read it back in school, it will 'land' differently now.The story is timeless and very American. The self created master of the universe, still looking out and coveting from his gilded perch.We live in a world full of greedy strivers and wannabes, grasping for success at all costs and often achieving it; who create their identities out of whole cloth, and who we then look up to admiringly, unaware of any seedy backstory.This book is as contemporary now as it was almost 90 years ago when it was written, and probably will continue to be, so long as humans continue to be the greedy schemers they have been to date!And it is written so beautifully. Fitzgerald would be enjoying his renaissance and he deserves it, as his own life was as full of tragedy as it was glitter and praise."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is still one of my favorite books.

I wanted to get reacquainted with it before the movie comes out and I'm so glad that I did. When I was younger, I was so enamored by the lavish, 20's lifestyle that these characters lived- almost as if I was an outsider invited to tag along with them, just like our narrator, Nick. Reading it now, I have a much more skeptical but mature reaction. I felt sad for how lonely and stuck all of these characters were in their life choices. The only person who was able to realize this early on, and know when to say when, was Nick.While ultimately a sad story, I really did enjoy it and happy that I reintroduced myself to Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a classic and when I read it I instantly knew why.The writing is poetic and so are the characters.I had been meaning to read this for a long time and jumped on it when it went on sale.

This book takes you on a journey through what is right and wrong, good and evil and the blurred lines that exist in that mindset."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby written by F.Scott Fitzgerald is set during the marvelous and provocative age of the Jazz era. It is a story that follows the journey of a young man Nick Carraway who moves into a neighborhood in Long Island and is a neighbor to the eccentric powerful Gatsby. Nick has a cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who he goes visits and meets her husband Tom along with beautiful Jordan Baker. Every night Nick is amazed to see his neighbors' popularity and hear about his infamous parties. One night, he is surprised to find out the Gatsby has personally invited him to one of his entertaining parties. After going to Gatsby's parties many nights he was unsuccessful at meeting him until one night he sparks an interesting conversation with a young man who turns out to be Jay Gatsby. One afternoon Nick had lunch with Miss. Baker who admits to him that Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy. Gatsby's intension was to confess his long lost love to Daisy and win her over like he had done five years before. After Gatsby's reunites with Daisy they decide to proclaim their love to Tom, but obstacles keep them from being together.In this book there are many themes that coincide to make an interesting story that turns out to be a tragedy. Love, greed, money, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal are all human attributes that are subtly sporadic throughout the novel. Gatsby represented money and ambition and determination along with love while the woman he loved represented greed and betrayal. Gatsby did everything in his power to get his love while Daisy was undetermined to what she wanted and whom she truly loved. The love interest between Nick and Miss. Baker ends in a unsettled dispute because of betrayal and jealousy. All the characters in the Great Gatsby are tied to these rudiments in one form or the other.These elements combined gave The Great Gatsby a great ending and made reading it worth while. Although extremely slow paced in the beginning for my taste, I was intrigued by about page 100, it satisfied me by the end. It was a surprising tragic ending that made every boring page before was worth reading. Ever since I started high school I had heard about this book and it's elegant style of the 1920's, I was extremely disappointed when I started reading it because it was nothing what it was hyped up to be. I gave the reading 3 stars because half of the book was extremely boring to me but the other half was extremely well written and thought out. I would recommend this book to any one of my friends if they have the patience to a slow start but a great ending."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book only because I had to for a literature class...this book may be good for some. I have to talked with friends and things that have said that they enjoy it, however I had a hard time getting into it!However a side from all of that! It gives a great depiction of the Rolling 20's and the shallowness of all people. I would recomend it to someone who loves to read about 10 books a week and wouldn't mind wasting their time to read one more. But as for me I didn't care for it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am not certain why this book is considered a classic. There's not one likeable character to relate to. Selfish, self-involved, shallow people. The first half was rough going to read through. The second half, a little better. I found this very disappointing after hearing for so long that it was a must-read. So many other more special books to spend one's time with."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the unfortunate case of the reputation making the novel, rather than the other way around. I found \\"the Great Gatsby\\" very dissapointing. Its said to be the greatest American novel of all time, yet I found it largely uninteresting and poorly written (in light of its reputation, that is). The characters are not dymanic, and the novel's apparent focus -- that the wealthy, petty, aloof inhabitants of both East and West Egg are interchangeable -- is made evident during the first chapter. The novel centers on a host of blase characters - Gatsby chief among them -- whose lavish parties are attended by strangers, and whose funerals are attended by nobody.This is not the \\"Great American Novel\\" - actually, its far too short to qualify as a NOVEL. Novella, maybe. Limerick, more like it. only limericks are at least amusing.Theme One: Old money, new money, the perceived difference in the have's and have more's. Whether East Egg, West Egg or Fried Egg, its nothing more than a distinction without difference. I found the same message in Dr. Seusss's story of the Sneeches - and at least that rhymed.Theme 2: You can't escape the past. Thanks, Nostradummy. The past repeats itself. Much like Fitzgerald's tired themes and characters.Theme 3: Love = jealousy. There is no great romance here. This much is evident when Gatsby admits to Daisy that it is not her love that he desires, but for to have loved no other, even in the past. The much-lauded green light at the end of the dock? Just another symbol of petty jealousy, not the sign of \\"hope\\" as some commentators believe.But is not the bland characters that make this novel unworthy of its reputation; it is the fact that the characters are fully fleshed out by page 20, and remain static throughout the remainder of the novel. Read Dr. Seuss instead. You'll read the same themes in the same amount of time, and if you're going to write on the level of a 6-year-old, you may as well do it intentionally."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great GatsbyPublished in 1925, The Great Gatsby had a certain amount of success, fulfilling F. Scott Fitzgerald's expectations and promoting an authorial pride within him. Years later, while being read by a different generation, Fitzgerald's novel exclaims a different effect. With a tense plot and extreme characters, The Great Gatsby produces a complete grip upon its readers but as the character moves through his summer complications, one can witness Fitzgerald's desperation to create a novel.Set in Long Island, New York, F. Scott introduces a decent but uninteresting man, Nick Caraway, who decides to visit a second cousin but instead, becomes entangled in the past, present and future interactions of this woman's life. By not emphasizing Nick's personality, Fitzgerald helps the reader to focus on everyone else's. The second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, endures a pressured marriage as he commits adultery. Aware of her husband's disloyalty, Daisy only bothers to disguise her knowing. This opens the novel to theories of immoral behaviour and irony. For Nick's neighbour, Jay Gatsby, happens to be the past love of Daisy and is set on returning her to himself. F. Scott. gives his title character an obsessive yet submissive personality that revolves around Mrs. Buchanan. At certain points within the novel, this can become an annoyance. Gatsby's persistence on obtaining Daisy's affection only causes him damage. Such a plot can induce a reaction from the reader which deserves some praise until Fitzgerald forgets to place a period.Eventually the novel climaxes with tension and complication. Had Fitzgerald not involved such a tense plot with his writing, the novel would've been an actual bore. His constant babbling and unnecessary explanations can lead one into a deep sleep. Though he was unable to write without ranting on, Fitzgerald does deserve to be complimented on his diversion of personality and East Egg versus West Egg (old rich vs. new) dilemma; a diversion from the all too cliched rich vs. poor. Unfortunately the ending suffers most because it was too verbose. Fitzgerald leaves no suspense, which to some can be a good thing, but it takes too long to get to the results of the climactic events, thus one slowly becomes disappointed.The Great Gatsby is an otherwise decent novel; not to be called a great American classic, rather a book good when produced during its time. Fitzgerald had struggled in his production and caused ruin to the word format. His ideas, however, were of good enough quality, maybe what suffices for it to be called a great novel; then again, Bukowski also holds that title."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yeah right.I know this is a &quot;classic&quot; and a required read for any person not spending their life under a rock but quite frankly, its terribly overrated.This tale of the &quot;American Dream&quot; is really nothing more than people who will do anything they can to get rich.It's a tale of snobby people during the jazz age and all their affairs and problems.Just because a book is consideed a classic doesn't make it good.I'm very sorry if I have offeneded anyone who read and enjoyed this book but I don't see what the big deal is.A waste of time and money, please don't read this unless your one of those old people who never smile and drink little cups of tea with their pinky sticking out.In the words of the mighty Dennis Miller &quot;That's just my opinion, I could be wrong...&quot; But I'm not."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott FitzgeraldFor my report I really didn't know what book to read, I asked around and one answer I got was to read the Great Gatsby. The person I asked had said they had never read the book but it was a really good movie. Since I have heard of this book before because it was a classic I decided to read it and I have to say I was not at all impressed. I decided that maybe the movie would improve on things, but I soon realized that this also was not all it was cracked up to be.I thought that the book's basic plot was really good and interesting, but the problem with the book was that it didn't always follow the basic plot. This book was about a past love between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Duchanan trying to rekindle itself many years later, but there is only one problem, Daisy is already married to a man who is cheating on her with a girl from New York. Yes this sounds very intriguing, and it is, but this was only the story for a little more that half the book. The other half was the cousin of Daisy, Nick Carraway (teller of the story) telling about a party he went to, or what his backyard looked like, or the weather that day. What I am saying is that the tangents Nick went off on took away from the attention of what was really going on in the story.The fact that it was told by Nick was a weird point of view to lay the story out at. It is difficult to tell a love story from the point of view from neither of the lovers. You can never really tell what they're thinking, which either adds to the suspense of the story or, takes away a lot of detail.The book also left so many unanswered questions, one in particular being: where did Gatsby get all his money? He said that it was inherited from a man he was with at sea who died, but later tells us that most of it was wasted in the panic of the war. All we can infer is that he was gaining all this money through something illegal; drugs maybe, but never really know exactly what he was doing. This is not to say this is a bad book completely, just a very slow paced book in which most action takes place the last 70 pages about. This book is more for people who are into quiet romance novels and are very patient in their reading, in other words, for people who aren't me. Even though it seems like I spent the last paragraph trashing the book I would like to make it clear that I didn't hate it, I just didn't really like it either. It did have its moments though, just not as many as I would have liked.The movie didn't improve on things. It mirrored the book exactly, scene by scene. I can honestly say I don't think they had a sentence out of place. It is like, if you saw the movie, you practically read the book. Not like in other movies such as \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" where once you've seen it, you still don't know what the books about. This really surprised me because for such a short book (189 pages) it was a long movie (2 hours and so). This was mainly because of how much they stuck to the book, which I think wasn't the smartest thing to do. I think some of the scenes they included where a little stretched out rather than just getting to the point. Like the scene where Daisy and Gatsby meet again for the first time in many years. They just sat there for a while, then walked around a bit and talked in a very drone voice.This brings me to another case about the movie, the acting. The parts of Daisy and Jordan (a good friend of Daisy and Nick) were very either over dramatized or under dramatized. Daisy is supposed to be calm, with a soothing voice. Instead they made her constantly shaking and her voice always in a quiver. The part of Jordan, who was supposed to be jaunty and full of life, walked slowly and spoke with a monotone voice. The movie did however clear up a few parts in the book that were confusing to me. When I read a certain part I didn't really understand what had just happened but the movie is able to show you rather than just describing it.In conclusion for those of you who enjoy faster paced books, this isn't for you. I would recommend this to romance readers who are very patient with their reading. This book is obviously not for everybody but I have asked more people and got good responses about this book so all I can say now is read at your own risk."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I know many people consider this book to be a great literary classic. Honestly, I admit that Fitzgerald utilized figurative language and symbolism quite successfully. I truly enjoyed some of his satire and hidden meanings. You could analyze this book for years if you wanted to.The problem is that there are no truly noble characters to encourage a reader. All the characters seem to be involved in shady activities. The absence of a role model disturbs me and makes me wonder why the book is required reading at so many schools. (Some people have suggested that Nick is the sole moral person in the book; however, his willingness to aid in other's schemes seems to prove otherwise.)Here's my advice: To those who have to read it - read it, keep a good attitude, and take lots of notes. To those who want to read it- only read it if you don't mind reading about crazy lifestyles and love affairs.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book that I ordered was The Great Gatsby.

The cover is of a girl and with the title and the authors name. I have had this happen before, but this time I made sure that that was the only picture it was showing. But I still got the wrong cover."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Consumerism is the New Food for America The necessities in life at one period in our world were merely just anacre of land and tools to build a shelter and feed the empty stomachs. As technology increased in parts of the world, people's necessities began to adapt and change. In America, the basic necessities of food and water are available on every block of the street and are taken for granted; therefore our necessity in an American life became money. Although the concept is hard to believe that money is anywhere close to being as important as food or water, it has to be understood to know the role of consumerism. Back in the mid 1700s, people in North America focused on their crops because their goal was to feed themselves and a family if they had one. In the twenty- first century, America has satisfied hunger at a very cheap rate and has encouraged Americans with a new goal. Since most Americans do not struggle for food, we are not trying to satisfy our physical living life, but our spiritual life. The spiritual life is our mindset on happiness, our wants and what makes us feel \\"good\\". Therefore, with the excess money people have after rent or payment on homes and food, most people invests it on materials, either to decorate their home, the equipments needed in their hobby, or a car for transportation. Again, because America is more advanced than other countries, it is necessary for us to possess excess materials not needed for the physical life, but for the spiritual life of desire, and happiness.Even if consumerism is unneeded to a person, it is unavoidable. Grocery stores not only have foods and snacks, but clothes, flowers and office supplies. Also, the idea of a new school year means new clothes and looks. Another example is marriage, buying dresses, tuxedos, service, a ring and a legal contract. Commercialism also plays a big role for expanding consumerism, such as ads on the back of store receipts and search engines on the internet. Another reason why consumption in material is still here, although some people believe it is the key to corruption is because majority wants or desires it. Each material is designed to be produce because people have been demanding it. Some will still disagree, but when there are enough people taking interest in a certain material, some company will produce it to make a profit on their own.Back in history, the thirteen colonies were not happy with the king interrupting in individual businesses, and still after two hundred and fifty years the United States of America are not happy with the effects of capitalism. There are reasons to have a bad impression on it, such as the production of trash, greed, and class distinctions, but as a whole America is a successful country to be named the land of opportunities. Our needs and wants have created diversity of positions in the educational, medical, business and science field.Another favorite author is Fitzgerald, who depicts money and materials as faults of corruption in Americans. Gatsby is the only gentlemen who is wealthy that proves some dignity and respect of the true feelings of love. He had depended on materialism on his whole life, seeking his desire for daisy. Wealthy, brutal, and powerful; Tom abuses his power of status to deceive a poor mechanic Mr. Wilson to get to his wife, Myrtle. He also depends on consumerism to be at the status he is.One of the important materials in this novel is cars. Myrtle represented the corrupted people who obsessed over materials and wealth, which ironically ended her life. This is all too true in our nation, when people just become in debt, because they could not control their desire in useless materials.It is ironic how our very desirable consumerism in American life, will one day drive our society crashing to the ground. Whether it be a nuclear war over the last gallons of gasoline, or the pollution created from the excess trash of products, consumerism will run the American country to the peak until it will fill up all the wants and desires from the spiritual life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There were a multitude of books I read in high school which allowed me to become the engineer I am... basically saying English was never my favorite subject.

TRAGICALLY beautiful , although, it was a bit slow"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Whenever this book is discussed, the american dream and the jazz age are the first things to be mentioned. I never understood this because, for me, the emotional core of the novel is understanding the extent to which men are willing to fabricate and chase illusions. This slim beast of a novel allows us to walk in the shoes of a man determined to recreate the past and shape reality to his wishes. Everything Jay Gatsby does is designed to win back his love, but time, social status, and reality stand between him and his dreams. By empathizing with Jay Gatsby, we understand our own desires to recapture the past and our own tendencies to objectify the people we cared about. It is for this reason that this is a great piece of literature worthy of reading and rereading.For those out there who find the characters unsympathetic, please note that the same negative traits found in the characters are the same traits we all have. Gatsby, Daisy, etc... are not supposed to be role models, they're supposed to highlight our own desires and flaws. While we might not find them euphoric to be around, we certainly learn more about ourselves by being with them.

He doesn't disappoint from beginning to end, I recommend to any book lover out there or anyone looking for something to keep them occupied. One of the greatest era to write about in the greatest city in America!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"By some quirk in my personal history, I'd never read GATSBY. It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that \\"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes...\\" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (\\"hard rock\\") or a tenuous one (\\"wet marshes\\"). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another \\"wet\\" metaphor in the justly famous line \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. \\"On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.\\" Later, the narrator notes, \\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\" A milieu built on the \\"wet marshes\\" indeed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This wasn't a good book in my opinion.

I don't even think that The Great Gatsby is Fitzgerald's best work.The book, though masterfully crafted as are all of Fitzgerald's stories, fails to make a personal connection with me in any way. I have no sympathy for Jay Gatsby and in my opinion all the characters in this book are arrogant, rich stuck up snobs, who have nothing better to do than be caught up in the cruel pettiness of their own lives.Perhaps I am giving my review of this book too much of a Marxist slant, it is possible that someone else may become more emotionally involved in this novel than I did.

Scott Fitzgerald is considered by many to be the greatest American story, the tale of what an empty life one can lead if one adheres too strongly to the American Dream. Jay Gatsby has risen to prominence in a method seeming to be right out of a Horatio Alger novel. Born a Westerner of no consequence, Gatsby has acquired his millions, moved to a Long Island mansion, and thrown lavish parties nightly. Only later we learn that he has done all this for the single goal of marrying Daisy Buchanan, a woman he romanced for a month in his youth.However, Gatsby's single-mindedness is his downfall. Every action, every acquaintance, every acquisition over a five-year span has only helped him to romanticize his quest. Gatsby fails to question whether he wants to belong to Daisy's world, and he cannot comprehend that Daisy's daily concerns about her wealth may temper her love for him.Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, another misplaced Westerner, but one with his feet firmly planted in the less-manicured lawns of reality, Fitzgerald weaves a tapestry of the excesses of New York in the Jazz Age. It is a world of people bonded together by \\"their money or their vast carelessness\\" who \\"let other people clean up the mess they had made.\\" Gatsby could not find fulfillment in his elaborate hoax because he is too honest to enjoy the illusion he created."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a fine example of books that will be entertaining to those who like to read and those that are inapropriate for School purposes. this is a more pature book and i believe that it was writen with great passion and this is shown in Mr. Gatsby himself. with all the tragety in this book and the love story that is displayed, i would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a classic but not to anyone looking for just any old book and doesn't give it the respect it deserves. Blindspot is the best band in the WORLD."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was a pretty good one which kept my interest and did not put me to sleep. More action could have been used but the romance was nice and the ending was Clutch. The willingness of Jay Gatsby to Stick with Daisy was exciting and i liked the passion that was put into writing it. Well done Mr. Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've read and reread The Great Gatsby for most of my adult life, and it's the greatest American novel because it shows America's endless ability to re-invent itself, and ourselves. Oh sure, that book featuring a young man named Huckleberry Finn by America's greatest writer of all time, Mark Twain comes close, but Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway are Everyman, and... well, they don't float rafts down the Mississippi anymore, do they?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Over the summer our school assigns a reading list and I picked this book, thinking it would be another boring book, that I probably wouldn't even read. I was wrong, this is a really good book. In addition to being short, under 200 pages, it captures the life of these people, and makes you want to learn about them and their lives. Between the lavish parties at Mr. Gatsby's house, and the affairs, of Tom and Daisy Buchannon, this book will be a fast read for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"First had to read this as a school assignment, but years later I pulled it off the shelf and read it on my own free will. Considering how little is revealed about Gatsby, he is a truly fascinating character. The Buchanans are the really interesting people in this story. Another key point - the book is not very long."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a true classic of the 1920's and the affluence of a distinguished facet of society. As a high school student, I am quick to judge any novel I read, yet this one caught my attention and had me wondering the truth about the book's title character, Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald mixes romance and tragedy to create an unforgettable plot which keeps the attention of its audience. It proves that wealth cannot buy happiness and does so with unexpected circumstances that surprised me and kept me on my toes until the tradgic finale. The only unfortunate thing about the book is that it ends and leaves you wanting more. For an intriguing and different read, The Great Gatsby does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is great in two aspects of books that I look for. First is the general story; plot, characterization, setting, storyline. Second is the way it is written which keeps you reading it over and over.The setting is a fictitious New York suburb of East and West Egg in the early 1920's, a location dotted with large estates build with immense wealth. The main characters are the narrator, Nick Caraway; his new found girl and golf pro, Jordan Baker; Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan; and of course James Gatz also known as Jay Gatsby, self prescribed culturist of old wealth.Concerning the first aspect, this book is an art of obsession, treachery, deception, hubris, crime and murder. It is the original soap opera (though not annoyingly melodramatic). It will keep you turning pages and ends with a bang.The second aspect, the one that makes it a classic is the brilliant prose and mastery of the English language. Like a movie that presents something new every time you watch it, this book has many subtle subplots and philosophical outlooks.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading and rereading the classics. A book from \\"the lost generation,\\" written by an author from World War I, it definitely has the era's deserving undertones."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Next to the Sun Also Rises, the Great Gatsby is simply the greatest American Novel written in the 20th Century. And on the last page, the reader will be able to find the finest paragraph of prose to be discovered and enjoyed in any language.If you've never read this book before, you're in for a wonderful suprise. Fitzgerald's imagery and allusions (think T.S. Elliot's &quot;Wasteland&quot;) create a subtext questioning of 1920s mores and intellectual fashions that transform this seemingly simple novel into a thoughtful dissertation on life's rewards."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"We read this book in hope of enjoying, it but what is there to like when you have read it before. It starts out interesting but the characters are boring and don't seem real. The ending is just plain bad."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book can't be shoved into a 1-10 rating. Goes beyond that. Simple the best American novel ever written. Achingly beautiful. Best &quot;last page&quot; ever written, bar none."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A masterpiece about the American Dream. One of the best novels ever written, but don't take my words for it. The uses of symbolism are brilliant, such as the green light on the dock, the Valley of Ashes, and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg. I especially cherish the ending, it was so beautiful. I recommend reading this book, and then read it again, and again"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby's deceptively ephemeral story is not so much the deserved masterpiece of one of our most gifted writers as it is the stunning illusion of a great magician. In that, it is a velvet covered table upon which a small band of bored and privileged jazz-agers appear under the entertainer's deft hands. It is a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. What makes this book magical? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much. But the craft of magic is never about the rabbit; rather, it is about the empty hat. Fitzgerald The Great's magic wand is the English language, and from the void he lifts a masterstroke of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Anyone that has not read this book is horrible deprived in every way that I can think of. This book has just about everything that one could possibly want in a book. It has romance, wealth, parties, anger, jealousy, revenge, searching. It has it all!! It is the story of a very wealthy group of people in the twenties. One in particular (who is quite mysterious to those around him) is in love with a married woman. She falls in love with him too, when she discovers that he lives very near her. THere is a showdown between Gatsby and Daisy's husband that ends in a very interesting way. There is so much more to this book than just this bit that I have alluded to. There is so much more that to try and write a true review of it would create a whole new book in and of itself. I just hope that some of you out there read this and decide to read it. It is truly one of the best novels ever written!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In a world where a football star can commit murder and get away with it,and a family of rich and famous politicians can trash those who stand inthe way of reelection, Fitzgerald could never have been more correct. Whenhe wrote in &quot;Gatsby&quot; that the rich are different, he seems to have had somesort of prophetic genuis. They certainly are different. The way in which Tomand Daisy were able to leave their problems behind is not so dissimilar tothe kind of privilege which is flaunted by those who abuse such privilegetoday. I can't help but feel that even Fitzgerald could never haveimagined the depth of arrogance which our rich and infamous have reachedtoday."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book. I fell in love with, and felt for Gatsby. It is a love story with a lot of underlying themes and messages. I read a review that 'Textorcist \\"me\\" (saschatuan)' wrote and i wanted to point out that the book actually takes place in Long Island and Tom and Daisy's last name is Buchanan (not Buckhannon.) The fact that Gatby throws parties is a very important detail of the book, showing his devotion to reunite with Daisy. I also noticed spelling and grammar errors. Maybe if this person ('Textorcist \\"me\\" (saschatuan)) was more educated and payed batter attention to the book he or she would like it more. In order to appreciate a book you must first understand it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Cromulus recommends this book highly. You must read this book. Reading this book pleases Cromulus. You will anger Cromulus if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Even though I only had to read this for school, I can tell you one thing through my forced reading: the only good thing about this book was that I could read it fast. Fitzgerald puts across some good points, but the book left me without the feeling of having been there and only with images of what happened. He did not do a very good job of emphasizing the important points, and I'm afraid I missed some of them. I would only recommend this book if your intent is a long-term study of writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Anyone remember a skit that Andy Kaufmann did on Saturday Night Live? He came out on stage holding a copy of THE GREAT GATSBY, sat down on a stool, and told the audience that he had never really understood the book when reading it in school, and proposed that he and the audience read it aloud and discuss it, so that he could understand what it was all about. Maybe that is needed here.I am not anti-kids or anti-teens. But high school students need constantly to remind themselves that they are not experienced readers, and that their opinions on books should be proffered with a necessary dose of humility--humility that they might not yet have learned to be a first rate reader.To pass a judgment on THE GREAT GATSBY like \\"it isn't so great\\" or \\"this is a bad book\\" or \\"this is boring\\" says absolutely nothing about the novel but a great deal about the presumptuous oaf uttering the statement.THE GREAT GATSBY--like ULYSSES, THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, LOLITA, MOBY DICK, MIDDLEMARCH, or Proust--provides the measure of what a great novel can achieve. But one isn't born able to read and appreciate great books; it is a skill achieved over the course of time.My advice to all the high schoolers who want to trash this book out of revenge for having been forced to read it: wait a few years, learn to read novels, gain a little more understanding of history, grow up a little, and then go back to it. The book will have remained the same, but you will have grown up sufficiently to get the point. Hopefully."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A great read! If you love the roaring 20's or just a good flowing novel read this.It is one of those books that you just can't put down. F. Scott Fitgerald makes you want to finish the book in one night, you want to know what happens next.If you don't know much about the author, you will after reading this book. He incorparated so much of his life into this story. That was what made me so interested.I think it is a must read, especially if you keep hearing good things about it like i do. Pick it up!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I wanted to start reading this book because I kept hearing about how good it was and all. And sure enough after reading it I thought it was more than great it was awsome! The characters are so real and unique. And its very exciting to read at well. I thought that last few pages of the book were so beutifuly wrriten. The ending is very sad and I just dont know what kind of mind would write something like that. But it was a really great book. After reading it I went out and rented Robert Redfords version of the movie. I found that the book was much better than the movie as most of you other reviewers say and it is very true."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Perhaps the reason that no film adaptation of Gatsby has been well-received is that no director could possibly compete with the pictures Fitzgerald paints in the reader's mind. If you haven't already, read this and lose yourself in this Jazz age Greek tragedy. And enjoy the movie in your mind."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It was at least four decades ago that I first read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.I must confess it was a greater pleasure this time as an elective, rather than required reading.It is beautifully plotted and full of lyrical writing, intriguing dialogue and extremely rich and fully developed characters.The reader is magically transported into the Jazz Age by first person narrator Nick Carraway.The feature players Jay Gatsby, Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Jordan Baker are involved in a mystery comprising greed, ambition, and a love triangle.It truly is a novel whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Absolutely a classic.Reward yourself by reading or rereading \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" It is time well spent."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby starts off as kind of a boring book, book but it ends up being a good book. The story starts off slowly, but has a lot of plot to make you want to keep reading. The story is interesting because the whole picture comes together as you read. The story is a bit complicated if you skim through it, so it is a book you have to read in its entirety in order to understand the stories plot twists and to understand the characters. The characters way of speaking gives the book its early 1900's feel, and the clothes they wear also help. The book is in a way a love story, and is the focus, but there is a lot more than just the focus on Gatsby wanting to be with Daisy. There are the relationships between Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and the relationship between Myrtle and George. These relationships create examples of the characters are, conflict, and plot in the story are shown through dioulouge and situations. Example for showing that Tom was a violent person was when Myrtle shouted the name of his wife,\\"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!\\" Tom hits Myrtle in the face and breaks her nose.Why I recommend this book be because it is an interesting story. It's interesting in the way that truth slowly surfaces throughout the book. The story about Gatsby and who he really is makes you want to keep reading, and also to see if he achieves his goal. The book successfully covers how Gatsby uses the American Dream, power and money, to try and achieve his goal of winning back Daisy. The way Gatsby gets his power and money, bootlegging alcohol, fits in perfect due to the time period that the story takes place because there is a prohibition going on.One thing I didn't like about the book is that the book is very detailed, especially about the characheters. I found it difficult to come back to the book after not reading it for a week. I went back several times to remember the story and recent developments. Other than that one minor difficulty the book is very good and is recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's most notable work, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; defined a generation; that of the Jazz Age (1920's upper-crust America). Told in first-person through the young, middle-class metaphor Nick Carraway, the story has one of the most overarching themes I have ever encountered. On one level a tragic love triangle between Daisy Buchanan, Tom Miller, and Jay Gatsby. On another, it tells the story of New York's middle- and upper-classes, and the aftereffects of a lavish lifestyle on both societies.The narrative unfolds in a straightforward manner, and the language is beautiful, the prose intricately crafted with the care of a master gardener.The novel also touches briefly on the theme of war as well; Gatsby returns to find his idea of feminine perfection, Daisy, has married the bellicose Tom Buchanan. Gatsby becomes infatuated with the acquisition of wealth, material possessions and appearances the centerpoint of his existence. Which makes his ending all the more powerful; in the end, Gatsby is undone by his greed and egocentrism.There is much, much more to the book--including the character of Jordan Baker, the significance of Gatsby's surname, and Meyer Wolfsheim--but there is not nearly enough space to discuss this masterpiece of American Literature.Yes, it has been the hallmark of high school English classes, but that should not be it's grave; indeed, it is the foundation of modern literature and the defining moment for an entire generation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The novel critizes many of the themes and trends of the 1920s.The main character is a self-made man but, he giained his money through bootlegging, he is also extremely materialsitc. One of the themes in the novel that material possessions cannot equal the love a person. This book was an excellent social commentary of the roaing 1920s.Fitzgerald used frequent symbolism and complex language but, he kept the book simple enough to be easily enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book, The Great Gatsby, is about a man, Jay Gatsby who embodies the very essence of the decade known as the Roaring Twenties.

Fitsgerald's description of society gave a greater understanding to the \\"Jazz\\" age and the \\"glitz\\" in wealth during this period in American History.

Fitzgerald truly did a great job with this one, and it's twists will surely please you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"And so we revisit the official novel of high school English, the only F. Scott Fitzgerald most people will ever read. Does it live up to the hype? It's in the highest category of literature where no book can.The novel concerns a number of extremely rich people, all of whom feel unloved and all of whom are unfulfilled. Through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the main character, we see these characters' destruction like a slow-motion, 180-page train wreck. To a limited degree, the reader is also sucked into this amoral morass.I also note that there are some obvious similarities in the endings between this book and Sunset Boulevard, which was of course written later.Fitzgerald was unquestionably a talented writer, and quite often his imagery and metaphors are excellent. However, here and there the reader gets the feeling that he's trying too hard, as sentences and phrases come across as stilted or contrived.So what does The Great Gatsby do for us today? No real redemption occurs here for any of the characters (this is different from a happy ending; I'm not complaining because it doesn't have a happy ending). Certainly it is a cautionary tale against materialism, but no hope is ever presented for any of the characters.I wanted to bump this to 4 stars/recommended, but I couldn't in good conscience do it.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" a few years ago I confess that I didn't really care for it very much. This summer I gave it another chance, and I'm glad that I did because it has given me a whole new perspective on the classic novel. Reading it as an eighteen-year old, I was annoyed by how the book seems to be a frivolous glimpse into the foibles of frivolous characters living in the fashionable society of 1920s New York. Reading it as a twenty-five year old, however, made me catch on to what those seemingly frivolous characters are meant to represent and how their fates seem to make a bleak statement about the future of the American dream, and of society in general. Other reviews have delved into Gatsby's themes pretty well, so I will spare you from yet another interpretation; what I will implore readers to do is this: for those of you who have disliked Gatsby in the past, give it another chance and look closer this time. You might be surprised by what you see. For those of you who are going to be reading Gatsby for the first time, soak it in - don't just give this book a distracted look-through at the beach. If you don't you may find yourself in the former group a few years down the road. I sure did.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a perfect summer read - I know, a bold statement to make about such a classic book. But I discovered The Great Gatsby in the beginning of a lazy, hot summer when I could identify with Fitzgerald's irony and disenchantment with young, wealthy partygoers. The book itself takes place during the summer, and many times throughout the book, the oppressive heat and atmosphere are palpable. I know many people read this book in school on required reading lists, but I invite you to pick it up (again!) and discover it in a new light!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This famous novel mixes a serious critique of the excesses of the 1920's Jazz age with a tragic tale of hypocrisy, jealousy, ambition and greed. Narrator Nick Carraway views his ritzy neighbor Jake Gatsby with a mix of disdain and admiration. Gatsby enjoys the good life of high society parties and fast living, plus pursuing a non-admirable woman (Daisy) who happens to be married. Not surprisingly, events come to a head later in the book. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) had a strong feel for the excesses and hypocrisy of high society, and one suspects the story's modest anti-Semitism and racism reflect something Fitzgerald both disdained and indulged in. Readers are advised that this book is better understood with a basic knowledge of the 1920's with its booming postwar economy, riches, prohibition, and new inventions.Some say the author was his own Gatsby, a talented young writer with a society wife (Zelda) whose fast living and alcoholism led to an early demise."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One would have to be rather pedantic not recognize that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald certainly was not the only voice of that age but the voice that best exemplified the tensions between the mores of \`old wealth' and the emerging sources of \`new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts, as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work.There is no better example of those tensions than Jay Gatsby. If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to \`make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story.And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the \`old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but very wealthy member of that \`old money' crowd. Gatsby's lavish but fumbling attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the \`old money', forms the core of the story.Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the Daisy matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on. This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today.A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature, has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include \`third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader.Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the \`robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this masterpiece when I was a kid. Reading it as an adult demonstrated to me why \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is revered as a classic. I have to concur that although a quick read it is most enjoyable. F. Scott pours his artistry into his work and it shows that he was indeed a great artist."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald portrays through this book the life of the wealthy during the 1920s. Gatsby fell in love with Daisy, a wealthy young woman, when he was placed at Louisiana as a soldier. However, due to his poorness, he let Daisy go. Gatsby does not give up on her and becomes rich through the job of bootlegging. Knowing that Daisy lives at East Egg, Gatsby moves to West Egg where he can watch her without suspicion. However, Daisy is married to a wealthy guy named Tom Buchanon. Still, Gatsby holds party every Saturday, hoping someday Daisy will come to the party and realize Gatsby's wealth. He gets the chance when Nick, the narrator of the story, moves next door to him. Nick is the cousin of Daisy. By acquainting Nick and doing favors to him, Gatsby is able to meet Daisy through Nick. Daisy, impressed by Gatsby's success, falls in love with him again. However, as Tom finds out about this affair, a dilemma occurs. Fitzgerald illustrates through this book that while people seek wealth as the only route to gaining one's desires, wealth ironically destroys the portals to happiness. The plot of the book is easy to follow, and Fitzgerald effectively portrays the corrupt side of 1920s, when the Unites States was prospering and everything seemed to be perfect."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book in high school, and I loved the prose. Fitzgerald paints really amazing pictures with his words.However, this book was much more powerful when I read it again as an adult. For me, the theme of the book was that you can't escape your past, and you have to be careful what you wish for in your future. It really drives home the point that you can't depend on other people for your happiness. You just don't know when one of those solid people that you trust turns out to be one of the shallow people instead.This book is a tragedy, and it seems more powerful than the Greek tragedies I've read. In Greek tragedy, so much of what happens seems to happen as a whim of the gods and there is nothing anyone can do to escape their fate. Fate takes control for Gatsby, but he doesn't have the gods to blame. It makes it a much more tragic story.I strongly recommend reading this book, even if (or maybe especially if) you've read it before. It's a much more powerful book to read once you've been in the position to have lost some of your dreams, to see the shallowness of the real world outside of high school or college."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Truly one of the classics.Well written and as a \\"classic\\" a book that does not want to be left alone.A great study of human nature at that time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"_The Great Gatsby_ has a lot to offer: high society parties, lost love, infedelity, murder and suicide written in an elegant, flowing prose. The story revolves around a summer spent in a resort community outside of NYC, and the lavish lifestyle of the title character. While the characters have few redeeming qualities and Fitzgerald's stinging critque of the upper classes is off-putting to some, it remains a classic for a reason: like it or not, admit it or not, we are all to some extent like Jay Gatsby: inventions and reinventions of ourselves.On a more superficial level, Fitzgerald does a tremendous job of recreating a picture in time and, for a brief moment, allowing us to visit that time and place. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel starts out slow. The middle painted a vivid picture.

It takes you on an amazing ride of emotions, from being piqued at the beginning to depressed at the end. Although the story isn't brilliant, the beauty of this book isn't in the story.

I, however, found it enthralling from start to finish. Fitzgerald has a gift for writing. He really does. Nick Carraway, the first person narrator, describes his surroundings so well that you immediately have a picture of what's going on. The story builds up and develops characters, and keeps the strong characterization completely through the novel. There are a number of quotes from this classic that are very well-known, but reading the entire novel is better than that. This novel is magnificently written."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I saw the movie previews the other day and I wanted to read the book before watching it in theaters.

With the new movie coming out I felt it was appropriate to read it first since it is a classic. The story is a simple one we know well - a tragic love triangle (but more like a love octagon) but we see everything through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who is just a witness to it all like us. Just like we are fascinated by rich, famous people, Nick is fascinated by Jay Gatsby and we get brought into his world. Definitely liking forward to the movie and then re-reading it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby's tale of love and life, the possibility of the moment realized and the crushing emptiness of a dream lost is so compelling that it continues to speak profoundly about the volatile experience of being both human and American in a world that is increasingly doing its level best to lure us away from the simpler selves we mean to inhabit. There are other themes and topics in Gatsby: greed, corruption, the Jazz Age, the American Dream gone sadly off course. But the compelling message of Gatsby is the romanticism within us all - that there is an incorruptible truth out there somewhere, if only we can maintain the focus to seek it out and the courage to embrace it when we stumble across its path. To read Gatsby is to rediscover the lyricism of the English language, enjoy a good story and be admonished to stay true to our dreams"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A boring book about bored rich people, not to mention contrived.

Many people's dream of reliving the past is reflected in Gatsby, while Nick gives us an unbiased view of the ordeal. Fitzgeralds style is captivating and rich, moving forward at a good pace and ending the book VERY well"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of our century, this book presents a vivid chronicle of the Jazz Age and is a tightly constructed work of literary genius. In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"And so i sat, alone (spare the flies), on the balcony of Iberostar Costa Dorada, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Having just finished \\"The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" in less then a day i was earning for more. So I picked up \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in hope of satisfying my imaginative fifteen year old mind. Until the last light drew over the horizon and for sometime the next day I was absorbed into Fitzgeralds' world.I will not recite what you already know about the story and what-not. Instead let me just say that for a fifteen year old romantic this has been an imaginative tail. This is the kind of story that will make you wonder where all of the romance has gone in the world and make you wish that you had lived during the \\"Roaring Twenties\\". Oh how i loved wishing that I was the Great Gatsby and I so desired the love and affection of lovely Daisy. But alas it was just a book and it was over way too soon.I must confess, however, that as I closed the last page of the book tears swelled and threatened in my eyes. I am not the one to cry, let me just state. But this book has touched me so.I truly belive that this is a classic and although you may think that my young mind is limited you would do well to know that I have read most of what others consider \\"classics\\" throughout my life.If this book can touch one so young, then it can just as well touch one just a tad older. I recommend that you pick up with book with all of my heart. I do realize that for those blinded by todays world this will be nothing but a short and unsatisfying bore. But for those who still belive that somewhere in the world true love exists, this book was writen for you. I must say that if i had a hat on right now and the great writer of this story was alive and next to me, I would tip that hat at him and smile. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I finished this book during biology and have nothing negative to say about it. It had great symbolism, plot, and all the necessary elements to be considered a classic example of modernism. I disagree with the person who said that teenagers cannot appreciate classics.

My daughter read in high school and really liked it. Due to it's short length this is almost more of a novella. The decadence of that era was brilliantly portrayed.

I highly recommend it as well."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Its easy to see why this is considered a classic of American literature. Historians see it as a mirror of those who lived during the Jazz Age. To me at a deeper level, it deals with the issue of what you want in life or out of life, and what you do when you find you can't get it, and you realize you can't. And, no amount of money or power or friends can get you there. To those peers living during the self-indulgent Jazz Age, the Great Gatsby speaks prophetically about the realiy of not finding satisfaction through indulging. The way to realization of goals is to be ethical and principled. The only one in the book who is that and is thus the hero turns out not to be Gatsby, not matter how great, but the narrator who is the &#34;least among these&#34;, telling the story and is a distant observer of those caught in the chase. Anyone contemplating setting out on life's journey to find fame and fortune ought to consult the Great Gatsby before going too far down the road."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Although I am not exactly old enough to read some of the other classics, The Great Gatsby is my favorite book of all time. Its plot is tightly knit, so when Fitzgerald goes out on what seems to be a tanget, he knits it back into the story miraculously. Gatsby himself is one, if not the, most memorable charater in all of literature.The Great Gatsby has it all- drama, suspense, irony, romance, and comedy. The reader can see how the past affects the future and how amazing and sometimes foolish human nature can be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"'The Great Gatsby' is the best book I've ever read. It is as close to perfect a book as you'll ever find. From the story itself to the characters to the locations, everything seems exactly the way it should be. Fitzgerald's words flow off the page seemingly effortlessly.'Gatsby' is the story of a man, Gatsby, who never gives up his love for a woman, Daisy. It is narrated by Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's relative Nick. Other colorful characters weave their way in and out of the story. The tragic ending, present in all good dramas, is used to great effect here.If you haven't read this book yet, you should be ashamed. Buy it now, and make it your next read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America. The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience. At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness. Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best. Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America. In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail. How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another? American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness. In this time of global uncertainty, we can get back in touch with what it means to be an American by reading such books."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America.

The book does indeed have much of the same feel as the movie, and provided a welcome Summer distraction. It also provides a more complete and satisfying version of the story. I had not realized at the time that this is considered an important piece of American literature. However it is a charming and well crafted work of art that deserves recognition. Like several American classics (such as Huckleberry Finn), it evokes a certain period in American in a personal way that a historical reference never could. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the best books for any reader, young adult or adult to read. The book is a wonderful idea of what the Jazz Age (1920s) were all about. Reading this book for AP English was one of the best selections anyone could have read for a class. The thematic touches, along with unforgettable characters make this book a sure win for any reader's heart. I would recommend this book for not only school study but for pleasure reading as well."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I was in high school this was on my summer reading list and at the time it was boring to me. I didn't understand all of it. Later on during college I picked the book up one night when I couldn't sleep and found it hard to put down. I had read the book again a few times since then. Its a good read and is a beautifully written story of how a good person goes through great lengths and personal scarafice to impress a shallow socolite."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was a requirement for an advanced Egnlish class in my Junior year of high school. When I first picked it up I was intrigued, but slightly put off by the organization of the first chapter. It was only after I had finished the book and began to relect on what I had read that I understood why it has become such a classic. This book should be a requirement for anyone taking an English class. Gatsby is guilty of what we all are guilty of at one time or another. Idealism. It was his idolization of Daisy that eventually caused his demise. I would recommend this book for any student who wants a better understanding of classic American literature, or for anyone who wants a book to analyze and discuss."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had to read this novel for junior english in high school and it was my favorite book! It was easy to understand and the action moved along nicely and the love stories were everything expected from the roaring 20's....read this book!! It's a well deserving classic!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is widely considered the greatest piece of fiction ever written. Its almost insulting that a story written as a representation of the 1920's lifestyle (and the best representation ever) that explores the themes of greed at the time is downgraded because the plot isn't Fight Club."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is American literature at its best! Sorry, no time to say anymore. But if you're thinking about reading it, DO IT NOW! Or buy it as a gift for someone who has not read it or for someone who has but doesn't own it! Anything! It's just one of my favorite books so buy it!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby has been reknowned for some time as one of the greatest pieces of American fiction. And, after reading the short but incredible novel, I will have to agree with this assertion. The story is vivid and colourful, and the narration truly engages the reader and makes him/her feel that s/he is living the story. You will feel the pain of long lost love, the shallowness of the urban-socialite community, and respect and admiration for an incredibly well written novel. The novel is fairly short, which is one of the strengths of the novel, as it is not verbose or overdrawn. Concise and moving, a must read for those who appreciate great prose and situational novels..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is an excellent novel, filled with fascinating characters and recognition of superficiality. Gatsby (born Gatz) is a man of mystery, almost like Kurtz of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Much like the Conrad book, a certain aura surrounds Gatsby--he is a man of mysterious abilities and unknown origins. I would recommend to anyone this story about a bootlegger whose prepetual party comes to a fatal end."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A very good story to say the least but it was a little hard to understand. I had to re-read paragraphs to get a grip on the story a little better but I assume the book reads like that because it was written so long ago using the &quot;language&quot; of that era. I read this along with my daughter as suggested by her English teacher. The book did spark conversation about the early 1900s and some of the &quot;symbolism&quot; in the story, which was enjoyable. It's a classic and worth reading but it's not what I call a page turner."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I would grant four stars to the book \\"The Great Gatsby\\", since in my opinion, the book was good and very amusing in some parts, but at the same time very boring in others. I would recommend this book to a specific group of people, because I believe that this book is not one that any person can read, because other individual's help is required to understand some parts. The book in my opinion was not entertaining in its first parts, when the characters are introduced and you begin to know each one of the lives of the different main characters. When I could overtake half of it, my opinion towards the book started changing, because as the different events started to be introduced in the story, I began to involve myself more and more with the book. Finally, when I reached the end, which from my point of view, is the most interesting part, I realised that it was a good book to read, but if I had the opportunity of reading it again, I would not do so."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald hit the nail on the head in this book when he makes a scathing comment on popularity. He portrays popularity as a fleeting status in this book. Gatsby is the center of attention in his life with huge parties and a grandios lifestyle, but when he passes on, only a few good freinds show up at his funeral. A great book from an author who was never fully appreciated in his time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is very difficult for me to understand why the average rating given The Great Gatsby by reviewers isn't five stars. In my view this is one of the greatest novels ever written -- perhaps even THE great American novel. This book is so well written that it would be a pleasure to read even if it didn't have a plot. But it does have a plot -- one that is both well constructed and quintessentially American -- as well as characters so well-developed one feels that one knows them. If you haven't read the Great Gatsby yet, please do so -- and find out how good truly great writing can be."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was an excellent book. It captured the readers attention from the start and kept you clinging to the fascinating storyline. It displayed true human character, without trying to sound impressive. A simple, yet understated work of fiction. One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The American Dream--as it arose in the Colonial period and developed in the nineteenth century--was based on the assumption that each person, no matter what his origins, could succeed in life on the sole basis of his or her own skill and effort. The dream was embodied in the ideal of the self-made man, just as it was embodied in Fitzgerald's own family by his grandfather, P. F. McQuillan.The Great Gatsby is a novel about what happened to the American dream in the 1920s, a period when the old values that gave substance to the dream had been corrupted by the vulgar pursuit of wealth. The characters are Midwesterners who have come East in pursuit of this new dream of money, fame, success, glamour, and excitement. Tom and Daisy must have a huge house, a stable of polo ponies, and friends in Europe. Gatsby must have his enormous mansion before he can feel confident enough to try to win Daisy.What Fitzgerald seems to be criticizing in The Great Gatsby is not the American Dream itself but the corruption of the American Dream. What was once--for Ben Franklin, for example, or Thomas Jefferson--a belief in self-reliance and hard work has become what Nick Carraway calls \\"...the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.\\" The energy that might have gone into the pursuit of noble goals has been channeled into the pursuit of power and pleasure, and a very showy, but fundamentally empty form of success."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was a book that really kept me interestd in it with its exciting plot. Chasing dreams and lost loves, love affairs, lavish houses, and big parties make the story exciting. The characters in this novel really draw you into the story. Some are mysterious, some are cruel, some are kind, but they're all interesting in their own way. Their obsession with wealth, chasing after dreams and goals, and wanting to repeat the past gets the characters into a big mess of problems. Not only is it a very good story, but it is also very well written. The book has deeper meanings to it and many symbolisms that make you really get into what you are reading. You would also enjoy this book if you like history because it demonstrates what life was like in the 1920's. The Great Gatsby was a really great book, and I would recomend for people to read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just read this book in English class. I couldn't believe that none of my friends liked it. I thought it was such an intricately-woven story and a biting social commentary. It was so illustrative of 1920s culture and society. Almost every little detail in this book is symbolic of some aspect of someone's personality or past or of human nature in general. I could go on and on about why this book is worthwhile, but I suppose that the main reason is that it's a sad but fascinating story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"We all are attracted to glamor;some of us live in the past. We can all learn things from this book; like, how corrosive money can be, when love is gone we should move on, and that we all live some kind of misguided life. It's the book Bret Easton Ellis, Tom Woolf, et al, have always tried to write but never managed to come remotely close to. That's why, dear readers, it's still with us today. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Compared to 20th Century classics penned by the likes of Joyce, Faulkner, and James, the Great Gatsby is a breath of fresh air. Fitzgerald's prose is flawless, arrestingly beautiful at times. This may be a quick, easy read (fewer than 200 pages) but don't be fooled - despite its relatively thin binding, there is a lot going on in The Great Gatsby. This is a complex and tragic novel, ripe with irony.I was surprised to find relatively few reviews posted for this novel (which is widely considered one of the best novels -if not THE best novel- of the 20th Century). I suspect the fact that the novel is something of a \`downer' has thwarted its mass appeal. The Great Gatsby tells us that you can't recapture the past no matter how hard you try, that dreams and aspirations are doomed to failure, and that the morally bankrupt, self indulgent privileged class will inevitably prevail at the expense of others.Despite its grim message, the Great Gatsby is well worth reading (or re-reading if you were forced to read it in high school). While it may not be the best novel of the 20th Century, it's still pretty great."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of those classics that packs an entire indictment of a society within a very short space. The Great Gatsby is less than 200 pages long in most editions, yet it contains so much of Fitzgerald's outlook on the world around him. The novel's portrayal of the emptiness, brutality and meanness of the \\"Jazz Age\\" has made it one of the most famous English language books of the 20th century. It is so packed with ideas that every reviewer has a different opinion on the themes of the book, as well as the main point. The best thing is to read it for yourself, it only takes a few hours.Essentially the book is about a few meagre happenings narrated by Nick, an outsider to the world of upper class suburban New York. He encounters crime, infidelity, tragedy and an obsessive desire for keeping up pretences; but it is the deeper motivations of characters such as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy that are most fascinating.The book is very visual, possibly because the large number of movies about this era make it easy to visualise the settings in a rich manner. And although it has a sense of nostalgia for the past, I did not find myself nostalgic for the bygone era at all. Fitzgerald pulled one of the great nihilistic pieces of the century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald had set out write a simple novel depicting the Jazz Age's misinterpreted lifestyles and emptiness. Not only did he complete this task, but he did so within the bounds of a simplistic literary masterpiece. Rarely does a work of such quality tend to be simple and light, and still get an emotionally heavy and confused message to the readers.Nick is our narrator in Fitzgerald's namesake title. Spoken in retrospect, we only recieve one view of the people and places described outside of dialogue. This is important in realizing what sort of person Jay Gatsby was, as we only see him through Nick's eyes, he may have established himself as different sort to his other 'friends.'Nick moves himself to West Egg Staton Island after military obligations and into the house neighboring one Jay Gatsby, who shared the ranks with Nick in the first World War. The Great Gatsby throws extravagant parties and rarely do his guest take time to acknowledge their host. Nick finds himself caught in the line of love, when Gatsby reveals his purpose for the house on the sound and the life of parties. They were all a lure, a bait, to bring one Daisy Buchanon to his home. Daisy happens also to be Nick's cousin. When Tom Buchanon realizes Gatsby's intent Daisy is caught in the witness's satand in a debate of devotion. Tom, who hasn't always been true to Daisy, finds a crowd about the home of his mistress as he passes it with Nick and Jordan, another aquaintance of the lot, riding in his coupe. She had been struck by a car as she attempted to halt the oncoming driver. Daisy was the driver, but Tom convinced the unknowing mistress' husband that Gatsby was behind the wheel. Mr. Wilson went hunting for Gatsby, he found him by his poolside and murdered him, then Wilson ended his own life.Nick felt strangely obligated to organize Gatsby's funeral. Jay was an Oxford man, a self-made millionaire without a real friend in the world. He never took time befriend another, due to his obsession with Daisy. Thus, no one save Gatsby's father showed up. Of all the guests and aquaintances of Jay Gatsby, two were at his funeral and none would inherit his wealth.&quot;They smashed up things and creatures, and then they reatreated back into their vast carelessness, or their wealth or whatever it was that kept them together.&quot; -said of Tom and Daisy, and their wreckless, excess and insecure partnership."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"One gets the impression from reading the negative reviewsof this novel written in these \\"modern\\" times that thereviewers are refusing to recognize any correlationbetween Gatsby and his world -- and themselves and theirown.

Such isthe wonder -- and horror -- of life and living.There are two main types of Idealists who swim inthe shifting, unstable oceans of life. One is theRomantic Idealist -- moved by visions and fantasiesof beauty (usually for some unattainable female goddess,who may be a Medusa in disguise), by his luring feelingsand passions, toward some elusive goal of ultimate bliss.The other is the Classical Idealist -- moved by visionsand dreams of beauty (usually involving some unattainablemale god, who may be Hermes or a malignant Apollo indisguise), by his luring Reason, divine intuitions,and mystic desire for melding and absorption towardcommunion with the Ideal (the beauty, the power,the love).Jay Gatsby is a Romantic Idealist. If that fact isnot understood from the beginning, then all that ismarvelous and miraculous about his metamorphosis --and \\"apotheosis\\" -- cannot fully be understood.

The truthwas that 'Jay Gatsby' of West Egg, Long Island,sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.[Fitzgerald has it wrong -- Jay is a RomanticIdealist, not a Classical one.] He was a son ofGod -- a phrase which, if it means anything,means just that -- and he must be about hisFather's business, the service of a vast,vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he inventedjust the sort of 'Jay Gatsby' that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and tothis conception he was faithful to the end.\\"-- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

The roaring 20s. A time of splendor, illegal drinking, and scandelous dealings. This work takes the reader back to the great era of pre-depression years. The advertising knowledge Fitzgerald portrays in this novel is represented in his imagery of the opthomologist billboard. Unbeknownced to many, F. Scott was showing the negative impace of advertising on society. Notice the crime and pain caused by the eyes of the billboard. Perhaps without commercials, we would be a much greater nation. The eyes represented a big brother captalistic attitude surrounding the commercialism with that society.Pay close attention to the symbolism in this work.

When I first read it, it was for a class assignment, the next couple of times I read it, it was for pure and unadulterated pleasure. I'm not sure it's even legal to fall in love with a piece of literature that isn't a romance novel, nor a sonnet, nor words of love written to you, the way I fell in love with this literary masterpiece. Up until recently, I had forgotten how much of an impact the words within this piece had on my life. And not to say that Gatsby will be that awe-inspiring to everyone who is fortunate enough to pick up this book and begin to read it, but for me, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Fitzgerald conveys so many things in this book, it amazes me just how deep everything is...it's almost as if nothing is really what it appears on the surface, everything down to the ditch, and the billboard, and the &quot;chance&quot; meeting with Owl-Eyes...everything has a deeper meaning and extrodinary effect on the outcome of the book as well as the reader. To sum up my point of view of this book, I cannot praise it enough. It is definitely (in my eyes and library) one of the 5 greatest pieces of literature ever written. Falling somewhere between the Bible and perhaps The Richest Man in Babylon."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, set in the year 1922, is a literary classic and I can well understand why. A mere 205 pages, it's a book that has everything - story, theme, symbolism, moral drama and great characters. No wonder it's stood the test of time.The early 1920s was a very special time in American history. The Great War was over, and it was a time of celebration. Prohibition was the law of the land and bootleggers and gamblers were making fortunes as everybody partied with illegal booze and speculated in the stock market. In retrospect, we readers know that it all came to a crashing end later, but that was after the book was published and so the book captures the era in its own time.The narrator is Nick Carraway, a young man who, like Fitzgerald himself, was raised in the mid-west and is working in the stock market in New York City. His own financial circumstances are modest but he rents a house in Long Island next door to the flamboyant and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties and whose background is shrouded in mystery. As a New Yorker myself I must say I cringed at his geography, but the rest of the book transcends these minor physical details.Slowly, we learn of Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for the wealthy Daisy, now married to the snobbish Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with a garage owner's wife. Nick is a friend of this cast of characters, participating in their lives but yet standing back and observing. He's a man of his times as well as a person who understands human character and foibles. How the story plays out is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy and including elements worthy of Shakespeare or classic Greek theater. This is more than just a good story. It's an emotional ride in expensive cars to an era filled with people we can all identify with.I give this book by highest recommendation. It rises above a mere good read and dwells in the realm of great literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is great. I saw the movie in my 20th Century American Literature class last year as well as reading it over the summer for my AP English class. The two are not even close to being the same. At first I didn't know what to think of the book, it was strange and confusing and then it was romantic. Over all it was a very emotional book for me. After reading the book I did a research project for the book. I discovered that this book is so similar to Fitzgerald's life. He reminded me of each one of the male characters in some sort of way. Tom had the affair just as he(Fitzgerald) did. Gatsby felt left out at all the infamous parties just as Fitzgerald did. This book is definetly worthy of reading! I suggest it to all!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby's deceptively ephemeral story is not so much the deserved masterpiece of one of our most gifted writers as it is the stunning illusion of a great magician. In that, it is a literary portal that allows us to peer into the narrow lives of a small band of the bored and privileged. It is both a metaphor of its age and an uncanny prognostication of our current malaise. So where's the magic? When one steps back from the book, there's no plot, the characters are rather bland, they don't do anything particularly interesting, and what they do accomplish in the very short timespan we spend with them is so trivial or mean that we are left wondering why we enjoyed the book so much. The answer lies in the fact that magic is never about the rabbit; rather, it is about the empty hat. Fitzgerald The Great's magic wand is the English language, his scarf the shadows cast by limelight, and we, his vaudville audience in our straw hats and bowlers, are mesmerized by his amazing show."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Upon reading The Great Gatsby, I loved it! I was forced to read it for my AP English class, and don't regret it one bit! Fitzgerald has a way of drawing you into the book, so that you can't seem to put it down! My emotions were constantly changing...anger when I learned of Tom's affair, mystery of the man known as Gatsby (before he is introduced by Nick), and hope when it seems that Nick and Jordan might just hit it off. It seemed a bit strange that you never really know how Daisy is feeling, but Fitzgerald obviously wanted it that way. Once I learned how much the book really related to his [Fitzgerald's] life, it took on a whole new meaning...in my opinion fulfilling the comment that it's his greatest work ever. I recommend this book to all! Two thumbs up!!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Truly outstanding. Memorable in many ways: characters, symbolism, writing style. While this book isn't as memorable to me as Lord of the Rings, because I read this at an older age and it didn't effect my life in the same way, there are no books BETTER than this. If you have any hesitations, read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I'd like to emphasize that The Great Gatsby is not the best or greatest American Novel, but that it is a perfect one. Contradiction? Not really, because The Great Gatsby completely encapsulates what it is like to be American, particularly in the 1920s. It perfectly illustrates all the qualities that people fear and admire in the American people: ambition, power, privilege. Its flaws don't qualify it as the &quot;greatest,&quot; but it is still pretty amazing! A lot of reviewers dissed this novel because of the &quot;ordinary&quot; plot, supposedly reminiscent of a soap opera. Well, where do you think all those soap operas (and movies, etc.) got their plots from? For better or worse, Fitzgerald and his contemporaries recreated the modern novel, just as Shakespeare (another high school nemesis, I'm sure) recreated theatre. Without Fitzgerald, we wouldn't have Douglas Coupland, or Jack Kerouac, or a host of other writers who, directly or indirectly, were influenced by Fitzgerald's clear writing, time-line crossing, sense of emotion. Granted, many inferior writers (like the soap opera ones, and by the way, how do you know soap opera plots, anyway?) have taken Fitzgerald's innovations and created awful versions. But what can you do? Originals always spawn copies."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald did with Great Gatsby in literature what Orson Welles did with Citizen Kane in film: he made something sweet and sublime and simple and complex and brilliant. Fitzgerald effectively describes with a few words what other authors would squander pages on, and his prose still manages to be smooth and flowing. And what's not to understand? The love, the murder, the partying? You can find the same things at your average weekend kegger. The difference is, in THe Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald shows the American people for what they were, and still are today- greedy excessive, and self-centered. Which is why Gatsby is still a great novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book, while not as good as Tender is the Night, is an exellent book.

From the incredible symbolism, to the perfectly intricate plot, this book is simple, perfect, elegance. To open this book is to be magically transported into the world of 1920's America. While to many jaded Americans, the &quot;American Dream&quot; is but a pipe dream, this book makes those dreams real, if only for a little while. This might actually be &quot;the&quot; novel of the 20th century.Please read the edition with comments by Matthew J.

Some parts were pretty boring but other parts were really good! So read the book if you want! I was forced to read it at school!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Looking over the other responses, I have to include my own two cents and agree with the reviewer who said that anyone who gave this book less than 4 stars is completely oblivious. I first read this book about 15 years ago - when I was 14 and had to read it for my junior high English class. At that time, I too didn't &quot;get&quot; the book, thought it was boring, and couldn't see what all the hype was about. Then I re-read it a few years ago. I was simply amazed at how well-crafted, insightful, and yet SUBTLE the book is. The reviewer who remarked that GG's structure is flawed is especially misguided and probably didn't pay enough attention while reading. In fact, the structure of this book is pretty close to being perfect. The reviewer thought the narration of the events through the point of view of the neighbor is a &quot;crutch&quot; and a worn-out device. Not so! The WHOLE POINT of the novel is NOT, in fact, Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy, as everyone seems to think, but the question: who IS Jay Gatsby? Not only literally, i.e., what is his identity, but also figuratively, who IS he as a person. The story is remarkable in that we never see Gatsby directly; instead, his character is filtered through the views of the people around him. Therefore, the narration of the neighbor fits in perfectly with the overarching theme of the novel: he is left to sort out his impressions of Gatsby much in the same way that the reader is. If the story were told from Gatsby's point of view, we would get too close, know too much about him, and the entire effect would be ruined. As it stands, however, the novel becomes a comment on identity: who we really are, and how other people perceive or misperceive us. (I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read the book yet, but once you do read it, make this connection and you'll see how perfect the structure is.) That other reviewer also made the comment that a great work of art should cause us to think, question ourselves, etc., etc. GG does exactly this, but as I pointed out, Fitzgerald's technique is very subtle - with the result that some of the nuances may be lost on inattentive readers. To those who gave the novel less than four stars: read it again, and this time pay attention and look beyond the surface!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"More than anything, a meticulously crafted tale about TIME: its insufferable pace, its disruption, and the fallacy of controlling it. In the end, everyone is human--but Gatsby is worth more than all the &quot;rest of 'em put together&quot;. Alas, reality never lives up to the promises of the green light: there is certain loss in having. A metaphor for Fitzgerald's time, our time, and all time.--Justin Laird Weaver"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a well-written fictitious book about the lives of people living in America during the 1920s. Fitzgerald wrote this book in the 1920s, and some believe he modeled many of the events after his wife who longed for the lifestyle of the financially prosperous people of the time. This book is representative of many issues in the roaring twenties like alcoholism, racism, adultery, and many more, although they are somewhat exaggerated. Fitzgerald does an excellent job of writing about the settings and gives readers a great concept of the situations and feelings of characters. I believe that Fitzgerald's main theme of the book is while many desire the American Dream of easy, quick money and measuring success and happiness only with material wealth, eventually they realize this perfect dream is ultimately unattainable. In this speech, I am going to give a brief summary of the book, give my evaluation of the book and compare it to two reviews from Amazon.com in order to help you understand my thesis. While The Great Gatsby is a fiction novel that tells of the lives of fantasy characters in the twenties, Fitzgerald has done a great job predicting and describing the happenings of what we now know to be the truth of the roaring twenties and are vastly applicable to many eras of time.The Great Gatsby focuses on the extravagant lifestyles of a group of Ivy-League graduates in the 1920s. Nick, the narrator, always finds himself in the middle of his friends' problems. Being caught in between the secrets and controversies of those around him is not something that he is comfortable with by any means. The issues that his friends are facing eventually climax and their elaborate lives begin to crumble.Fitzgerald does many things to help the reader understand the happenings in the book's sequence of events. This book at first glance seems to be almost a childish book because of its large print and lack of hundreds of pages, but as one reviewer points out in her review, in order to understand this short book one needs to read it with a fine-toothed comb. I completely agree with Emma because in different parts throughout the book, he uses weather, colors and many other things to help describe the feelings in a setting. Like in Gatsby and Daisy's reunion during the pouring rain at Nick's house, which shows the awkwardness between them, but their love rekindles just as the rain stops and the sun begins to peak through the clouds. Gatsby's white flannel suit that he wears in their reunion represents his image of innocence and purity.Fitzgerald writes of the problems of these characters as if he is looking back on the 1920s. He brings the topics of alcoholism, Gatsby's bootlegging, Tom's racism, the common adultery in the group, wealth prejudice prevalent in the book, and many other issues almost as if he knew these things were going to be major issues in the twenties. Or are these issues universal with humankind throughout time? With some thought, one can see that the characters of this book can be compared to many people who live extravagant lifestyles today and throughout history. Thinking about the issues presented in this book can bestow the idea that this book is not only relevant to the 1920s, but possibly the entirety of humankind. However, another reviewer disagrees with me, presenting the idea that this book should have only been printed in a 1920's newspaper because of its unimaginative storyline and irrelevance to any period other than the twenties. After reading his review, I found that he should read the previous review that I mentioned and analyze the themes and details that this novel offers and possibly recognize that although a little more exaggerated, this novel is comparatively applicable to today.In conclusion, The Great Gatsby tells of the problems of fictional characters in the 1920s, but I believe it can be compared with people at any point in time. This shows that Fitzgerald did a great job writing this book because people today and people fifty years from now can read this book and in some way be able to identify with it. Although the book was very short and a bit confusing due to intricate details, the author did well to put everything that he wanted into his story in a small amount of space. With a little critical reading, one can find Fitzgerald's main ideas and the concepts of The Great Gatsby. The issues that Fitzgerald put into this book make it seem as though he wanted to point out the problems of humankind. Maybe he did this in the hopes that readers would see this and possibly try to change the thinking and actions of humans that are producing these problems."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald is considered to be an important early 20th century American writer. I bought and read Fitzgerald's five major novels (\\"This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and the Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and The Last Tycoon\\") plus one book of short stories plus the biography \\"Some Sort of Epic Grandeur\\" by Matthew Broccoli.His first major novel, \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" along with \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender is the Night\\" are considered to be great novels, and I enjoyed the reads. The other two have serious flaws. Interestingly, the Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of the five well known Fitzgerald novels as masterpieces. His best or most complicated work is \\"Tender is the Night,\\" but it is less well known than \\"Gatsby\\" which became a successful film.Fitzgerald wrote about half a dozen novels and over 100 short stories between approximately 1917 and 1940. The short stories were done largely to make money to support his life style. In later years, he worked on a number of Hollywood film scripts. He died poor in Hollywood in 1940 at an age of just 44, leaving an insurance policy as his main asset.Riding on the success of \\"This Side of Paradise,\\" Fitzgerald created the rambling novel \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" That novel has good prose but is a step down from his first novel. It was not a commercial success. Fitzgerald wrote the next novel - \\"Gatsby\\" - with an eye on creating another commercial best seller.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a much shorter novel than his prior two: just half the length. It is compact, polished, and contains beautiful prose. It is written largely in the first person by a young man who describes the life of his neighbour \\"Gatsby\\" on New York's long Island. It takes place during a warm New York summer, and like many other Fitzgerald works, there is a fascination with wealthy Americans. The story reflects some of the elements of the author's own life, and accordingly the protagonists have advanced in age to people in their twenties and thirties - no longer recent university graduates as in his prior two novels - and they are roughly the same age as the author.This is Fitzgerald's shortest and his most polished novel. Some think it is not as good as the more elaborate \\"Tender is the Night\\" or his breakout novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"This is an excellent but short read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A book I first read as a seventeen year old and revisit with religious like regularity, The Great Gatsby is a flawless diamond that never diminishes in quality and wonder. It's long been an academic staple for its multiple dimensions of genius. Like any literary darling, Gatsby gives the high minded, hegemonic, and painfully over-analytical professor types all the symbolism, theme, and structure they can possibly digest. More importantly, however, for us mere mortals of literary appreciation, is the intensity of the story itself. Unlike other stuffy old books of high literature merit, you'll be quickly and irrevocably engrossed. Fitzgerald's effortless writing and rapturous poetic ability is nothing short of breathtaking; one of those books that need to be accompanied by a highlighter. Truly spectactular.\\"Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's sterling 'The Great Gatsby' (1925) is broadly considered the greatest American work of fiction of the twentieth century; with Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1885), it is one of two viable candidates for the mythic title of the Great American Novel. Coming on the heels of the glib, hilarious 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the overextended 'The Beautiful And The Damned' (1922), 'The Great Gatsby' represented both an immense step forward in Fitzgerald's artistry and the kind of achievement only a handful of writers are capable of producing over the course of a lifetime.What makes 'The Great Gatsby' all the more remarkable is the fact that the economically-written novel is built upon a thin, almost predictable plot which concerns itself exclusively with crass, spiritually coarse people.With the exception of hopeful, naive narrator Nick Carraway, almost all of the characters are frayed personalities existing in a depthless, moment to moment world which lacks values, substance, and any inherent quality worth living for.Magnificently wealthy Tom Buchanan is an earthy, brutish man who believes that \\"might makes right,\\" while his attractive wife Daisy is a skittish, shallow, and unintentionally callous woman apt to go with whatever the wind blows her way. Their friend Jordan Baker, a jaded sportswoman with a talent for shrewd social observation, illustrates the novel's cynical view of both humanity and the American way of life. Jay Gatsby, whose flaws are somewhat easier to sympathize with, stands in contrast to these diversion-seeking characters.Gatsby is a delusional man with a benevolent God complex, a manipulative, calculating individual who falteringly believes that the past--and the truth--can be obliterated and permanently transcended by sheer force of will. Unlike the Buchanans and Jordan, Gatsby has more than filled the empty void of the universe with his fantasies of romantic fulfillment. But Tom, Daisy, and Jordan eventually show signs of human feeling and moral awareness, however briefly, while Gatsby, who is also exceedingly wealthy, clearly reflects their superficial vision in some of his own choices, actions, and values.The genius of 'Th'e Great Gatsby' is evident in the manner in which Fitzgerald subtly underscores and illustrates the motivators that drive and define the American psyche. In an America that is both a relatively new country as well as a capitalistic one, Gatsby and Tom are concerned with recreating themselves and achieving self - esteem, social respect, and power through the attainment and maintenance of wealth, the single recognized indicator of success in their world.A distorting-mirror image of the American Dream, 'The Great Gatsby' illustrates how a sincere desire for evolved selfhood can instead devolve into a nightmare scenario of the nouveau riche. To his credit, the pseudo-heroic Gatsby has a larger, if impossibly imagined, goal beyond the accumulation of wealth, property, and friends.The novel is also a meditation on how the American desire to achieve a socially respected, successful identity usually requires moral compromise and a series of carefully - constructed fabrications, which in turn may lead directly to self delusion. Jay Gatsby may be American literature's most famous chameleon, though one ultimately lacking the nimble antisocial personality to successfully pull off his charade.Interestingly, few establishment critics have commented at length on Gatsby's youthful relationship with wealthy, older mentor Dan Cody, a suspect relationship that Nick rightly refers to \\"strange.\\"As a striking but penniless young man, Gatsby has been employed by Cody \\"in a vague personal capacity\\" while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary and even jailor.\\" Having traveled together three times around the world by yacht, their long idle comes to end when Cody's wife Ella suddenly comes \\"on board\\" and puts a stop to their companionship. Then Cody--bereft of Gatsby's company--suddenly dies.As an adult, Gatsby keeps a portrait of Cody prominently displayed in his mansion, which Nick calls \\"a token of forgotten violence.\\" Is Gatsby, despite his troubadour-like obsession with Daisy, in fact bisexually inclined? Or has his relationship with Cody merely been an opportunistic means to an end? Or one of honest mentoring?When Gatsby invites Daisy to see his palatial estate, Nick is surprised to suddenly come upon Klipspringer, a man Gatsby refers to as his \\"boarder.\\" Klipspringer, who has never previously been mentioned in the narrative and who promptly disappears back to wherever he came from, is discovered \\"in pajamas\\" \\"doing liver exercises on the floor\\" in one of the spare bedrooms. Nick then recalls that he has seen the mysterious Klipspringer \\"wandering hungrily about the beach\\" earlier that morning.During an uncomfortable lapse in conversation, Gatsby lights on the idea of having \\"Klipspringer play the piano,\\" and calls out \\"Ewing!\\" Entering, Klipspringer is described as \\"an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.\\" Sitting at the piano, Klipspringer plays a song of his own choosing, tellingly called \\"The Love Nest.\\"Fitzgerald makes it evident that Klipspringer is both 'artistic' and subordinate to Gatsby's whims. Curiously, Nick, who is fascinated by the enigmatic Gatsby's motivations, never raises the question of Klipspringer again. Is the fashion conscious, antique-loving Jay Gatsby, like Holden Caulfield, one of American literature's encrypted homosexual figures?In a novel as concerned with questions of identity as this, the Dan Cody and Klipspringer episodes are impossible to overlook and can hardly be accidental. Later in the story, the cuckolded George Wilson says, \\"God sees everything.\\" Is the reader intended to \\"see everything\\" about Gatsby as well? It's worth noting that both of Fitzgerald's previous books feature shrill, effete male characters whose antics border on high camp.Less than hugely successful upon publication, it wasn't until the fifties that 'The Great Gatsby' was fully recognized as the masterpiece it is. Balanced and poetically realized throughout, with 'The Great Gatsby' Fitzgerald mastered the art of revealing the soulful tragedy inherent in both the complex and commonplace members of mankind."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the best books of its time. F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of American values in the jazz age of the 1920s is one of the great classics of 20th-century literature. The novel is written about Nick Carraway's sum up of his summer in New York where things aren't what they appear to be in the life of luxury. He visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom in their lavish home only to discover how unhappy she is. He returns from his visit to his home to see the figure of his mysterious neighbor Jay Gatsby. From that moment, Nick's life became more engaged in Gatsby's life than he could possibly imagine.This novel describes each character with great detail. Detailed facts about each person's personality appeal to a wide variety of readers. This allows them to have a better understanding of the situation they are put through. Readers are able to put themselves in the characters' positions and wonder what they'll do next.The Great Gatsby, however, shatters the American dream. During that time period, people came to America to earn an honest living. While reading through it, it was evident that this idea was shattered by greed. Any person with much wealth gained a great deal of power. For example, Meyer Wolfsheim, a bootlegger and Gatsby's friend, became wealthy by being a criminal. He exclaims about how he fixed the 1919 World Series with the utmost pride. He was capable of such things because of his wealth through illegal activity. Fitzgerald destroyed the vision for the common people.The book is wonderful for a high school level. The classic deals with topics like alcohol that students in the middle school shouldn't be reading. Another topic is that of adultery. Tom Buchanan was having an affair during that story. Elementary school and middle school children might not understand that it's wrong. Beyond the story, the vocabulary and terms used are quite difficult to grasp. Some readers might need a dictionary for a better understanding. This is excellent for study to achieve better word usage.I loved Fitzgerald's style of writing. He describes the time period so well of the Jazz Age. The parties that take place at Gatsby's home are great account of the 1920s. Things were lively and full of entertainment and this novel explains it so well. The setting and environment is brilliant; I'm sure many will love it, too.F. Scott Fitzgerald truly did write a new story that would defy odds of excellence. It's a wonderful book that many enjoy for as long as it is published."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While Fitzgerald's writing style is wonderful, his colorful descriptions truely being artwork in themselves, the story itself seems lacking. While I understood the concept he was getting at (we read this in English, and we discussed this book until I was sick of it) it still failed to truely interest me. This is a story of the shallow twenties, when the rich threw glamorous parties to flaunt their wealth, and those that went to the parties went to flaunt their own. In the middle of this stands Gatsby, trying to find his lost love, and the narrator, who finds himself drawn up in the relationships between Gatsby and his companions, which rapidly degrade due to Gatsby's delusions of himself and the world around him.I liked what Fitzgerald was getting at, yet the story itself of Gatsby and Daisy and all the rest just bored me. At no point in the story did I care about what happened to any of the characters because, as another reviewer said, they were very shallow, as Fitzgerald may or may not have intended. Overall this is a good book to read for fans of the classics, but for the casual reader, it's probably one to skip over."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald accomplished exactly what he set out to do with this novel. He wrote a simple and beautiful tale about sustaining the American dream.Fitzgerald offers us Jay Gatsby the overly confident, charismatic portrait of excess who falls in love with something beyond his reach, Daisy Buchanan. It is a classic love gone wrong story that embodies itself on the theory that we always want what we cannot have. Once money is added to the calculation the pursuit becomes all the more desperate.This novel is a must read if only for its classic status. It is an easy summer day exploration into the mind of greed, lust and all that it leads to. Fitzgerald managed to write something simple minded with great prose and compassion. But while uncomplicated it is also written with terrific insight questioning the concept of greatness at its very core."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is an highly enjoyable, very rich book.

It is an easy book to get into, and gets into the plot quite quickly, keeping a perfect pace and suspensefulness, which is an art in itself. great to read for the simple pleasure of reading, but i didn't draw anything out of it, and it didnt haunt me like great novels do. To me it read like a well written magazine article, a pleasure, but not entirely purposeful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is justly termed one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. This relatively short novel is a biting commentary on the nature of class distinctions in American society in the early 1900s. Gatsby, the 'hero,' is an extremely rich man who lives in a mansion and throws extravagant parties. But he has not always been that way. Once he was a pauper.Gatsby is in love with Daisy, a married woman who comes from a wealthy family. Though Gatsby now has money, he has 'new money'--in other words, he has not come from a long line of wealthy individuals. This, in some ways, makes him inferior, at least in the eyes of Daisy and her husband. The power of this novel, the lasting appeal it has, lies in Fitzgerald's poignant commentary on American upper-class mentality.Nick, the narrator, comments that the rich are often \\"careless people,\\" and that they \\"smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money...and let other people clean up the mess they made.\\" What makes Gatsby great is his driving ambition, his burning desire to penetrate the upper social strata and get the heart of the woman he loves.This novel is very tragic, but Gatsby himself seems to be more of a pathetic hero. This is one of the things which gives the novel its appeal, and which makes Gatsby 'great'--he can be seen as the underdog clawing and fighting his way to the top, only to realize he isn't welcome there. Besides being beautifully written, well told, and enjoyable to read, the Great Gatsby has a very important message to convey--sometimes (unfortunately), money IS everything."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Sometimes when I am reading a book I think, come on, you can read a bit more - it could be worthwhile - but when I am reading a good book I think' I must get to the end as soon as possibleThis was the case with Gatsy -"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Through &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; F. Scott Fitzgerald proved that if you only live life for today you won't be able to cope with tomorrow. The book went extremely slow paced in the beginning until I reached 40 pages from the end of it. Fitzgerald did a great job getting the reader into the story. He used so much description and image word choice that I kept half interested. As soon as you get to that one point in the book, it just moves so fast that you can barely keep track of everything happening even. The story is a total depiction of the 1920s with the unsuccessful and unfaithful relationships, the partying that went on constantly, and the unexpected consequences of living life for today. The characters only did what they wanted to make that day the best it could be. They never once thought of what would and/or could have happened to them. They didn't think there was anything wrong with what they were doing. People living in the 1920s didn't believe anything would go wrong in their society, but just look what happened. Can you say, &quot;DEPRESSION?&quot; Depression is not exactly the word I would use to describe what happened to Fitzgerald's characters in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; after their lives backfired. It would make more sense to use a word such as ---- suppression!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book in my opinion is a very romantic tale about two people split apart. The details are outstanding yet kind of repetitive. I recomend this book to advanced readers because of very hard vocabulary. And don't mind if you cry in the end."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 11th Grade English class, and I recomend it highly, especially if you're a hopeless romantic (like me!). It's a story of impossible love set against the backdrop of the 1920's. Gatsby has everything money can buy, but what he really wants can't be bought--Daisy. I'll admit the first couple chapters are boring, but it's worth it if you stick it out!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald, the GREAT GATSBY is a traditional classic. I give the book two thumbs up. The book is about a wealthy, lonely bachelor, who will not rest until he gets the love of his life. The book has a sad ending, but I will leave that for you to read about. The author brilliantly shows how being wealthy doesn't necessarily make you happy. Wealth can bring about isolation, and lonliness. The morality of the story refects very heavily on society today. People are always criticizing the wealthy instead of congratulating them for their accomplishments. This book gives great insight on the &quot;snobby&quot; rich, and the &quot;down to earth&quot; rich individuals. Once again I highly recommend this novel and I really hope you like it. And if you don't like it, then I don't know whats wrong with you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the greatest novels ever written. The way that F. Scott Fitzgerald uses diffrent emotions really expresses how life in the 1920's were. It also shows what love is really like, and how it can make you do crazy thinks. It can even lead to death. Gatsby learned that the hard way. If your into drama, action, and romance please read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a fantastic love story told in such a manner that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Gatsby is every woman's dream man. He's loyal to his love, honest, intelligent, gallant, handsome, and has money. The only draw back is that his money is dirty. Truly a fiction character that women can only dream about, never the less a very entertaining piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I admit, I was surprised. I went into reading this book as a big task, something to be avoided at all costs. But when I really got down to reading it, I realized how interesting the book actually was. The first chapter or so was a bit slow, but after that the storyline just kept gaining momentum. I strongly believe that F. Scott Fitzgerald was the premier writer of the &quot;Jazz Age.&quot; &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is often referred to as the quintessential novel of the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; and I believe that this is very true! Some of Fitzgerald's characters seem as real as the characters in &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; Realism is especially clear in the main character, Nick Cathaway. He is a hard working man from the Midwest who was in the &quot;Great War.&quot; Some people say that he lives a rather boring life, but honestly, if your life were so much more exciting would you be sitting at home reading this book? I didn't think so! Although Fitzgerald was a great writer, I think he was a little politically incorrect. He also used a lot of plays on words, which made reading the novel a little more confusing. The notes in the back of the book did help a little but it was more confusing then it needed to be. I did like how Fitzgerald used the first person. It lets us get really close inside the narrator's head and that's nice to be able to do. Overall I really enjoyed reading this book and I can't wait to read other books by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Thank you for listening and V.A. rules."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was forced to read this book in my high school English class. I ended up actually enjoying this book. I thought it was a good story, engaging and a wonderful depiction of the 1920s. I found myself not so into the plot but into the style of writing, and the wonderful backdrop of the roaring 20s, a time of partying and prosperous times for the upper class. I found this book to be very dark, touching on the pain that money can bring."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is told from Nick Carraways point of view. Nick lived on Long Island Sound, but he lived in West Egg on the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound. Nick knew only what he would see or was told about Gatsby. The book is about the changing of hearts for people that have so much money all they need is someone to love. Money isn't everything because love can over take money. Gatsby would give up everything for a true love such as Daisy. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a good novel full of surprises that will make you think twice about money and love.F. Scott Fitzgerald writes from Nick Carraway's point of view. Nick is the narrator and through Nick we find out about all the other characters and how they become the way they were. Nick would figure out the other characters and learn about them when spending the day with them. That way you were able to find out where each character came from. All the other characters had different views than Nick which made him nice to have around for a day because he would look at issues from a different viewpoint helping them out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Hands down - the greatest piece of fiction I have ever read (and I am not a big reader of fiction).

There are some who call it \\"boring\\", \\"pretentious\\", \\"pointless\\" and most of all, \\"confusing\\". However, the beauty in this masterpiece is Fitzgerald's weaving of what (we can conclude) he may have witnessed in his own life of wealth, carelessness and debauchery. He had a way of seeing through people's facades and getting to the truth of a person's heart, and then revealing these truths in deceptively simple ways. There was his genius.Jay Gatsby is one of the great tragic heroes of any time. He has amassed a great deal of wealth, but doesn't know what to do with it. He uses it to throw parties for people who don't know him, and who don't care that they don't. His myth is bigger than he is, and so he doesn't set them straight. He is a pathetic, lonely creature who comes alive again after he reunites with Daisy, his lifelong love. But this happiness, too, is elusive and fleeting. And it is his undoing.My favorite parts of the work are the descriptions of the times, the people, the places. When reading this book we are afforded the opportunity to cut through the glitzy, glamorous depictions of \\"the roaring twenties\\", and instead see the darkness, emptiness and loneliness all that glitz was supposed to be covering up."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"With a singular obsession, Jay Gatsby manoeuvers every dollar of his vast fortune to cradle a woman he thinks he loves. Throwing elaborate parties with a guest list that includes anyone who wants to show up, Gatsby builds a mansion just across the way from Daisy, the object of his obsession.Circumstance thwarts all of his goals, the futility of his quest never completely realized. Gatsby is as tragic a character as the inevitability of his failure. Gatsby, \\"pa[ys] a high price for living too long with a single dream.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a somewhat solemn and restrained fellow who never really expresses what he wants to say. His virtue, however, is his silence and profound honesty. He says so himself: \\"Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.\\"The Great Gatsby is a stunning tale of remarkable poise and literary quality. Fitzgerald is the epitome of the highschool English teachers dream--he appreciates the English language, and takes the standard approach to literature very seriously. The book is a tour de force of depth and contrast, and an exploration of the King's English. The author has taken pains to diversify his word choice, and the texture and depth of his language.Here's a passage that demonstrates Fitzgerald's quality as a writer: \\"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward teh drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated teh surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.\\"Yikes. Enough to give you goosebumps, isn't it?Highly recommended, and worth the praise."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In college, when I asked my literature professor to name the greatest novel of all time, without hesitation, he mentioned Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. I then asked what he thought was the tantamount novel by an American. He offered three, Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby. I had already read Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn while I attended high school. However, my high school failed to include The Great Gatsby in its curriculum. I vowed that summer (1993) to read Gatsby. Since then I have read it two more times and savored each subsequent reading. I now understand why The Great Gatsby has received such an exalted position in the literary stratosphere.After his first two novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and the Damned, F. Scott Fitzgerald said he wanted to try something \\"exciting and new.\\" His creation became The Great Gatsby, published in 1925 to modest success. It wasn't until later that Gastby became regarded as Fitzgerald's masterpiece.The Great Gatsby is a short novel and can be completed in a day or two. The ease of reading The Great Gatsby belies its intricate plot and evocative prose. Gatsby perfectly captures the prosperous, carefree era of the 1920's. The novel appealed to me because of its Long Island setting. East and West Egg are Manhassat and Great Neck. Jay Gatsby, the novel's protagonist, had a love affair with Daisy Buchanan that ended when Gatsby went to fight in World War I. Gatsby lost his fortune thereafter. Daisy married Tom Buchanan while Gatsby was away. To regain Daisy's affections, Gatsby uses unscrupulous means to garner money. Tom Buchanan refers to Gatsby's bootlegging. Gatsby throws lavish parties at his home thinking Daisy might attend. Daisy won't leave her husband, even though she knows he is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, thus creating tension between Gatsby and Tom.The American dream does not become a reality for everybody. Although Gatsby's wealth can afford him a luxurious house overlooking the Long Island Sound, it's the wrong currency for recapturing Daisy's love. Daisy and Myrtle are both materialistic characters and money clouds their perceptions. Daisy ignores her husband's affair with Myrtle due to Tom's wealth. Although Tom treats her terribly, Myrtle is shallow and only sees Tom's affluence.The Great Gatsby also vividly displays Fitzgerald's adept utilization of foreshadowing and symbolism. The car accident in Gatsby's driveway at the beginning of the novel provides a case in point. When one reaches the end of the novel, this scene will become more poignant.The late comedian Andy Kaufman, to the consternation of his audience, incorporated a reading of The Great Gatsby into his stand up routine. This is a testament to the stature the novel has attained in the last sixty years. Gatsby is the epitome of the perfect novel. The Great Gatsby has become my favorite novel of all time, with Anna Karenina being a close second. I would recommend everyone read the book before seeing the mediocre Robert Reford film. I like Redford, but I thought he was dreadfully miscast as Jay Gatsby. I hope my high school English teachers now provide The Great Gatsby to their students. They will be treated to a genuine literary masterwork."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I learned that the Modern Library Board had selected the Great Gatsby as the second most important novel to be written in the English language in the twentieth century, my first reaction was &quot;Uh-oh. What did I miss.&quot; So, after twenty-five years, I picked up the novel again. After reading the novel for a second time, even with the Board's lofty ranking always in my mind, my original opinion remained unchanged.Although I have always been astounded by the beauty of some of Fitzgerald's prose, I considered his story of ambition, the &quot;American Dream,&quot; and lost love as somewhat trite and predictable. That opinion did not change with this reading. I still saw the plot as being too contrived, the characters too thinly drawn, and his theme of the corruption of the &quot;American Dream&quot; better handled by Dos Passos, Dreiser or even Nabokov. So why did the Modern Library give this novel such a high ranking? I am still unsure. And I might be so presumptuous as to suggest that even Fitzgerald would be surprised; after all, during his lifetime the book nearly went out of print. I guess that many critics, following the lead of Lionel Trilling, see the character of Jay Gatsby as standing for America itself, and the novel as the most American of American novels.Even though my opinion of the novel remained the same after two readings, my overall impression of the author grew. I have always associated Fitzgerald with wealth, as an author with whom I could have no connection. This prejudice affected my reading of Tender is the Night, and has remained for twenty-five years. Now I see Fitzgerald in a more human light, a man haunted by the same desires that drove Gatsby, and like his chief character, a man who could not give up his dreams, or his &quot;old warm world.&quot; Both Gatsby and the author lived lives of silent desperation, moving slowly toward thier dreams, passing through the ash heaps of American society under the sightless eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is narrated by the simple Nick Carraway and tells of the intricate lives of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald creates a perfect mix of love, happiness, wealth, betrayal, and suspense. Through the use of the characters and their love, the reader can picture the times of the roaring twenties. From astonishingly gorgeous parties of the wealthy Jay Gatsby, to the simple beauty and innocence of Daisy, Fitzgerald convinces the reader to truly believe his writing. He writes with a style that creates beautiful and sometimes frustrating images for the reader. His descriptions utilize precise detail. As one reads Fitzgerald's words slipping across the page, one can witness exactly what is being described. Fitzgerald's techniques of using descriptions and detail prove helpful. Moving beyond style, the book pushes past the basic storyline and becomes very symbolic. The characters, setting, and events that take place are all telling of the American dream in the twenties. It depicts people who let wealth determine their lives. It emphasizes how money and people's desire for money can stand in the way of true happiness. The Great Gatsby is a well-written novel that creates a telling depiction of life in America in the 1920's."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is an important book, make no mistake. It is also the finest novel of a very fine novelist. At a time when America was just beginning to realise that it was as susceptible to corruption, greed and self-delusion as every other country on the planet, Fitzgerald wrote a book that really does capture the moment a nation founded on ideals realises that ideals are hard to live by.Gatsby, the central anti-character, is a mere shadow, a man who reinvents himself to win the heart of the girl he think he loves. The foundations of this infatuation and subsequent reinvention are rotten and the result must be rotten too. Fitzgerald writes beautifully, his words tinged with the sadness and quiet desperation that flavours the whole novel, and his characters all seem to sense that their lives are built on precarious ideas about success, happiness and love.The Great Gatsby is a very honest and acute portrayal of a nation built on the misbegotten assumption that you can be whoever you want to be, and the consequences that that belief holds. More importantly it is a brilliant and moving novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was initally forced onto me as a high school junior, and, like all the other students, I first groaned and braced myself for the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a good read (with a few psychological aspects)... it's a classic that just doesn't seem like a classic"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I found it practically impossible to enjoy this book because it is about shallow, careless and carefree people. Because the characters are extremely dull and flippant about life, I found the book itself to be a dull read. It was like trying to swallow terrible tasting medicine. This book certainly does not attempt to tackle any of life's problems. I give this book two stars rather than one, however, because Fitzgerald deserves credit for the mystical, beautifully flowing,light, prose which he uses. I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the chapter of the garden party at Gatsby's mansion, as well as the end of the novel."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After reading this book, I wondered why Fitzgerald chose to tell the story from Nick's perspective. But I realized it was because he is the only character worth cheering for in this book. I hoped Fitzgerald would give more information about Mr. Wilson, and Gatsby, so their characters would be more developed. I was disappointed. It was a very chilling conclusion to the book, and written well, but I hoped the characters would be developed more and discussed in greater detail."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In our English class, we have to do literature circles. Each student gets to choose his/her own book from four choices. After hearing the basic story plot, I chose \\"The Great Gatsby\\". I was curious and wanted to find out more about \\"the man who worked so hard that he bought a house across the lake facing the girl's house just to make her fall in love with him\\". Now I have finished the book, although it's is a little short, the plot and themes are not being affected at all. In the beginning of the book, it's not so interesting and the readers will be feeling weird about everything. Gatsby, the title of the book, is the crazy man. Although the main character is Nick, he's telling the audience about Gatsby. Gatsby hold grand parties at his mansion with people who he didn't even know, and he often isolate himself from the crowd as people were having fun. His purpose of having parties is not to have fun; but to show off and impress the girl.As the readers goes on, they will start to notice everything that's been happening and start to fall into the book. The author, Scott Fitzgerald, referred himself to the main character Nick in the book. The novel was written in 1920's, the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald thinks that the moral part of people is almost gone under the success and prosperity of the Jazz Age, so he is trying to include some moral ingredients in the story. In this book, he reflected his feelings towards the 20's and expressed himself through the novel.This book mainly talked about relationships, and it also showed all kinds of people's character and personality. Overall, I think this is a nice book, and it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yes, Dear Readers, it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, Professor Emeritus of American History.

Widely regarded as a masterpiece, I think The Great Gatsby took advantage of the claim as a marketing tool in a way of generating sales. But honestly, the book is just not that darn interesting. It lacks feelings, emotions, and realism, but F. Scott Fitzgerald does well in making his characters appear as robotic, unfeeling, and uninteresting. The most surprising thing about the book is how Jay Gatsby appears to be smaller than life. Had he been portrayed as a legendary figure, my opinion of the book would have been much dramatically different. Rather, he is an ordinary guy who happens to have money. Anyhow, if I had to suggest a much better book that deals with the same themes as The Great Gatsby did, it would easily have to be The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. The Great Gatsby is dated in its details as they are also lacking of description whereas in The Bonfire of the Vanities (A Man in Full isn't too far off either) is more relevant to our times and is very revealing. I could almost taste it as if I was there, but in The Great Gatsby, it was difficult to follow the course of action at times. It could be the writing itself, but let's be honest, no matter how many revisions it will take, The Great Gatsby is not that interesting. It might be an accurate description of the Roaring Twenties, but let's face it, it was a dated era. Nevertheless, I was forced to read the book during high school and found nothing of substance. The second time I read it for pleasure during college, I still found nothing of substance. And now, I read it again for pleasure and still find absolutely nothing of substance. I want to make a comment about two things in the book. Every time Jay Gatsby calls Nick \\"old sport,\\" I cringe with my eyes shut. When Nick (the narrator whom I hate) suddenly said, \\"I just remembered that today's my birthday,\\" now...that is probably the worst moment of the book. It's just so stupidly random and so stupidly stupid. Even Sam Waterston had to pull out the Keanu Reeves moment by quoting the line. One part in the book where Jay Gatsby threw his clothes in the air, Daisy Buchanan remarked about the beautiful shirts. At that moment, I immediately flashbacked to Mia Farrow's over-the-top performance and wondered if I could get a glass ball from the dance club and whirl it above her. All in all, it is safe to say that The Great Gatsby has been vastly overrated over the years."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it with a book club or an English class. The story is compelling enough but the writing and the symbolism were sometimes out of my grasp.I'm not thick-headed (or at least I don't think I am) but I tend to like to be hit over the head with things and I like characters who are direct and to the point (same with people in real life). I get frustrated when things are very subtle and I generally have no idea what the hell people are talking about. Which is how I felt about much of this book. It felt like people were speaking a different language...I just didn't understand it.I'm glad I finally read it and I'm really glad it was only 180 pages long."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As a much praised literary work of art, I must say, this book leaves much to be desired. While it does depict a historically accurate and believable account of the 1920s, not one of the characters seems to be anything more that a superficial comsumer or partygoer. Through the entire novel, Nick Carraway, our straighfoward, if not boring, narrator is a shadow of a real man, showing no courage or brain for himself. In the end, just when he could stand up and change the entire point of view for the characters, he chooses to stay comfortable in his little corner of his unimpressionable life.

It was an okay book though, just like a thousand others on the shelves."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a fun read, but an overrated classic that has been pumped up. Even though there are plenty of &quot;cliff notes&quot; for this book, there really is not much below the surface (follow the green light)."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Great American novelists such as Francis Fitzgerald himself are known world wide for their intelligent works. I decided to read his book, The Great Gatsby to find that it was a mistake. I usually enjoy reading challenging books, however, this book was far from challenging. I moaned and whined when it was time to read it, yet I kept reading to see if it got better. Reading The Great Gatsby was a great waste of my time.This novel has a handful of very complex characters. Many who disguise themselves until the very end. Tom and Daisy Buchanan are mainly a spoiled rich couple who need nothing but money to live. They ruin lives and do not think of the consequences of their actions because of their social status of where they live. Nick who is the narrator and that is hard to see until 40 or so pages into the book is good at contradicting himself. He makes several remarks that he is the most honest man he has ever known yet, he lies about a web of rumors about an engagement to everyone except Jordan Baker. The \\"great\\" Gatsby turns out to be a great let down. The readers find out that Gatsby and Daisy had a relationship going until the war calls Gatsby out. Daisy then finds \\"untrue\\" love with Tom, this makes Gatsby's life miserable even though he is rich and powerful. His power leads to the unbelievable ending of this book. The book has a basic plot which the world lives on and society thrives on everyday. It puts the status versus happiness clich&eacute; into a realistic perspective. The affair between Tom and Myrtle also is realistic in the main events between those two characters also. Even though Myrtle plays a minor role in this book she is the main reason for the ending.I did not enjoy this book very much, however, people who like to compare social status and power should enjoy this book a great deal. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks money, power and fame is everything."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"First let me start out by saying that I am a high school student who was forced to read this book during summer, which is the first downfall. The Great Gatsby is a story of a man, Jay Gatsby, who wastes his life away throwing parties, hoping his first love, Daisy, would maybe attend one of these parties. The narrator, Nick, finally meets Gatsby at a party and since Nick is Daisy's cousin, Nick is pulled into a plot that ends in a very tragic way. I was more interested in Nick than Gatsby or any of the other characters. Gatsby is a character that really isn't defined besides the fact that he loves Daisy. Also, along the way readers are introduced to characters at parties that have no signifigant role in the book. Another problem with The Great Gatsby was that it seemed to progress so slow. The plot didn't keep my attention like it should have. The ending is a little surprising but not enough that could redeem the rest of the book. Although this is a highly acclaimed book, I found out it's not a book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"not sure what or which is the more / most vacuous . . . the characters, the style, the plot or the writer himself. save yourself some time and watch ants crawl around or contemplate the ceiling fan. Overwrought, overwritten. At some point, you gotta care about the author or the events or at least one of the characters, for God's sake. This stuff is dated today and I think at the time it was trite and tripe, both. Like the Emperor's New Clothes, someone ought to speak the truth about this boring piece which is, most decidedly, not a great work of art."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Perhaps becaues it was written in a different era, I had difficulty in getting a lot out of it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald was the author of \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Fitzgerald was born in 1896. An interesting fact is that he was named after his ancestor who wrote the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\". He was an underachiever when he was in high school but he was intelligent. He did, however, end up going to Princeton University, though he didn't graduate from there. He instead enrolled in the army in 1917. Events in Fitzgerald's life inspired him to write his most famous book, \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Fitzgerald died of a heart attack in 1940.The most controversial situation in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was the disfunctional marraige between Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Tom was interested in a girl in New York. Daisy even knew that Tom was having an affair but she tried to love him anways. She figured that she had to because she had a baby on the way and Tom was the only life she knew.Jay Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy. Every night, from across the bay, Gatsby watches Daisy's greenlight on her porch. Gatsby and Daisy used to love each other before Gatsby went off to war. Gatsby's absence left Daisy lonely and she married Tom. Gatsby wanted Daisy back. He tried to live the \\"American Dream.\\" He thought this dream would bring his love back to him. Daisy, however, never heard of Gatsby's return until she was invited over to a lunch which he \\"happened\\" to be at. The luncheon caused Daisy and Gatsby's love to rekindle and they began to have an affair.Tom found out about the affair and he was furious with Daisy. He knew he was having an affair himself, yet he still had the nerve to tell Daisy she was wrong. Tom thought Daisy should be a faithful wife to him. This was the main conflict which caused all the problems to arise throughout the novel.This conflict really caught my attention. I felt for Daisy as she was still living the life when her husband was with another woman. I can't imagine the pain she was going through and how hard it must have been to continue to be with him. When Daisy started seeing Gatsby, I did not think she was doing the right thing. Two wrongs don't make a right. That was the feeling I had throughout the book, hurt for the way the Buchanan's chose to live their lives. Their life of cheating, lying, pretending, and settling for less then the best. I felt this way because I know there are people who really live their lives this way and I wish no one would have to go through that pain. This book has a very strong and lasting impact on the reader."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Its an American classic whose themes are still relevant today."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recommend, as an alternative, &quot;The South Beach Diet.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Response to literature is a matter of taste and taste is often a matter of experience. Those who haven't read much (and widely) are less likely to be able to discriminate between what is significant and what is not. But even experience and an open mind do not guarantee a positive response to every classic. I always wanted to like The Great Gatsby because it was one of those books in the canon of accepted 'great' American books, but repeated attempts at the book still leave me cold. I don't find anyone in the novel to care for and if one doesn't care about the characters, one doesn't care what happens to them.'Gatsby', I think, is a minor book about very shallow people. Fitzgerald's language seems, to me, overblown and almost, at times, adolescent. I think it is significant as a document - a historical marker for a period in American history - but not as a great work of art, or of entertainment."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't get it the lavish praise for this book. I guess there was a reason I never read it in high school. Still....all the hoopla about it being the \\"classic\\" American novel and it being made into no less than FIVE films with another on the way in 2012...I thought there HAS to be something great about it.WRONG.I never though a 150-page book could take so long to read. This isn't so much a story as it feels like an outline for a story. The book is SLOW and Fitzgerald's writing style is SO over-wrought and flowery that it really, really gets in the way of moving the plot (wait, was there a plot?) along. None of the characters are likeable. There was NO ONE to root for, therefore there was no emotional investment in this story. In the end, it's a VERY thin love triangle between rich, superficial people. That's it.It's also told through Nick's character, who is completely irrelevant to the story. He's only there to narrate it. Why do we need him? It's more effective to SHOW us what's going on rather than have Nick feed us all the details AFTER the fact. That device provides NO drama, suspense or anything else. In fact, you could remove Nick's whole character from the book and it would lose nothing. That's how inconsequential his character is. It only serves to separate us further from the characters and a story that are already pretty thin and distant.Wow. This book is a D+ at best. I'm shocked this is what people think of as a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Excellent substitute for valium...

I seem to have fallen asleep again. Wonderful book for insomnia this....zzzzzzzzz"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first was forced to read this book in high school for English class. That was well over ten years ago. This book was like many of the other so called classics we had to read, depressing and dull. For a young man coming of age who already broods over life, such books were not inspiring and did not instill a sense of adventure. I was well read at a young age and enjoyed other great classics, but too often those greats were not part of the high school curriculum.As a more mature individual, I decided to give the book and the movie a second chance. My wife and I are reading American classics as we are both writers.Again, I was utterly bored with the characters and the premise. Yes, I sympathized with Gatsby, but as brilliant and hard working as we are to believe he was--he was actually a complete fool, blinded by love for a materialist bitch, which lead to his destruction. Ok, I get the plot. I understand the nuances in the book.However, the book, to me, just describes one party after another after another. And I don't just mean the Gatsby parties, I also mean the tea parties and all the conversations among multiple people who actually do not have anything to do with the plot. I forced myself to read the book. It was not a page turner. The characters were not interesting. And the entirety of the plot can be summed up in a couple of sentences.When I watched the Redford movie, I found Jordan interesting, as she was in the book, but the emphasis was on the annoying, utterly unlovable Daisy, whom, for some incomprehensible reason, Gatsby sacrifices everything. I will not watch that movie again!I think a bunch of divorced intellectuals have perpetuated this book through time and perpetrated it upon young adults. We wonder why kids do not read much--well here is a good example. Stop forcing them to read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This ebook costs more than the paperback and more even than the hardbound editions.

Its not a classic its just terrible crap that society thinks is good cause its old."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is not by any means as talented as truly excellent writers like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells or Tolkien, but he manages a writing style which, if not involving, is at least amusing at times, even when he's not trying to be.The Great Gatsby starts out in two massive egg-like structures made for luxury on Long Island, in a futuristic setting almost reminiscent of an anime, and like an anime, starts with characters discussing things that promise great things from the story.Of all the characters found in the novel, only the narrator; a man known as Nick, is morally-upright to any noticable degree. This itself isn't so bad. I often like stories with a lot of evil characters. The problem is that very often in novels worth reading, evil characters either confront their evil tendencies leading to internal conflict, and/or are overcome by them, and it makes them interesting as a result.Really, that's my problem with this story.When dealing with Nemo or Griffin or Dorian Grey in truly excellent novels, we face characters who have been tainted by evil impulses, and as a result, their characters are interesting to watch as their evil impulses are in direct contrast to the parts of themselves that deep down, still desire to be good. These contrasts paint truly impressive pictures, especially since the characters themselves always manage to use their good and evil sides to bring something truly amazing to the story.Gatsby, Tom, Wilson and Daisy don't do that. The story plops the characters down in the middle of a city with what look to be the makings of an interesting picture, but it is missing the most important brush strokes. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; promises a truly phenomenal occurance that could shock and amaze, but, and this is entirely the fault of the author, it never really follows through on that. I was left feeling like &quot;what? Where's the 'Kaboom?'&quot; This book neither contained the depth to involve me emotionally, nor the thrill to get me excited, and I was disappointed with that. As I've said, Fitzgerald is, at times, unintentionally-humorous, but on the whole, this is a tedious read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I though it was a really bad book, and most of the other people that read it in school for L.A. with me also did not enjoy it. It could have left out many of the chapters in my opinion, most of them had no point. I read some of the other reviews, they said they couldn't put it down, but I dreaded the days we had to read from it for homework. I also didn't like his style of writing, the symolism was okay, but too deep for some people. I would not recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald did not create a masterpiece with this horrifying wonder of modern literature. In the story his over use of meaningless description and verbosity indicates to the reader that he was trying too hard, and it would be unrealistic to believe that this is a natural voice. As an example of writing style, I would expect it from someone in grade 6, with a dictionary. The sentences are basic and blunt, and interspersed with horrendously redundant words that were probably put there to make the author look smart, since they were more than 5 letters long of course!. If the author was alive, I would suggest he re-write the story without the blatant attempt at Dickens verbosity and write it in an actual voice that is readable and consistent."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Not much to say!

There are several pennies that I added, but I didn't know where to send them."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a humble character from the Midwest who finds himself surrounded by a wealthy crowd of people. Nick lives across Jay Gatsby, a mysterious figure who surrounds himself with extravagancies and people he considers extravagant. Gatsby's idea is to rekindle his romantic relationship with Daisy Buchanan, who's since married Tom Buchanan. Nick reintroduces Daisy to Gatsby. Gatsby's relationship with Daisy is based off of a lie and they never get back together. Daisy stays with Tom. Gatsby's killed in the end by a delusional widower.What \\"The Great Gatsby\\" does best is captures the fickleness of upper-class society. Gatsby who was not born into money adores Daisy for her popularity and money. Gatsby lies to Daisy and tells her he's rich. Not content with himself, Gatsby's idea is to become rich so that Daisy will continue to love him when they're reunited. Fitzgerald succeeds in telling the story from Nick's point of view. Nick is intrigued by the glamor that surrounds him in New York, but never submits to the notion that money will provide him with happiness. Nicks quiet demeanor allows for Gatsby to go about his wasteful spending uninterrupted. When Nick finds Gatsby hiding in a bush outside of Daisy mansion, the hollowness of the upper-class is put subtly into perspective. Together, Tom, Daisy, and Gatsby create a very comedic dynamic. The three are all so rich that they're bored and their meaningless pursuits lead them ironically into some of the most primitive confrontations.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is simple to read and this style compliments the characters the book is written about intelligently. There is nothing solid behind the glitter that cloaks Gatsby's life. By the time Gatsby dies, it feels about right, because by the end of the book, it's clear he's nothing \\"great\\". Fitzgerald does an excellent job of keeping the novel moderately paced, as the story feels that it does all characters involved justice."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's masterpiece stands the test of time. The decadence and callousness of the characters make them hard to like, but riveting as well. The lyricism of the language is not to be found in many authors today. Gatsby, for all his failings, still may be the most likable of the cast of characters because he does realize there is a world outside himself. A tragic tale beautifully told. It will be a challenging read for most contemporary readers, but it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time I read The Great Gatsby was for school and at first I was apprehensive about it. After completing a few chapters my worries were swayed and I realized that this book would become one of my favorites. The story follows Nick Carraway around New York and his interactions with the citizens of this pretentious society mainly Tom, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. One aspect of what makes The Great Gatsby such an excellent and timeless novel is the character development. Gatsby's character is mainly developed through interactions with Nick and Nick's descriptions and opinions of him. Also, Fitzgerald's prose and syntax come off naturally and help the flow of the novel and the accessibility of it as a whole. The tale of unrequited love and the yearning to live in the past was very identifiable to me which in return made the novel overall more appealing. Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, this time purely for pleasure, the story and the characters overall felt more real and deeper. It seems that this is one of those novels that every time you read it again it gets better and better. I have now read The Great Gatsby about four or five times and it never loses its appeal or meaning through re-readings. Isn't that what a timeless novel should do? If that's the case, then The Great Gatsby is definitely a classic novel not only because it fits the formula, but also because it's full of superb writing and characters. It's the perfect novel for someone who is unhappy with their present state or someone who loves a person but they do not feel the same way, or if you just want a well developed story that will change the way you look at things. Overall it's an excellent story that everyone should read at some point because we all of the tendency to want to relive the past and can learn the pitfall of this from none other than Jay Gatsby himself."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I chose The Great Gatsby as an outside reading for my advanced placement English class. I'm not a fan of fiction, but the synopsis of the novel caught my attention. Who doesn't have an American dream? As I read the novel, I found myself pitying Gatsby and loathing Daisy. But Gatsby kept tearing at my heart. Morally, he had some issues, but I do admire his honesty to himself. I do recommend the novel to anyone who enjoys the era of the twenties and a character who fails to see the flaws in the one he thinks he loves."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of literary fiction by F.

It is easy to become enthralled with the lavishness and mystery of Gatsby, but the center of the book remains with the protagonist's analysis and understanding of human nature.Most great writers embed their thoughts, experiences, and musings into their work, and The Great Gatsby is a perfect example. What you find in the book will differ, some will say it's an accurate portrayal of the shallowness of the 20's, others will find a deep feeling of sadness: that no one is ever be truely happy, whether you are a beautiful woman, a football star, a millionaire, or if a famous woman is attracted to you and you live in West Egg.The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the book seemed a little flat. Perhaps it is a side effect of being concise, but I felt very little attachment towards any of the characters, and although Fitzgerald gave them some dimension, it's been done far better.The Great Gatsby is a book I would recommend none-the-less."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a story about a group of characters that all see things in the wrong perspective. Gatsby, the main character, lives an illegal life for the love of a silly married rich girl named Daisy. Daisy thinks that ignorance will get women far in life. In my opinion she is pretty ignorant her self. Tom, Daisy's husband, thinks that money and power gives him the right to do what he wishes to do, including hit women and cheat on his wife with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is also married and hopes to one day live a glamorous life with Tom, but Tom is lying when he said he would leave his wife for Myrtle. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, is a depressed man that looks at life as though it were covered in ashes. The others live in West Egg also known as New York, the city of sin. These confused individuals all have one thing in common and that is that their outlook on life is all wrong.In the story I found that F. Scott Fitzgerald used colors to help express the characters. He did this by using the green light outside Gatsby's house to show that he had money; he used white dresses that Daisy, Daisy's daughter, and Jordan wore to show they were rich. The Valley of Ashes is a symbol of a gray gloomy dark depressed place. The author did this to describe the setting more clearly to the reader. I enjoyed the color coordination in the book. The colors make this book more interesting and unique.The characters in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; were overall selfish people that really did not care much about anyone else. Gatsby's love for Daisy clouds his mind and the thoughts about how Daisy is married already and has a child. Their love affair could jeopardize Tom and Daisy's marriage and the daughter. Tom cheats on his wife regardless that there is a child involved. No one in the story really mentions anything about the welfare of the child. Everyone seems to be much too involved in other things. George just wants to up and leave so bad that he overlooks Myrtle's feelings. Myrtle hurts George to the point of depression, and won't even go to a church when his friend suggests it to him. Daisy leads Gatsby on, knowing that she can't and won't leave Tom. Nick's need to be friendly to everyone blinds him to the point were he can't prevent the tragedies that occur when it's possible to do so.If I could change on thing about the book The Great Gatsby it would be Gatsby's love for Daisy. The whole love thing between Gatsby and Daisy dose not make sense at all. I would change this because Gatsby's love for her leads to tragedy. Gatsby could have done better. Gatsby was a strange guy that did too much for too little. Gatsby let himself be taken for granted.I would recommend this book to anyone that is selfish or someone that looks at love, money, power, or dreaming as though this means everything in the world. These things may be good to have but, like in The Great Gatsby, too much can lead a person to his end. This is a book that made me really think about the consequences that result from selfish actions. This book has a great message about life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The movie version of The Great Gatsby, was very concise with the book. I was surprised that the lines were said word for word. It made the book become real, and I was finally able to see certain places that I couldn't picture in my head while reading the book. I believe that while the settings and events were accurate some of the actors that played their character could have been chosen better to fit the part.The performance of Nick played by Paul Rudd did an excellent job with his character. In the book I was always picturing Nick to be this man that was relatively quiet, boring, and the most normal of all the Great Gatsby characters. In the movie that's exactly what he played. He did a good job looking very glum throughout the book, and I believed his character very much.As for Gatsby, who was played by Toby Stephens, I feel they could have found someone that would have played the part better. I pictured a character that looked older, and wasn't so perfect looking, (hair, teeth, etc.). I just feel that he didn't play up to his role, and when he spoke I didn't feel as though the movie was as real anymore, because I don't think he fit the character. I also think it could be due to the fact that finding an actor for the role of Gatsby would be difficult because Gatsby is such a hard character to play.The movies accuracy to the book was extremely concise, and fitting. I totally believed it, and the director, (Robert Markowitz) did an excellent job keeping things parallel with the book, instead of putting a Hollywood spin on things. The characters were mostly played well and were accurate with the exception of Tom, whom I thought would be a much heavier and stouter character, and Myrtle, whom, I thought would have more beauty to her than she did. Even though she played such a small role, I though that Tom and Daisy's little girl would have been a blonde haired cute little thing, and turned out to have brownish/blackish WILD curly hair. Of course Gatsby, who I felt didn't fit his character well at all.The production of the film was very well done. The settings and places in the book were extremely concise in matching up with the book. The tone and the feel of the movie were well done also. The book, to me, felt dark and depressing, and surprisingly enough the movie gave off that vibe too.Mr. M made us watch this movie."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a story of a man who tries to impress a girl, by showing her he can be apart of the upper class in New York City. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who met the main character, Jay Gatsby at one of Gatsby's parties. Gatsby, whose real name is James Gatz, has moved from North Dakota to New York City to prosper as a wealthy stock broker. That is a very different change, even if it's in the 1920's.Gatsby has one intention throughout the story that is to get Daisy back. She is a past fling that took place in Louisville, Kentucky. Daisy is married to Tom, who is very wealthy. Tom, unlike Gatsby, has had wealth in his family that dates back several generations. Tom says, \\".....\\" Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson.Nick meets Jordan Baker, whose name represents Lexus or Mercedes in current times because both Jordan and Baker were popular automobiles during the time. Nick invites Gatsby and Daisy over to his home so they can meet up with each other again. This makes Tom jealous because Gatsby and Daisy fall in love again.Tom invites the whole crew out to eat and accuses Gatsby of causing trouble with him and Daisy. They tell everyone that they are in love and leave. George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, also gets into a fight and she leaves, only to be hit by the car that Daisy is driving. Tom tells George that Gatsby is responsible for the Myrtle's death and George goes to Gatsby's home and kills Gatsby, but then turns and shoots himself.

I'd like to say that the concept's are not too difficult either, but I just don't know what those concepts were supposed to have been. I tried to read into it, but I just didn't get very far. I take that to mean that there wasn't too terribly much there.There was an added difficulty in the fact that I didn't like any of the characters. If you can't stand any of the people in a story, then you don't really care about what happens to them, and you start to skip large sections of stories that involve them....Anyway, I'll say this: It was OK.

Fitzgerald's writing was very vague. At times, a novel calls for vague writing, and it works. In this case, it did not. He just skimmed over the important parts and honed in on pointless details. The entire book had a very ghostly quality; I always felt like something was there, but it was mostly undetectable. Still, it has its good points - I liked the way Fitzgerald protrayed Gatsby's fair-weather friends, and the tragic ending that could be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy, when no one is left but the narrator :). I'm not entirely sure what to make of this book, I think I'll read it again in a few years.

What an injustice!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was one of the best books I have ever read. Its takes place in Long island, New york in the summer of 1922. I really like New York since I have been there many times. This made the book better for me because i can relate to it more. The main character is named Nick Carraway. Nick is a young guy who has moved from minnesota to a district of Long Island called West Egg. West Egg is a very wealthy district. Nicks neighbor is a man named Jay Gatsby. Jay lives in a huge house and has parties ever saturday night. Fitzgerald does a good job of describing East and West Egg. He gives you a clear immage of what is going on and the various types of views. Throughout the book, there is a lot of chaos going on between the diferent couples which makes the story very interesting. I like how Fitzgerald describes Gatsby's house to be very gothic and prodiguous. Throughout the book you learn not only about Gatsby's past, but all the characters secrects.Almost all the characters in this book have or are cheating on the ones that they love.It was tricky to understand completely what was going on durring the book. Nick learns a lot about the people he meets in Long Island. Although most of the things he learns are not good things. Overall i thought this story was exiting and fun to read. Although I found it to be quite confusing at times. I would still recomend this book to all."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I recently read the book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The book is the all-american novel for everyone. The Great Gatsby should not sit on a book shelf. The book is the most esquisit book I have read to date. The book deals with all aspects of love and the trials of life. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; Is a text that a person can read a chapter and then leave it laying there for more than a day. Since the author is so descriptive, it made me feel like I was in the story. I felt like I was a part of thier lifes.I could refer back to the text and compare my life with thier life. This book is inspirational to all people including young new writers. The book has to be one of the best books out there. I reconmend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had to read The Great Gatsby for my 11th grade English class. Now I have read the book four times, and I have yet to understand what makes this novel receive all the praise it does. The plot is like a Beverly Hills 90210 episode in the 1920s. The plot is that Gatsby loved a beautiful socialite Daisy way back when. Then Gatsby had to leave for the war, though Daisy promised to wait for him. Unfortunately, Daisy didn't wait and married the overtly rich Tom Buchanan instead. So Gatsby accumulated all this wealth and stature in hopes of winning back Daisy. There are two problems here though. One, Gatsby doesn't love Daisy, he loves what she stands for, money, power and social standing. Two, Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is too vapid and shallow and only loves men with money (and when she first met Gatsby he told her he was wealthy, which at the time was a lie) which is why she married Tom instead of waiting for Gatsby. I also had a problem with Nick as the narrator. If this was supposed to be a story of Gatsby and Daisy why on earth do we care about who he is having lunch with or what the weathers like? Also, when things happened, like Tom breaking Myrtle's nose, Nick didn't seem to care he just told the reader about it and them went on to something else (\\"The sky was shining blue as bright as a diamond\\"..blah blah blah) Upon reading the reviews here I noticed that many kids like me also had to read this book and most them didn't like it. I don't hate this book and I'm not going off on one of those \\"This was so boring!\\" tangents. My problem was with the characters. Daisy was a vapid, shallow money loving gold digger. I couldn't understand why any man would love her. Gatsby spent so much time trying to live up to the measures of a women who would never really love him unless he was made out of gold. Tom was a hypocritical, racist, sexist punk. Jordan was a lying, cheating loser. If they are examples of being wealthy, of fulfilling the American dream (in this book is to do what? Become a bored snob?) then I don't think its really worth it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Tim Robbins' smooth rendition brings this excellent classic to life under audio format, pairing an unabridged presentation with letters narrated by Robert Sean Leonard covering Fitzgerald's writings to his editor and his agents and friends. The pairing of the literary classic in audio with this background set of insights makes for an involving listen."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is about a man named Nick Carraway who moves to New York. He ends up renting a small cottage next to a mansion, which is occupied by the man who gives his name to the book, Jay Gatsby. This story takes place during what was known as the \\"roaring twenties\\" when everyone seemed to get rich quick. People who weren't there to experience it first hand seem to see it as a time when everyone got rich, went to speakeasies and consumed alcohol illegally. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to think that the twenties were an era of possibility, aspiration and achievement. Gatsby is a deep, mysterious character that has secretly loved Nick's second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, since they used to date five years before the story takes place. In the present, Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, and they have a young daughter. Tom has a mistress, who is also married, and Gatsby takes the opportunity to win back Daisy's heart.Like Gatsby, I've made the mistake of thinking I wasn't good enough for someone and that they wouldn't accept me just the way I was. Jay Gatsby took it to a higher level than I when he lied about his upbringing and basically \\"wrote his own story.\\" It is heartbreaking to think that someone won't accept you for who you really are. It hurts when people see your flaws and imperfections as what makes them better than you instead of viewing those flaws as what makes you human. This book, narrated by Nick, who said, \\"I am one of the few honest people I have ever known,\\" brought me to the realization that people should not be ashamed of their past and the details of their less than perfect lives and instead learn to love them because it is what makes us who we are.The Great Gatsby accentuates the idea that ambition is a strong virtue. It reminds us that when you strive to become the best and you want it bad enough, you'll get it. Our lives should be about turning ambition into success instead of material things and status. We need to achieve happiness in our own lives before we try and be happy with someone else. This book is a good choice for a romantic and someone who needs motivation, like I did, to be proud of their flaws and their uniqueness.I would recommend this book to other people with hope that they get a message from it. A visual mind will see the story as a result of the description used. I would also recommend this book to someone who needs a reminder that success is achieved by ambition and hard work, and that all people, as perfect as they may seem, have details in their lives that they find faulty."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the first novel I have read by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and I really enjoyed it, although the story was sad. I liked how he wrote the story from the observations of a neighbor. I like the way he wrote the novel. I could picture some of the events and conversations taking place. This novel painted a picture that seemed more real to me than many other novels I have read. The plot was also good.What happened? Nick Carraway was the neighbor to Jay Gatsby. Gatsby owns a large house and throws extravegant parties. His ambition is to have his former love, who is now married, attend one of his parties, and so renew their former relationship. The women Gatsby loved has an unfaithful husband and some of the novel deals with his mistress. There are also many twists in the novel, that kept me interested and allowed me to finish the book in one night. I encourage you to read this book. It is not long and is very well written."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's later novels symbolize decadence, expatriate hedonism, and excess. His first novel, This Side of Paradise, tells a story (rather biographical) of a hopeful young man in college, on the verge of transcendence and moral epiphany. One might conclude that something happened along the way, that, how could an author, so interested in classical morality, come to end writing about rich drunks living in Europe.The Great Gatsby fills in such disparity, as if Fitzgerald himself learned the lesson that all readers learn, in writing this gloriously sad and righteous book. Perhaps it was impossible to take any hero seriously, after creating Jay Gatsby.Jay Gatsby loves without judgment, without conquest or need. The sad irony is that the object of such noble sentiment is a shallow yet benign Daisy, a lethargic, bored, and wealthy philistine. Gatsby is not a wise hero, otherwise this novel would be pedantic and obvious. Gatsby shares the shallowness of modern society, and its belief system of material possession. Gatsby is, simply put, \`unaffected', pure, a blind unabashed dreamer. Jay and his friends, all rather crass and shallow except for our narrator and moral moderator, Nick Calloway, go back and forth between cocktail parties, driving under T.J Eckleberg's Eyes, an abandoned billboard optometry advertisement. Themes of T.S. Eliot's hauntingly prophetic Wasteland are echoed. When a drunken night of obliviousness ends in the death of Tom Buchanan's (a fierce egoist and staunch \`realist') mistress, the moral fiber of all those involved break down, and finger's begin to twitch and point.It is no surprise that Gatsby dies in this tragic yet hopeful novel. The arbitrariness of his death, the absurd lineage of events that precede the incident, seem obsolete and invariable in a way, almost as if his death was fitting, imminent, somehow purposeful. Readers remember the grotesquely graphic car accident, the symbolic green light across the bay, and the last scene in Gatsby's swimming pool, where ingrown waves beat \`ceaselessly against the past'. Let me assert another sublime moment: Jay stands, perched at the top of his marble staircase, wearing a colored suit. Nick notices a pink reflection below Jay, reflected off the immaculate surface Gatsby built, and now stands on. Perhaps the color leaking out of Gatsby was an arbitrary choice of wardrobe. Perhaps it was fate, that sooner or later, the color of blood, as if diluted in water, would surround and embrace our floating hero."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F.

Other works in this same category include Invisible Man, anything by Dostoyevsky, anything by Tolstoy... well you get the idea.Gatsby, with its tight almost terse language, complex relationships, and subtle imagery places it among the great works of American literature. Its subject, wanting and loss, are feelings with which Fitzgerald was intimately familiar. Tragically, many people were turned off to this work as teens when they could not yet understand its multi layered emotional landscape. Hopefully, some of them return to the book as adults so that they can experience a real reading pleasure. Fitzgerald died young, but he left the world a master work."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've read this book twice, once when they forced me in school and later when I was about 27 years old. In my later reading, I fully appreciated the language of this book and view it as one of the most entrancing books I've ever read, equal in might only to The Grapes of Wrath. Will it change your life, probably not. But it brings you to a far off place, in an era that the author brings to life vivdly. I read this book a few times a year, and it never loses its power."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. Given that I hadn't the opportunity to read it during high school, I took it up at the age of 23.While some of the story jumps a little unexpectedly from time to time, the story is quite exquisite, covering the fatal flaws of imagery and desire. This is a complex story, who's inner workings remind me something of Fight Club, whose narrator has a love/hate feeling for the character he works with, and whose compatriate really doesn't care all too greatly, as his personal dealings are rather obscured and placed aside.I finished reading the book two days ago, I had a better review otherwise..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book was okay, it had a good plot, but could have been shorter. It was a little bit too political for me. It seemed to take a long time for things to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to the setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings and I don't like too much detail, I am more of a short and to the point kind of guy. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, where and mainly what was going on. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it and even after I reread it I still didn't get it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, which I am, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waste of time to read. The Great Gatsby is a very dramatic book, and it holds a lot of truth. The main reason I read it is because I heard a lot about it and how F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great author. Many of the things discussed in it reflect on even today's society. So overall it was okay, I personally didn't enjoy it too much but again if you like stuff like this, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"You were probably assigned this book as a teenager, for school, like every other teenager in America. I know I was. But if you were like me you were totally unable to appreciate it. More recently (read: 10 years later) I re-read the book. I don't need to say it's the greatest American novel ever written, since so many before me said it much more eloquently.All I can add to the chorus of praise is that this book is much more meaningful when you're a little older and able to appreciate it, and it's actually a very quick read. The experience of reading this in your 20s (or later) is extremely pleasant and rewarding.Enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Can we all agree that this is the Great American Novel?It captures, perfectly, the spirit and sounds of the Twenties. Fitzgerald's characters are so well imagined that they take on a life of their own - so much so that turning the book into a film is well nigh impossible. Even though it has been done a number of times, the casting is usually wrong, at least in part.We have such a vividly personal idea of whom Tom and Daisy, Nick and Jordan and yes, Gatsby are, that no one actor or actress can quite satisfy on the screen. So too with the symbols, from the light at the end of the dock to the billowy room and those ever- watchful eyes...This book is worth keeping near by, and re-reading often. Say, once a year. It really is a modern marvel - and o so much more than a snapshot of its time.Fitzgerald got it so right in this novel that it remains his tragic fate that he never quite equaled his genius elsewhere. Perhaps because the people are real people, aren't they? We can, for instance, say that Nick and Gatsby are the two personas of F Scott and that Daisy is pretty much Zelda Sayre, and when we do, we will appreciate them more, not less.Read it for the romance, read it for the razzmatazz, read it for the historicity, read it for the tragedy, read it for fun and read it for consolation. Gatsby really is Great.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"While I was reading it about a month ago, The Great Gatsby seemed like a pointless story of spoiled rich people, too lazy to commit adultery successfully, let alone make a marriage or even romance work. There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early. The movie seemed like it would be thoroughly dull to anyone who hasn't read the book, though relatively faithful for a Hollywood adaptation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby was a beautifully written novel, set in the Jazz Age. Written from the point of view of Nick Carroway, it was told from a subjective point of view providing the only interesting part of the novel. I'm not saying this was a bad book, Fitzgerald is a phenomenal writer, but even so I couldn't make myself care about the characters. Maybe that wasn't the point, but from the perspective of a pleasure reader it made the book rather dull. As a study of the culture of the twenties or of the theme of time in a period coming directly after WWI, it is amazing and captivating, but the characters were so shallow that I felt a strong detachment as i was reading further and further into the novel. Gatsby is a complete flop, spending all of his energy tryig to redo the past, Daisy is so flippant that you can't truly care for her, Tom cheats on his wife and hits his girlfriend, and Nick allows himself to get sucked into their games. Although written well, and worth all the acclaim it has recieved i personally did not enjoy this novel or find it particularly engrossing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To only have lived in this well depicted time period.

Judge not lest ye be judged.While I also disagree with Textorcist's opinion, it's clear that (just possibly) this person read the book for school, wasn't interested enough in the book to really weigh the motifs and subplots of the book, and just read it to have read it. In order to appreciate anything, you must have the common sense to know that not everyone will.95/100 people will tell you Gatsby is a masterpiece, and for good reason.

I had to read Gatsby last year, in the tenth grade, and I absolutely adored it. Fitzgerald did a wonderful job with this story. It is a light and simple read, while at the same time an intricately crafted and beautiful story of Gatsby, one of the most tragic and wonderful characters I have encountered in my seventeen years of reading. This book is worth reading a few times through. Thought-evoking, tragic, and beautifully written, it delivers a tale with a message that you are bound to remember. Classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What I meant by that statement was that I really must have missed a lot when I read this book. The reason I say that is because I'm an avid reader of classic fiction (great literature from the past and the present), but I just didn't understand why this is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. I chose to read this book in part because of its &quot;greatness&quot; in the eyes of most reviewers. But I found myself 150 pages into it and still waiting for something exciting to happen. It started out slow and just got slower. But I just didn't get it. The ending was definitely surprising (I won't spoil it for whoever's reading this), but somewhat of an anticlimax.What was the most depressing to me is that I have read many other great books that my friends have hated or found utterly boring, and I have just loved them. Examples include &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Ethan Frome.&quot; But I must have just missed something major in this book. I understand all the fuss about the &quot;American Dream&quot; and how this is about the hollowness of rich living, but it seems that in writing about that hollowness, the book becomes hollow too. Well, I'm only 16 and in the 10th grade, so that definitely must be affecting something. I guess I'll just leave it on my bookshelf for a decade and go back and then we'll see where I am. For now, though, I might reread &quot;Beloved&quot; or move on to &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book that has a double meaning throughout the entire story and if one does not realize it, one would think it is just another book. The Great Gatsby is all about what Americans would go through in order to reach the &quot;American Dream.&quot; Some of the reviews that did not like the book were written because they did not understand the real message Fitzgerald was trying to get across. When Gatsby becomes rich all of a sudden, the book implies he was selling liquor in the 1920's when it was prohibited. Daisy is just intereseted in the money, just like everyone, not caring where it came from. There are many implications in the book but Fitzgerald always tries to say things moderately. If someone reads the book just on the &quot;surface,&quot; it is likely the person will not understand the true meaning of the plot and just think it was a story. In order to appreciate the book, one would have to go inside the book to find why each word that is being written is an important component of the story. The Great Gatsby clarifies what the true &quot;American Dream&quot; is and Fitzgerald puts it in a way no one can believe but is true."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition method of purchasing it. I love this book dearly, I really do, but seriously. Can anyone even BEGIN to explain to me why the Kindle edition is three dollars MORE EXPENSIVE than the paperback? With Kindle books, you don't even have to pay for the paper! To whoever it was who set these prices: I think it's disgusting that you would pull a dirty trick like that on your customers, knowing that a lot of people buy the Kindle edition first, without looking at the paperback. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.This book would have been an easy sale to me, Amazon, because I would really prefer to have it on my Kindle. But I will instead be buying the paperback from Barnes & Noble, even if it comes out to more than $12.99, out of sheer principle."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a classic.

Mr. Gatsby sure was something..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Awesome book! One of my all time favorites! Great plot, interesting characters, I just wish the book could be longer and more in depth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Not being American, I never studied this book in high school. Which was probably just as well. Because like the vast of majority of the classics of English language literature, such a book is way beyond the comprehension of the twentieth or twenty first century teenager. And so, a complete waste of a good book. After only a brief look at reviews of this novel on Good Reads or Amazon it is glaringly obvious that readers either passionately adore it or hate it with a frightening fervour - and for most it was compulsory school reading. Now take a look at the trailer for the Baz Luhrmann film due to be released in May of this year. It brings the novel to life in such a way that no high school English teacher could ever have done! And perhaps nowadays that is how we perceive a 'Classic' novel such as this. Filmed five times previously only shows how truly timeless the novel is, and how each generation tweaks it for current relevance.This novel is so timeless it has been compared to a Greek tragedy with its classic love triangle - Gatsby, Daisy and Tom; secondary but essential characters who tip the balance into madness - George and Myrtle Wilson; and the Chorus - Nick Carraway who is a distant cousin of Daisy and becomes Gatsby's neighbour for the summer. Into this mix are thrown and stirred the greed, ambition and hedonism of the very rich in 1920s America. And above all perhaps boredom - these people have so little point to their lives, are so self absorbed, and have so little purpose that it is no wonder trouble results. Be careful what you wish for...There is little point in doing a plot summary as the story is so well known and the plot is so accessible via the Net. But you don't read a book just for the plot. At just 190 pages, this is a short 'Classic' read, written with such vividness you can feel the heat of the New York summer, the cool lushness of Long Island, the despair in Gatsby's heart, the emptiness in Daisy. With the doorstops that nowadays pass for 'Classic' novels, it is a true joy to read something written with such finesse and restraint. It may not be rewarding reading for a teenager but for an adult, most definitely."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I decided to read this in preparation for the movie, and I have to say it was great. The style of the novel took some time getting used to, but the story itself is captivating. I definitely recommend you read if."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is an interesting novel which brings the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" to life. The author of this book certainly knows how to maintain the reader's interest. The main scheme consists of a cast of colorful characters seemingly stuck in what modern day society would call \\"a mild soap opera type of lifestyle.\\" At least each and every one of these characters that the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald has come up with; either has already or attempts to commit at least one or more of the seven deadly sins. These sins include pride, envy, greed, anger, lust as the main occurrences, with, sloth and gluttony ranking more at the lower end of the events that take place throughout the book.The narrator, Nick Carraway, irreverently states his thoughts and opinions about nearly each and every one of the vibrant characters more than once as the story goes on. Should we as reader's value Nick's opinion is something that you will have to find out for yourself. Nick says, \\"Gatsby turns out alright in the end.\\" I beg to differ with that statement but again, once the reader gets into the story he or she will realize this is a suspenseful plot which leads up to the main idea of who Jay Gatsby really was and what his intentions were as he shared the same social circle as Nick's cousin, Daisy. The \\"cast\\" includes the infamous Jay Gatsby, who the book revolves around and his former lover, Daisy Buchannan, who decided to marry Tom, who was richer and readily available while Gatsby was away at war. Also worthy of mention is Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson who will eventually share the same fate as Jay Gatsby as the story evolves closer to the end of the tremendous fiction.The bottom line being that The Great Gatsby is a great catch and a worthwhile read for any of us. We as readers should and could benefit from the literature and historical aspects in which F. Scott Fitzgerald has so terrifically written."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was one of the most adorable books ever. It amazed me that Fitzgerald made so many references to transient yet important moments in life which we usually take for granted in life. It evoked feelings in me that made me think of the emotions behind a first kiss or the ones evoked when watching a couple bloom and fall apart. Simply Amazing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I absolutely loved the Great Gatsby. This may be due in part to the fact that the 20's is my favorite time period, but I think its mainly because I love the way Fitzgerald writes. His work is full of gems and wonderfully sad quotes. He successfully reflects the essence of the 'Lost Generation' more than any other author I have read, that 'party-hard' attitude punctuated by melancholy.His characters are rich and successful, but unable to escape the weight of their pasts. They subsist on the American Dream gone wrong, finding happiness only in their fantasy versions of others. The main character, Jay Gatsby, lives for the hope of a relationship with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan, but he finds out that the real person can never live up to the ideal he has set for her.In essence, this novel conveys the melancholy and loss of missed opportunities. Gatsby is unable to accept that he cannot live his life with Daisy the way he once envisioned, so he retreats to a fantasy in which he convinces himself that if he just tries hard enough, he can win Daisy back and make everything right again. But he can't. He is living in a dream world, and when it is shattered, he is unable to really come back to reality again. Basically, the whole book can be summed up by Fitzgerald touching last line, \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time I read &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; I found it superficial and trite. It took a much more careful read to realize what a masterpiece this book is. Fitgerald uses the quick and flowing style of writing born in the Jazz Age, making this an easy read as well as a very satisfying one. I'm tempted to say that the basic storyline of Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, who pursues his fickle sweetheart to a tragic end, is outweighed by the synesthetic descriptions and intimate character studies. Fitzgerald has a skill for highlighting the dark, tragic moments in the book by contrasting them with beautiful and carefree lifestyle of its characters. This can make the book seem too light and at times arrogant; however, look deeper at the dialogue and actions of the character to find the disquieting sense of melancholy that make this book so sadly lovely."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway having graduated from Yale and fought in World War I has returned home to find a job. Being unsettled, he decided to move to New York to learn the bond business. The novel opens early in the summer of 1922 in West Egg, Long Island, where Nick has rented a house and seems to be unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg. Next to his place, is the Gatsby's mansion. Shortly after his arrival, Nick travels across the Sound to the more fashionable East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy Buchannan and her husband, Tom, a hulking, imposing man whom Nick had known in college. While Nick is there, he meets a young woman golfer named Jordan Baker, whom Daisy wants Nick to be interested in. During dinner, the telephone rings, and when Tom and Daisy leave the room, Jordan informs Nick that the caller is Tom's woman from New York. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom's marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.As the summer continues, Nick turns his attention to his mysterious neighbor, who hosts weekly parties for the rich and fashionable. Upon Gatsby's invitation, Nick attends one of the extravagant gatherings. There, he bumps into Jordan Baker, as well as Gatsby himself. Gatsby, a gracious host, remains apart from his guest; more of an observer more than a participant. As the party winds down, Gatsby takes Jordan aside to speak privately. Jordan is greatly amazed by what she's learned from Gatsby.One day, Nick and Gatsby take a trip into the city and there Nick meets Meyer Wolfshiem, one of Gatsby's associates and Gatsby's link to organized crime. On that same day, while having tea with Jordan Baker, Nick learns the amazing story that Gatsby told her the night of his party. Gatsby, it appears, is in love with Daisy Buchannan. They met years earlier when he was in the army but could not be together because he did not yet have the means to support her. In the intervening years, Gatsby made his fortune, all with the goal of winning Daisy back. He bought his house so that he would be across the Sound from her and hosted the elaborate parties in the hopes that she would notice. It has come time for Gatsby to meet Daisy again, face-to-face, and so, through the intermediary of Jordan Baker, Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to his little house where Gatsby will show up unannounced.The day for the re-acquaintance of Gatsby and Daisy finally arrives. Gatsby makes sure that everything is perfectly prepared, and wants every detail to be perfect for his reunion with his lost love. When the two former lovers meet, their reunion is slightly nervous, but shortly, the two are again comfortable with each other.. Later on, the three move the party from Nick's house to Gatsby's, where he takes special delight in showing Daisy his meticulously decorated house and his impressive arrangement of belongings, as if demonstrating in a very tangible way just how far out of poverty he has traveled.When Nick, Jordan, and Tom take a drive one day, they discover that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom's lover. They rush back to Long Island, where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle's husband, George, that Gatsby was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. He then turns the gun on himself.After Gatsby's death, Nick is left to help prepare for his burial, only problem is that no one seems overly concerned with Gatsby's death. A telegram from Gatsby's father indicates he will be coming from Minnesota to bury his son. Gatsby's funeral hosts only Nick, Gatsby's father, a few servants, the postman, and the minister at his gravesite. Although Gatsby, during his lifetime held high popularity, at the time of his death, he was completely forgotten.Nick, after everything he has experienced, heads back home to the Midwest."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I decided to read The Great Gatsby knowing what a classic it's considered to be, but I have to say I didn't personally think it was great. I'll tell the basic plot to the story and then elaborate on my feelings.The story is told by Nick Carraway, a man living on Long Island next to the very wealthy Jay Gatsby. On first sight it appears Jay Gatsby has a wonderful live with his wealth and the extravagant parties he throws every week, but he's missing something. He's missing Daisy Buchanan's love. Daisy Buchanan is a woman he knew 5 years ago and fell in love with, but circumstances kept them apart. Coincidentally, Nick Carraway happens to be the 2nd cousin of Daisy whom lives only across a lake(which Gatsby knows). So, Gatsby befriends Carraway in an attempt to get back the love he lost. In retrospect, Carraway, as the narrator, relates the events of the period of his life in which he knew Gatsby and what happened.Reading this book, I just found trouble getting really into it. The characters are described well enough and a pretty clear picture of them is painted of them(except maybe for Gatsby who is always surrounded by some mystery) and the writing was pretty good(the book isn't bogged down with very sophisticated language or anything like that), but for about the first half of the book I just found things to be kind of boring. The 2nd half gets a little more interesting when things start to pick up between Daisy and Jay. Also, there's an interesting cast of characters which seem very real and make the book more interesting.Overall, I'd say that I would recommend reading this book since it is considered to be a classic and I know that others which read The Great Gatsby would probably have completely different opinions about the book and think it's great. Also, it's only about 197 pages, so it's really not too long. It's a book that I wouldn't be surprised that if I read again, like in a few years, perhaps maybe I'd have a different view of things. I do sort of get the feeling that maybe this is a book I'd appreciate a little more after another reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a well written novel that portrays life in the 1920s in America. It reveals many of the dishonest motivators present in that time period and also present in today's society. Some of these motivators are lust, greed, money, and love. Fitzgerald causes the readed to reflect on how ethical these influencers are. This is a very worth while book to read. It caused me to question what motivates me in my own life. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Yes, The Great Gatsby is a true classic. It is such a beautiful little novel, and its themes transcend the century.Most people know the story. Nick, who narrates, has just moved to New York, and his life becomes entangled with that of his mysterious neighbor, the rich, self-made Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, who is married to Tom Buchanan. The plot follows the telling events that take place between this small group of the Jazz Age elite.The entire novel is so exquisitely constructed. The prose is beautiful, the plot is an emotionally moving degenerative tragedy, and the symbols are intricately woven in to deftly illustrate the theme. And that theme is so relevant as Fitzgerald laments over the fall of the American Dream. He reveals the wasteland that is, the America made hollow by the embrace of materialism and a set of false ideals to adhere to their materialistic longings. There is so much that Fitzgerald says, and reading the work, one feels that the Jazz Age has yet to end. We are still reeling in the languish Fitzgerald described."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"and I stayed up crying for hours after the ending! Even now if I see a copy of it in a store I cringe. I won't tell you why because that would ruin the story for you.So why am I giving it five stars? Because the writing is *truly* remarkable. If you want an example of excellent literature, this is it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"During the hedonistic go-go years following the end of the First World War, F. Scott Fitzgerald was plainly alarmed by the cultural and financial excesses that marked America's new and what was for him, a perverted interest in the historically rooted American dream. In this dream, begun by Ben Franklin in his autobiography, he lists, as does Jay Gatsby in THE GREAT GATSBY, a shopping list of virtues whose goal it is to inculcate those values that both Franklin and Gatsby thought would lead to material success. The difference between Ben Franklin and Jay Gatsby has more to say about the use of those virtues than their origin. With Gatsby, the American Dream is not simply pulling himself up by his bootstraps from poverty to riches, but in his warped vision of that dream, Gatsby symbolizes what can go wrong when any upwardly mobile American allows another to recast that dream according to the competing dreams of another.Gatsby believes that he loves the incredibly alluring Daisy Fay, a teenage society deb--beautiful, sexy, elegant--whom he sees as the ultimate goal for his life. They meet, they fall in love (or do they? This is arguable) and they break up because Gatsby is too poor for her to marry. Up to the point that they meet, Gatsby is pursuing the Franklinian version of the American ideal, which can be summed up as hard work + true grit = material success. Gatsby wants success, but he wants it for himself. After meeting and being rejected by Daisy, Gatsby now sees his dream as the means to achieve a higher dream: securing the affections of a woman whose limitations in taste and fidelity were obvious to all but him. During the years of their separation, Gatsby worked hard to build his criminal empire that brought him the money and possessions that he truly saw as the missing variable in the romantic equation that would convince Daisy to be by his side. Gatsby is wrong is so many ways that the reader is not sure whether to laugh at him for his emotional myopia or to pity him for the same reason.Those critics who analyze Gatsby's role in the perversion of the American dream tend to focus on the Gatsby side of the equation, yet to understand the inner tragedy of this dream's deconstruction, one must also examine Daisy's role. Exactly who is this Daisy Fay? To begin with, consider her last name, which is an aberrant spelling of 'fey,' which means a doomed vision. Those who connect with her, both Gatsby and her brute husband Tom, are doomed to a life of trying to relate to a woman who cannot return basic human kindness. Daisy is shallow, frivolous, and easily impressed by the very qualities that Tom showers her with (a $350,000 ring) and Gatsby shows her (those silk shirts that cause her to weep). It is almost as if Daisy is auctioning herself off to the highest bidder. Daisy's dream is the flipside of Franklin's. She wants the rewards of hard work without incurring the demands of the work itself. In the collision between these contrasting dreams, it comes as no surprise that buried somewhere in Daisy's soul is just enough of a link to harsh reality to remind her that Tom, despite his affairs and animalistic nature, is still preferable to a Gatsby, who offers only the illusion, not the reality of love. When Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be reborn and reshaped into a present more to his liking, Gatsby stuns both Nick and the reader by saying, \\"Of course it can.\\" Gatsby's entire life and by extension his dream of success that is to include the questionable charms of Daisy, is seen as so flawed that whenever his dream meets a competing dream that has at least some root in reality, his dream of a green light that can blink into any color he wants will crash into a tragedy that resounds even today."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Holden was right-- Fitzgerald would have been a great person to have around. I devoured the book...the way words were unfolded made me wish I had written them myself. It may strike some people as a what's-the-point book, but I think it possesses great intensity, not to mention it's plain fun to read. A tragedy that is melancholy but funny; light but insightful; and most of all, I think it's about something we all can relate to: unreciprocated, almost delusional kind of love that in the end, whether rightly or wrongly, robs life of all its purpose and vitality."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was very surprised by how good of a book this was. It was assigned by my english teacher during my senior year. Up until this time I never really had any assigned readings i any of my classes.I wasn't thrilled with the first book we had to read, which was MY ANTONIA. I found that one boring and rather uninteresting at times. I expected the same from GATSBY. I am happy to say I was wrong to think this book was no good. It doesn't seem like anything special. It has a simple story about a wealthy man who falls in love with a woman he can't have, told from the point of view of another character who is friends of them both.Seems boring, eh? Well, I don't know how Fitzgereld did it, but he wrote the book in such a way that it was both easy to read and fun. Normally even good books like the HOBBIT and 1984 have moments that you wish could end so you could continue with the book. Not this one. Fitzgereld writes only what we, the reader, need to know. Everything seems important and everything makes you want to continue on.My only complaint would be that very rarely does anything truly spectacualr happens, which one would normally expect from a classic. But in the end, it doesn't seem to matter. It's a good book, plain and simple."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At first i did not see the big picture of what the book was trying to convey.

A few days ago i decided to read the book once again because I was wondering why I had been so bored and depressed by that second reading. I read it again and was soon discovering my original enjoyment of the story. I suppose it was just typical teenage moodiness. It is a great story, and I especially like the descriptive bits, like where it describes Daisy and the tennis player(I cant remember her name at this second) as floating in white dresses on the coach. Gatsbys parties and the drunken party at Toms mistress's house are wonderful. The characters are very true to life and I loved the mysteriousness of Gatsby.

Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald is very descriptive and uses many themes to add a deeper understanding of the emotions and trials of the characters. Two major themes are wealth and self-improvement. Jay Gatsby had been in love with Daisy since the two met a month before he was sent to war. Gatsby admired her voice and felt the \\"stirring warmth that flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to (him) in one of those breathless, thrilling words.\\" She had \\"an excitement in her voice that men who cared for her found difficult to forget.\\" Gatsby loved Daisy's youthful beauty and cherished their limited time together. They devoted themselves to each other and expressed their powerful love. However, one problem existed- Gatsby's social status made him unsuitable for Daisy. Daisy came from a very wealthy family and Gatsby even noticed the \\"money in her voice.\\" Throughout and after his service in military, Jay Gatsby desperately tried to improve himself and his status so that when he returned his proposal would be accepted. When Jay Gatsby left the military, he began to establish himself with illegal \\"new money.\\" He met Meyer Wolfshiem, who \\"raised him... out of the gutter.\\" They were involved in illegal activities such as bootlegging, the unlawful sale of alcohol. They established a series of \\"drug stores\\" that provided it to the people. Jay Gatsby also forged counterfeit bonds. Although the sources of his income were illegal, he saw only the quick money that he was making and thought he could win Daisy back with his improved status. Sure enough, when Daisy and Jay were reunited, she was very impressed with his possessions. Oddly, she seemed to adore Jay more when he boasted his multiple silk shirts. She realized that Jay has done well for himself and she fell in love with him and the money. Although Daisy enjoyed Jay's lifestyle, she could not leave Tom Buchanan, her wealthy, arrogant husband (especially when she learned that the source of Jay's money may only be short-term.) Right before Jay Gatsby is killed, he began to realize that Daisy was a selfish being who was too obsessed with money and herself. He also realized that he spent about five years improving himself and becoming a man that he thought would be suitable for Daisy, but now he knows that Daisy was not suitable for him. When Gatsby was murdered, none of his party guests, business acquaintances or even Daisy pay their respects at his funeral. Some had picnics to attend; others were too wrapped up in a business deal at the moment. Daisy's selfish mind ran from the problems she caused and escaped on a vacation with her husband. She sent neither a letter nor flowers to acknowledge Gatsby's death. She did not recognize the trouble and struggle that Gatsby went through to improve himself and to gain her approval. Instead she retreated into her luxuries and forgot the one who loved her.Money distorts the mind and often produces false priorities. Daisy was accustomed to a certain lifestyle and wanted luxuries more than love. She was not able to face realty and often retreated intoher money, which she thought would solve everything. For Jay, it was the idea that he could buy Daisy's love. He soon realized that if someone would not accept you for who you are, then they are not worth accepting. Daisy was in love with money, not Tom or Jay---\\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a document of an era, like the Rosetta Stone -- an artifact that, all on its own, permits us to decipher the words and meanings of another era. In this case the era is the Jazz Age, a time of promise and excitement, especially for young people intoxicated by its novelties. It's no easy thing to capture a moment like that, but Fitzgerald does it with remarkable fluidity, because his writing skills are simply unparalleled. You can open any page of this great book and revel in the sheer artistry of phrasing, the wit, the precision of description. Since it was published it has continually been enjoyed by generation after generation because it is the perfect snapshot of the moment. For an equivalent in later years, On the Road captures the 50's brilliantly. For contemporary times, the very best I've found is the remarkable Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which demonstrates ably that the concerns of the Jazz age -- fast living, young people grabbing the world by the throat and giving it a good shake -- are still with us. Great books from great writers, evoking eras perfectly."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Nick Carraway spends a summer learning about responsibility and romance as his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, begins an adulterous affair with a long-lost love, Jay Gatsby. This one-sentence plot summary does nothing to relay the considerable issues of the book. We learn that Jay Gatsby has a strong sense of romance--he is a product of the American Dream, where everything is possible as long as anything can be bought. He becomes a product of reputation, a carefully cultivated fictional past, and ready money at a time when established order has suffered a severe jolt from early twentieth-century ennui and loss of faith. Fitzgerald's analysis of shifting societal proprieties remains relevant as we begin our new century, but Jay Gatsby's yearning for a pure, enduring love makes this book timeless. If THE GREAT GATSBY isn't the greatest American novel, it must be in the top ten. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars? I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies. I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago. I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book. I was curious. It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one. It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I thought this book was really good. It was awesome. It showed that Fitsgerald is a great author. Out of the many characters in this book i found that Daisy was a very loving individual. She some times loved too much. which you will find out when u read the book, I give it two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I felt that The Great Gatsby was a good book. It definitely illustrates well the daily activities of life in the 1920's. There are many things that were happening at that time that influenced the plot of the book such as the war and the KKK. I enjoyed reading material by a new author. Fitzgerald does an incredible job of bringing to life the settings of the book, and he uses such vivid and colorful words to describe them. There are times when the novel could become a bit confusing as far as the time element was concerned, but Fitzgerald would usually give subtle hints to allow you to estimate around what time it was. I think that the book is a book that can be enjoyed by many different kinds of readers, and it is a good book to read if you are interested in getting a taste of life in the 1920's."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgeralsssd's The Great Gatsby is a commentary on the human pysche. What reasonable man would host expensive parties for an extended period of time, in the hopes a woman would hear about it and come? Did Gatsby need a shrink? I think so. I know that love will make you do strange things, but after Daisy ran over the woman in the road and insisted on going to her own home instead of Gatsby's, my man should have cut his losses. Gatsby vowed to take the blame for the hit-and-run, waiting in the pool for Daisy to call. Had he not met Daisy as a young man, what would he have lived for? It was sad to see someone's life so empty."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a complicated tale comprised of many themes which are all linked together in a very clever fashion. Nick Carraway is the title character, who is from Minnesota. The setting is the 1920s, and Nick has just moved East, to Long Island. His neighbor is man by the name Jay Gatsby, but as he later finds out, that name is false. Although Nick lives in the West Egg, his friends live in the higher-class East Egg. Daisy, his cousin, lives with her husband there. Nick discovers that Tom, Daisy's husband, is cheating on her, with a woman across town, Myrtle. Both Myrtle's husband and Daisy know nothing of the affair. Nick meets Jordan Baker via Tom and Daisy, and they have an intimate relationship. As the story progresses, more information is revealed about Gatsby, and how he knew Daisy from a long time ago. In fact the sole reason that he moved to New York was to be near Daisy. Gatsby's complex emotions are that of a man who obsesses with power and wealth. His vision is to achieve power and wealth, which he has done illegally, and to achieve Daisy, who symbolizes power and wealth. Tom finds out about Gatsby's affair with his wife and asserts himself; Daisy does go back with Tom. While Daisy was driving home with Gatsby, she ran down and killed Myrtle, her husband's lover. Gatsby took the rap for her, as he still loved her. Myrtle's husband got word of who made him a widower and then tracked down Gatsby and shot him. He also killed himself. Nick tried to hold a funeral for Gatsby, but hardly anyone attended. Thus, he realized that New York was no place for him and moved back to Minnesota.\\\\The most prevalent theme present in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is: \\"The grass isn't always greener on the other side.\\" Nick moved to Long Island in hopes of getting rich. However, he couldn't see past the mask of fame and fortune to the low level of morality. In the end, he realized that he would rather live a simple, honest life than get tangled up in a web of deceit in New York. This idea is enough to make anyone think, and so did I. I have always thought it would be cool to live in an extravagant life in a big city. Being from a rural Midwest town, such as Nick and Gatsby, I often ponder the opposite lifestyle. However, like the characters in the book, I am not sure that I could sacrafice my morals an honesty just for a mansion, a BMW, and a yacht. At first thought, I would say that, \\"yeah,\\" I could do without to get ahead, but after analyzing it, I bet I probably couldn't. This type of situation involving \\"the American Dream,\\" really does depend on the strength of the person who is put into it. In the case of Gatsby and Nick Carraway, they could not handle it.When looking at the \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the first time, the reader does not know that the title is actually quite ironic. Gatsby was acutally the opposite of great. He lied about his past to almost everyone he met, he changed his name, and he became a criminal just to get ahead. This is not a person who is great. Contradictorily, he was great in the eyes of the people who perceived him. Even Nick, who knew the whole story, still had a feeling of respect and liking towards Gatsby after his death. The ending was good in that it reflected the themes of the book. It was fairly complex and complicated, but it did finalize the story.I would recommend this book to more advanced readers. It contains a heavier vocabulary, and the theme are presented somewhat abstractly, but the story is great. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a classic book, and no one has an excuse not to read it. It really is an excellent story."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read this novel in high school. I found it slow, the characterizations fuzzy, and the plot uninvolving. Recently, I came across a copy that my stepdaughter had been required to read in high school. I decided to try it again.It is, of course, quite wonderful. Magical, Keatsian prose; masterful management of a complex narrative structure: wonderful impressionistic characterizations (The women are especially vivid.) If you read it in high school and were underwhelmed, I suggest that you give it another try.Incidentally, my stepdaughter didn't like it either--but I think she might in twenty years!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"As a high school student who read this for english class, I was naturally reluctant to like this book. However, I found that I actually can admire the incredible writing style Fitzgerald demonstrated. While I may not enjoy the plot, it is realistic and brings across the point of the book- to show how many americans had begun to veiw the world. While the bleak ending may not be my cup of tea, it was the way the story had to conclude. A happy ending would not have been a natural ending to the story. The Great Gatsby was one of the first books of its kind. Written in the Ninteen-twenties, it was a cynical and accurate look at american society's increasing preoccupation with wealth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a true classic, which you will enjoy is you are a fan of books containing love and tragedy. The book is very well written, and I loved The Great Gatsby because the story held my attention. The setting for The Great Gatsby is outside New York City, in the 1920s. The story is told by Nick Carraway, who is visiting his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom. When you read the book, you have something in common with most of the characters. At the beginning of the story, no one knows who Gatsby even is. That is a mystery everyone is trying to find out, and once you solve the mystery of Gatsby, you uncover a new mystery. This mystery includes Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. To solve these mysteries, you should read The Great Gatsby. F. Scott Fitzgerald did an excelent job with details. Everything that is described in the book, you can easily form a mental picture of; especially such things as Gatsby's house and Mr. Wilson's Garage. The Great Gatsby, somewhat, reminds me of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. Both Books involve the return of a long lost love, which was slightly secretive. Wuthering Heights is a little harder to follow then the Great Gatsby, but I enjoyed both of them. I recomend reading The Great Gatsby if you enjoy books that are exciting, suspensful, amusing, and tragic. What more could you ask for in a book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The favorite novel of romantics, it is put together like a mysterious machine from another world. Interestingly, movies can't get close to portraying Gatsby's passion. The code has never been broken by those who wish to trade on or exploit this tale. There are a couple of flaws in the marble, but that just adds to its mysterious greatness. This novel is read, and then re-read and then re-read. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", is narrated by the passive Nick Carrraway, who has recently settled into the West Egg section of Long Island, a decidedly less prestigious area than its East Egg counterpart. He has come to find his way in New York and to make his name known in the bond business. Nick's story, however, is not so much about himself as it is about his new neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gaudy mansion next door and hosts wild weekly parties to all of New York's upper crust. When Nick is brought into this fast-paced world, he must reexamine himself and the world he lives in.The novel is a classic examination of what it means to be a success the American Dream. As secrets unfold about the mythologized Gatsby, we discover that he has reinvented himself into the persona that he is, and that he is a man who is tormented by an idealistic vision of the woman he loves, and his desire to capture that woman for himself.Written in 1922, the novel is both a tragedy and a scathing indictment of the time of decadence that preceded the immediate economic upheaval and crash of 1929. Although it is situated very much in the context of the 20s and New York, it serves as a timeless story of a man's dream and the sometimes impossibility of those dreams."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"A couple of thoughts:1. Don't read this book, or any book, because you believe it to be \\"a classic.\\" That term is essentially meaningless, and the people who use it -- either as praise or blame -- generally don't have any souls. Really. And that is not a subjective opinion.2. Do read this book because, in doing so, you may learn things about the reality of America, the dream of America, dreaming itself and the beautiful emptiness of it, and perhaps even yourself. You may not learn all these things. You may, in fact, not learn any of them. And, frankly, you may not like the way the book is challenging your conception of yourself once you realize just how deeply it is doing so. But at the very least, even if you hate the book after you have read it, you will have exposed yourself to some thoughts that are, in and of themselves, quite beautifully expressed. Worse things can happen to you. And if the worst thing that ever happens to you is that you don't like a book, you'll be luckier than most.3. A lot of people have found in this book something worthwhile, although it hasn't always been (as evidenced by these reviews) \\"pleasure.\\" Some of those people may indeed be fools, and others of them may have been hornswaggled by the Evil American Culture Industry into thinking this book was more meaningful to them than, say, the Iliad. But, probably, the rest of them are just being honest. You might give them the benefit of the doubt.4. Likewise, a lot of people (albeit fewer of them, again as evidenced by these reviews) have found absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book. I encourage you to read their reviews, and then to press the \\"read the rest of my reviews button\\" to find out just how many of them prefer, say, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is, without a doubt, funnier) to this book. But, as in thought number 3 above, it is probably a mistake to generalize: certainly not all of the people who find this book valueless are unsophisticated, imaginationless, anti-intellectual, snobbish, or even just plain douchebags.It is remarkable, however, how often they sound that way.5. You may disregard thought 4 with respect to Luder of Saddam City. I'm pretty sure he/she IS a douchebag. And I reiterate: he/she really doesn't get the book. Or, I suspect, books generally. But he/she does seem to like Spanish an awful lot."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a fictional novel portraying the lives of wealthy young citizens of West and East-Egg, Long Island. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was his chance for something new. It was his chance for what he believed was greatness. Today the Great Gastby's name is synonymous with that of Fitzgerald's. Fitzgerald's novel includes love,mystery, and a myriad of events that would lead to downfall and tragedy.The story takes place around the jazz era. Nick, the narrator of the story is a young gentlman who comes out to the west into Long Island into a bonds business. He spends his summer with his cousin Daisy Bunchanan, her husband Tom Buchanan, and their friend/tennis star, Jordan Baker. Nick is fascinated by the mystery and lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, the topic of the story, is a man who had built an empire for himself which eventually like many empires, fall. As much as Gatsby is great, he is plagued with many rumors.Gatsby befriends Nick to get to his cousin Daisy whom he was once in love with five years ago before he had gone to war. He goes through many obstacles such as Daisy's husband Tom and his fear of rejection once again. It turns out that Daisy had rejected him in the past because he was too poor. Gatsby makes his way up top through some illegal activities accompanied by his friend Meyer Wolfshiem. For years Gastby had been hosting parties and moved to West Egg to lure Daisy and to meet her once again. After wising to the fact that Nick was her cousin he had found his trump card.However this novel does not end in fairy tale. It is more of a Shakespeareian play, a tragedy. Althoygh I'm more partial to happy endings, the twist in the story does very well suit it. The story is wonderfully pieced together, in storym plot, and ending but it lacks excitement. Maybe Fitzgerald was headed in the direction of simplicity but this is definitely too simplistic.I don't agree with Fitzgerald's title for the story. To my knowledge there was nothing great about Gatsby. He used people to his advantage like the way he used Nick to get to Daisy. To get Nicks help he would even in a manner, bribe him. Was it because he was rich and famous? He became rich through illegal acitvities such as bootlegging with shady figures such as Wolfshiem and he was just as famous as rumors about him were. There is nothing great about that struggling man. A more appropriate title would be \\"The Late Gatsby\\". He is dead inside.I found some parts of the story quite blurry and hard to understand. Was the role of Tom Buchanan a bad man or a good yet misunderstood man? Some say he's a brute but was his actions justifiable? I believe they were; he was only standing up for his wife. He does admit to loving his wife Daisy and tries to keep Gatsby away from her. Is he wrong for doing so? In one man's opinion he may be protecting his family from a home wrecker and in another man's opnion he may be blocking the starving lover from his candy of his eye.In the end I believe this isn't much of a reading material. I was easily bored. Maybe the story could have been more interesting had Fitzgerald created a much better narrator. Everything in this story wa pure descriptive. Although it was pieced together well, it lacked substance. Maybe this story would be more appealing to the older age groups but to keep interest in teenage readers, I would have to disagree. It is not really a bad story in terms of construction, just in the ability to maintain a reader's interest."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"There's so much critique-wise that could be said of this book. It's an entertaining, interesting story. The characters are so well-developed and their actions and words so consistent and unique throughout the novel that they seem so real. This is something most novels lack. Fitzgerald brings even the minor characters to life. The imagery and symbols are intricate, both serving to further the theme. The symbols are an integral part of the story, like Gatsby's car, which characterizes him as ostentatious and symbolically leads to his death. The characters themselves are symbolic. The story serves as a historical document of the 20's. The thematic material applies as much to our present society as it did back then. It is condensed, fitting so much meaning into each page, each sentence, each phrase. Much of the wording of the book is so memorable, so quotable, even magical. The Preface, Publisher's Afterward, and the Explanatory notes of this edition, as well as Cliff's Notes are very helpful to understand and appreciate this novel.The basic theme is that of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby is defined by his dream to win Daisy Buchanan, a popular, beautiful, but superficial girl. To win her, he needs exorbitant sums of money which he gains through corruption. Gatsby has all the \\"toys\\"-- a mansion, a Rolls-Royce, a hydroplane, and connections to people like Meyer Wolfsheif who fixed the 1919 World Series. Dan Cody circling the continent aimlessly in his yacht as he falls victim to alcohol shows that money is not an end in itself. Gatsby is different because money is only a means to an end for him; still, he fails. This book shows the harmful effects of a wide gap between the rich and the poor. The wealthy Buchanan's are not productive at all and the poor Wilson struggles to survive and is pushed around by Tom Buchanan. This book shows that such extreme wealth as Gatsby's and the Buchanan's leads to waste. Gatsby has a pool he only uses once all summer. He drives a Rolls-Royce which can cost over 300 grand in today's money. Daisy drives the car and accidentally kills Wilson's wife who was having an affair with Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband. Tom manipulates Wilson into thinking Gatsby killed her and Wilson shoots him then turns the gun on himself. The major theme of the novel is that \\"money isn't real\\" as the movie \\"Blow\\" put it. The material world is illusion, in other words. I've heard it said that \\"You can't buy happiness but you can rent it.\\" If that's true, then it helps explain Gatsby's failure-- he tried to, and thought he did, buy it.Gatsby's boyhood program for self-improvement as revealed by his dad at the ending is just like Ben Franklin's autobiography. Two self-help books I've read and reviewed negatively are \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie and \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. After reading Gatsby it seemed as though these two books were studied and practiced thoroughly by Jay Gatsby.First off, Gatsby's mannerisms resemble what is recommended in \\"Win Friends.\\" Gatsby is very indirect. He can't just go directly to Daisy or even directly to Nick to arrange the meeting between he and Daisy. He has Jordan tell Nick about the background between them then has Nick invite Daisy over to his house (he's Gatsby's neighbor) and tells him to tell her not to bring her husband. Gatsby then disappears outside when she comes and knocks on the back door. He must have looked like an idiot to Daisy being so ridiculously indirect and obvious like this. Gatsby even bought his house in the neighborhood of Daisy for this reason. Another aspect of Win Friends is to smile-- whether you are truthfully happy or not to charm other people into liking you. Consider Nick's description of Gatsby's smile, \\"It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it. It faced--or seemed to face-- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you, with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck...whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\" As is advised to do in \\"Win Friends\\", Gatsby makes other people feel special like the way he calls everyone \\"old sport.\\" But keep in mind Gatsby has no real friends and everyone but Nick merely uses him. They flocked to his mansion by the hundred for his parties but only a few people were at his funeral.The other Jay Gatsby handbook is \\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" by Anthony Robbins. I once saw Tony on TV and Jay Gatsby came to my mind before I realized it was him. I saw Tony's signature before and it was signed in a \\"majestic hand\\" just like Gatsby's writing on the note of invitation to his party to Nick. Throughout his book, Robbins writes of his accomplishments of making money and buying all the ostentatious \\"toys\\" like Gatsby has. Both men's obsession with materialism is so intense as to almost take on a spiritual level. Comparing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to these two books and the movies \\"Blow\\" and \\"Casino\\" are just some ways you can understand how Gatsby relates to our world now even though it was written about the 1920's.I don't feel a review of a 1000 word limit can possibly do justice to this novel. To appreciate it yourself, all the more I can say is read it, read Cliff's notes, think about it, read it again, and observe how the theme relates to the world around you very much today."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the horrifically real tale of people and lost dreams. The story takes place in New York in the 1930's -40's. The main charcter, Nick is a bondsman from Wisconsin who happens to move into a house nextdoor to the mysterious Jay Gatsby who throws extraveagnt parties nightly. Nick's summer in New York was a colorful menagerie of elaborate society where he meets his sweetheart and gets into some mixups with his cousin Daisy and Gatsby. Nick discovers after not too much time there is a reason why Gatsby's past is so elusive and that there is a very real and very powerful agenda on Gatsby's mind. The Great Gatsby was an awesome book. Fitzgerald has a bold voice in his writing and expresses abstrsct ideas in a very tangible form. It gave a tragic look into life and society of the East Coast and the forlorn hopes that people hold to in their minds. Gatsby was a pleasant read and the sentences seemed to contain so much substance that I found myself rereading a lot so I wouldn't miss anything. I read the authorized text, so it was identical to the original publication, so it was wholly preserved. I would reccommend this book as intriguing and enchanting to most."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I purchased this book for my high school lit class and found it to be a huge rip-off.

Fitzgerald seems to assume (rightly it would seem) that the mere evocation of fantastic wealth (shiny automobiles, lavish parties etc) will be fantastically interesting to his readers. A triumph of content over style if you ask me! Admittedly there are a few very brilliant passages, but overall I find the book's much-vaunted prose to be like iridescent steam, vapid and affected. There is precious little complexity of thought, and more of what I would call \`sentiment' than genuine emotion. The symbolism is laughably trite (to take just 3 examples : the green light on Daisy's side of the bay, characters in white, and - last but not least - the celebrated Valley of Ashes (Oh come on now ! Give us break!)). The characterization struck me as hollow, and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. Very rarely was I able to hear real men and women. I could go on, but after reading what other readers have said I feel like a voice in the wilderness..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book arrived on time and was as eexpected.

Although it seemed a little dull in the first few chapters, The Great Gatsby has a great impact on a reader. The symbolism and the story contrast with each other perfectly. It is an exciting heartfelt story that I was hesitant to read at first but I actually ended up reading most of it in one day, which I think is very unusual for a student like me. The Characters in the novel seem almost to real and the story if followed carefully has an overwhelming amount of symbolism and meaning. This book really suprised me.

Then i was asked to read it for my english class at school, so, i started again still convinced i would never reach the end. The beginning i found to be quite slow abd the overall plot never reaching a point of greatness. Even thouhgh this was not my favourite novel, i found something that i did enjoy. F.Scott Fitzgerald's style of writing cauhgt my attention on a number of occasions. He used a great deal of well placed symbolism in forms fo location, colours, the time period and also names. i am sure that a lot of thought nust have gone into this book before writing it. Fitzgerald did an excellent job of giving evreything a significant meaning, but he could have added his &quot;special tough&quot; to the situations throughout.

I finally decided to pick it up after the modern library listed as the number 2 book in the 19th century. I can see now why it is a classic. Fitzgerald's magnificent mastery of story telling had me entranced. This simple story set in the 20's moved me emotionally, and turned me into a Gatsby fan. This was a beautiful book about a misunderstood man, and it touched me. I am sincerely glad that I finally read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I believe THE GREAT GATSBY (that did not sell well in its day) is not Fitzgerald's best book. I think it has endured in academia because liberal professors like how it &quot;damns&quot; the American Dream. Gatsby tries to realize the American Dream by going from a poor boy to a rich man, and moving into high society. But he fails. (He never started down the American Dream trail anyway. Gatsby makes his money illegally, which is NOT the American Dream). Academics love when the American Dream is &quot;shown&quot; to be a house of cards. Then we can all embrace socialism. Fitzgerald actually wrote better short stories (especially &quot;Absolution,&quot; which, ironically, was originally a childhood scene for THE GREAT GATSBY, but cut out). And Fitzgerald's contemporary, John O'Hara, said about Fitzgerald's later novel TENDER IS THE NIGHT: &quot;Compared with TENDER IS THE NIGHT, THE GREAT GATSBY is greasy kid stuff.&quot; And O'Hara was absolutely right. TENDER IS THE NIGHT is a much better novel. Ernest Hemingway even thought TENDER IS THE NIGHT was Fitzgerald's best novel. GATSBY ain't bad, but if you want to read the best of Fitzgerald, check his other work out first."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel has a certain magnetism, a certain style that the author used to beautify and immortalise the mundane aspects of life and glorify them forever in our memory; aesthetic language is the manuscript of this amazing opus..In this case, it is a sweet lullaby that came from the 1920's, a most singular era potrayed to us through the eyes of a virtuous writter, F.Scott.Fitzgerald; He gave life to an era and wings to its cast, creating a world full of surreal parties, dusty limbos and glamourus automobiles.Yet it is surely through the special appeal of its language that the novel makes its first claim on our interest; for it it is a highly poetic novel, with strong, powerful, touching evocations that make our senses submerge and transmigrate into a perpetual limbo.The novel is strung together by motifs that appear and return, lingering in our mind for future innuendosIn a society, accidents happen and are taken for granted, but as they multiply in the book, they reveal a whole new meaning in which cars are merely futile excuses for careless driving with no moral or ethical directions at all.Irresponsability is the essence, the fuel on which this nemesis drives on, running over anything without any regret but expecting that someone ( the white trash ) will always clean after them.It is as if the 1920's were just pleasent cocktail waves impregnated with the mezmerising sounds of jazz, catalysed in the anarchy of charleston's moodThis were the parties Gatsby hosted, were all the USA intoxicated themserlves with champagne and sinecures, merely to sober up and presence the reality of the hangoverGatsby merely intended to extend the curfew, in order not to face the reality of his anguish, the slow trepidation of time's forgotten realm, showing itself as an incubus that would end the dream....his dreamGatsby wanted to trascend time, and to him time appeared submissive to his wealth and power, as he tried to recreate the past, the american dream, holding the clock's wrath aimlessly and in vain against his hopes, desires and aspirations, leading to his destruction while the others,&quot;the foul dust that floated on the wake of his dreams&quot; lingers on forever, covering meaningless actions in a meaningless worldBut soon the 20's would sail etheraly into the past with all its cast viciously darkened by the definite crash"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby was a great novel and one that everyone who has read this, will remember. I truly believed that it defined and era of our country. The extravagant parties and tea times. Gatsby's tragic flaw although was the fact that he loved Daisy and fell in love with her once again, too easily. Daisy, I feel had no respect for Gatsby, especially after his death. Not going to your lovers funeral is the worst flaw anyone can possess. I feel sorry for Gatsby and hope that this never happens to anyone close to me. Everyone who said and acted like they were his friends truly weren't. I also feel very sorry for Nick Carrawy because he has to witness a great man st and alone and still be happy in the process. Gatsby's book also describes the era of the 20's very well. He has been known to define the Jazz age and th era. Affer doing some basic work on the 20's, it shows that it really does describe alot of the time period. Gatsby's place in life was not showed through his work. His life suffered more hard work than Gatsby ever could. I think that through his works he tried to portray his life in a way that he wish it would have went."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At this point a wide variety of teachers have been teaching me English, in one form or another, for the last 12 years or so. I have often heard some of those teachers describe &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as an American literary classic, but I haven't had the opportunity to read the story until now. One reason is that a novel like &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; written in 1925 didn't exactly appeal to the average teenager at these earlier stages of education. Another, more valid, reason is that we probably wouldn't have understood it anyway.At first sight &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; seems to be a long story about nothing in particular except for an obscene amount of parties. It turns out though that the story contains multiple levels of observation on the American society during the &quot;roaring twenties&quot;, as well as more general reflections over human nature and even philosophical and theological points.A thing I find interesting about &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, is the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, because this says a great deal about Gatsby. During the story three different images of Gatsby are transmitted to the readers. At first Gatsby is portrayed as a decent and noble Oxford man who has made himself a fortune in ways unknown to us and with a lot of things going on. He gives great parties and even though several of his guests perceive him as a somewhat mystical figure who isn't quite what he seems to be - some even suggest that he killed a man or acted as a German spy during the war - he stands out as the perfect host. Later it turns out that he actually does have a lot of things going on, though not exactly of the reputable kind.The truth is that he participated in the war and came out as a highly decorated officer. After the war however his decorations could not buy food or clothes and by coincidence he met Meyer Wolfsheim, who had just the right thing for him...So Gatsby is actually in the business of bootlegging. Having established that, it would be easy to write him off as a liar and a common - although wealthy - criminal. This image of him is softened though by the observation, that he did it for love. In fact it seems that everything in his life revolves around one person, namely Daisy.It turns out that Gatsby and Daisy know each other from five years earlier, when they were a couple and were actually going to marry each other. Gatsby was madly in love with Daisy and she loved him too, but when he was in Europe during the war, she eventually got a little bit desperate and wanted her life to take on a steady and reassuring direction - I would imagine that her parents had something to do with it as well. Consequently she married Tom Buchanan, who was extremely wealthy and an impressive physical presence as well. This explains Gatsby's actions to a certain extent, since it is obvious that the only purpose of his extravagant house is to impress Daisy.This is seen in the situation where Gatsby has Nick Carraway arrange a meeting with Daisy at Nick's - a rather embarrassing session at first that ends up with Gatsby giving Daisy the super-extended deluxe grand tour of his house. During the tour Gatsby perceives his own home through Daisy's eyes and generally does everything to seem interesting, for instance when asked how he can stand living in the house alone: &quot;I always keep it full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.&quot; It is not a coincidence either that he bought his house with a view across the water to where Daisy lives. At the end of the dock she has a green light that shines all night, which takes on a great deal of significance since it symbolises the distance between Daisy and himself.The span of water between Gatsby and the light (also great symbolism in itself, isn't it?) could be compared to the actual distance in emotion and time. Now he has met with her, talked to her and touched her. She has seen his home and given her approval, so the gap has closed and the light is just a light again. Or is it? The light could be any colour, but it is green which has always meant &quot;full speed ahead&quot;. So since the distance between Gatsby and the light has closed due to his recent entering the same high social class as Daisy, he is now worthy of her love, in his own eyes and apparently hers as well.So the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy has come full circle. Jay Gatsby's appearance towards his surroundings is built up on lies upon deceit and e.g. the large and wild parties are only meant to capture the attention of Daisy.Another thing that I find interesting in this story is the mentioning of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. After the death of his wife George Wilson states that &quot;God sees everything&quot; while looking specifically at the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg indicating that Eckleburg should or could be interpreted as God. He is, however, just an old billboard advertising for an optometrist - faded after not having been painted for a long time and brooding over a dumping ground . The symbolism is pretty clear. The presence of God is faded in the society described and the society as seen by God i.e. those who believe, is deranged - a dumping ground.As for George Wilson he says: &quot;...you can't fool God&quot; and &quot;God sees everything&quot; but the question he must be asking himself is, if God sees everything, why did he not stop Myrtle Wilson from running out in front of the car? Maybe that is why God is symbolised only by a pair of huge eyes - because He let go of the steering wheel years ago and has now retreated to the role of the observer. Omnipotence replaced by omniscience. Anyway Wilson decides to lend God's eyes a pair of hands, but manages - with a little help from Tom Buchanan - to kill the wrong man.Importance is in the mind of the beholder - a historian would find other aspects of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; interesting than I have. Interpreting this story, I found it exciting to work with the whole relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The story of how his love for her gave birth to his ambitions and consequently his wealth hold faint reminiscence of Greek tragedy. It stands parallel to Fitzgerald's own life, where he could not marry Zelda Sayre until he had achieved some success and wealth , and even Fitzgerald's description of the wild life is somewhat autobiographical. In the story Daisy moves away with her husband, while in real life Fitzgerald was separated from Zelda because she was suffering from a severe mental illness.The passages about T.J. Eckleburg are a fine way of giving a hint that this wild life and social shallowness is actually leading nowhere - also illustrated by the fact that only three persons attend Gatsby's funeral - his father, Nick Carraway and the man with the owl-eyed glasses. He is the only other person who has taken the time to scratch the surface of Gatsby as a human being, symbolised by his opening the books in Gatsby's library instead of just assuming that they would be empty shells . This suggests that a man's legacy could be measured by the number of people by his grave rather than in parties or hard currency."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"How is it possible to label as &quot;underappreciated&quot; a book that is routinely included in the American literary canon? Understand this: _Gatsby_ forced its way into the canon--with the pellucid beauty of its prose and the undeniable resonance of its theme--against the wishes of many, if not most, in the critical intelligensia. In his time, Fitzgerald was regarded as a talented but irresponsible lightweight, a writer who dissolved his unique gift in expensive gin. Today, his lifetime reputation as a dissolute drunkard continues to tarnish his litarary legacy, particularly in comparison to the other two members of the Trinity of 20th Century American Literature, Hemingway and Faulkner. With some exceptions (most notably the fanatically devoted Matthew Bruccoli), critics and academics continue to regard Fitzgerald's work of love, wealth, and dreams as a shade beneath Hemingway and Faulkner, with their more gaudily &quot;literary&quot; themes of mortality, family, and death. But _Gatsby_ makes liars and fools of those who remain intent on observing only a chronicler of the gin-soaked privileged classes. Yes, there is wealth, and parties and cars and stars, but _Gatsby_ is a book that rewards not only the dazzling first read, but repeated readings. Of course, the book features some of the best of Fitzgerald's spectacular, inimitable prose style, which even detractors acknowledge as unmatched in its poetic grace. But there is much more underneath the fine finish, where so many have failed to look, distracted by the glossy exterior. Dreams, ambition, financial and moral corruption, love real and imagined, morality, success, failure and death: these are _Gatsby_'s themes, the themes of the American story--and are there bigger themes in Hemingway's bullfights and war, or Faulkner's incest and insanity? Modern critics continue to insist that Fitzgerald understood only a certain class and time, but this assessment suffers from a failure of the vision and imagination that Fitzgerald possessed in abundance. The very slightness of the plot of _Gatsby_ facilitates its analogy to contemporary America. Just imagine how easy it would be for Hollywood to remake _Gatsby_ as a modern tale of a boy from the ghetto rising through raw ambition and illicit means, chasing a dream he left behind that was never within his reach. In fact, Hollywood has made that movie, a hundred times over, because it is the prototypical American story, applicable to any time or place in the nation's history. _Gatsby_ is really a perfect, particular retelling of the most enduring story in American mythology"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Few books can be as consistently incredible as Gatsby. The idea of astockbroker/promoter who has a heart must send chills of fear downthe managers of the great Wall Street firms. Yet, it is so, and isdecisively the realm of fiction.Gatsby is the prototypical social mountaineer, climbing and climbingin the 1920s towards an impossible dream: having the love of a flipand indecisive Southern gal, and being accepted for who he dreams hemay be within his questing heart. Like the best American novels itis replete with greed, over consumption of limited goods, graced bya cynical narrator, and clever in its jaded appraisal of life.Ultimately the book comes down to one central issue that is notexplained: &quot;Why would a great man have so much love for a selfishlyundeserving woman?&quot; Gatsby has grandeur but his love has nothing.It's a spoiled book in that sense, and without the quality of virtuein Daisy, the book becomes a cruel mistake that can only end in death.Fitzgerald's style is elegant, brief, he never makes mistakes injudgment, and his narrative is impeccable. The book rushes forwardlike a Greek tragedy and ends just as Sunset Boulevard begins: withGatsby dead in a pool killed by that which he loved. Somehow thereis some great truth in the idea that in great American fiction theuse of coincidence is always deadly, and satisfaction never easy.Plato would have used the book as an exemplar in his proof of theideal, Aristotle would have merely laughed, yet inwardly agreed -the book is a cautionary tale; but more importantly hagiography.....C.K.

The book is a miniature version."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is the tale of an aloof narrator caught up in adultery and murder in a 1920s America flush with new money. The novel has been touted as a mirror of its age, a meditation on the loss of a basic humanity in the midst of economic prosperity, and even the summit of American prose writing in the 20th century.In fact, I must confess that I find THE GREAT GATSBY a sometimes tiresome soap opera that never manages to make that leap to great novel. The novel can be read to the end, and even often enjoyed. There's a decent bit of humour, and clearly some elements have been original enough to sink into the public consciousness. However, those elements that are so often referenced -- Gatsby's unrequited love, Nick's disgust with what he sees -- always sound more profound when detached from the actual text with its contrived turns, unrealistic dialogue and the occasional (and generally unsuccessful) try at poetic metaphor.All in all, THE GREAT GATSBY belongs in that list of books one must read to be an informed person, but for which one should steel oneself for the disappointment that may come."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book because I'm trying to read a lot of the classics on the various \\"Top 100\\" book lists floating around out there.

Daisy seemed hardly worth all the trouble Gatsby took, and for that matter, neither did entry into her world. She was a cipher. The use of a narrator to connect the various characters was interesting; how could the book have been written otherwise? But at times the plot felt contrived, as with the switching of cars and an accident, and the symbolism around the valley of ashes seemed heavy-handed. Other than the passive narrator, the people lacked even a small degree of self-awareness. The one who seemed the least conflicted and most sure of himself was the brutal, self-centered Tom.It was the lesser details in this novel that were enjoyed most. A montage at the end of the second chapter in which the drunken narrator moved from an elevator, to a bedroom, to Penn Station. How Gatsby's smile affected those who saw it. A mansion housing a library of books with their pages uncut. The vapidity of a man who tried to act out his limited idea of the good life but had little of interest to say and thought San Francisco was in the Middle West. Dogged efforts at self-improvement linked to shallow goals. A shady character eating with \\"ferocious delicacy.\\" The way Daisy conveyed her love for a character in just a few words said lightly in front of her husband. The class disdain someone like Tom felt for the main character -- he couldn't be an Oxford man because he wore a pink suit. The gust of hot shrubbery from Central Park wafting through the upper windows of the Plaza Hotel. The author's description of how it felt to reach 30.

I didn't really expct it to be that good, but I can say it's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a classic piece of literature by F. Scott Fitzgerald! The story of love lost, found and lost again, the beautiful language will touch the heart and mind. It's amazing how simple things were back when Fitzgerald wrote this - the book isn't very long, and it speaks of so much: love, jealousy, tolerance, sacrifice, abuse, the inability to admit fault or appreciate what you have, the very essence of the American dream to become who you want to be.This book is like an old black and white movie where men were men. It's entertaining, but the author allows you to think for yourself and draw your own opinions rather than spoon-feeding you a story with the desire to sway your judgment toward his own. I was really amazed at how the writing captured my attention and imagination so thoroughly that a couple of written lines could produce the graphic images of a horrific car accident in my mind's eye.This is truly a thinking man's book and a must read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When F.Scott Fitzgerald finished up this novel in Paris, he was a man with his hands full. Zelda was beginning to show signs of mental deterioration and infidelity, and his cavorting and hell-raising left behind a wake of bad reputation in the social set he used to party hearty with. He was a bit old for such shenanigans to be tolerated anymore.This is reflected in The Great Gatsby. What is also reflected, and refined, is the paradox of an American trying to live to the ideal vested in the grail known as the American Dream. Fitzgerald was indeed talented and lucky as a young writer, but he was also undisciplined and still seeking to \\"prove himself.\\"It is refreshing, upon perhaps my third read in about 10 years, to realize that none of the characters are meant to be likable. They all have shadows and weaknesses of character. Though the narrator tries to portray himself as an innocent; an outsider, he is culpable as much as Tom Buchanan for the events following the climax of the book. This is important, and had I realized it earlier, it would've served me as I passed through the ages exhibited by the characters in the book.As with America itself, there may be ugliness, indifference, and malice in some Americans. They are, after all, people. Yet people love America despite these bad apples. Their affection more to do with what America means...what it meant to stand for. what it has hoped to be from its inception.Hope carries the dream. Hope endures even beyond what others would deem \\"reasonable.\\" Hope transcends age.Hope is Gatsby's specialty.Read this book and feel for yourself the quality Fitzgerald describes as \\"vitality,\\" and never take it for granted again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Simply put, Gatsby is a perfect book.

It is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbour and trusted confidante. The story follows Nick as he embarks on a new life in New York. Slowly, but surely Nick gets to know his neighbour; the flamboyant, ridiculously wealthy Jay Gatsby who is madly in love with Daisy Buchanan. The love story between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan perfectly portrays the infatuation and obsession of first love.Fitzgerald's beautiful writing and incredible character descriptions immediately drew me into the story while the plot kept me glued to every page.

And I like much more than the first time reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't think I am capable of putting to words what I thought of this novel.The Great Gatsby is a jazzy tale that takes place in 1920's America and revolves around seven characters: Jay Gatsby, impeccable host with a past unknown to many, in love with naive, superficial and materialistic Daisy Buchanan. Daisy, in turn, married herself to Tom Buchanan for the sole purpose of continuing to lead a life of privilege. Tom is an egotistic, adulterer, whose latest mistress is none other than the mechanic's wife, Myrtle Wilson. The mechanic, George Wilson, is good friends with Tom, and is none the wiser about this affair. Jordan Baker, a golfer and Daisy's friend, is aware of everything that's happening, and brings in narrator, and neighbour of Gatsby, Nick Carraway into the picture.In a strange turn of events, Nick becomes a close friend and confidante of Gatsby. Gatsby is now a very wealthy man who lives in a mansion and holds daily parties that go on until the early hours of the morning, in the hopes that one day, Daisy would walk in through the doors. With Nick's help, Daisy and Jay meet again, and the romance is instantly rekindled. However, in The Great Gatsby, it isn't a matter of all's well that ends well.This story really makes me sad. A very charming man, Jay Gatsby wanted nothing more in this world than to be with Daisy. Daisy on the other hand is torn between wanting love, and wanting to remain with Tom and her comfortable existence. I wasn't very surprised with the ending, as I saw it coming. But I was surprised at the reaction of all the people that surrounded Gatsby, and angry at quite a few of them.Definitely a must-read.

Then I read it again many years later (when I came to live on Long Island) and only then fully appreciated.It is pointless to try to re-tell the plot here, because the complicated character of Gatsby (a truly American self-made man who never forgot his love, but with a secret in his past) and the simplicity and shallowness of Daisy and Tom are revealed in a sequence of events that has to be uncovered step by step.And still I feel that Fitzgerald caught without any mistake or hesitation the atmosphere of that time in America between wars, the people who could be either fully aware or careless and childish.

F. Scott Fitzgerald has given us a timeless treasure to read and enjoy time and time again. The illusion of grandeur &amp; the disillusion of marriage coupled with the search for love, happiness, The American Dream, as well as the imperceptibly foreboding desire to rekindle the past all make The Great Gatsby an incredibly entertaining, yet highly enigmatic, masterpiece of a novel.No one can deny the greatness of F. Scott Fitzgerald. No author since has had the unique gift of such masterful and captivating use of the English language - combined with unparalleled social insight into his age and time. The excessively lavish and glitzy, yet highly impersonal, fetes of Gatsby, make one feel as if one is in attendance partaking in the debauchery - thanks to the effortless and fluid prose of Fitzgerald.

If you do decide to read it in a more in-depth manner, you will see Fitzgerald's story as one of the &quot;American Dream.&quot; The characters are striving for money, love, success and guarantees. They often try to be something on the outside that they really aren't on the inside. The story is told from a rather minor character's point of view and this enables the reader to come to many of his or her own conclusions. The narrator is also easily relatable.

However, the book had already gone to press and it was too late to change the title at that point. The reason I mention this is that I believe Nick Carraway is actually the most interesting and compelling character in the novel, contrary to popular belief. Fitzgerald set a standard for narration with this novel - a larger-than-life character seen from the less-biased view of a narrator who is eventually drawn into the novel's plot (as seen in &quot;All the King's Men&quot; and &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;,and even the film &quot;Wall Street&quot; among others). By the end of the novel, the reader comes away with a compelling and solid portrait of the Midwesterner, Nick Carraway (note, carraway seeds are in rye bread, a Midwestern association), who goes East, finds it &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;, and eventually returns to his roots. The novel is about the American Dream in general, and it is incredibly ironic to call Gatsby &quot;great&quot;, as he is shown to be a slave to love and ambition, whereas Nick is a much stronger man in the end. Nick is the only one who changes throughout the course of the novel, and therefore while he is not as outwardly flashy as Gatsby, he is the one who keeps the reader's interest in the end, as he comes to the same conclusions that we hope we would come to in a similar situation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a story of a man who is very rich and could buy anything he wants. But the only thing that he wants is his past love Daisy. Daisy is now unhappily married to Tom Buchanan, who is also very wealthy. Daisy is caught between her true love Gatsby and her husband Tom. Gatsby's quest to capture the love of his one and only Daisy leads to heartbreak and conception.Fitzgerald does an excellent job in portraying the mood of the roaring twenties. Gatsby's parties are described very well and all the events show this time period. Fitzgerald also shows the lifestyles and the characteristics of the time period of all three classes of society. The three classes shown where Gatsby and the Buchanans as the upper class, Nick Carraway as the middle class, and The Wilson's of Asheville as the lower class. The second thing that Fitzgerald does well is capturing the reader's attention. The character Jay Gatsby is a very handsome and rich and is left very mysterious by Fitzgerald. This mystery of such a character draws the reader into the book. Later in the novel the reader attention is obtained by tragic and unpredictable events. One part where the author may not have succeeded in his purpose was showing how Gatsby obtained the &quot;American Dream&quot;. The novel talks about how Gatsby is so successful, yet Fitzgerald never even mentions directly what he does for a living. Overall Fitzgerald is successful in portraying not only the characteristics and lifestyles of the time but also turning it into a popular novel that is very interesting."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"After several years of hesitation, I finally read Fitzgerald's classic at the end of which I couldn't help but wonder what the fuss is all about. Suffice to say that the book is probably more famous for what it represents than the literary value of its contents. The plot is trivially simple and at times over-dramatised. The saving grace comes in the form of the spare and lucid writing, and the Roaring 20s' atmosphere that is essentially the central theme of the book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I did not like this book at all. I know it is a classic,but not for me. All that happens is that they have parties gfet drunk and have another party"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I got this a for a special class in the novel. It arrived in a timely manner and in perfect shape. The book is a wonderful story.It was made into a movie in 1973 with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Good choices for the characters in the book. It will come out again as a remake in summer 2013 with Leonardo DiCaprio. Should be a winner. Read the book first and you will find the movie much more satisfying. Of course the book is taught as a classic in American Literature in thousands of high schools and universities every year. Annual sales now are greater than the total sales during the authors entire lifetime! Nice income for his only daughter I think."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Brings back memory of reading in High School. I have very different recollection of the story from the view of a teenager vs a grown adult.Still a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Reviewing \\"The Great Gatsby\\" feels a bit presumptuous and for sure somehow redundant. What can one say that has not been said already about this seminal story?To avoid being totally repetitive I will start with some personal perspective. I read this book the first time as a teenager in my native Bucharest, at a time when I knew little about life in general and almost nothing about New York or United States. When I finished reading, I was left with the impression that this was about some people quarreling after a car accident. What a difference 40 years make. Reading it now, I felt great empathy for the plight of the characters and I believe I recognized at least some of the universal themes pursued by the author. It seems to me that Fitzgerald advances here a very pessimistic premise about people's behavior and what they can expect from life, namely that those who are self-absorbed or just selfish will always end up better off than those who, in pursuit of valid or absurd dreams, insist on fighting the reality on behalf of their dreams.As we follow the story, Gatsby's dream of recapturing the lost love of his youth, Myrtle's dream of becoming a respectable bourgeois matron, Wilson's dream of being a successful business owner, all become vehicles for the ultimate destruction of those who dream them. In the meantime the monumentally insensitive Tom and the cowardly shallow Daisy continue to prosper in the big city, not perturbed in the least by their heavy responsibility for what has just happened. Learning his lesson, the narrator, Nick , gives up on his dream of becoming a well-adjusted East Coast money man and decides to go back home to Mid-West.Some people will see here a class contrast element. After all, Tom and Daisy are rich while their unintended victims are low or lower class. I believe that the essence of the story transcends class. In my experience, people like Tom and Daisy can be found in all strata of society, irrespective of income or status.The pleasure of reading this book is enhanced by Scott Fitzgerald wonderful gift for using little details like a gesture, a word, a simple noise or a clever comment by the narrator in order to bring depth to his characters and advance the story. \\"The Great Gatsby\\" effortlessly transports us to the \\"roaring twenties\\" in New York City, a time and place of great optimism and sudden prosperity for many. The author viewpoint is less rosy. He spots human frailty and suffering even in the middle of the most lavish settings. In a symbolic way, Daisy's car crash portends historical events still to come. Ability to prophesize aside, Fitzgerald remains himself a product of the era. Within the story, he casually stereotypes Jews as shadowy money grubbing characters with hairs coming out of their noses and he is not above using variations of the \\"n\\" word when he thinks necessary. No matter; this is a remarkable novel, one of those ten or twenty essential books that everyone should read before claiming they know anything about human nature. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is one of the most lively short stories I've picked up. Fitzgerald did an excellent job of putting life into these characters and the setting they are placed in. It really gives the reader an idea on how New York living was like back in the early 1920's."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is simply an Amazing classic... Great book every time you read it, just read it again after a couple of years and it was even better than the first time"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Reader could have been a little more animated, instead of somewhat monotonous. I am a teacher and played it for my students as they followed along. Unfortunately, the first cd skipped in a few places."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I finished reading this book for the first time last week. I usually review the books I read here, but since this book is closing in on being 100 years old, is required reading in many American AP high school English courses and most likely everything that could possibly be said about it by the human race, positive and negative, has been said by reviewers of higher importance than I, I thought it would be silly to review it.But here's this: I liked it. I liked it quite a lot. As much as I read, it's almost absurd that I hadn't gotten to this one sooner, but I'm glad I read it at this age because I almost surely wouldn't have appreciated it in it's fullness if I'd read it in high school.My wife recently read it for the second time (and she loves it), and though our taste in books is usually pretty far from similar, she insisted I really ought to give it a whirl. I was in the mood for something older and in the modern classic realm, so here we are.I have to say it went by fast. I mean, it's a short novel; less than 200 pages. But I daresay once things get cooking (once Gatsby actually enters the novel, basically), it's almost written in a jumpy, quick-moving way. Sure, there are moments of quiet beauty and reminiscence, but the party scenes are perfect depictions of swirling chaos from loud-mouthed, gossipy rich people from the perspective of a man who largely keeps to himself. I love how well the tone of the dialogue encapsulates the time period and suggests that most of the folks were talking just to hear their own voices, responding with answers that had nothing to do with the previous speaker, and no one really listened and no one really cared (again I'm referring primarily to the rich folks at the parties... not necessarily Gatsby or the other main characters, though Daisy shows some hints of this high-living arrogance).This is getting dangerously close to a review (MAY IT NEVER BE, GAINES!!), so I'll wrap up. I reckon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it. That being said, I'm fairly certain I'll revisit this book somewhere down the road."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel would be a great addition to your collection of books read. The great Gatsby is written in manner that is relatable to the reader. The first time I read The Great Gatsby I was in high school. I found it to be a great masterpiece that I couldn't cope with putting down. (I even cried at the end...which never happens). I read It again as I entered college and it blew my mind away. It was pure magic and left me astonished by the language and the bittersweet romance of the hopeful but desperate Jay Gatsby vying for the affection of a married woman but his one and only true love. It seems like every time I reread this novel, I find another flawless element that always keeps me wanting to read even though I already know what happens.I recommend The Great Gatsby for all high school students because high school is a time in your life that one starts to find true deception in everyday life that can be very relatable while reading this novel. High school is a time where deception is laden and you have to find out who you really are and identify what is fake and what is real. Also, when you re read this this book at a later point in your life, you will find different elements every time that will inspire you to pick up this book many more times throughout your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby could be stated as one of the greatest pieces of literature. Everyone should experience the world of Fitzgerald's writing.Fitzgerald created the characters with distinct personalities. He lets the reader feel strong sympathy for each character. In contrast, some readers may believe the characters are too exaggerated and seem unrealistic such as Daisy Buchanan. However, I believe exaggerated parts are necessary for the interesting plot.Jay Gatsby could be announced as one of the main characters. His perseverance to love one girl for a long time is very admiring. However, his dream of reuniting with Daisy crushes when he comes back and sees her with another successful man. When the reader finds out of his struggle, the reader starts feeling sympathy for him and realizes that money cannot solve everything. It is depressing to see Gatsby hold on to the past, thinking he could re-live it. Gatsby's idealistic characteristic as well as his wrongful idea of money buying happiness wins favors from his audience as well as myself and teaches us a real life lesson.The theme that money does not buy happiness is clearly apparent. Gatsby's character progression portrays how money cannot always bring the most desired, finding happiness. He thought prosperity could get him what he wanted, a common mistake that people in the modern society uphold. Many of us think money is all you need, that fortune could bring us joy in this money-oriented society. Wealth could bring us happiness to a certain extent; it cannot buy values that can only be obtained through experience. When he comes back as a prosperous man, he is shocked by the fact that his absence had caused Daisy to be with another man.The story was full of ups, downs and un-expectancies with an irony, which kept the reader wanting to continue on to the next page. Everyone who has read the book already could happily agree that it is hard to find a stopping point due to its intensity revolving around the characters and the stories they create. The overall language Fitzgerald uses in the novel defies typical comprehensive characteristics of an intelligent composition by making the book easier to follow yet still containing a higher-level reading."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book was used, but it was in great conditions. It only had a name on the outside, & it had minor signs of wear. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Overrated. None of the characters have any real depth. The descriptions often seem vague, as if the writer thinks he's being profound. The plot's fine, a bit soap-y.

F Scott Fitzgerald's language is so proper and educated that most people will have to read the book multiple times in order to begin to understand it. The language, in my view, is poetic in form. It may be hard to interpret, but once you understand it, it is one of the greatest American novels every written. Make sure you have time to read the book several times before you decide to embark on the adventure.Zachary B.

Nick, the main character and narrator, felt a little detached from the rest of the plot and, while now that it's over I appreciate the story being told from an outside perspective, didn't make much sense with the role he played in the story.

From the beginning I had a feeling that something is different about this book than any other book I have everread. So, it became the first book ever which I read first page to last page. I really liked that how the theme of American Dream is presented throughout the novel. Ireally admired the main character Gatsby since he gives up everything for his love, but in return he has to lose his life. The reason why I loved this book so muchwas that the dedication of Gatsby for the goal of his lifetime and the hard work he did for that. This book is really inspirational. It also talks about the AmericanDream of people. Additionally, it also mentions the changes in the values in the 1920s. I would definitely, recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a reallygood book to enjoy and also to learn.Sorry for ruining the story for you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a beautiful masterpiece. Fitzgerald gleefully dances the line between prose and poetry in an intriguing and delightful manner. He creates a collage of the human condition: love, romance, hatred, kindness, evil, deceit, loneliness, emptiness. The book also has great humor, unforgettable characters and an interesting plot. It's real miracle though is Fitzgerald's unassailable command of the English language. If you buy it in kindle form don't buy the cheaper version. It's words are broken up and all over the page. It will drive you crazy trying to read it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It is a short book, less than 200 pages, and the writing is fluid, so you can easily finish it in a couple of hours. On the surface it is about rich people's folly -- Gatsby's failed attempt to resurrect the past with money. But it is more than that; it cuts deep into the pitfalls of the Jazz Age: that easily gotten money is easily parted with, that money can buy everything. It is interesting to know that Fitzgerald wrote this book in the middle and at the height of the roaring 20s, portentous of the house of cards that was about to crumble in the next decade. The writing in this book has a liquid, even luminous quality to it, and it is quite remarkable that after more than 80 years it still has a degree of modernity and it does not feel antiquated at all."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books of all time.

Written in 1925 at the height of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby expertly captures the 1920s and all its excesses.As Nick Carraway begins this intriguing tale wherein wealth and gayety mask underlying tragedy, Gatsby is presented as an enigmatic character. No one really seems to know who Gatsby is or where he obtained his fortune. Because of that knowledge vacuum, multiple myths concerning the man circulate, growing more fantastic with each telling.But ultimately, Nick and the reader learn that Gatsby is a mere mortal whose inner life is a less than satisfying one and whose moment in the sun is destined to be short-lived.

I would recommend Gatsby for all ages. It's full of life, love, and mystery."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Recently I reread The Great Gatsby because I had some free time and it's been a few years since I read it back in high school. When I originally read The Great Gatsby I wasn't overly impressed by it, but I thought maybe it was because I was in high school. However, to my surprise, my opinion hasn't changed much. I wanted to like it, but the end result was just ok.The \\"main\\" character of the novel is a man named Nick Carraway. I put main in quotes because up until the end of the book his role, in my opinion, is pretty insignificant. Sure, he narrates the book and he arranges the tea meeting with Gatsby and Daisy, his cousin, but the character honestly feels like an empty vessel. One that you want to like because he's supposed to be the main character, but someone who feels genuinely unimportant. The same can be said about pretty much all the characters in the book. Gatsby, for instance, is probably the most likable. Everything he does he does because of his love for Daisy. Essentially the entire story is about Gatsby, but Fitzgerald doesn't take the time to properly flesh out his character, or any of the other characters for that matter. I think most of my distaste for the novel came from Fitzgerald's approach to writing.The novel is most enjoyable when we are going through the main story, but Fitzgerald constantly ruins the flow by having flashbacks right in the middle of the action. Towards the end of the book he starts switching back and forth so much that I found it difficult to follow along at first. Now these flashbacks are technically important because they give the reader some more insight into the characters, but they all seemed to be placed at the most inopportune time. Plus, Fitzgerald's style of writing during these sections changes dramatically from engaging to extremely dull.My biggest complaint has to be the way Fitzgerald structures his sentences. Maybe this was the way to write back then, but in today's world it's extremely uncomfortable. It isn't smooth and it isn't easy on the eyes. Instead of saying, \\"My favorite colors are blue, yellow, green, and red.\\" Fitzgerald would put, \\"My favorite colors are blue and yellow and green and red.\\" In case you don't believe me here's an excerpt from page 40: \\"By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.\\" It's like the man never learned how to properly use a comma. Couple that with his insistent need to hyphenate everything, \\"to-night, to-morrow, good-by\\", and you're bound to leave a chapter with a headache or two. Lastly, Fitzgerald found it necessary to include an overabundance of similes and metaphors that felt both forced and unnatural. It's not a huge gripe like the commas or the hyphenations, but it's still there.The Great Gatsby is relatively short, only 180 pages long, and you could probably finish it in one sitting if you don't have any other obligations to attend to. However, I think this is what ultimately ruins the experience. Some books can pull off a short page count, but others, like this one, cannot. Had Fitzgerald stuck in the present and not gone off on tangents of the past it would have been fine, but ultimately these flashbacks ruin any chance of fleshing out the characters or properly building up the story so that you actually feel something at the story's climax.Overall Score: 7/10 - I know this is considered a literary classic, and for its time I'm sure it was groundbreaking, but in today's world it's simply mediocre. Nothing about the novel is necessarily terrible, and I never felt the need to close it, but I just feel like the story wasn't given the time it deserved to fully develop into something amazing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I wanted to read this book before setting the new movie coming out this summer.

There is some immaturity that comes through in the forced density of the metahpors, but they are like pale and faint freckles on the cheek of Aphrodite, if you will. Fitzgerald manages to keep the significance and literary integrity of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; intact, while setting it in one of the most intriguing, romantic, and dramatic stories in American literature. Most of the criticism of this book comes from people who don't look deeply enough into the symbolism of every excruciating detail -- nearly all of which were consciously refined to the point of near perfection in Fitzgerald's many drafts."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Attending Princeton, F.

Scott Fitzgerald shows us the truth of this statement as if it were frozen in a crystal.

The dream of love that Gatsby lives for reveals so much about life that it motivates thought about what we ourselves value.

I recomend this book to people of all ages. The book itself is easy to understand and has great character analysis."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is an excellent book which keenly depicts the pre-Depression era. As a junior in high school, my class read this book which I thought was going to be the typical boring English book but it is truly a well-written work.I believed the book starts out pretty slow but as reader gets deeper and deeper into the book, they can find mystery, intrigue, romance, and other subplots. Readers can find the mystery which surrounds Gatsby. He only reveals bits and pieces about his past which leaves the reader to speculate some things about him. The intrigue and romance mingle into the odd love relationships of Tom, Daisy, Gatsby, and Myrtle. Did Daisy truly love Gatsby? Does Tom even care about his mistress Myrtle? All the confusion will make a head-on-collision toward the end of the book.So even if you do not get any of that symbolism or delve deeper into the novel, it's still worthwhile to read this American classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"if the book doesn't immediately grab you, it soon will.amazing. too bad that in his time, fitzgerald didn't get the credit he so richly deserved."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book was incredibly interesting.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby's love for Daisy was unmeasurable. His strive to achieve wealth in order to have her approval was fascinating. Gatsby never gave up the hope of realizing his dream of being with his one true love."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read Fitzgerald's masterpiece in English class last year. Only six weeks after we finished &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; it was ranked as the second-best English novel of the century, and I wasn't surprised. The book is concise, with the language for the most part easy to understand so that it becomes possible to try to find the novel's deeper meanings and implications. Plus it really helps that I'm a resident of Queens, New York. Using descriptive clues from the text, I was able to apply the plot to where I live. For example, the big wasteland that's in the book and which was supposedly located in Corona includes the area above which Shea Stadium has since been built."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The novel was pleasent to read and easy to understand. Gatsby's ambition to obtain social equality in order to win Daisy's approval is a testimony of one mans drive to reach true love. Through his determination, hope is kepted alive and is taught to be a key motivator in the pursuit of dreams and goals."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"An interesting read. The style of writing is descriptive and not very difficult to understand. The comment on Daisy by Gatsby &quot;Her voice is full of money&quot; is explanatory itself. And the last paragraph where the author describes the future as a green pasture which eludes us , but we strech our arms further every evening and one fine morning .... is brilliant."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald... I started reading the Great Gatsby last year, and before you can say HO! I finished reading. My mouth was open all the time and loved, yes really loved the book. Fitzgerald is the Jazz-age man and how he displays everything of the Jazz-age in this book is so good that it is almost unbelieveble. I did almost crie. Not because it was sad but because how good Fitzgerald wrote it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of the few novels I have read that move me not only by the plot and characters, but by the words themselves that the authors wrote. I find it amazing that even months after I read it for the first time there are still parts from the book that I remember almost word for word."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Written in the most poetic of prose styles, F. Scott. Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby is a most stirring novel. Every time after reading this book, I become lost in a trance, and only after navigating out of the Fitzgerald created haze, can I begin to examine his intent. There is nothing complex about this book, indeed his comment on the American Dream is straight-forward and easy to identify. Though this acknowledgement, for me, can only be truly realised on the completion and reflection of the work. Largely because Fitzgerald intices the reader to meet his characters, to feel the suffering and alienation of Gatsby, the ordinariness of Nick, and to be pushed slowly and gently by the rich current and bueaty of flow of his words.A most moving book, that despite it's obviousness transcends to something more sublime."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Gatsby is a wonderful book because of the layers and layers found within it. Each time I've read the book, I've found another timely social commentary. What amazes me the most is the precision with which Fitzgerald composed this piece. By far, this book is the best of the high school reading requirements because of character, plot, and depth."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"the great gatsby is undoubtedly one of the all time classics, and a must. it portrays wonderfully the meaning of the american dream. gatsby is the epitome of idealism, believing that the past can be repeated, and that his love for daisy, and her love for him, can be re-kindled. his vision of the world is pure, albeit for his materialism, the reader is made to sympathize with him. beautifully written, the prose-style is poetic, lyrical and magical. f. scott-fitzgerald uses a combination of allegories, sybolism an motifs to paint a most vivid and vibrant picture of life in the 20's, and the search for the holy grail, the ideal. an almost flawless book. potent, pure, yet realistic. scott-fitzgerald allows the reader to keep believing and searching... &quot;the milk of wonder&quot;...&quot;the palp of life&quot; can be achieved...the &quot;elusive rhythmn&quot; .to be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is, arguably, the greatest American novel. Read the last 2 pages and you are reading some of the most beautiful prose in the English language. Fitzgerald once said that he could never forgive the rich for being rich. This novel makes sense of that statement. And the last line feels like a punch in the stomach."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This title did bring out the society of the 1920's and was very well written. Prohibition caused social problems and classes in the society and F. Scott Fitzgerald certrainly showed he had an understanding of this society. I'm sure when this was written, many people were kind of offended at his not-so-perfect depiction of the life beneath the glamour of the 20's. Now it can be appreciated and I hope no one who reviewed this book had the audacity to review this book badly because it conflicted with their personal views. I hate when that stands in the way of enjoying a good book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is the best novel I think I have ever read. We had to read it in my high school English class and I loved it even then. I've read it two more time in the three years I have been out of high school, and I plan to read it at least one a year. I feel I have to, its like revisiting old friends who you wish you could help but you know you can't. This novel is awesome in the way that the characters just pop off the page. The Great Gatsby is so sad too because in the end no one &quot;wins&quot; except maybe for Nick who is a better man for having known Gatsby. Eventhough Nick believes that Daisy and Tom can retreat into their money and forget anything ever happened, Daisy still has to live with the fact that she got the only man who every really loved her killed, I don't think money could make her forget that. Anyway I recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, although if you read it when you were in high school, I suggest reading it again, because you probably missed how beautiful this book is in the rush to have it finished before the test! Also, if any of you have not seen the movie go rent it or check for it on your local classic movie channel because I've seen the movie on one of those channels at least ten times. The casting is excellent. Mia Farrow was the perfect &quot;Daisy&quot; beautiful, delicate, her voice &quot;full of money.&quot; Nick, sweetly played by the lovely Sam Waterston. And lets not forget Robert Redford's portrayal of the great Jay Gatsby. I thought he did and excellent job. This movie is very beautiful and if you don't cry as Daisy and Gatsby renew their love, or when George mourns over Mrytle's body, then you are not human!! I could write all day about the book and the movie but I will just say that they are both worth checking out. Lose yourself in the decadent twenties!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is honestly my favorite book of all time. Fitzgerald really displays the twenty's like no other can. Will you be able to figure out where Jay Gatsby's money comes from? Will Gatsby steal Daisy away from her wealthy husband Tom? Will narrator Nick Carraway ever really &quot;fit in&quot; will the East Eggers? And most importantly, will anyone ever figure out who's throwing this PARTY!? Believe me, finding out the answers to these questions is very exciting, and once you start picking up on Fitzgerald's symbolism, you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What I love most about the Great Gatsby is how it depicts what the 1920's were like. It gives you a taste of what it would be like to live back then and how society functioned. It brought together the 2 worlds of Gatsby and Daisy and George and Myrtle and showed how much they contrasted. Fitzgerald really does a great job of installing images into your head of what different scenes looked like-especially the huge parties Gatsby would have at his house. I really liked the story itself although it could be seen as depressing. Oh well, I guess all stories can't always have a happy ending!!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am a junior in high school, and we recently completed reading \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" I have to say, it is by far the greatest book I have ever read. Even on a superficial level, by just reading the book, it's amazing. In class, we also analyzed portions of the book and it is clear that F. Scott Fitzgerald was a literary genius. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To the person who said students shouldn't be forced to read this, Im glad I was. I am 23 now, and still remember reading Gatsby in high school. Of course, I read Shakespeare for pleasure, I always liked reading. When you grow up poor books are a great friend! I may have never read this if it hadn't been assigned. Its short, and its a classic. Perhaps those trashing it should reread it when they are mature enough to handle it?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The story takes place in the early 1920's on Long Island. The narrator is Nick Carraway who has just arrived from the Midwest to work as a bond salesman. He visits his cousin Daisy who is married to a wealthy college acquaintance named Tom Buchanan. Nick also soon meets his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who has made a fortune through questionable means and has moved to Long Island in an attempt to revive an old romance with Daisy.Gatsby knew Daisy before World War I.At Gatsby's suggestion, Nick arranges a reunion between the two former lovers. As the romance is rekindled a tragedy unfolds involving Gatsby, Nick, Daisy, Tom and Tom's mistress as well as her husband.THE GREAT GATSBY is a short book but Fitzgerald manages to create some complicated and interesting characters. Of course the most intriguing is Gatsby who is an incorrigible romantic dreamer with an insane desire to relive the past.THE GREAT GATSBY is also an entertaining book which deserves its high rank among American novels written during the early part of the last century."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I bought this book last year, but I just hadn't got around to read it. But for my holiday, I rounded up 3-4 of those \\"must reads\\" that was waiting on the shelf and took off. And what a great read this was! I loved \\"The Great Gatsby\\" from the very first page.Written in the 1920'ies one would think that this novel would be outdated by now. But a book doesn't get the label \\"a great classic\\" for no good reason. Fitzgerald, with \\"The Great Gatsby\\", has written a novel with a timeless message.The story's narrator, Nick Carraway, is the neighbour to the novel's protagonist Jay Gatsby. We enter the story when Jay has transformed from being a poor officer to a self made millionaire. He is throwing fantastic parties every weekend on his mansion on Long Island. Lots of people, lit garden, swimming pool and the full nine yards. Gatsby is a self-invented person, no one really knows him, what he does, or where he's from, but they all come to his parties. One of the other protagonists, Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom, but Daisy used to go out with Jay Gatsby. Back then when he was a poor guy and a no-body. When Jay went to serve overseas, Daisy married Tom. Tom is an incredibly rich young man. Brutal, low moral, arrogant and you name it.. but extraordinary rich..So that's the scene setting for this novel. This book has everything, the (impossible) love story, money and wealth, greed, affairs, jealousy and obsessions. Fitzgerald's writing style is vivid and eloquent. Simply an elegant use of the language! His language reminds me of Hemingway, one of my other favourites. The different characters are extraordinary well developed. I especially liked the cynical narrator of the story, Nick Carraway.Fitzgerald has written one of the best books I have ever read. This is a short book, and I read it in 50-page gulps at the time. A great book, ready to be re-read any day!!PS. Make sure to get this edition, as it has a great preface written by Matthew Bruccoli. The preface contains valuable information about the author and background information on the story itself. Read the preface first, you will benefit from it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is one of those books that has become immortal because it perfectly captures an era. The 1920's were perhaps the most exciting decade of the previous century in America (rivaled only by the 1960's), and this book showcases its excesses in all their glory. We see the rich person, and what money can do to you. We see how love can not only change a man's life, but also take it away from him. We see interactions between different social classes. We see how the amounts of excess in the 20's reached such a zenith that people would actually hold huge parties for multitudes of people at their houses that they not only didn't know, but would never even meet. This book, on the surface, is a love story, but it also has deeper revertebrations. It's a tragedy. It's poetry. It's a warning about the false luster of the American dream. The plot in this story is wonderful and perfectly thought out. The writing style is very, very smooth and actually acutely beautiful. It's a beautifully written book - almost like prose at times, but very literate. It's probably Fitzgerald's masterpiece. This is a book that you can't afford to skip over when reading your way through the American classics."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's life is somewhat paralleled by the character (Jay Gatsby) he creates in his most famous novel, The Great Gatsby. Gatsby throws lavish parties and lives one of the most extreme lifestyles fictionalized during the Jazz Age. Although Fitzgerald's life was tragic at times, he seems to have drawn the content of the novel from his creative literary genius as well. Because of its amazing story and craftsmanship, The Great Gatsby is the type of novel that deserves to stay in print for as long as people are reading books.The novel is a bit of a love story gone wrong, mixed with the budding friendship of a common bond salesman (Nick Carraway) with the notorious underground gambler and namesake of the novel (Jay Gatsby). The two are somewhat confidants, yet the audience never knows if Gatsby is totally truthful with Carraway. Gatsby finds that Carraway's distant cousin (Daisy Buchanan) is a lost love who has married another man (Tom Buchanan). It seems as though his pursuit is worthless, but the soap-opera feel of the book helps the story continue to flow. Tom is also having an affair; his mistress is a low-class woman named Myrtle Wilson who lives in a gas station halfway between the two major areas that set the novel (East Egg and West Egg). Gatsby goes on a mission to reclaim the love of his life, almost an attempt to eternally grasp happiness. Carraway also has a somewhat love interest, a lady golfer who often lands herself in trouble. A novel is complete without unexpected disaster and The Great Gatsby is no exception. Twists of fates and other accidents play into the story as the reader's heart beats faster and is too involved to close the book.Other plot elements allow Fitzgerald's novel to be highly esteemed. He magically mixes carefully crafted symbolism, dramatic irony, complex plot, figurative language, and vivid descriptions in such a bold yet intriguing way. A fantastic cast of characters work together move the story forward, although one man (Carraway) does the actual narration. After reading this amazing novel, any reader would wish to travel back to the 1920s and attend one of Gatsby's wild parties or befriend one of the other characters."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I was first assigned \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in college but I hate being \\"assigned\\" a book and held off reading it until now.I am very happy I came back to this book, truly a classic. It is not your classic love story and Fiztgerald captures the snobby life of these rich people perfectly. He brings them down to human levels despite all their riches and shows how we all suffer the same regardless of our monetary value.The first chapter or two can be a bit of a challenge to get through since it deals mostly with the setting up of their snobby environments, but if you stick with it puts everything into perspective further in the book.Without giving anything away, it had one of the best ending I have ever seen (or read rather). You read this book and never truly know how you felt about the characters, wether you loved them or hated them, at the end, all you can do it pity people like them."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This masterpiece take place in the 1920's in New York's West Egg Village, a suburb of New York City. The narrator of the story is Nick Carraway, a young man quietly carving out a living selling bonds and securities. Nick moves into a meager house located next door to the great Gatsby mansion. Nick is in awe of the fabulous Gatsby home. Lavish parties are the norm there, with prominent guests coming and going, and music and laughter filling the Long Island air. Jay Gatsby, however, is a mystery to Nick.Soon Nick receives an invitation from Gatsby himself to attend one of his parties. People are filled with uncertainty about Jay Gatsby. How did he become so wealthy? Where was he from? Who was he? Gossip stirred and rumors abounded.Although they were not from the same social circle, Jay Gatsby took an immediate liking to Nick Carraway and befriended him. But he had other motives too. Nick was cousin to the beautiful married Daisy Buchanan, a woman who Gatsby once loved and lost. Through Nick, Gatsby desperately tries to rekindle the romance with Daisy. At one point Nick tells Gatsby that the past cannot be repeated. Gatsby's reply is, &quot;Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!&quot;The characters in this book (with the exception of Nick) all share one common thread. They are striving for more of everything...love, success, money, notoriety, and a sense of self-worth. Yet they chase after their ambitions blindly. Feelings are hurt, friendships are destroyed, and tragic events unfold. What they thought would bring happiness only brings sorrow.Fitzgerald's insight into social interactions is profound. Through the voice and eyes of Nick, he helps the reader empathize with even the most loathsome characters. The prose is beautiful and oftentimes heartwrenching. Even after 75 years, the keen observations made by Fitzgerald (Nick) about people and society ring true today. History changes, but the human condition holds steadfast. Unforgettable..."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"No wonder this book was rated #2 on the top 100 American novels of the century. This is a true gem. Although not a fast paced book, the beauty of the story is the way it flows. The naration is written with pure emotion. The ending is true literary magic. This novel will capture you unless you refuse it with stubborn thoughts of boredom. Keep in mind before you decide to read this book that it is not an adventure or sci-fi blitz. If you miss the art of the writting, the way Fitzgerald selects specific words for specific intentions, you will miss the heart of this novel. This is a novel that should be read for it's art but don't be fooled, there is nothing boring about this book. It sets the bar that all novel should be judged by. Without a doubt the absolute best of the American classics that i have read to date. Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It is generally assumed by many that a book being considered a 'classic' is good enough reason to readit. This frequently is not the case, as everyone's idea of a classic is different. However, in the case of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, I would state that this book should be read by all.It tells the seperate stories of a number of people, but its focal point is the hidden love Jay Gatsby holds for Dasiy Buchanan - married, elegant and charismatic. As Gatsby pursues shady deals and his doomed obsession with Daisy, F. Scott Fitzgerald distills the essence of the Jazz Age and the empty heart of the American Dream. The novel is tragic, yet witty, with people and stories that tend to linger in the readers mind long after the book has been put down.Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The first time I read Gatsby was in high school, too young and coerced to come away with much but an urge to slap Daisy. The second read, in my early twenties, was magic -- I drank it in a night, awed by the grace of the language, and particularly swept up in the sad romance of it: gauche, hopeful Jay Gatsby, arms and dreams wide as he stared across the Sound at the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.This third time was the best, the purest, and if you haven't read it for a while, I urge you to pick it up again. It's truly a masterpiece, painting the whole American mess in vivid colors and flawless perspective without wasting a stroke. The best part, the deftest, is that Fitzgerald makes everyone culpable, from philandering elitist Tom Buchanan to passive narrator Nick Carraway. Even the reader can't help but feel involved: In the thousand wrongs and slights of everyday, in our selfish wants and our crueler rationalizations, we create and prolong the world Fitzgerald painted for us.And yes, I still want to slap Daisy."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is a marvelous look into the green-eyed monster of sexual jealousy. It's ripe with symbolic imagery from Fitzgerald's personal agony over his wife adulterous affair.Everyone knows the superficial lit class interpretation of the novel; idealistic Gatsby pursues fortune in vain attempt to dazzle and win golden girl, only to have her reject him. Conclusion: classic condemnation of the hollowness of upper class materialism. Rubbish!The story is not political. It is personal pure and simple! It would have taken place anytime, any place those two particular personalities came together. In real life Fitzgerald won his Zelda. But he then promptly and insouciantly cheated on her. She got him back by cheating on him. In his journals Fitzgerald wrote that something died at this time. Shortly afterward the couple moved to Paris.Does this not parallel George Wilson's reaction to his wife's affair in The Great Gatsby? Yes, Wilson is also Fitzgerald, the tortured, jealous part of Fitzgerald who mourns the loss of his wife even as he realizes her for what she is. Myrtle is the low class floozy that Zelda has become in Fitzgerald's eyes by cuckolding him.Wilson tries to hold on to his wife by locking her up until he can transact a business deal (buying the coupe) and thereby have the money to take her \\"west\\", something they had long talked about but which he is now going to make her do.Analogously, Fitzgerald sold short stories (seeing himself as stooping to low class laborer by writing for commerce instead of art's sake?)to pay his and Zelda's way to Paris, removing her from her paramour's proximity.Who actually kills Gatsby? The symbol of idealism and optimism (Gatsby)is killed by the symbol of grief and jealousy (Wilson). Fitzgerald was disillusioned by Zelda's adultery not class materialism.Who does that leave Daisy/Zelda with in the end? Tom, the lout, the woman beater, the snob. Realizing, to his relief, that Daisy will never actually leave him, Tom becomes smug. Go ahead, he tells Gatsby (or any man who now idolizes Zelda), flirt with her all you want. She'll always come crawling back to me! If Gatsby is how Fitzgerald wants to be, Tom is the husband Fitzgerald actually is.Daisy, Myrtle and Jordan are all Zelda; Daisy the debutante on a pedestal, Myrtle the common floozy, Jordan the sophisticate pursuing her own identity and career. But Jordan has no address of her own. She lives off other people and cheats on her golf game, just as Fitzgerald claimed that Zelda stole from him material for her own writing career.This is the world as seen through the eyes of a self-centered, tyrannical egoist, but with one saving grace, Nick the observer, the recorder. Nick is the writer in Fitzgerald, and for all his faults as a man, Fitzgerald was one heck-of-a- writer."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The wonder of F. Scott FitzGerald's magnum opus is that he has created a great mirror for any individual looking into it. Therefore, a god can see a god and a fool can see a fool. Reading the various reviews from a wide variety of supposed learned individuals, I must say that this masterpiece is not just a well written story or even art, but a great mirror that can reflect whatever an individual may have to offer to oneself. Within each of us, live all the characters that appear in this novel (if we're lucky) from Jay Gatsby to George Wilson. Obviously, some readers (amazon reviewers included) have lost key characters far too early in their life. The style and language of the story is both engaging and active. It stimulates the mind of the reader to create and not just follow, as most common writers will have us do. In a world of sheep that think themselves as wolves, this work may seem less than satisfying. Being given the opportunity to look into a mirror and truly look at ourselves verses shown an idealistic picture and told that that image is we, many will chose the latter. History has shown that most people prefer the illusions of life. As J.D Salinger simply put it &quot;They're all a bunch of phonies...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I haven't read Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' in almost two years. I picked it up again, to-day, though, and realized the truth of the notion that one learns something new each time one returns to a book. 'The Great Gatsby' just is a novel that must be returned to periodically to appreciate it properly.While the characters in the novel remain ultimately unknowable at their indefinite cores, Fitzgerald does a great job tying his characters to their historical setting. The protagonist of the novel, to my mind, is Nick Carraway, the narrator. The hero of his story, which frames the novel, is the legendary Jay Gatsby - a legend in his own mind. Although Carraway's narration is often heavily biased and unreliable, what emerges are the stories of a set of aimless individuals, thrown together in the summer of 1922. Daisy Buchanan is the pin that holds the novel together - by various means, she ties Nick to Jordan Baker, Tom Buchanan to Jay Gatsby, and Gatsby to the Wilsons.The novel itself deals with the shallow hypocrisies of fashionable New York society life in the early 1920's. It is almost as though Fitzgerald took the plot of Edith Wharton's 'The Age of Innocence' and updated it - in the process making the characters infinitely more detestable and depriving it of all hope. Extramarital affairs rage on with only the thinnest of veils to disguise them, the nouveau-riche rise on the back of scandal and corruption, and interpersonal relationships rarely signify anything permanent that doesn't reek of conspiracy. The novel's casual allusions to beginnings and histories often cause us to reflect on the novel's historical moment - when the American Dream and Benjamin Franklin's vision of the self-made man seem to coalesce in Jay Gatsby, a Franklinian who read too much Nietzsche.No matter how you read it, 'The Great Gatsby' is worth re-reading. M.J. Bruccoli's short, but informative preface, and C. Scribner III's afterword are included in this edition, and both set excellent contexts, literary, personal, and historical, for this classic of American literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This eloquently written novel, full of symbolism and wonderful imagery is set among a millionaire community on Long Island. The enigmatic bachelor Gatsby gives huge all night parties at his mansion, dancing, drugs and sex are the season's most fashionable events. His fascinated neighbour, the book's narrator Nick Carraway, makes friends with him and begins unravelling the secrets of his personality. Carraway's intervention triggers revelations about Gatsby's criminal past, and a love afair between Gatsby and the wife of the wealthy Tom Buchanan; these in turn leads to further tragedy. At the end of the book Carraway sits alone outside Gatsby's mansion, reflecting on the emptiness of the lives he has just described. Certainly this novel stands alone in range and depth. You will want to read this book again just for the beautiful flow of Fitzgerald's prose."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Like most, I first read the Great Gatsby in my high school English class. Although I have read much since then, I've not found another novel that surpasses to Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Between the solid story, symbolism and pleasant prose, the Great Gatsby touches on something everyone experiences in one degree or another: that of unrealized dreams. There are many Gatsbys in the world - each scheming some last-ditch effort to snatch victory from a certain defeat. He is a timeless character.Now, this is Fitzgerald, and that means he can lapse into sentimentality. I think what makes this book his best work technically is that he keeps tight rein over the sap. It is far more mature than This Side of Paradise and less amorphous than Tender is the Night. Saul Bellow considered Fitzgerald's writing 'weak', but at its best it strikes a young, idealistic chord that makes all the sap worthwhile. I've always felt that comes from Fitzgerald's successful courtship of Zelda.I recommend this book, but it is one of those stories you know whether you read it or not - like Romeo and Juliet or King Author. If you like Fitzgerald, there are several newer writers that he has influenced. Hunter S. Thompson comes to mind, and I once heard Thomas Wolfe mentioned as a 'devotee'. John Keats was a big inspiration in Fitzgerald's writing, and that old humbug Bernard Shaw as well. Ultimately, I think the Great Gatsby is the best American novel to date, which bridges admirably the old English poets and the modern workaday world."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Ernest Hemingway, who had a lifelong love-hate relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald once described Scott's talent as &quot;perfect and delicate as the wings of a butterfly.&quot; Yes, and that is what the lucky readers get in The Great Gatsby:that wonderful, exhilerating, lyrical delicacy shadowed by tragedy. I keep re-reading this book. It contains four or five of my favorite scenes in all literature: the scene of Daisy on the couch in the cottage with the breeze billowing her dress; the car accident at the party when we glimpse this dancing shoe emerging from the car; the great passage about &quot;those thrilling, returning trains of my youth&quot; and the scene where they're getting drunk in the hotel. There has never been a better, more subtly written drunk scene. Many have called Gatsby the best American novel of the century. It's not hard to see why. It's got everything in it. And it still stands, fresher than ever, as the great sad story of the American Dream gone sour."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To me this is literary perfection. It is the only book I know of that is complete: not a word should be cut, or added. It has a palpable mood in which the reader in engulfed: decadence, melancholy, longing, hope, failures, dreams, and an unflinching striving for something purer in a world that wants to drag us into its arrogant and indifferent corruption. Gatsby is THE romantic hero, and Nick the sensitive observer on whom the moral foundation of the book rests. The symbolism is simple and works unobtrusively. I love this book and have read it several times now. It is like a great painting or scene that holds in its smallest details the universal design or chaos if that be the paradox.Reading some of the reviews I find people's opinions varying greatly. Some very intelligent people dislike it, even hate it while others love it, or think it good. The same can be said of not so intelligent people. As Nick puts it: &quot;I was within and witout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexaustible variety of life.&quot;Do not be too greatly influenced by reviews or the book's reputation, simply read it and decide for yourself. In the end considering how short the novel is, how accessible, and if nothing else(I personally think it is much more) a literary phenomenom, it is worth reading for anyone interested in novels and literature"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It's what's not written and the hidden, subtle meanings between the lines and the potent reaction of the reader that makes this book one of the classics of American Literature, that and Fitzgerald's elegant, almost dance-like, symbolic and deep prose; yes, many might react surprisingly at the word \\"deep\\" to describe The Great Gatsby, but many simply did not see that- in portraying the shallowness of the characters, the fast-paced 1920's eastern life of the rich and notorious, and the struggles of one man-Gatsby-to rise above his past and ancestry and misplacing his meaning in life to one, undeserved woman-a well-hidden depth of meaning and understanding of what mankind should strive for and unfortunately what most miss was clearly pointed out in the novel.As I read other reviews, I concluded that many misunderstood this novel and it took a Kid Review to understand the main theme of the book: as we try to look into the future-be it for our ambitions, fulfillment, happiness, or love- and turn our dreams into realities-as Gatsby so desperately strived for-you are forever thrown back into your past that has been forgotten by many, for your past shapes the paths you take, your past and past decisions leave their marks and has often dire consequences on your present and future life. It is a message to be cautious and savor yesterday so that you do not fall and regret tomorrow. It is in this essence that Gatsby stood out from the others in the story and met a tragic fate at the hands of the careless, shallow, rich and the confused. Who Gatsby was, his flaws, and misplaced love fore Daisy was of no consequence, that was not Fitzgerald's point and many missed it by looking solely at the plot and shallow characterizations and dialogue.While Fitzgerald pointed out many obvious human traits-snobbery, excessive romanticism, carelessness of others' feelings, betrayal, and the shallow curiosity of other people's dramas, as well as the social discrepancies between the rich and the poor scornfully and with distaste, he was barely skimming through the true meaning of his novel.It was not a coincidence that the first 3 settings of the novel mirrored the last 3 settings of the story, in which the past meets the present and affects the future of every main character. The mirror image of the beginning and end of the novel closes the dramas that had unfolded so successfully and so unexpectedly you have to give pause, and with awe come to appreciate the genius of the writingAnd if that still leaves you confounded of what had just happened, it is in the first 2 pages and in the last 2 pages that Fitzgerald bluntly voices what he truly desires for the reader to understand.Anyone giving this novel a bad review simply did not understand it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Written by F. Scott Fitgerald in the 1920's, The Great Gatsby never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy American. It is also a fine representation of the American dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Gatsby is the typical wealthy American in the 1920's who lives the life wanted by all Americans. His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Daisy was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Gatsby tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Daisy. His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald's use of symbols is what represents most the books' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald held my interest and anticipation throughout the book. His characters were alive and Gatsby touched my heart. He was in love with love. The Great Gatsby is one of his masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is the fourth time I have the honor of reading this book, in preparation of the upcoming movie.I love it and it seems to get better everytime.If you haven't read it - read it before the movie and if you have read it - this should be at the top of the re-read pile!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I remember reading this book a long time ago in high school and, like many books in high school, I detested it, holding any teacher's attempts to explain a book's themes and symbols as a colossal waste of time. Now that I am a little older and wiser, I understand what Fitzgerald was getting at. Many American's have their own green light, their \\"American Dream\\" that they are always reaching for, but may never attain or may attain only to be left wondering, like Jay Gatsby, was it worth it? This is a great reflection on the American Dream, as all the great works of American literature are. The tragedy of Gatsby's life and longing are only enhanced because of the fact that every American has their own dream. And Fitzgerald's reflections on the moral wasteland that made up the wealthy's lifestyle in the 1920s has as much resonance today, post-2008 stock market crash, as it did 90 years ago. And while I wouldn't go so far as to call this book \\"The Great American Novel\\" as others have, I do believe that a new generation of Americans, traumatized by the Wall Street bailout and the economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country, will find new meaning in this classic work."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I loved the book. Its a short read but very entertaining. Starts off a little slow but picks up quick and keeps you entertained"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In my humble opinion, one of the best books ever written. I love it just as much now as I did when I read it in college."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Classic book about post WWI USA wealthy society. Old vs new money and no depth in many of the old money people...."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I've re-read the Great Gatsby...was just as in awe of it the second time around. However, it was easier to perceive the not happy ending, although I was once again hoping for it. Loved it...again! Timeless, still a must read; if you've missed it, it's not too late."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This modern classic paints a vivid picture of the shallowness and dishonesty of high society and of the futility of pursuing nostalgic dreams. Fitzgerald's characters are very believable, but all tend toward being loathsome, pathetic, or some combination of the two. This is one of those books that is definitely engaging and memorable, but not necessarily enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't think my words could do this great American novel justice. I will read it over and over for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Time to re-read one of the great classics, before the movie appears this summer! Kindle is great on the subway, too."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel is more than just a novel--it is the English language used in the greatest essence of perfection. Fitzgerald has written out prose that intertwine so many elements, the heirarchy of American society, love, aspiration to the American Dream, the sign of the times in the Roaring Twenties, friendship, paradise, and paradise lost, yet it is all woven together so clearly, so vividly, so beautifully...Fitzgerald's prose is lyrical, sharp and intense. It is the height of the use of the English language. The devices used to keep the reader interested are borrowed, yet brought to a level of perfection, a level that the originators of these devices could never fathom.Comparing Fitzgerald's work to the work of more modern novelists, I see what the latter aspire to. I was supposed to read this in high school but neglected to. I wish this was the novel to have sparked my interest in the art of prose.In the Esquire article &quot;Monologue to the Maestro: A High Seas Letter&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway talks about what makes a great writer. He says that reading the classics is something a writer should do &quot;...so he knows what he has to beat.&quot; He goes on to list classics that he feels are essential for a writer to read. In a modern times, &quot;Gatsby&quot; is a novel a writer should read &quot;so he knows what he has to beat.&quot;The Great Gatsby is not only a benchmark for writers, but a novel for anyone to read for its beautiful use of the English language, gripping story, and story structure. As I wish I could read Russian to fully understand the essence of classics like &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, I can imagine serious readers who cannot read English feeling the same way about a book like &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;I recommend this book to anyone who is into fine art, for this is fine art of storytelling and the English language of the twentieth century. Furthermore, I suggest,in order for this novel to be fully enjoyed, that it be read in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a must read book. I give it 4 stars because of the dramatic scenes and situations that Fitzgerald depicts. The book is an epic love story between Jay Gatsby and the lovely Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby who lives in a large mansion would throw tremendous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the insational love of the married Daisy Buchanan. During this story Gatsby follows his dream of getting Daisy back at any cost......even death of other people or himself as well. Fitzgerald's strong values and beliefs were clearly presented which is a very entertaining style to read. One thing I would criticise about this book is that the action of the story does not start until the fourth chapter, which discouraged my interest greatly."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of our century, this book presents a vivid chronicle of the Jazz Age and is a tightly constructed work of literary genius. In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is not a book soon forgotten. I read this book for a class of mine and totally fell in love with Fitzgerald's writing style. It is one that you can identify with so easily, as if you know exactly what he is talking about. The love story is somewhat common, that of a tragic nature, yet one truly feels completely saddened for young Gatsby at the end. Fitzgerald not only makes the reader eager to read, but you will find yourself eagerly grabbing for his other novels, all of which are equally superb."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald once wrote that a truly great writer should write &quot;for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolteachers ever afterward.&quot; How prophetic! Although I wasn't born until 40 years after Fitzgerald's death, the messages he speaks are as clear to me as if he were speaking in my ear. this american literary masterpiece, with its rich themes of time, devotion and the american dream is well worth its praise. Fitz knew it was his best work, and it's a damn shame he couldn't live to see it gain the respect of the world. i reccomend that anyone who enjoyed this book read more on Fitzgerald's life and you'll want to check out the short story &quot;winter dreams&quot; which resembles gatsby in several ways. If you ever make it to USC in columbia, s.c., go and see Professor Bruccoli's collection of F. Scott at the Thomas Cooper Library."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone! The book came recommended by the WSJ as a good summer read, so I figured &quot;Why not?&quot;. I was supposed to read Gatsby in high school, however, I chose to read Cliffs Notes instead - big mistake! It is a great read and moves very quickly.I read the book over 2 days during my recent vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book brings alive characters that are often so present in our society and intertwines them in a great story. Fitzgerald has a great way with words. He describes things in such a way that you truly feel like you can see the person or object he describes.I could say more, however, I will leave you with this - - Just read the book. It is less than 200 pages and is definitely in my Top 10 of books."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"We listened to this while driving through Long Island reviewing wineries for About.Com, and it was the perfect accompanyment in so many ways. Fitzgerald's writing style is incredibly evocative - stirring vivid images in your mind of the mansions of East Egg, of the complex individuals that lived there and how they interacted. Each person presents one face to the world, while hiding a wealth of fears and desires. The scene where a car looses a wheel is one of my favorites - the witty way Fitzgerald turns words and plays with the individuals is just fantastic.This is definitely not a book to read 'on assignment', forced to hunt for meaning. It's a book to read in your 20s or beyond, when you see the way old loves can still call to you, when temptation strikes sometime to try to turn back the clock. But of course, you can't, as Fitzgerald demonstrates with such a wonderful style. There were so many scenes in this book that stood out as stellar, that sparkled in our minds.I think it's hard for a younger person to identify with some of the themes in here, just as it's probably hard for an older person to truly remember what it's like to be a teenager. It's the kind of book that, if you've lived through love and loss, battled years to achieve something you realize later wasn't worth it, you finish a passage and say ... &quot;Yes. That is it exactly.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"With 381 reviews before me, it is clear that this one is superfluous, but since your eyes are reading these lines. Let me tell you what I think.I guess that this novel come into the hands of today's readers mostly due to the fact that it has been designated as one of the U.S. literary icons of the XX Century. Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby, who is the living symbol of those forces, who have laid more women that he can remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed. He provided a frame of reference for the people of the 20's to perceive their own time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book. It is story of a rich man, who is obsessed over Daisy his dream girl. Gatsby is the classic &quot;tragic hero&quot;. I recommend this book for any English class or if you just want to read a very good book."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby,\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a well written novel that explores the everyday life of a town through the eyes of an outsider. This onlooker sees not only the town, but every detail that paints a picture, for the reader, of the town and its people. The authors use of imagery is very good, because he uses great detail to from the smallest item to the largest disaster. He describes, in one part, a simple billboard for T.J. Eckelburg's, who is an eye doctor. Fitzgerald describes the billboard which has a great big pair of glasses with two eyes starring through, yet this is not only a good ad, but it also describes the town by a simple picture. These eyes describe, that everybody is watching everybody, and all is seen sooner or later. Through his use of imagery, a metaphor is produced, and the glasses and eyes are those of mainly Nick who sees all, but also of the townspeople, who sooner or later see all that has happened. This imagery also is used at the end of the book when the town is described as the fire is burning it down. This helps paint a mental picture of the destruction the fire did to all the buildings and the few people still alive in the town. All in all this book was a very good book because of its use of imagery which placed the reader with in the story making that much more exciting."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"They say a book can never get old, and with age they become classics. The Great Gatsby is a prime counterexample of this.In my opinion, a book that is entertaining and exciting needs to stretch the mind. It needs to use great imagination. Imagination makes mystery and murder novels scary and thrilling. Imagination makes a sci-fi interesting. What is there to imagine about The Great Gatsby? There are murders, but not very unique ones. If I wanted to read a good murder mystery, I would go to Thomas Harris. As for the love story The Great Gastby is placed around, I see this as the only conflict in the book. Every event in the entire book was based on this unrealistic relationship between Daisy, Tom, and Jay.To conclude, I would expect this story in a 1920's newspaper rather than being a mass produced as a \\"classic\\" novel. The only use I have for this book is a sleeping-pill substitute."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Okay. There's a program at my high school in the English department, called &quot;Accelerated Reader&quot;. You are assigned a book off of a list, and you are to read it, then take a test about it on the computer. The program is quite helpful (I think), but when I was assigned The Great Gatsby, I was struggling to get through it! There were maybe one or two parts (for me) that made me want to keep reading. The rest I had to jam down my throat. It is well-written, therefore I give it at least one star. But it was so &quot;boring&quot;, that I failed my test on the computer! I've aced every other one that I've taken, so I know it can't just be me.

He can't stand the thought of mixed relationships, \\"next thing they'll have intermarriage between blacks and whites\\" (p.137). Oddly enough Fitzgerald gives Tom that line to describe the significance of the suspected extra marital affair between his wife Daisy and Gatsby. Was he inferring that becuz Gatsby was not a European white (Tom refers to himself and his crowd as Nordics) he was doomed to fall?Tom's a avid reader of white power literature alluding to the authors as \\"scientists\\". He warns everyone that 'coloured' races will take over if left unchecked. Airheaded Daisy (the rich and of course white object of Gatsby's affection) agrees, remarking admiringly, \\"Tom's..very profound\\".Tom also chooses the underdog to conduct an illicit affair--his mechanic's wife, Myrtle. Of course Tom goes unpunished for his adulterous behaviour while Myrtle is killed in a hit and run, courtesy of Daisy, who also gets off unscathed. Gatsby takes the fall for her.James Gatz is of course a Jewish name, which Gatsby changed in his late teens showing his own shame for his ethnicity. Of course the shifty Jewish criminal, Mr. Wolfsheim has a poor command of the English language. Nick, the narrator mocks his versions of \\"Oggsford\\" for Oxford and \\"goneggtion\\" for connection.At the end the poorest people are wiped out, the mechanic and his cheating wife (for whom Tom sheds a hypocritical crocodile tear). Narrator Nick refers to the mechanic's death as \\"the holocaust\\".Can't say I enjoyed this novel, Gatsby fell in foolish love with a high-maintenance, forbidden woman because she was white, full of money and the fineries that went with it. It wasn't a pure love story. In the end Gatsby paid with his life while Tom and Daisy (who I'll call a spineless murderess for not admitting to anyone her responsibility in the manslaughter of Myrtle) continue their high lifestyle scot-free.Was Fitzgerald trying to say the underclass doesn't have or deserve a chance in hell?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"it has no purpose.....its a hard to readboring book!?!?!? i dont find it that interesting...but i have to read it for school so what can you do?"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"People rave about the brilliance of Fitzgerald. I was under the impression that the purpose of a novel was to entertain. I argue that a book that is painful to read, however perfect the style or structure, can never be 'brilliant.'It failed to entertain me and it failed to convey its fundamental mesage of social criticism. It is a waste of precious time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really tried to get into this book. Sorry, I could not get past the shallow, dislikeable people and situations. Prose and symbolism are nothing if accompanied by a boring, unreadable plot. Maybe that is the point, but there are plenty of classic books that have it all: prose, symbolism, good plot, good characterizations, action, social commentary etc. It seemed like this book was an outline of a novel where the author sketched the main points, threw in some symbolism, then decided not to fill in the outline and create any depth to the story. Maybe that was the point, but it made the book really lacking. It does not require a thin, shallow book to portray thin, shallow people or times."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave.

I do not know why. I wasted much time reading critical appraisals, but they are all junk. So is this book. I don't care what anybody says there are *SEVERAL* parts that *DO* seem to be &quot;scribbled drunk&quot; and are nearly unintelligible. The book is filled with all kinds of errors, particuliarly chronological. There is also plenty of *PREJUDICE* and *RACISM* in this book. Wolfsheim is singled out as &quot;a small, flat nosed Jew&quot; despite the fact that he never mentions this. Nick also constantly refers to his &quot;tragic nose&quot;. What garbage. Also when Tom talks about the &quot;Superior Nordic Race nobody seems to care *IN THE LEAST* about the horrible things he is saying. Nick's maid is refered to as &quot;my Finn&quot;, which is so racist as to be almost unintelligible. Daisy and Gatsby are proposterous characters. The idea that they can never get together *MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER*. I don't care about society standards that is completely ridiculous. That Daisy would even think of staying with Tom dates this book *HORRIBLY* at the very least and more realitically turns into *A VIRTUAL CARTOON*. How and why Gatsby would do what he did is not believably in the least. Gatsby would never have gone to Oxford if he had truly cared about Daisy. The Confrontation makes absolutely no sense. Tom calls Gatsby a bootlegger with a drink in his hand.

I figure that this is because it isn't really that orginal, at least in my eyes. There are so many story with similar plotlines (Guy X likes Girl Y who is married to and unfaithful husband, Guy Z, and various thing that are supposed to be interesting because of this) (sounds like a soap opra)My main complaint is about the writing style: it is written in a way that excites English teachers, and bores the rest of us (everyone I know [rather inteligent high school students with a slant twards math and science)This was written quickly and without much thought other that I didn't like the book and would rather be reading something written by Issac Asimov, Douglas Adams, or some other author that doesn't write boring fiction that ends up or resembles that which does end up in high school english class"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a perfect example why kids don't like to read or find it boring.

They represent important things in the book. Weather and time are very important symbols.

I happen to believe that you are older than me and yet, I understood the book better than you. Why don't you read it a little more carefully next time? There aren't any unanswered questions. Gatsby's work is subtely mentioned in the book after Gatsby's death when Nick picks up a phone call that was meant for Gatsby. On page 174, Nick is confused by what the man on the other line wants from Gatsby. &quot;'Young Parke's in trouble,' he said rapidly. 'They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.'&quot; It goes on to tell how it actually happened. If one read closely enough, it is obvious that Gatsby was not a bootlegger, as believed by Tom, but a white collar criminal who created counterfeit bonds.I also do not enjoy seeing comments like &quot;teenagers don't appreciate books, read it when you grow up,&quot; because I really liked the book and am sure that many other teenagers appreciate it too."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a glimpse into the jazz age and the glamourous parties of that time.

He throws lavish parties and hope's to see his past love(Daisy) in one of those parties.

At first I believed the theme to be that of a love story, but further reading brought me to find the main theme, which was the American dream in the 1920's. The dream was to become wealthy and socially excepted by a higher class, even if it meant going against your morals. I think I like this novel because I can relate the dream of the 1920's to be very similar to that of today. This connection helped me to stay interested and better understand what the theme was about.My favorite character was Nick Carraway even though he had no desire to achieve this dream. He possessed a very strong character and did not give in to the immoral things his neighbors did, which separated him from the rest. Nick was the middle man and it was interesting to see how he learned of everyone's affairs, even his cousin's, which he had a hand in setting up. He was also the narrator, so his ideas and views influenced the reader's feelings about the story, as we saw the account from his point of view. This is the first novel that I have ever read where the main character was not in the beginning or end of the story. Nick was the person who was important in the beginning and end of the book, though he was not the main character. This approach was very appealing and pretty amazing. Jay Gatsby was another character that I found interesting. He was the main character of the story and was who the novel revolved around. He was a young man who made his millions illegally and only did it to win his long-life love back. And that is why at first I believed the theme to be about love.The ending of the novel was very attention grabbing. I would have never guessed it to end that way. I think the ending was the best part. It really showed the American dream and how immoral people can be to one another. The ending really made me think about my dreams and how I should be careful in all things I do and that I should always stick to my morals."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, The Great Gatsby is the story of Jay Gatsby's doomed obsession with Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy, married woman who had been his lover before the war.I rather liked the details that made the Jazz Age really come alive in this book. And I absolutely loved the perspective character, Nick; Fitzgerald sets up at the very beginning that Nick is an observant character who is careful with his judgement and remains true to this characterization throughout the story.However, I gave it just four stars because it took quite a while for me to get into the story, which isn't very long to begin with (my copy is only 115 pages). But I did enjoy it and was impressed that such a charismatic story could be told in just over a hundred pages. Nick Carraway alone is enough to make me want to reread this book; I just loved his personality and his perceptiveness.Plus, the ending came as a surprise to me. I won't give it away, but it's definitely an unexpected twist"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is a story full of sound and fury ultimately signifying everything about life in the 20's.

This story explores his newly found riches and contemplates the still controversial question, &quot;What truly makes a person happy and successful?&quot;This book drew me into a time and place I had never experienced before; the center of rich, lavish, 1920's New York City. I was given a close look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Thought it was written 80 years ago, I realized I could relate to the characters--their lifestyles and personalities are still applicable to life in America today. This book speaks to the reader, allowing them to feel the same emotions the narrarator is feeling, experience the same events the narrarator is.

It was a little bit too political for my taste. It seemed to take a long time forthings to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, and where. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waiste of time to read.

I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope\\" (5-6). F. Scott Fitzgerald opens The Great Gatsby with Nick's commentary to define his purpose for The Great Gatsby: no one can't judge others; he can only allow the different arguments of a situation to lead to a point of cognitive dissonance, define his hopes, and strengthen him as a person. Some view The Great Gatsby as a love story about Fitzgerald and Zelda, his wife, through Gatsby and Daisy's relationship, while others dig deeper to find underlying controversial issues of bisexuality through Gatsby and Dan Cody's relationship. These were just tactics Fitzgerald uses to bring the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance so he will discover his deepest hopes and unshakable beliefs. Great pieces of literature use such tactics.Set in the suburbs of New York City, The Great Gatsby tells Nick Carraway's story of the quirky character Jay Gatsby. It focuses upon Gatsby's love and pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, while reflecting upon his detour relationship with Dan Cody. From beginning to end balanced evidence for each relationship allows presents the reader to ponder Gatsby's personal life and intentions, with a choice of focusing on the obvious and judging what is right or wrong or weighing the different arguments to determine personal hopes.One reviewer claims that The Great Gatsby is a love story modeled after Fitzgerald and Zelda's marriage, especially through Daisy and Gatsby's relationship. Gatsby and Daisy's past was electric. When young, they were so engrossed in each other that Daisy didn't notice Jordan Baker five feet away! Ms. Baker describes it as romantic how Gatsby looked at Daisy. This reviewer's argument that the novel was a pure love story is logical but too obvious to be Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Another reviewer questions the intentions of Gatsby's \\"youthful relationship\\" with Dan Cody and suggests that Gatsby may be bisexual. Gatsby and Dan Cody's first meeting was electric, also. Gatsby smiled and Cody found him \\"quick and extravagantly ambitious\\" (106). Cody bought him expensive clothes and even included him in his will. This \\"arrangement,\\" as he called it, might have lasted indefinitely; that is, until Cody's wife stepped in. This is a more sophisticated, intuitive suggestion but still not Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Fitzgerald provides supporting evidence for both relationships to prevent the reader from knowing exactly how Gatsby feels; to prevent the reader from making a judgment. Every great writer uses similar tactics of weighing arguments with limited information to push the reader to a greater level of understanding. For example, George Orwell's 1984 weighs unattached versus emotional sex; Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter weighs parental obligations versus social status; Shakespeare's Othello weighs fate versus decisions; John Cheever's \\"Enormous Radio\\" weighs privacy versus safety. Each presents arguments concerning judgment and hope to lead the reader to a point of cognitive dissonance and relate it to his personal life, learning that he is unable to make a polar judgement about another person's life. Fitzgerald is exemplifying that the reader can't make forthright judgements about Gatsby's personal relationships, especially his sexual preference; the reader can only weigh each argument with his personal hopes and determine what is best for himself.Sure, Fitzgerald could have used his marriage as a model for the novel, and clear evidence supports that Gatsby has bisexual tendencies. Neither of these was Fitzgerald's purpose for writing the novel. Every great writer uses these tactics in for a greater purpose. Any writer could attack social issues or write a love story, but it takes a great author to change a reader's life."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"In F. Scott Fitzgeralds's novel The Great Gatsby, he manages to completely bore his reading audience by slowing down his depiction of the fictional story. This novel has a bittersweet storyline to it, which can keep a reader hooked at certain points, but not all throughout the novel. The love between Jay Gatbsy and the married Daisy Buchanan is just enough to keep this story going, without it, Fitzgerald has nothing to keep anyone wanting to pursue the plot. The strength of the characters in this novel is also questionable. This book is one that will not be missed for those who would like to read about little excitement once in a while. The Great Gatsby is a decent piece of fiction, but its slow formation, poor narration, and lack of enthusiasm fails to keep its audience entwined.The introduction in this novel should just be skimmed, because reading would take too much time and it is far too detailed for any intro. Much of the background that Fitzgerald puts into the story is unnecessary and for the most part, mundane. At one point, he goes into detail describing pages of guests that go to one of Jay Gatsby's numerous parties. ALthough this book does move slowly, some of the romantic moments between Jay and Daisy do cause a little bit of suspense in the storyline. The ending to this story is also another drawn out process. It is again filled with a bunch of statements that really do not pertain to the story as a whole. The end is full of sentimental thoughts that do not really mean much to the reader. Basically, Fitzgerald becomes extremely wordy when he begins and finishes the Great Gatsby.Nick Carraway, the narrator in this story is a poor character. As he tells about the individual lives of the characters, he seems to give off a sense of detachment. Being the narrator, of course, he might be somewhat not as important as the rest of the characters; however, it is almost as if he was not even a part of the story. The book would have been better without him because he did not do much to give a true insight on the feelings of each person. He is far too conservative for a person who is supposed to give the opinions about the actions of the main people in the two love triangles. Perhaps if Nick were more a direct and upfront about his take on the romantic episodes Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan along with Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, the audience might be enthusiastic about reading.Fitzgerald uses his own life experiences as a guide in this story, which in a way helps readers understand some parts of the chemistry between Jay and Daisy during the roaring twenties. The poor guy that Fitzgerald used to be was Jay and the beautiful rich girl that he was in love with, but could not have, was the married Daisy Buchanan. Although the plot might be fascination enough to keep some readers going others may find the general story far too detailed and at some parts boring. Sure, the ending might serve as the spontaneity that readers were waiting for; however, they should not have to wait until the end to be surprised. Most authors may throw the readers many times during a story in order to provoke those people into guessing what might happen. Fitzgerald does that less than a few times making the novel less enthralling.The Great Gatsby is a great story if one can truly appreciate its many details along with its wordy introductions and closings. A reader needs more than patience alone to read this book all at once. Now wonder this book did not receive the acclaim that it has now, when it was first published."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I don't understand. This book is called the Great Gatsby, but everyone in the book treats Gatsby like he's regular size. What's so great about that? I mean, if he were a giant or something, that would be totally sweet, but if he's just a normal size guy, then why does he get a whole book about his greatness?All I really remember about this book is there are some strange things about lights on the shore, and a chick named Daisy, which made me think about the Dukes of Hazard a little bit, but that's it. I sorta vaguely remember Gatsby fighting a jive talking robot, but it was in one of the later chapters, so I won't ruin it for you.You can read this book if you want, but I'd recommend you try and figure out who is better: Kitt from Knight Rider, or the Orange car from Dukes of Hazard."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"It truly is. I am quite sure that Fitzgerald is more than capable of writing a work of art. Unfortunately, this is not it.The plot is very tiresome and the book gets boring FAST. The dialogue is simply the hobnobbing of a bunch of snobs.All of the characters are quite one-dimensional which allows for minimal character growth and even less character depth.The only redeeming quality of this book is its use of &quot;color symbolism&quot;. But not even a great literary technique can salvage this novel.In short, DO NOT READ this."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I have been asked many times. What do I look for in a book? The answer is simple, the characters.If I don't care about the characters I won't care much about the book.

A bunch of millionaires wallowing in their lives.Had it not been for all these reviews I wouldn't have bothered to read this book past page 10, and looking back I can't believe I finished it.Next time 10 pages and your out."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"My personal choice for The Great American Novel - with an emphasis on the American. This is, as narrator Nick Carraway notes, a story of the West after all.Fitzgerald's masterpiece captures the American dream at a point in time, and yet in a way that resonates down to us today. It remains the most accessible of the classics. I can't recall enjoying re reading a book more. Just a delight. Every chapter, every page, is luminous and heart breaking.I returned to the book, haunted in many ways, not so much by Gatsby as by Carraway, the narrator, who happens to be in the perfect position to observe the Gatsby/Daisy Buchanan love story, as a relative of Daisy and a neighbor of Gatsby's.It was his sense of being an outsider looking in, or being more observer than participant in events, with which I most cloely identified. In many ways I still think of it as Nick's book, and this re reading confirmed the notion."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is a book that you will appreciate for a long time after your done with it. I couldn't put it down from the second I started reading it. The characters are finely crafted and the storyline a hit as you meet Nick and Gatsby and the different lives they lead until one day they are both wonderfully and tragically intertwined.

Scott Fitzgerald and the 1920's because of reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy. Greed and the lust of power are very dangerous. A reflection of a darkening America, the book is more relevant today than it was in 1925."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"At only 182 pages in the paperback edition, The Great Gatsby looms far larger in the life of American fiction than its slim dimensions. Unlike many novels with a great deal of hype latched to them, Gatsby lives up to its reputation in every blessed way. Perhaps part of the staying power and widespread appeal of this work is that it and its author were nearly forgotten. This powerful work was hardly read for more than 25 years, and now it is widely assumed to be one of the greatest works of American fiction in the 20th century. It earned its kingdom through dark years. From amnesia to aggrandizement shows that behind the swirl of its reputation is a powerfully complete artistic vision. Like all great work, Gatsby can be read on many levels: as a critique of the shifting American psyche, as a critique of the pitfalls of capitalism, as a time capsule of the roaring 20's... each reading brings new surprises. Perhaps the most refreshing reading is the uniqueness of the language. Fitzgerald here created prose masterpiece. Every sentence is finely wrought and cleverly designed, like jewels in an exquisite setting. He created, as he stated, a consciously artistic achievement."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is not your typical fictional novel. In this book you will find mystery, excitement, rule-breaking, parties, and shady characters that surprise you with every turn- all of which I was not expecting when I began this book. F. Scott Fitzgerald added these elements in a 1920's setting- an era in which there were many social changes. The main theme presented in this book- you can't relive the past- is relevent even today. We all live in the here-and-now- what's in the past is in the past for a reason, and trying to alter that will cause problems for many people- as you will find in The Great Gatsby. We can all get something out of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, no matter your age!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is not a perfect novel. The characters are underdeveloped. It is difficult to care about some of them either way. The story line is melodramatic, and it does not break any new ground.However, the real joy of the book it the language it is written in. Try reading it aloud. You will appreciate the rhythm and the cadenza of how each paragraph is constructed. You will not find a book that evokes its settings more vividly than this one. This is a short book, but it is to be read slowly. Savor every moment. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I read this book after having known the plot and ending, through another novel, The Double Bind by Chris Bohjalian. I figured it sounded interesting and thought I would read it for myself. Having known the ending didn't make for the most exciting read, but it was good. More than that, it was more about what the novel represented and did not say.I won't go through the plot. The 1920's were a fascenating time and this novel helped capture that. While it was also written during this period, it had very much a sound and tone of an older novel which did take a little getting used to. Overall, I'd describe it as a little more bland or plain spoken that what you might read today. The character development was done with finess and the story was brought along to the conclusion masterfully. Towards the end you just wanted to skip through to see how it would end.Overall it's a tragic tale. There's a lot of tragedy in the book, however it's interesting how the author choses to present this to us, in a matter of fact way. What really resonates with me is the topic of the past and how some of us are prisoners of it. And how often a first love, may be your only true love. The notion that maybe you can recapture this one day, is something I think many can relate to. Great novel, I'm glad I decided to finally get around to reading this classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald captured one of the great truths of American life: that a person can \\"reinvent\\" themselves. We are not bound by our accidents of birth. He also captured one of the sad truths: too many people spend their lives chasing an illusion. In Gatsby's case, it was the illuions of the happiness that comes from being in the \\"moneyed\\" class. If Fitzgerald were writing today, I would bet that Gatsby would be chasing celebrity culture, equally pointless and equally seductive to so many. The developing friendship between Nick and Gatsby is interesting to watch, as Gatsby at first tries to ingratiate himself with his money, and then realizes he doesn't have to and finally opens up to have a real friend. When Nick informs Gatsby that he is worth the lot of the rich put together, it is a culmination of something real, not the illusion. The book captuers the roaring 20's well, but can also translate easily into our time. It is justifiably considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Did you ever want to go back? Back to those great times? That's what Gatsby wanted to do but he additionally wanted to CHANGE THE RULES too!This work is told from the perspective of a third party about a determined man, Gatsby, who fails to secure an early love, a vain immature gal, Daisy, and now that he's hit the big time and has become a high-roller, he wants his Daisy back (even though he never had her to begin with) -- and he's willing to go to any extreme to OWN her.The setting is the 20s, a period of excess and near social insanity in New York City in particular. Gatsby puts his plan into place and things go fine for awhile in that Daisy responds quickly to his overtures. But what Gatsby never figured on is that Daisy is a mile wide and an inch thick. She RE-responds to her husband's overtures to come back, albeit this act is spurred on by a personal tragedy and the death of a near-innocent.Gatsby, in the meantime, has inadvertently set into motion a chain of events over which he no longer exerts control and, ultimately, it leads to his demise.This book is arguably Fitzgerald's best work and it's bulging with symbolism and metaphor. It's a book that is set apart from most others of the period and now is thus referred to as \\"literature\\" -- quite the professionally written novel.It's not for everybody but if you're up for reading some great prose, you love scandal, and don't mind all the subtle ethical lessons that accompany the work, then this one is probably for you.Tom Wolf wrote a very similar work which was all about having rotten friends and the parallel excesses of a much more contemporary period, if you're interested:The Bonfire of the Vanities"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This novel may have a bit of a negative association for many past and present American high schoolers, myself included (two decades ago), who were forced to read it. And it is a touch boring. But other than that it's a great book, especially considering that the author was only 29 years old when it was published. It flawlessly captures the excesses of the roaring 1920s in the Hamptons of Long Island, through a group of characters who are each distinct and not easy to forget. The description of the wasteland surrounding the shop of the mechanic, George Wilson, is a very interesting way to contrast the lavishness of the Hamptons. And there actually is a fair amount of action in the plot that intensifies the psychological aspects of the story.

There are many twists to the plot and a lot of unexpected events. I found myself very surprised throughout the book because of the dramatic changes in the plot.The characters in the book were very interesting people. My favorite was Gatsby because of his unusual way of doing things. He would have parties and not go to them. This was the most odd thing about him in my opinion. It was also weird how he could keep his love for Daisy over all the years. Daisy was a very emotional character and I didn't like her very much for that. She was always unhappy about something during the book. When everything seemed alright and when she seemed happy something would upset her. I found this sort of annoying and that is why I didn't like Daisy as a character. Nick was a fairly shy character and he was my second favorite. He always went along with what was happening and never caused too many problems. He was very down to earth and I like that about him.The setting seemed very old fashioned to me. Gatsby's Mansion seemed to be very cool though, almost like a castle. I liked his mansion and the basic setting of the book.The plot was my favorite out of all. I was very bored throughout the book until the end. This is where it went 180 degrees and everything fell apart. I loved when Gatsby and Tom got into a fight because it staged the killing of Myrtle. This put some spice into the book and I was suddenly interested. George then thought that Gatsby had hit and killed his wife. When George came down to Gatsby's house it was very suspenseful.

Scott Fitzgerald claimed that his 1925 novel in titled The Great Gatsby was to be his \\"greatest masterpiece\\", in the opinion of at least one reader the book fell disappointingly short of his highly optimistic, and probably unrealistic, expectations. The Great Gatsby is often heralded as one of the \\"great\\" and \\"exemplary\\" literary works in American history, but in my opinion as a reader it is simply flawed and uninteresting. And even though my opinion may not fall into the category of mainstream sentiment towards the novel, take it as a viewpoint less explored, yet still like any other, valid nonetheless.I had no prior knowledge regarding The Great Gatsby prior to its introduction into my American Literature II class, but after seeing that it had received a vast amount of rave reviews as well as learning about its author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, I must admit I was intrigued by the prospect of a novel with lust, romance, friendships, lies among many other interesting occurrences. Fitzgerald commences his \\"masterpiece\\" in a very descriptive manner, at times overwhelmingly descriptive, by introducing to the reader his narrator Nick Carraway. Nick seems to be an honest and trustworthy narrator throughout the course novel, but in my opinion he refuses to speak of the harsh realities of life to Jay Gatsby, a person who he considers his friend. Nick is very observant and descriptive, qualities essential to any successful narrator of a novel, but at times, Fitzgerald goes over board allowing Nick to ramble on about scenery and how he feels towards certain character's actions and feelings. Some readers may enjoy detail, but excess detail, from my vantage point, makes the story needlessly long and a strenuous read. I in particular do not appreciate it when an author forces me to continue reading a story that seems to take forever to develop.Another aspect aside for the excess detail used by Fitzgerald, is his weak and clich&eacute; storyline. Its been done, honestly, William Shakespeare wrote this same type of story a while back, Fitzgerald simply chose to give it a twist by moving the setting to the roaring twenties, but unfortunately that added little excitement to a boring and unoriginal story. I will try not to give away any of the major portions of the storyline, but still explain why I feel this way towards The Great Gatsby, and the way it was written. First off the characters are all, in the words Holden Caufield in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in The Rye, \\"phonies\\", prototypical aristocrats of the 1920's, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald himself. That includes the narrator Nick, who leaves the rural mid-west for a life of glamour in the \\"capital of the world\\" NYC. I personally had a difficult time relating to their personalities and their various \\"issues\\". Another aspect that makes the story dull and repetitive is its \\"classical\\" love hook. This is a feeble attempt by Fitzgerald to add spice to an otherwise tasteless novel. Its unoriginal, and not what I expected from one of the best authors in American literature.Now I will not tear the novel to shreds or call it a waste of time, but I rather watch grass grow than reread The Great Gatsby. If you as a reader are able to overlook the excess descriptions given by Nick throughout the novel, the predictable storyline, and the abrupt and disappointing ending, then you will love this book, maybe even consider it as one of your all-time favorites. But I for one would like to forget I ever read it. If The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"greatest masterpiece\\" maybe we should reconsider his status as one of the best writers in American Literature."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of literature that shows that man has a chance at success and fortune and/or a chance at a solid relationship. Money and success in a goal for the ambitious, and F. Scott Fitzgerald hit this hard. However, the 3 out of 5, is because this book is lacking in excitement and adventure. This book is for the people that enjoy detailed parties and a man looking for a future. But, I had to give credit where credit is due. Fitzgerald is a brilliant writer, although he writes with a style that; leaves you to organize the event.These events will determine if you will trust the character Jay Gatsby in the end.

I did like it, particularly the prose, but didn't consider it &quot;great.&quot; I was led to believe it was a story of life during the Jazz Age, an era I am very much interested in, and didn't find much in the way of describing life in the 1920s apart from some nightly parties thrown and attended by overly rich people and the title character being involved in bootlegging. I was expecting more descriptions of things like the actual process involved in bootlegging (how they made the alcohol in their bathtubs, for example), the kind of clothes people were wearing, popular songs and dances, flappers, movies, that sort of thing.I found what remained of the story, after the lovely prose and descriptions of Twenties life, to be plotless and unconvincing. Why is Nick Carraway narrating this story? What does he do that's important? This book would have been better served with third-person narration instead of being narrated by Daisy's second-cousin once removed. It was also really unrealistic how Daisy and Gatsby instantly are as close and loving as they were before Daisy jilted him when he went off to war in 1917 and because he wasn't a rich man. Daisy has since married and had a child; she hasn't sat around waiting for him all these years like Penelope waited for Odysseus! I'm supposed to believe that their romance is rekindled overnight, and applaud Gatsby for throwing these lavish nightly parties only out of the vain hope that Daisy might come to one of them and see him again? He even has his house right across the way from Daisy's, and became so rich only in the hopes of winning her back, which seems really obsessive instead of sweet and romantic.The book would have been better served having a hundred or so more pages so the reader could figure out the solutions to all of the whodunnits on his or her own. These are some great and intriguing mysteries, yet very quickly we're handed all of the answers on a silver platter. That takes away the thrill of figuring out what happened on one's own. The ending also was very dead-end and disappointing. I would have liked it more had the plot unfolded slower instead of too quickly to be realistic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Green light means go.In The Great Gatsby, green light means don't go..The green light is mentioned three times in the novel: at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end.Before I proceed, should I also mention that the The Great Gatsby is one of the most important novels in the American language.I emphasize, this novel is uniquely American. You will find no other work of literature that can hold a candle to this book. It may be required reading in high school, but oh what a work of art the world considers this book to be. Read it and be forever thankful this country can produce a novel like this.The style is decptively simple. When Gatsby says, \\"Old sport!\\" I think of Holden Caulfield saying, \\"For Chrissakes!\\"Salinger owes Fitzgerald a lot. Without The Great Gatsby, there can be no Catcher In The Rye. Nick Carraway is a grown up Holden Caulfield. Carraway is confiding in you. He is talking to you one on one. You listen to him because you want to be his confidant.Going back to the green light.The green light means the green American dream. How ironic that the road ends on your side of the intersection when the traffic light flashes go!Gatsby stands at land's end and stares at the green light hanging at the end of the pier behind Daisy's home. The road ends at his feet. He can get no closer to his American dream that this! All that money he has doesn't help him win Daisy one bit.. All those flashy shirts he pulls from his closet, all those different color sports cars he drives, all of it means nothing.Money can't buy you love. (That;s a good title for a song!). That is what The Great Gatsby is all about.. Green light, go.....My copy of this hard bound Scribner edition of The Great Gatsby has the printed price of [price]. That is how long ago I bought it. I suggest you run out and buy this edition before the price goes any higher. The book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This is just my simple opinion, but when I read The Great Gatsby, I found it to be 1) extremely difficult to follow, and 2) drastically overbearing. People describe F. Scott's Fitzgerald's writing as poetic, and indeed it is at some points in the book. However I believe that as a result of this, Gatsby is much more difficult to read and comprehend. I would have preferred a more traditional writing style instead of a over-embellished, over-done, and, most importantly, an overly-complex style of writing."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"To me, this book was a little on the dull side. The life of Jay Gatsby was less than fascinating and his obsession with Daisy Buchanan was pathetic. This doesn't mean that the book isn't well-written or that it isn't a &quot;classic&quot;- that's why I give it three stars. Its slow moving plot and lack of action is the reason why I only give it three stars."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Simply put, this may be the greatest masterpiece ever written by an American author. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is superb during the classic tale of Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, and the other supporting characters. Fitzgerald's masterpiece is depressing, and it is much like Romeo &amp; Juliet, in that happiness is never attained. However, it is his writing style that saves this book. The eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald has never been more clearly shown than in this book. Readers can literally see the hours he spent poring over his manuscript, for every line, word, and phrase is carefully thought out. Concise, witty, and lyrical, Fitzgerald's writing style quickly captures the reader through sheer humor through the first 50 pages, and leaves the reader breathless through the last 3/4 of the book, detailing his romance with the problems that arise from it. The true brilliance is not the story, for the story has been told before. This novel is a vehicle for Fitzgerald's skill as a writer. The book must be read more than once, for Fitzgerald pieces together his story very carefully, giving the reader hints of the outcome before the ending, hints that are easily missed on the first read. Every word in every sentence is carefully thought out, a phenomenon clearly seen after reading the novel more than once. It is that unquestionable brilliance as a writer, that amazing style and eloquence, that gives this book its greatness. Fitzgerald has never been this witty, this dry, this powerful, this sarcastic, and this thrilling. Are there flaws? Absolutely. The book is ambiguous on the ending, and the book must be reread in order to be fully appreciated. Yet, the book is so good that those flaws are ignored easily. The wittiness, the humor, the sarcasm, all mixed with the sadness and depression, creates an atmosphere of life breathing through the pages. The characters are timeless, the writing brilliant, the story simple, this is a book for all time."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Contemporarily, when one undertakes a classic literary paragon such as \\"Gatsby\\", it isn't usually just for the sheer pleasure of reading a \\"good book\\"...one typically reads it to feel the need to be connected to writing so sublime that one could almost draw spiritual innervations from it. Some, on the other hand, may feel the need to be grounded in literature so rich and provocative that upon returning to contemporary fiction, they then have a yardstick with which to compare. Others, still, may derive and extract lost emotions that only the classics can emote.Whatever vehicle drives one back to consider \\"Gatsby\\", the outcome can only lead to some interesting and, perhaps, novel conclusions. This reader's motivation, for example, was a recent reading of Dan Okrent's marvelous account of the bootlegging \`20's in \\"Last Call\\" a history of prohibition wherein Okrent describes disparate characters very much similar to Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby and the socio-culture of the \\"jazz-age\\" that is depicted so eloquently in \\"Gatsby\\". Whatever the engine, returning to this prodigious work by Fitzgerald, the reader is again struck by the grandiloquence of the wording, the grandeur of the scene setting, the power of the plot and the gut-wrenching and heartfelt sensibilities of the narrator as he and thus the reader are dragged along in a story so strong and powerful, we immediately recognize the brilliance of Fitzgerald as an archetype fiction writer and also, then, the work of \\"Gatsby\\" as his literary masterpiece.True, there are criticisms that have abounded for decades...the character development especially for Daisy and Tom Buchanan are almost deplorably one dimensional. Some of the criticisms of Gatsby follow this same line...he appears to be horribly shallow and unfeeling; immature in an unsettling way as to drive the reader to wonder what Daisy (no mature stalwart herself by any standard) ever saw in him. Also, the tragic Wilson's are almost laughable in their lack of earnestness and believability...Fitzgerald provides an antagonist that is almost too downcast, too disconsolate to be believable.And yet it all works. The overall drive for this work and, undoubtedly, the reason it has reached mythic proportions as a literary classic, is the nuanced and almost transcendent interventions of the narrator Nick Carraway. His profound and reasoned observations seemingly tie everything together. He is what makes this book work. Fitzgerald, after further consideration, probably had this in mind all along...if that was his intent, he truly was a genius.So whatever your compulsion, go back to West Egg, Long Island; enjoy an evening at the Gatsby mansion and immerse yourself in the early \`20's jazz age once again while experiencing expert literary storytelling. You'll undoubtedly find yourself marveling at the genius of F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work along with all the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I often feel you can judge a book by the first and last lines. The Great Gatsby is my favorite example of this. The first line is:In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. \\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This why Fitzgerald is read today, this one book. The Crack-Up is devastingly insightful and an incredible work for its time; the Letters are the second best thing he did; but this one book is why F. Scott Fitzgerald is remembered today.

It is a masterpiece; I first read the book years ago and only in time after re-visiting it and re-reading do you get what Fitzgerald was going after. It is relatively short for a novel yet it is an epic in ideas and idealism centering around the American Dream. The characters described; Daisy, Nick, tom, Gatsby; they are richly portrayed in their own ways. Fitzgerald is a master in setting the scene; each desire, emotion and quest bouncing off of one another in the place where all dreams face off: West Egg. This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"\\"More critical writing exists on The Great Gatsby than on any other work of American fiction\\" - according to the back matter ofF. Scott Fitzgerald: The Great Gatsby, a critical guide from Columbia University Press. Though it's unsourced, it sounds legitimate - which is why I doubt I can say much about Fitzgerald's work that hasn't already been said. However, except for briefly commenting on the novel's classic status, the reason I've written this review is to assist those who, like me, may have avoided 'Gatsby' for years, and to help them decide whether to keep on doing so.I sidestepped 'The Great Gatsby' because I believed that this book, universally acknowledged as a classic, had to make its appeal for that standing to the broadest possible base of readers - an American Literature primer, so to speak. High-handed, maybe, but I've basically the same opinion since finishing the book as before. That doesn't mean 'Gatsby' isn't an excellent construction, full of interesting themes and motifs, and above all an insightful opinion on the American Dream - which I expected - but as an introduction to literature, I wonder what resonance 'Gatsby' carries for young readers confronted with the book today.Jay Gatsby, the self-made man, built out of nothing but now able to buy anything except the one thing he wants - Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the voice of reason, narrates the events - how Gatsby and Daisy, lovers before the war, are reunited; but despite all of Gatsby's attempts, he fails to lure her away from her philandering husband. Nick, disgusted with the excesses and unseemliness of both Gatsby's party crowd and Daisy's old money blue bloods, eventually decamps westward, returning symbolically to the common sense of America's heartland.It's not surprising that 'The Great Gatsby' wasn't successful in Fitzgerald's lifetime. After all, he chastised the people most likely to read his book for being part of the anything goes culture. Nor is it remarkable that there was a rediscovery of 'Gatsby' after World War II. In the Twenties, Nick Carraway was a perceptive man, and Gatsby a nave and complicit victim of the American Dream. In the years since, Nick looks like an altruistic fool, and, in the ultimate irony, Gatsby, who was facetiously called 'Great' by Fitzgerald, has grown into his title. Viewing his life now, it's difficult not to say that he conquered the Dream as he acquired a vast wealth, and his willingness to sacrifice everything for Daisy becomes a tragic flaw - instead of one last symbol in a poorly directed life.Fitzgerald warned that the pursuit of wealth wasn't enough, that it couldn't buy dreams - now the dream *is* the pursuit of wealth. Those tasked with presenting 'Gatsby' to succeeding generations must face a wall of misunderstanding - how to convince people that the wealthy Gatsby's inability to buy back his past amounts to failure? Or more importantly, why he even wanted to with all he already had. I'm glad that's not my job.In the end, though, I find a distinct lack of emotion in Fitzgerald's examination of the American Dream - it is instead an almost clinical post-mortem. No matter what the tragic circumstances surrounding the end of Gatsby are, I just can't muster up enough interest to care one way or the other. As a literature primer, it works because of Fitzgerald's skill as a wordsmith - as an effective or affecting work, instead of great, it is sufficient.This edition, with a preface and endnotes by Fitzgerald biographer Matthew Bruccoli, promises to be the \\"Authorized Text\\", a reprint of the Cambridge University Press 1991 edition. In a brief note, Mr. Bruccoli gives a few examples of some of the corrected textual errors, but I couldn't see much difference. Bruccoli's preface and the publisher's afterward were both interesting without becoming tiresome, though the endnotes seemed geared toward an inexperienced and ill-read student. Thankfully, the text wasn't dotted with superscript notation indicating entries in the endnotes, which I find very distracting. Overall, I doubt there's enough to distinguish this edition from a mass-market publication, except that it's in the trade paperback format, which I prefer if I plan to keep a book, and which is easier on the eyes the older I get."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I used this with my class of special education students (high school).

Scott Fitzgerald claimed to despise. He is both the quintessential Jazz-Age writer and probably his era's harshest critic. Complex and timeless. Who could ask for more?My favorite passage -\\"Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"What does it mean to be \\"Great\\"? F. Scott Fitzgerald expresses his idea of being great as Nick Carraway arrives to the West Egg to experience the new life in the city. After adapting to this new world, Nick is acquainted with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan; his cousin's husband, Tom Buchanan and his cousin's friend, Jordan Baker. Nick quickly realizes that his new acquaintances have been negatively influenced by wealth. Then Nick is introduced to the extremely wealthy, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby had already shown signs of generosity as he gladly accepted anyone to his elaborate parties. Gatsby was a mysterious, yet composed man which appealed to Nick. Nick felt safe around Gatsby and grows close to him, only to be caught in between a love conflict characterized with dishonesty, disloyalty, and overall debauchery. The events that follow all lead downhill as it eventually results to violence. The reader witnesses the human corruption in The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald effectively warns the reader of the doomed outcome that results to those who rapaciously seek money. The characteristics between the country life and city life are distinguished by Fitzgerald as Nick journeys from the comfortable country to the rapid pace city life and eventually illustrates that to be considered \\"Great\\" is to focus on a certain goal rather than being distracted by greed of wealth. During Nick's time living the fast life of the city, Fitzgerald not only warns the readers, but the readers are also able to observe the attributes that make a \\"Great\\" man."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book The Great Gatsby by F.

However, did this \\"fallen angel\\" have the right to pursue happiness? Was his pursuit of true love fortunate or unfortunate? The content or plot of the story would tell us that love was the greatest link.As for Gatsby's real profession, the people despised and looked down on him. In spite of this, this was the one area in which we admired him for. When the people who lived in America during the 1920s were carried away and charmed into vanity, Gatsby did not lose his inner self - his na?vet? and his high or lofty ideals. He was still a person of principle and was still punctilious about his dreams. Even if he would lose every thing for the love of his life, he would have no regrets at all.What was the drive or impulse that led a person to be so dedicated or devoted? What could possibly be the cause that led a person to be so persistent with his or her faith? It is very hard for us to love others as we love ourselves. At certain times, we feel that it's not worthwhile to pay our love and affection. For that reason, I admire and sympathize with Gatsby even more. Throughout his whole life, love had always been both a burden and a reward (for him.) Love is an ongoing lesson in life in which all of us are obliged to learn.Though this story did not contain positive and inspirational characters, the content of this book may direct the readers towards a deeper understanding of the main character's na?vet? and purity, and then guide or bring out the love within the readers' hearts."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby is one of thse books that seem so confusing in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to enjoy, and eventually, love.Almost everything that happens in the book is completely ironic because in the end, everything is just the opposite of what the author leads you to expect. Even the way the story is written is ironic because although the author uses all kinds of deep and meaningful descriptions about everything, the things he is writing about are the extreme shallowness and pretentiousness of the people who live in that time. In a way, the story is a satire through and through.The whole story is a whirlwind of emotions and it practically turns everything from the mood to the environment to the people inside out, and all of it is told from a single person's point of view, which makes it all the easier to imagine that you are actually the one thinking those thoughts.Also, it becomes very easy to relate to the story when you realize that even if the story takes place in a time long before, every kind of flaw in man is still present today, and a lot of them are featured in the very colorful characters from The Great Gatsby. Traits like immaturity, lovesickness, carelessness, snobbery, etc, were present then and are still present now, and once you realize that you will be able to enjoy the pure humor in the book that the author is probably trying to present to us.The Great Gatsby is one of the most obscure books that I have ever read, and yet after I read it, a lightbulb appeared in my head and now that I understand it's message, I know that I really enjoyed it and the challenge was wortht the read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"When I first start reading chapter one and two I wanted to give up reading the book because I couldn't understand what the author was talking about.

It means that it's not wise to judge people by the looks because sometimes you might misunderstand that person and create some problems. However, I think the story was mainly about how wealth, popularity, love, loss, betrayal and emptiness. The whole story is kind of depressing because two of the characters die. Everyone's life is depended on money but nothing else. People tend to care about money than the social problems between groups of people. There is a social problem that caused through many years. People divide themselves in to three groups, high class, mid class and low class. If you're not very wealthy, people would just ignore you but when your fairly rich people would remember your name.

As he goes on he describes the type of environment he is in. How the East Egg and West Egg differ, yet they both share the same sort of problems. The East Egg is full of the aristocratic, while the West Egg is known as the area for the \\"new rich\\". He is assosciated with Daisy (his cousin), Tom (Daisy's wife), and Jordan (Daisy's friend) who all reside on the East Egg. All of them live in a world where they are surrounded by wealth, and in other people's eyes \\"problem free\\". Nick lives in the West Egg and lives beside a mysterious man, only known as Gatsby. Gatsby is everything that Nick scorns, but disregards that comment because he isn't a person that judges people. As the story moves on we Nick and Gatsby becomes friends. Gatsby tries to win back his past love, but finds that difficult for she already is married. Many surprising events happen, and it all ends tragically.Overall, the book is full of adventure. When you first read it, you feel as though this book has no point, and you want to find out who Gatsy is. Luckily as the story moves on, NIck and Gatsby develop a close friendship, and we actually get to see who this man is -- behind all those lavish parties and life a luxury. The story unfolds and you actually see that these wealthy people actually have a big load of problems, and that they are not as they seem. The way the author choose his words, make you think about a deeper meaning that goes beyond in the book. I think this is one reason why the book is so interesting, because it is just full of surprises. The Great Gatsby is one of those classic books in American literature that you have to read.

The Great Gatsby is a book about a love remade between Jay Gatsby, an extremely wealthy man who was known for throwing lavish parties, and Daisy Buchanan's, a woman who is charmed by a mans wealth. The two meet through Nick Carraway, (Daisy's cousin) a young, educated man who moves to New York to further his knowledge in the bond business. It begins with Nick meeting Jay at one of his parties where he doesn't feel that he really fits in. Here he learns that the locals pride themselves on material possessions more so than that of more noble goals.As the story grows you learn more about Daisy's husband, Tom, who has a side relation with Myrtle Wilson of which Daisy knows about. Although Tom is just as guilty, with his gain in knowledge of his wife's affair, he becomes more and more jealous of the relation between Daisy and Gatsby which is growing more intense as time goes by. With the progressing tension building, things take a twist to end the book with an exciting, unexpected ending.This work by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a remarkable display of the way society was folding in the 1920's. The way people were falling into a trap where moral values were deteriorating, greed was taking over, and the reckless lifestyle of parties displayed most of the times ideas of wealth. The unrealistic ideas of money could have been related to the rise in the stock market after the war which led to a newfound materialism. This allowed people of any social status to become wealthy. The difference between the East and West egg in the book demonstrated this idea of \\"new and old money\\".The symbolism in the book can become baffling at some point making it an unpleasureable read. In order to understand the whole concept that Fitzgerald is trying to convey, you need to recognize and understand the meanings behind what he is actually saying. Although this was a good book, this aspect of it threw me off a little bit and created a confusing read. If you enjoy reading about a meant to be romance and the confusion that comes with realizing that to late, then this is defiantly a book I would recommend for you."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The book started out as a bore.

Little did Gatsby know that shortly after, he would be exiled to Darkest India due to the evil government stooges. Alas, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, digress. All you young accidents who wish to major in that truly noble subject, American Literature, should read this amusing novel post-haste! The story is simple: Maibatsu (or Jay for short) Gatsby is a millionare-tyrant by day, fiendish anarchist by night. With the help of his dashing assistant/lover Daisy, they bring down the social and economic classes only to be foiled by the fiendish lout, Tom (Daisy's first husband) who is a two-timing secret agent. In the end (after a daring car chase) Gatsby and Daisy die in eachother's arms, ascending happily to Our Lord and Maker.Hark! It is near noon-mass time!Grouchily,Professor Emeritus Percy Q. JohnstoneProfessor Emeritus of American LiteratureDarkest India"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I first read this one years ago, in high school I believe, and I liked it well enough then. But it was soon eclipsed in my mind by Joyce's works. And Hemingway's. Against the works of these latter authors, Fitzgerald's GATSBY seemed to me to be rather ordinary, old fashioned if you will . . . albeit a nicely honed piece of prose.There is, indeed, a certain artifice to the Gatsby story which smacks of the writer's intentions, an intrusive \\"plottiness\\" reflecting coincidences which are not at all the way things really work in life. And yet for all that, the story is strongly told, moving and lyrical, and the characterizations, as I found on re-reading the novel at my wife's urging, far more subtle than I recalled from my high school days. GATSBY is the story of a mystery man who dreams of a wealthy debutante he met years before, when he was an impoverished young soldier, and whose entire life since has been dedicated to winning her. To do this he has earned millions of dollars in the heyday of racketeering and prohibition (how is never quite made clear) and, at the time the novel is set, is engaged in creating an upper class persona for himself, in order to be worthy of the woman he loves.Of course, as Fitzgerald, through his narrator, the Midwestern transplant and aspiring bond salesman, Nick Carraway, shows, it is not Gatsby who needs to be made worthy at all. There is a certain melodrama to the tale which kind of blunted the edge for me but, on balance, the overwrought tragic overtones in the careless hit and run accident that brings all to a head are more than balanced out by the insight vouchsafed to us by Nick when he tells Gatsby, near the end, that the whole lot of them are not worth Gatsby alone. Gatsby wanders off distractedly to meet his undeserved destiny, thereafter, and Nick remains to pick up the pieces, packing up and returning home to the Midwest in disgust, and something akin to despair, at the human condition when, at last, the full import of what has occurred comes home to him.Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded. Though it has flaws, the powerful insight and the polished, lyrical prose more than make up for them, setting this book firmly in the constellation of great American novels.SWM"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This book is a literary classic. This is not difficult for many to recognize, but often this book is used as a required reading assignment in high school and teens don't get the &quot;Big Picture.&quot;TGG was assigned to me while in highschool. I made a mad dash for the bookstore to get the Cliff's Notes. I BS'd my way through a book report and put the class behind me.I just read the book for a college english class. I'll reiterate what a wonderful book it is.I am left feeling like I should in fact have read it in highschool instead of opting for the Cliff's Notes. Reading the book in highschool and then again in college would have allowed me to draw a wonderful parallel. I wish I was able to look back on my views in high school and compare them to my opinions of the book today.Reading TGG in highscool and then in college gives you an oppurtunity to see your maturation first hand!"},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I really enjoyed and would highly recommend reading The Great Gatsby. Overall, it was an easy read, and for the most part, a light-hearted, entertaining story. It had an interesting plot with remarkable characters to support it. Even though it was written almost a century ago, it is still easy to appreciate Fitzgerald's ideas and style of writing.The book was very well written for many reasons. I liked the fact that it was a first person narrative. I personally enjoy first person novel because I think that the insight of the narrator makes the reader relate to the story more, as opposed to the neutral position of a third person story. The narrative offered details vivid enough to easily imagine the setting. I was not familiar with the setting in New York, but the descriptiveness was clear enough for me to picture the scenes. Also, the writing style was excellent at using setting as a device to convey emotion, and in a few instances, foreshadowing. The plot is fast moving and I really enjoyed the unexpected plot twist towards the end. The small side plots that arose between the supporting characters sustained my interest also. The story was very much to the point, and did not at any time drag on.The strongest part of the writing was the development, connections, and introduction of the characters. Nick Cattaway fits the role of the narrator perfectly and provides a central connection among all the other characters. It allowed me to feel more sympathetic towards the characters because of Nick's sympathy for his friends. The order in which he introduces the characters and then slowly revealed how their lives were intertwined made for a very interesting story. My favorite of the introductions was the surprisingly low key intro to Gatsby. However, this character was the only one that I wasn't satisfied with, and proved to be the only flaw I found with the book.The lack of development of the character of Gatsby was very disappointing for me. After such a unique entrance, in addition to the title, I expected much more than the book offered. Although more is revealed about Gatsby as the story progresses, I still didn't feel a connection to the character. Since Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious character, that may be the reason the lack of information about him. However, there seemed to be a true depth missing that was hinted at, but was never fully communicated. This was especially true in the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The intensity of Gatsby's feelings seemed to be glanced over.Besides that minor negative point, the book was very good, and as a said before I recommend it to anyone looking for a short but enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was a book that stayed with me long after hearing it read. I found Gatsby to be a very intriguing character because of his singleminded passion. I enjoyed understanding the thoughts and ideas of Carraway. The writing provided vivid imagery of a time gone by and yet it was a timeless story. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Why is this novel a classic? The answer is more than just Fitzgerald's wonderful prose or his use of imagery to convey messages. The answer lies in the way the characters in this novel teach us to look more closely at ourselves and our lives and notice things we might otherwise have missed.The novel's narrator, Nick, opens by telling us that he \\"tends to reserve all judgements\\" of people until he has gotten to know them. From this introduction, we come to see the flaw in Nick's reasoning. For he does judge people, though he chooses to remain silent about it, and we see his judgements as he introduces us to the people in his life. It seems that everyone around Nick is obsessed with money, particularly his second cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. Nick introduces Tom and Daisy by telling us that they \\"drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.\\" This excellent sentence tells us pretty much everything we need to know about Tom and Daisy, and the events that follow do little to change this perception. And then there's Gatsby. Wealthy, popular, mysterious Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties at his mansion and seems to be totally in control of his life. And yet he longs for something more: to be with Daisy, the woman he loves. But is he really in love with Daisy, or is he only in love with the person he thinks she is? This question plagues us as we read, watching Gatsby's facade crumble as he pursues Daisy throughout the novel. We know that something terrible is going to happen, we just don't know what it is. Yet we know that the relationship is doomed; Daisy doesn't love Gatsby, she is in love with his image. And through Nick's eyes, her true character is revealed. We see that although Daisy is beautiful, she is also cold, caring only for herself and her own happiness. Her true love is money, and she's married to a man who can provide her with what she truly loves. She cares little for the consequences of her actions. Nick's final assesment reads, \\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...\\"The lesson is powerful and important: things aren't always what they seem. The bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil, and we see this played out in the lives of these characters. In the end, Nick realizes that some things are more important, and so he has resolved to go on with his life and learn from Gatsby's mistakes. We, the readers, are touched and changed. That is why this book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I had to read this book in high school as a Junior and I didn't really get into it. In fact I really coasted through the book without really following it too closely. I decided to reread it and I was much surprised by how much I liked this novel.Fitzgerald has created a great portrait of a tainted American Dream. Through his character Jay Gatsby we see how the ideals of society have been corrupted. Gatsby made his fortune by dubious means, and pursues irrationally Daisy Buchannan, a very vapid individual who comes to tears over shirts. This is also symbolic of his the futile pursuit of happiness.Though this novel was written in the 20's, the message is still timeless. Anyone who thinks this is dated has not looked at the society we live in. We are practically in another me generation. People today don't have a care in the world. Having recently finished high school and being currently in college I have witnessed the sort of carefree vapid sense that most young people have. They don't have a collective thought in their heads other than drinking and partying. They also don't seem to care who they hurt in the process, sort of like Daisy and Gatsby in the car.The only drawback I can possibly see with this wonderful novel is the technical skills. They aren't great but they don't detract from the story. Fitzgerald does use a limited perspective and he does follow a cohesive plot, so the technical writing isn't too terrible.Overall this is one of the top 10 books I have ever read, and I have read quite extensively. So don't listen to the negative reviews, read this novel and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald is mainly known as a jazz age writer, as an observer of the flappers and his work is considered to be stuck in the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. This novel captures the American spirit in all its confused idealism, its expansive dreaming and scheming, the corruption in its childlike innocence and its penchant for pressing into the future without examining the past. The old money and its callous cop-out policies are still practised by the ones who can buy second chances as symbolized by the established Buchanans while neurotic upstart Gatsby is the forerunner of every motivated small town boy who makes it against the odds and finds out that although everything is for sale, including a brand new identity , all the power and all the glitz can't buy back the wasted youth or the heart of the ones who had their finger on the pulse of opportunity and rationale. The closer Gatsby gets to his dream the more remote its core becomes;not unlike an emotional fata morgana. Nick Carraway is the chronicler of this tragedy of illusion and leaves the wiser for having the veil lifted and seeing nothing more than a poor boy's broken heart in the swimmingpool of vodka and blood. The Wilsons from the wrong side of the track are a brilliant signifier of how the priviledged amuse themselves with the hardscabble folks for diversion but can effort to cut them at a moment's notice. Having means won't buy you love or real friends but it will buy you a clean slate again and again until you run out of real estate. Gatsby's real estate is his heart's yearning so he dies desolate because he bought the motivational speech and was never told that the new continent and all its attentant promises might make room for a new brand of hero but it can't change the human heart.A classic in the best sense of the word. A Greek myth remade to fit the size of the new world."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Most reviews of this book talk of nothing but the love affair of Daisy and Jay Gatsby. They never speak of the off balance, really modern relationship of Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker. Carraway is by far the character to watch, and the one that makes this book interesting. His constantly changing relationship to Gatsby is strictly human. Reading this book from the twenties is like reading a book from the nineties. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was far ahead of its time, and so was Nick Carraway and the relationships flooded throughout the book.The gossip aspect is very modern as well. Everyone at Gatsby's parties follow him around because of mystery. And that's what Jay Gatsby is about. Mystery. Even when the book is over, you never fully understand him.Overall, a great book, but not the best ever."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"Fitzgerald's third and best-known novel, \\"Gatsby\\" is remarkable both for the degree of skill already evidenced by the 28-year-old writer and for the unmistakable turn of phrases, a hallmark of Fitzgerald's writing. My favorite aspect of Fitzgerald's prose is the way he was able to convey such precise shades of meaning, fearlessly crafting sentences that though wordy perfectly capture a character's emotions or a memory's effect.\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is, essentially, a tragic story of love gone wrong. Is a lie told out of love less censurable than those told for lower reasons? Gatsby spins a cocoon of lies around himself, a cocoon from which he hopes to emerge as a new man worthy of Daisy's love. He emerges instead into a world of liars, and though on the face of things he is the biggest grifter of them all, Gatsby alone elicits sympathy: there is a degree of absolution due the creator of such a colossal deception. It is almost as if one is begging to be found out. Neither Tom nor Daisy nor Jordan nor even the unhappily married Wilsons have any such claim on our understanding. In the course of this story everyone lies to everyone else: only Gatsby pays the price. The truly creative liar is punished, the everyday tellers of banal lies go unchecked.I personally preferred \\"Tender is the Night\\", perhaps only because its longer and more complex nature allowed Fitzgerald more room to perform, to draw on all the powers at his command. But \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is definitely a worthwhile read, a relatively short tale told with the ease of a colorful memory."},{"Title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"I am a 17 year old high school student and I just read the Great Gatsby this year for my English class. I expected it to be just like every other &quot;classic&quot; novel, full of stogy prose and dated language. Instead what I found was a thorougly &quot;modern&quot; book, in every way. The descriptions, the characters, the situations, all seemed to be latent in society today. It made me want to be alive in the 1920's, a time of unmeasurable prosperity and creative talent."},{"Title":"Love and Other Stories","review":"George Szirtes in his introduction raises as many questions as he answers about this purportedly Chekhovian Hungarian writer (1897-1977). Dery's persistent if rather cloaked versions of socialist realism, stemming from his Communist Party affiliations that predated the \\"red terror\\" of the Bela Kun soviet that briefly took over Hungary in 1919, do mask whatever Dery deeper down might have come to feel about the regime that liberated his nation from the Nazi and Arrow Cross fascism that he describes well in his vignettes near and of the end of WW2. I wonder what Dery wanted to write rather than what he was allowed to publish in the subsequent totalitarian regime. Dissent peeks out slightly, but is allowable if against discredited former regimes or occupiers, not the present ones.A knowledge of modern Hungarian history is needed to fully appreciate some of the stories. The Rakosi, pre-1956, Stalin-aligned rulers are denigrated energetically by characters; the sacrifice of a professor who gets to the border after the failed rebellion and chooses to freeze to death rather than cross over into Austria and presumably betrayal of his homeland make for intriguing, if ultimately rather too oblique commentary that nonetheless remains rare for English readers of fiction. Dery's stories of the siege of Budapest and the coming of the Russians, as Szirtes notes, appeared in 1946, two years before the Communist takeover and within a time when a multiparty coalition seemed still likely. Dery does stumble: his Russian soldier who signals the war's end has \\"laughing blue eyes\\"; the Aunt Anna who dies heroically has a lingering and lengthy speech of proleteriat defiance that is simply as unbelievable as it is unrealistic. The fidelity, then, to whatever Communist principles inspired Dery long before, during, and after WW2 make for an uneven array of stories.Those linked about a collection of folks struggling under Budapest to survive the Nazi retreat and the Allied bombings make for reading that rewards--a horse brought in to survive while soldiers' corpses decay above, the bickering of bodies too long pressed together, the ideological tension as those on the fascist side contend below with those welcoming the Russians all add up to more vignettes than fully-fledged fiction, but still valuable records of the time.The strongest, most literary efforts, \\"Love\\" and \\"Two Women,\\" show Dery's ability to eschew agitprop for conventional stories, and even these hint marvellously at deeper political meanings. \\"The Circus\\" becomes a bold and moving allegory in this same fashion. Socialist realism in \\"Behind the Brick Wall,\\" however, failed to move me at all; the details of survival in \\"Reckoning\\" among the refugees escaping in late 1956 as winter descended inspired me to continue the story despite its awkward narrative, compressed perhaps again by the ideological constraints under which Dery would have produced his work under the post-rebellion Kadar-ruled state. Finally, \\"Philemon & Baucis\\" failed to rise from the pages.It is difficult to find many competent and fluent translators of an incredibly complex language of 10 million as well as English, and the quality of the various renderings differs. Some make the lower classes speak as if Cockney, some as if Southern American, slightly twisted. The tone, therefore, differs from story to story, and this may have added to the uneven nature of the fiction that is assembled here in translation. I do not know if Dery truly enjoyed writing; I get some sense that he felt he had to do so, but that he did not do so \\"naturally.\\""},{"Title":"National Certification Examination for Professional Massage & Bodywork (Admission Test Series)","review":"I was impressed and a bit overwhelmed by the level of questioning in this book.

And yet - the subject matter presented draws so many unmentioned parallels to the situation of \\"quacks\\" to be found in modern day.Roy Porter is a brilliant historian. His form of writing is exceptional. Initially I noticed he would repeat certain information in subsequent chapters and though it was always written differently I wondered \\"doesn't he know he has already made reference to this?\\" But then I realized how beneficial this can be to learning. The important points that are repeated are far easier to digest, understand and remember and for those of us afflicted with poor memory, this is a welcome characteristic in a non-fiction book and it appears to be more of an intentional tool than an oversight. Regardless, the amount of original information to be found within this book is immense and as usual, Roy Porter fills his pages with powerful prose that afford such a sweeping field to be explored and grasped. Though I allude to the fact this book should be referenced more within the medical arena - the book is indeed written for the everyman (and woman) and few people will find it a difficult read. I do, however, think it should be mandatory reading for medical students._Quacks_ chronicles the highly lucrative occupation of nostrum mongers - traveling across Europe (most notably in Britain) selling potions, philosophies, herbs, and all manner of \\"cures\\" for the various ills of society. The tactics they use are rich and entertaining - the pulpit, the monkey, the jester, magic, on-the-spot dental repairs and laying on the hands healing. Some even operated booths outside the Bethlam asylum. The words used in their nostrums are highly imaginative - all competing against the other to attract the laymen and many claiming to be cure-alls with such words as UNIVERSAL. Or somehow advocated by royalty with words like REGAL and IMPERIAL. Advertisements are rich in fonts, language, and illustration - comparable to the sideshow advertisements of a later period.Porter explores this topic as objectively as possible and points out several \\"myths\\" among historians. The line drawn between \\"real\\" physicians and quacks is not as clear as we are lead to believe. A person choosing to patronize a quack is not necessarily anti-medical establishment. For those investigating or interested in today's debates between traditional and alternative medicine - there are many lessons to be learned in reading this book. Though it deals mainly with the medieval and middle ages, and more so with the era of enlightenment - the fact that history can repeat itself is made perfectly clear.The book is richly illustrated. An excellent addition to any library - and more importantly, to any mind."},{"Title":"Quacks - Fakers & Charlatans in Medicine (Revealing History)","review":"This was an entertaining history of the men and women who were labeled as quacks in Britain during the 17th to the early 19th centuries. The term \\"quack\\" was applied to men and women who were accused of practicing medicine (Physic) in bad faith, those who traveled from town to town and gave public performances and demonstrations, sold nostrums that proclaimed to cure numerous unrelated diseases from 'Rheumatick Defluctions' to 'Wind Cholick' to 'Ptisick or shortnesse of breath', advertised widely in newspapers, or made outrageous claims about their clientele (many claimed to be the personal physician to kings and queens throughout Europe), their cure rates and the efficacy of their medicines.However, Porter shows us that several practitioners who were labeled as quacks received medical degrees from Oxford, Cambridge or other renowned schools, and nearly all subscribed to the same medical theories and treatments used by the regular physicians. Many of the standard medical providers also used the same techniques as the quacks, such as advertising, frequent use of nostrums to purge the body of toxins that were the cause of illness, and frequent self promotion. The success of quackery was also aided by the lack of regulation, as neither the courts nor town officials sought to enforce standards on practitioners until the early 19th century, and by the state of medical knowledge in the 17th and 18th centuries, which was dominated by theories beliefs rather than proven fact.Quackery slowly fell out of fashion in the early and mid 19th century in England, as alternative medical movements such as homeopathy, naturopathy and medical botany took hold, and as allopathic (standard) medical practice became more regulated and restricted.\\"Quacks\\" contains several detailed accounts of notable practitioners, along with detailed etchings and engravings of quacks as they beguile and entertain potential customers. The book was overly repetitive at times, especially in the sections about advertising and nostrums, but overall it was a well written and balanced look at quackery in Britain."},{"Title":"Time-Crunch Quilts","review":"I ordered this book before it was available because I saw it advertised on Nancy Martin's page and I'm always looking for quilting shortcuts.

With an intricate plot, unlikely hero and intriguing mystery, this will captivate kids not ready for \\"Hobbit\\" or \\"Harry Potter.\\"In the aftermath of \\"Rowan of Rin,\\" the boy Rowan is a hero to his village. Now growing a crop of succulent Mountain berries, the villagers have settled back into their normal routine -- until the Travellers come. The nomadic tribe has a history of friction-filled cooperation with the people of Rin, and their mockery of Rowan's triumph shows that nothing has changed. Several of the villagers also suspect that the Travellers are plotting to steal the Mountain berries.Then the Travellers vanish, and villagers begin lapsing, one by one, into comas. The old wise woman Sheba utters another prophecy, and rails insanely out of fear of something that is coming -- an old \\"enemy.\\" Only Rowan and the half-Traveller Allun are able to escape, and they rejoin the Travellers, who claim to have no knowledge of what is happening to Rin. They are planning to go back to the Pit of Unrin, to find a legendary golden city that was mysteriously destroyed. But when Rowan agrees to come, he will find something lurking that is too terrifying to imagine.This book can probably stand on its own; references are made to the previous book, but no plot elements lean too heavily. The dialogue is never pretentious, a little stilted in places, but overall good. The descriptions -- especially chilling ones -- are even better, in such scenes as the one with the carnivorous trees with flexible roots, and Sheba's ranting. The only problem is that the cause of the villagers' affliction is pretty obvious from the beginning. Rodda makes up for this, however, with several twists to that plot device.Rowan has grown since the previous tale, as we see him standing up to Sheba when she rails at and insults him. He even stands up against Ogden, something that no one would have expected at the beginning of the previous book. Allun is also expanded as a character, further from the person we saw in \\"Rowan of Rin\\"; in this one, he refuses to believe that the Travellers could have cursed the inhabitants of Rin. Traveller leader Ogden is convincing, though it might have improved the latter half of the book if he had been on the adventure and not his adopted daughter Zeel.A good sequel to a good book, and one that young fantasy fans will undoubtedly enjoy a great deal."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Travelers (Rowan of Rin #2)","review":"After his unlikey heroism in Rowan of Rin, Rowan is still very much the weak boy he once was.

They do agree to help, and along with a Traveler girl, Rowan sets out to find the cause of the sickness by solving a difficult riddle. Their journey takes them to a valley full of deadly perils. Rowan may be scared, but to save his family and his village, he will have to face his fears. Readers who enjoyed Rowan of Rin, the first book about Rowan, will love this sequel and look forward to the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Travelers (Rowan of Rin #2)","review":"This is a great series for kids to follow-up on the first one (Rowan of Rin). This is about the travelers who come to the valley of Rin once every two years to trade. The people of Rin think that the travelers have put a spell on them. So it is about Rowan's journey to find out if the travelers actually are putting a spell on Rin. Rowan and his friend go to a place and get the answer within Pit of Unrin, with a used to be Zebak, (Zebak is a hated tribe) who now is a traveler name Zeel. I learned not everything is what it seems. I hope this book is good for you too. (Ruth H. C. with grownup help.)"},{"Title":"Rowan and the Travelers (Rowan of Rin #2)","review":"As you can tell from the number and dates of these reviews the Rowan books do not seem to have a wide or a current readership, at least not the way blockbusters like \\"Percy Jackson\\" do. And that's a shame because these are truly remarkable books.Congratulations on finding this, and book one - \\"Rowan of Rin\\", and the later books.Rodda has had a very productive output. Her set of three different Deltora series is also a wonderful choice for beginning fantasy readers. This Rowan set seems to be for a slightly older reader than is the case for the Deltora books, but the difference is almost negligible.Anyway, in the first Rowan book we had a map, clues and puzzles to be worked out. This second volume is more of a mystery, where strange doings and suspect loyalties must be understood, a strange prophecy must be interpreted, and courageous deeds must be undertaken. Rowan is small and relatively weak and even a bit sickly, but his heart is strong and his mind is sharp and he understands duty and sacrifice. In fact, if you were to take all of the heroic virtues and tie them up in a modest and unassuming package, you'd have Rowan. With strong support from trusted adults, but some sly reference to the less reliable adults of the village, Rodda has fleshed out a fairly convincing village that is vaguely medieval and that provides way more secondary characters and way more cultural context than any similar book I know of, including many aimed at an older audience and many with much more exalted goals.And all of this is wrapped up in a well-written, age appropriate, reading level appropriate, manageable and compelling read. Really, if it seems that your reader has any interest at all in fantasy/quest/adventure type books, this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Travelers (Rowan of Rin #2)","review":"I have to really look hard for books that my 13 year son will read.

But upon hearing an ancient legend, he embarks on an adventure through a dangerous cave with his new friend, Zeal.Very nice, though not quite as good as the previous."},{"Title":"Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars","review":"If you are looking for a beginner book with a goal of recognizing the constellations, there are better choices (consider \\"The Stars, a new way to see them\\" by HA Ray). Moore's comprehensive description of each star in a constellation tends to drag, and details go well beyond the beginner level. A lot of the data will repeat what should be contained in a good star atlas. On the other hand I liked his viewing perspective, mostly aimed from northern latitudes ca 50 deg. I liked his easy literary style, and he does have an enviable lifetime of experience. He uses D-shaped star maps, that work well for stars near the horizon, but these maps aren't so good for stars overhead. Some of the introductory chapters are simple overviews of astronomy facts that are better covered in my university textbooks. Ultimately the superficial details aren't useful once you are beyond that beginner stage. I could still see holding onto a copy of this, or it's cousin \\"Stargazing\\", if only as a supplementary reference to a star atlas. However, for it's stated description as a beginner's guide to the sky, it falls short."},{"Title":"Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars","review":"Its one of the well written books I've come across about scanning the night skies through binoculars. If you simply want to point your binoculars anywhere in the sky after consulting a map, this book will not likely appeal too much.The first chapter takes us through the big dipper and sets a good foundation for understanding the movement of stars during night and during the year (every star sets 4 minutes earlier than the previous night; orientation of big dipper around the year; how to measure angular distances using anchor points; characteristics of stars and Hertzsprung-Russell sequence etc.) All in the first chapter, and really a good amount of information presented briefly to give any intelligent reader the tools necessary for finding his/her way across the sky."},{"Title":"Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars","review":"The author's advice on choice of binocular ignores the age-related change in size of the human pupil, so that a 7x50 binocular is probably more binocular than an over-fifty star-gazer can use. This issue is covered well in \\"Astronomy Hacks\\" by Robert Thompson."},{"Title":"Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars","review":"A friend gave me this guide years ago. I think she thought my interest in observing birds would bleed into stargazing. It took me a while, but I came across the book one day and I realized I had a set of binocs that not quite right for birding, and hadn't I always wanted to get beyond the Big Dipper/Polaris as the one thing I could always identify? Now, I'm a fan. Last night I \\"swept\\" the area around Altair and saw an attractive constellation-like cluster of stars - turns out it was Delphinus, which I hadn't even heard of before last night.Moore does not aim for the most simplistic presentation, but I find that rewarding. Here is Cygnus, he says, but if you look for *Greek letter star whatever* you'll see this nebula. He has a Carl Sagan-ish gift for drawing you closer in, so that you get excited about it. In a world that seems to have a distressing number of science illiterates, and a vast number of people who have a glib, superficial understanding at best of headline-making scientific discoveries, it's refreshing to read an eloquent case for going outside (better to start on a warm summer night) and doing a little science on your own. As Moore points out, astronomy is one branch of science where important work is done by amateurs."},{"Title":"Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars","review":"A lot of the information is given in metric system. Pricing information is given in the British Pound. Much of the information given is very good and the advise he gives is sound in regards to binocular size.

That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word. This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows. So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good."},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"Over the Christmas holidays, I traveled back east to visit my parents. I carried Lanham's &quot;A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms.&quot; One night my mom and I sat up talking about everything from Picasso to metaphysics and at some point we got to talking about Shakespeare. I tried to explain to her why Shakespeare is rhetorically reveered, and at one point I climbed downstairs to the guest room and retrieved Lanham's book. She -- like most of us -- hears the word &quot;rhetoric&quot; and thinks of politicians and empty promises, or phrasing so complicated as to render simple fact obscure.I think the first word in &quot;Handlist&quot; we got a chuckle over was &quot;chiasmus&quot; and some of the examples like &quot;It's not whether grapenuts are good enough for you, but whether you're good enough for grapenuts!&quot; And the famous &quot;When the going gets tough, the tough get going.&quot; The one that gave her the best chuckle though was an editor's advice to a young writer &quot;You're writing is both original and interesting; unfortunately the part that's original is not interesting and the part that is interesting is not original.&quot;The great thing about this book is that it gives name to a great many devices we already use in everyday speech, and for a writer this information is invaluable. The better facility a writer has with these devices the better he or she can express our endless human emotions.A good many of the examples give the Latin or Greek root word, but the definitions are in English. Many of them have example usage along with the definition.E.g., &quot;Insultatio&quot;: derisive, ironical abuse of a person to his face. As Hamlet says to his mother:Look on this picture, and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See what a grace was seated on this brow:Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself...This was your husband. Look you now what follows.Here is your husband, like a mildewed earBlasting the wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,And batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?(Hamlett, III, iv)All in all, I think this handlist -- as much a dictionary as a &quot;handlist&quot; of rhetorical devices -- is a rich resource for writers, law students, political science majors, and young English scholars. Indeed, with this handlist, you could begin your own &quot;Progymnasmata&quot;!Stacey"},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"Samuel Butler once wrote that &quot;All a rhetorician's rules teach nothing but to name his tools.&quot; Classical and Medieval rhetoricians named, renamed, parsed, and cataloged all these tools with a bewildering sesquipedalian nomenclature. &quot;Handlist&quot; almost succeeds in its attempt to make sense of this thorny thicket of jargon.Chapter 1 of &quot;Handlist&quot; is a dictionary style listing of all the various names of the rhetorical devices. Each name is individually entered, but only the main name is defined. Each of the lesser names simply has cross references. The merely-cross-referenced names outnumber the actually-defined names by about 3 to 1. The actually-defined names should have been set in a bolder type than the merely-cross-referenced names.Chapter 2 consists of an excellent review of the divisions of rhetoric. Read Chapter 2 first.Chapter 3 takes the more common rhetorical devices and catalogs them by type, giving brief definitions. It catalogs only one name for each device, and is much more user friendly than Chapter 1. Read Chapter 3 second.My suggestion for the third edition: Reorder the chapters. Put Chapter 2 first and Chapter 1 last."},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"It's hard to describe how valuable this book is. Simply put, it changed my life. The title is both perfect and a little misleading: yes, it's a handlist, but that gives little sense of the breadth and scholarship of Lanham's work. Yes, you'll find incredibly useful definitions of the most recondite, as well as the most everyday, tropes and schemes. But embedded within his exposition Lanham gives us an argument for rhetoric: its complexity, historical richness, and value. Lanham's touch is very personal, offering a collection of definitions that are at once eclectic and definitive. If you need to buy one book on rhetoric, this should be it. If it intrigues you as much as it did me, follow up with Lanham's _The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts_. There you'll see the very practical implications of the study of rhetoric framed through historical and theoretical debates.

Get it. Now.The book is well-organized, easily acccessible, loaded with great quotes, and a treasure trove of unique terms and devices.

The quips and quotes are marvellous and the terms put into the Greek and Latin I also found to be excellent. I highly reccomend this book to anyone for any reason.

Be warned, though, some explanations get a bit erudite."},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"I had high hopes for this well-established entry in the strikingly limited field of guides to rhetorical terms. I am disappointed on several counts. Firstly, the total number of Latin terms is disproportionate to the definitions and examples on offer. On any given page approximately half the entries are uninformative redirects that pair different spellings of the same word--e.g., \\"Mezozeugma - Mesozeugma\\" I understand that the need to account for variant spellings in the book's source materials necessitates some redundancy, but for most users this type of entry is a waste of space. Second, and more serious, is the lack of consistency or precision in the way terms are defined. Take \\"prolepsis,\\" a term one would expect to occupy the core mission of such a book. Lanham has \\"foreseeing and forestalling objections in various ways\\" as primary, and \\"Propounder. A general statement is amplified by dividing it into parts.\\" followed by a block quote from Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience describing the recipe for a Heavy Dragoon. Where is \\"the representation or assumption of a future act or development as if presently existing or accomplished\\"--Merriam-Webster sense \\"a\\" never mind \\"the application of an adjective to a noun in anticipation of the result of the action for the verb\\"--Merriam-Webster sense \\"b\\"? And what has \\"Propounder\\" got to do with it? In typical fashion, the entry goes on to assimilate \\"prolepsis\\" to \\"procatalepsis\\" and invoke \\"Lewis and Short\\" and Quintilian without once supplying either of the top two relevant rhetorical meanings. Finally, there is a persistently intrusive first-person aspect to the presentation that further undermines the volume's credibility. There are many students and teachers out there for whom a reliable and informative guide to rhetorical terms would be of use. Unfortunately, Lanham's \\"Handlist\\" is not that guide."},{"Title":"Happy Birthday, Dear Duck","review":"Duck celebrates his birthday with animal friends in this beautifully illustrated book for younger children (from about age one to five).

Since the examples are dated, it is easy to find names from a particular time."},{"Title":"A dictionary of English surnames","review":"Obviously someone who wishes to give a first name to a child is not the most likely person to consult this very learned tome: for those people P. Hanks and F. Hodges's *Dictionary of First Names* (also published by Oxford) is the appropriate book (though David Pickering's *Penguin Dictionary of First Names* is also very good). Obviously, if the first name you have in mind is also a surname, then this reference tool, too, is likely to be useful.The amount of work that has gone into this volume is daunting, particularly when it comes to the mention of early sources in which names have been found. Some of that material is perhaps more of interest to the specialist than the general user, but in any case it is valuable. The Introduction, on names generally, is extremely informative and interesting.For myself, I most often need to know what a surname might mean (most of them do have meaning), and I suspect that this is what others, too, frequently want to know. For example, are those many Australians who have the surname *Smyth* in effect carrying the surname *Smith*? Yes, indeed: the *y* is merely a spelling variant, which many welcome because it suggests a name other than *Smith* (though quite a few people called *Smyth* don't themselves know that *Smyth*= *Smith*!).Does this dictionary reveal what one wants to know? It does, but not always in the handiest way possible. It has an entry *Smye, Smythe*, but not one for *Smyth*: one needs to know something about the early stages of the language to realise that if *Smythe* is an early form of *Smith*, then so is *Smyth* likely to be, and if one then turns to *Smith* one will find *Smyth* there. So not everyone will necessarily immediately discover the material searched for - but most people are likely to do so eventually. All in all , I recommend the book heartily, and use it often. - Joost Daalder, Professor of English, Flinders University (South Australia)"},{"Title":"A dictionary of English surnames","review":"After buying this book with great expectations I was very disappointed.

Just as Latin music is just beginning to be felt in the mainstream landscape of music consumers, dancers, students, and aspiring musicians. Tito Puente left us library of music productions, some videos, scholarships, and now a new book/audio package that pulls together the multiple elements of Latin music tempos. This book is more like a dream come true. I remember going to music stores so many times looking for books on Latin music, and guest what; NADA! All that has changed, almost two years in the making, this project was developed with very close involvement from Tito. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in Latin music and its history. Additionally it gives a technical understanding of the rudiments of Latin percussion for the student and layman alike, in Tito's own voice (replete with New York City accent). Each Latin rhythm explained in the book and demonstrated on the CD is followed by a Tito classic which exemplifies the rhythm he is teaching. It is an incredible archive just to have a Tito Puente CD with many of his hits, but this one has the King's voice explaining his rhythms. And, as always was so important to Tito, one of his last legacies was to provide us with an amazing educational tool that combines musical technique, arrangements and history, --the one lived by the King TITO PUENTE (TP).I can't say enough about the book specially when I see a picture of Arserio Rodriguez and another one of Tito Puente as a Sax-Alto player in the Navy. Then as I scroll through Chapter One the following quote reinforces everything I have been saying about clave in my writings &quot;Every instrument has to abide by the Clave. Stay on the Clave and you'll make it.&quot; - TP. Chapter two starts with this quote, &quot;You can even dance to the Timbales without anything else. That's how important they are in the rhythm section. The Timbale player keeps the band together with the Clave.&quot; - TP. Clave is so important both for the musician and dancer. Without Clave there's nothing regardless of how many solos or shines one can memorize.

The accompanying CD has over 50 tracks playing not only the examples of the book, but actual songs from the career of Tito -- some from groundbreaking albums like Puente in Percussion (all percussion band w/bass ala. avante garde Birth of the Cool in jazz), and the original and now world-known &quot;Oye Coma Va&quot; written by Tito &amp; recorded well before Sanata. An extremely well put together package for the player or listener alike as well as the Afro-Cuban music historian and Tito afficionado. Sounds like a strage mix, but this has it all! You won;t be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Tito Puente's Drumming With the Mambo King","review":"This book along with \\"The Art of Playing Timbales\\" by Victor Rendon are the 2 best books a beginner will find on playing the Timbales for Latin music. It covers from the very basics(clave's relationship to the rhythms) to soloing. There are 3 transcribed Tito solos that are worth learning once you've mastered the basics. The biggest problem I've had with the book is the binding. It's very poorly bound and it's falling apart. I do use it a lot as I'm a beginner, but the pages should have been bound a lot better. Other than the poor quality of the binding, the content and CD are very, very good. So I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to master playing Latin music with Timbales. Of course, you should also listen to a lot of recordings. Training the ear is very important for improvisation on the Timbales."},{"Title":"Tito Puente's Drumming With the Mambo King","review":"I bought this because I wanted a thoroughly written Timbale method. It is that, and much more. The history of Tito, and Mambo/Latin music is engaging and well written; the CD combines teaching tracks with some of Tito's best commercial recordings.

Can ya tell...I think this was good. I'm still a bit overwhelmed...wow.I actually thought I was reading the first book in the series and I was so impressed by how well entrenched all the characters were. You truly can read this story out of its order as Hill doesn't leave you wondering what you've missed. Instead, I fell into their story in total comfort. As though I had known them forever. Now I'm curious about all that has gone before...tch...never happy, am I?Hill has done a beautiful job of writing Yorkshire dialog. It feels very authentic and yet up-to-date. No, I'm not trying to be catty. It's just that you know the story is set in a contemporary day and the characters are everyday people comfortable in \\"today\\" while '\\"in character\\" with their Yorkshire accent and all those \\"were\\"s. It helped set the atmosphere beautifully.It's a compelling story with a lovely cast of varied characters. Everyday characters enduring the dramas that attach to parenthood and policework in such a way that you want to know what will happen next. I love the introspection Hill provides us in Pascoe's worries about his daughter and how she views their family; the conclusions we draw as we learn more about Elizabeth and Betsy Allgood---I'd certainly never have expected Elizabeth to turn out as she has...until I reached the end; Ellie Pascoe's thoughts on her many writing rejections are hauntingly funny; there's Novello's worries about the retreats and advances in her own career along with her assessments of the \\"Holy Trinity\\";Hill intrigues and teases with his subtle red herrings although I am confused as to why everyone ignored the 'strine accent of the mysterious \\"Benny Lightfoot\\"...!I did enjoy Digweed's paraphrase of Churchill's quote when Monte \\"came to visit\\": \\"Naturally my first thought was, &lt;em>I'm being raped by an ape&lt;/em>,...So I lay back and thought of Africa.\\"One thought that rises is that we never pay enough attention to what children say. Nor do we remember how they interpret what they see in relation to what they know...just ask Rosie. And the greatest tragedy? We teach them to tell us what will make us adults happy. We tell them that they should always tell the truth, but then punish them for it. It only teaches them to repeat to us what they think we want to hear. The truth may not have saved anyone the first time around...but, at least, there may have been a chance.\\"The Sumo Wrestler as Sex Object.\\"Ooh, and yet more snark!The StoryHistory is repeating itself when a little girl goes missing on the fells.

Hill immerses the reader in the feeling of the small, Yorkshire community shown here-- people doubly betrayed by the loss of their original village and by a decades-old series of unsolved murders.Both will come back to haunt them yet again.This story is so interesting and well-written that readers need no familiarity with Hill's detectives or their history. It is a full, satisfying read all on its own, every bit as much a standard novel as it is a mystery. Highly recommended for fans of either genre."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I've read a number of Reginald Hill's books, and he is always good, always fun, often even better. He's extremely literate, a remote quality among contemporary mystery writers, and I enjoy recognizing quotations from my own jumped-up education. With the exception of Recalled to Life, this book is his most memorable. I couldn't put it down; I only partially guessed the outcome; and the voices were very real. I'll remember the voices, and for someone who reads as much as I do, that's an accomplishment for the author, who stands out among those who write art mysteries."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Fearlessly ambitious, with a beautifully orchestrated plot, and written in a voice both tart and lyrical, this is one of finest works in the crime genre I've read. Hill has created a rural Yorkshire community that has been almost defined by unsolved crimes of the most painful kind and then chronicles the long, painful road to truth. American readers, and perhaps even many British ones as well, will need to be patient with the characters' Yorkshire patois, but this is a small price to pay for so satisfying a read."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"\\"On Beulah Height\\" has been well reviewed already. I can add only that it is very strong writing by the ever reliable Reginald Hill on a gut-wrenching and dark subject. This is the author in a very serious mode meditating on the chilling experience of threats to one's children. Very little room for Hill's famous humor and wit here. A wonderful story though that adds to this author's stock as on of the best mystery writers at work in the English language. Recommended."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Here's hoping primo cover designer Chip Kidd's superb designs for the paperback reissues of the Dalziel and Pascoe series bring Reginald Hill the larger audience he deserves. Hill's British mystery is as stunning as the stark cover.I enjoyed seeing the action flit back and forth between past and present and amongst the different characters. Hill truly keeps you guessing until the end, and somehow it all makes sense at that point thanks to his tight plotting. He is also at times very funny, with superb dialogue. Looking forward to the next novel in the series."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Reginald Hill is a writer who has consistently challenged the mystery form with a broadly discursive fascination with the hidden life of very ordinary (though very bright), very modern people. I suspect that's not everyone's take, but it is mine. Hill, like Peter Dickinson, can make setting a character; though characters never become set piece's. Fat Andy is simply more complicated and interesting than is the equally fat Rumpole, but he is also much less comfortable and for that reason perhaps less popular. Fans might also discover another side of Hill if they check out his pseudonym, Patrick Ruell."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"This was my first Reginald Hill book. I don't read mysteries anymore because they are mindless, formulaic and bloody. But the cover of this book caught my attention, as did the story synopsis on the back cover. The complexity of characters, setting, conflict, and resolution made for a thought-provoking read that affected me on many levels. I especially enjoyed the theme surrounding the drowning of the small village--the reactions of the citizens, the preparation, the feelings of the children, the move, and the actual drowning. [The idea of \\"drowning\\" an entire village is eerie in and of itself, no matter what the reason!!] Mr. Hill spends his literary skill on the story, characters, and conflict NOT on graphic descriptions of murder, blood, and perversion. Beware that the story line is sensitive--missing and dead children--but the action centers around the family's reactions and not on the actual murders. \\"On Beulah Height\\" is definitely a notch above the typical suspense novel. Already looking for the next one!"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Reginald Hill currently produces some of the most intelligent and best written mysteries on the market. On Beulah Height (the 17th Dalziel and Pascoe novel) is a fine series entry and should appeal to long-time Hill fans and new readers alike.A town in Yorkshire doomed by a reservoir project had been the scene of a terrifying series of child disappearances 15 years ago. Dalziel had been one of the investigating officers on the case. The prime suspect was never caught. The case is reopened when the disappearances begin again, and Dalziel finds the original cast of characters reassembled, with some in surprising new roles.If you are new to Hill as a writer, you are in for a real treat. He has been called the golden age detective writer for our own time, and the title is well deserved. His mysteries are witty, erudite, funny and full of strong and well-written characters. On Beulah Height is a good example of his work, and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I am an admirer of Reginald Hill. His characters, Dalziel and Pascoe, have helped me spend many happy hours with their adventures. This, however, is not his best moment. The book focuses on the disappearance of young girls. Illness of Pascoe's daughter sharpens the feelings for the loss of a child. Little is made of the motivation of the perpetrator or any reason behind the disappearances. One is left with feelings of great dissatisfaction at the conclusion. I would recommend other books in the series."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Much, much more than a police procedural about the serial murder of little girls, On Beulah Height is a deeply haunting and moving exploration of the afterlives we create for those who disappear. The only thing I can remotely tie it to is Peter Wier's haunting exploration of the aftermath of disappearance in his film Picnic at Hanging Rock. Hill's last novel, The Wood Beyond, belongs in the pantheon of great novels about the unending legacy of World War I, along with Dorothy Sayers' Nine Tailors and Graham Swift's Waterland. There, the dead are buried, but rise again to tell their truths to their children's children. In this novel, the dead are children who disappear. They don't return to tell their parents mundane truths; instead, they cause them to dream dreams, imagine legends of an underworld of caves and drowned villages, of holes in the hillside inhabited by ageless little maids who will be, as one father imagines, &quot;troubled by the light&quot; when they come out again. Parents, teachers, police, doctors, nurses, all the adults in the story, try desperately to cope with and control the mad upside-downness of a landscape in which it is possible for children to die before their parents. It is as unreasonable to the reasoning mind as the idea of a dale full of farms, schools, and churches, being drowned under the flood of a new reservoir. Yet both situations are painfully factual. How could any world inhabited by the likes of Andy Dalziel NOT be? And he's here in all his massive, randy, rambunctious glory to ensure that we don't get lost in the feyness of the tale. The children, on the other hand, understand quite well the nature of what happens to their playmates and to them. Rosie Pascoe, dreaming away time in a twilit cave between life and death, and Elizabeth Wulfstan, a young artist whose childhood was marked by an earlier set of disappearances, both understand the essential quality of events. It is they, not the grownups, who can solve the case. It is very simple--there's something mysterious, greedily hungry, wicked, that wants to carry tender young life down with it into its dark cave. Never mind the usual clinical imaginings of what makes a child-killer. In this novel, such a being is a goblin, a nix, a golem, a troll. Never mind Rosie and her friend Zandra are the well-tended children of thoroughly modern and sophisticated parents. In this novel, as in life itself, the very best parents can be blindsided, sidelined, rendered utterly, primitively irrational by the prospect that their children can be snatched from them by death. It's enough to make Fat Andy snap a car's dashboard in two with a blow of the fist. It's enough to make the parents of lost children permanently moonstruck, to possess them with furious revengefulness and mad behavior. Hill makes brilliant use of text from Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, translated into Yorkshire dialect, to express the longing and mystery that afflict those left behind. In previous novels--Recalled to Life springs to mind--Hill has done great things with quotations from earlier works of art. But never has he used such material to greater effect than here. He has made the poems, if not the music, his own. I, for one, look forward to rereading this novel a second time, with Mahler's songs playing in the background."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Reginald Hill is a wonderful writer. While so many other authors in the mystery genre repeat themselves and take the easy way out when it comes to plotting, Hill continues to challange his readers. Great plotting, great characters, great book."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"A doomed Yorskshire Valley waiting to be flooded, missing girls and the legend of Benny's Back, what can all this mean to Dalziel 15 years down the track, well it looks like Benny is back and another little girl has gone missing in similar circumstances, Dalziel must retrace his steps 15 years back when he was involved in the search for the missing girls. Pascoe has his own problems with his own little girl which will somehow tie everything together. This book was quite an exhaustive read with so much going on in the present and the past, how can the drowning of a valley so long ago mean so much to everyone involved in the present day? This book has so many turns and red herrings that the only people I didn't suspect of murder were Dalziel and Pascoe. a thoroughly enjoyable read I give it five out of five. Another plus to this book is that it gives you an interest in exploring the composer Mahler to see if the music mentioned in the book is available."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"This book has some of the most complex characters I've encountered in a mystery novel. It combines humor, poignancy, and sorrow with an intricate and fascinating mystery...

Can't wait to read the next book by this author."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I bought this book for its lovely title's sake only, so if it had turned out to be a bore I would have got what I deserved. Luckily it is nothing like it: considering the general dearth of good crime novels this one is a gem: Good writing! Solid, believable, interesting characters! Snappy and smart dialogue that is really snappy and smart! A well-built mystery that is not contrived and does not cheat on the reader, and that you cannot guess by page 10! This is my first Reginald Hill, but by all means it is not going to be the last."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Never has Hill's ensemble cast of characters worked better than in this haunting tale of children gone missing in the Yorkshire region of England. By interweaving an elemental, terrifying local legend with real events, the author has given his tale a mythic dimension. At the same time, real people are in terrible pain for their children. As always, Hill injects just enough humor to keep the proceedings from becoming altogether too grim. This novel is a triumph - P.D. James-caliber mystery writing. (Fans of Colin Dexter's Morse novels would also enjoy this series.)"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"For 15 years the disappearance of three little girls has occupied the minds of the villagers of Danby, a Mid-Yorkshire hamlet that is usually concerned with their sheep--or their re-location due to the construction of a lake that has caused many to be uprooted and moved.The disappearance has also occupied the mind of Andy Dalziel, Reginald Hill's chief character in \\"On Beulah Hieight\\"and superintendent of the local CID, who knows his Mahler like the next guy. \\"Fat Andy\\" was in charge of that investigation and the fact that it wasn't solved has long bothered him.Now, another child has gone missing, opening up old wounds and introducing new ones. Signs have been spray painted around town that \\"Benny's Back\\" and that also unnerves the locals, especially those with young children themselves. Benny Lightfoot was the chief suspect those years ago but because Dalziel didn't really believe he was guilty, let him go, and then he disappeared. The villagers--and the readers--are on edge, to say the least. Dalziel, along with Peter Pascoe, Sergeant Wield, and WCI Novello, begins his methodical search, this time determined not to let this one get through.Author Hill, in his usual manner, guides us through with a hop here, a skip there, and a leap over there at, but the reader generally stays \\"on target\\" with this book, and, unlike his earlier \\"Pictures of Perfection,\\" Hill takes his work seriously and we don't have to wonder if there's going to be the \\"surprise\\" ending that \\"Pictures\\" produced. In \\"Beulah,\\" however, so many references are made to \\"Pictures\\" that it helps if one has read that one as well. Allusions to previous Dalziel/Pascoe investigations are there, which can be a pain for readers who may have decided to pick this book for its own merit (Martha Grimes is also quite guilty of this, as well).Hill's prose remains the same, and he seems determined to make us think he has a bigger vocabulary than P.D. James. He writes, \\"Dalziel pondered, his great face brooding like God's over a tricky piece of epeirogeny.\\" (\\"Deformation of the earth's crust by which the broader features of relief are produced\\"--I looked it up for you in Webster's Seventh Collegiate!). He also includes \\"pendentious\\" but my Webster doesn't carry that one: perhaps it's a Yorkshire term. Hill continues with expressions like \\"Pascoe prevaricated.\\" (Note to Hill: James would have simply said \\"he lied\\"!). Add periodic bouts of melodrama and you have the minus side of the book.The pluses, however, outweigh the minuses, and the aforementioned obstacles aside, \\"On Beulah Height\\" is a sound, almost mesmerizing story. There are enough solid examples of fulfilling the needs of this genre to make this one--and all the other Hill books I have read, at least--worthwhile. Hill is not guilty of being too simple in his plot and character developments and both ring true. Dalziel's acid wit and at times crude, boorish behavior work just right and with Pascoe's urbane, refined side, Hill has concocted a winning team.English television has made a number of the Dalziel/Pascoe cases into movies and one can only hope that they will continue, as it eliminates some of the minus of Hill's prose, and the actors cast seem quite appropriate. As a venerable American baseball player might once have said, \\"It ain't over till the Fat Man sings.\\" And so far, Andy hasn't started singing. Let's hope he keeps those tunes to himself, as Hill's adventures are worth the effort!"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I think that is one of Hill's best in the Dalziel and Pascoe series. He has created a story that is eery and mystical. The story begins with three little girls going missing from a small town called Danby. At the same time as these girls are being searched for by a much younger Andy Dalziel, the whole village of Danby is preparing to be submerged in water as a reservoir is being constructed on the old townsite. This is what makes this book so tantalizing. We keep slipping back to when the village of Danby was drowned and all the terrible things that happened then (which is 15 years before the setting for this book), and a new horror has occurrred in the present time when another little girl goes missing. Dazliel and his crew are trying to solve both cases, and Pascoe is dealing with a personal issue that threatens his very existance. How Hill manages to keep all these balls in the air, and the tenuous strings that he has intertwined between the many different plots in this book is pure genius. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece of writing. There are so many things at play here that it's hard to classify this novel. Is it a psychological thriller? Yes, but it is so much more - a mystery, a ghost story, a dramatic story and another wonderful stop in the lives of these people that I care about so much by now - the many-layered Dazliel, and the scholarly and introverted Pascoe."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"This highly literate detective mystery is part of the firmly established series featuring Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pascoe series. It is a particularly rewarding story because Hill invests his detective story with a sense of the mystical in this engrossing and emotionally poignant ghost-story, of sorts. Even better, Hill further develops his ace Andy Dalziel in an arrestingly affecting manner by allowing him to show his softer side as Dalziel puzzles through his encounter with old and dormant spirits.Drawn back to old haunts by the recent disappearance of a seven-year old girl, the super-masculine and hyper-capable Dalziel is thrown back upon the remembrance of past failure when he returns to a locale that he knows quite well, although perhaps not yet well enough. The new mystery has so many overlapping markers with the old, that Dalziel is compelled to return in an apparent quest for a vindication of the past.Wending his way through a reality that sometimes appears to flirt with magic and logic that seemingly melts into fantasy, Dalziel brings his experience to bear on both the familiarity of the mystery and the equally changed realities that have as much to do with staging as they do with real transformation. Our hero has to pierce the faade, erected like a Potemkin Village, of new relationships as he finds many of the new and old actors in the drama to be playing surprisingly tragic roles - caught between preserving the broken past and the impulses to bury it - as he finds which connections exist between the new disappearance and the ghosts of those old disappearances, newly awoken.Hill weaves this story with great skill and the emotional subtlety in the psychology of his characters is admirable. Particularly effective is how Hill structures Dalziel's major reckoning around a commonplace human experience that the detective has yet to experience. Namely, Hill allows the old bachelor Dalziel to vicariously experience the hopes and anxieties of parenthood through the agonies of others. The insights that Dalziel thereby cobbles together display his emotional depth and development throughout the novel - rewarding aspects in any piece of literature and especially in a mystery series.Now, Hill clearly had a fabulous set of ideas for the development of the story and his development of Dalziel is executed well, although not entirely seamlessly. For example, the attempts to tie Mahler's Kindertotenlieder to Dalziel's internal journey - instead of merely to anchor the agonistic conflicts experienced by the parents - seems somewhat forced, even if fair game. The near-deification of Dalziel conveyed by his subordinates is somewhat excessive, even if meant to suggest that Dalziel's paternal aspect is projected through his professional associations, rather than to his intimates. Peter Pascoe's New Age Man routine is a little forced in this book as well, veering too closely to a caricature, as if Pascoe needed to dim in order for Dalziel to shine ever more brightly.But overall, these are minor complaints and perhaps are more like noticing that the welding between two joints isn't as clean as it could have been. This is a worthwhile novel with plenty of ambition behind it. It reaches out to include important elements of classic tragedy while advancing the reader's understanding for an established and charismatic character in this series. The underlying puzzle is well-crafted and Hill has packed highly entertaining components within the story that enhance the arc generally described in this review. On my decimal scale, I would give this novel a 4.1 out of 5.Definitely a satisfying story, whetting the appetite and curiosity about what Reginald Hill will try next."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Before reading this book, I had precious little interest in Yorkshire; and the first chapter, full of local dialect, was pretty slow going for me. I perservered, however, and I am truly glad that I did. Both by the characters and the story itself slowly seduced me, and I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting! Many mysteries, including those by very talented authors, are so unlikely. This one hangs together logically from beginning to end, propelled by a fascinating (and diverse) trio of detectives. Add to that some incredibly well drawn local characters, and you have a truly suspenseful mystery. I would recommend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"This could have been an excellent mystery - but the ending was unfortunately predictable and lame. Aside from the detectives, the remaining characters were one-dimensional and undeveloped. It's a shame because the writing is otherwise beautiful. Still, the book kept my attention and I managed to finish all 548 pages. It was exciting in some areas and I did care about the two main detectives. Overall, it wasn't as good as it good have been, but it certainly wasn't the worst mystery I have ever read!"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"There is beauty in this story. The prose and plotting are exceptional. The characters and the dialog between them never fails to fascinate. Although the subject matter is distressing, it is presented in a way that is almost soothing. An excellent read."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Being this was the first Hill I've read, I definitely felt the lack of history with the characters. I found myself wanting to know them better. But they were the best part of the story. Except for particular bits, I found the plot not over interesting and the book way over long."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"It's so rare to pick up a modern author from this genre (mystery) and have his talent as a wordsmith be so exquisite. If I seem effusive concerning this book, you will have to excuse me. When you get stuck reading a lot of badly written textbooks, and other material whether books or journals for profesional purposes, when you do pick up a good mystery (based on recommendations from Amazon.com--thanks guys!) it is nice to be able to dive into a story which is not only a good mystery, but the writing itself is wonderful.The British have a way with the English language. I don't know what is in the water over there, but I am increasingly finding that my tastes are generally more satisfied when reading British mysteries. And I am not talking Agatha Christie here, though I've read stuff that far back. Hill is an obvious contender for those who enjoy P.D. James mysteries, as well as historical mysteries of the type written by Charles Todd (I keep forgetting he is American).This story is painstakingly drawn out. It's a hefty mystery, and frankly, Hill did a great job by not allowing the reader to determine who was responsible for the disappearance of several young girls. I made several errors in judgement, that were solved (sensibly thank heavens) in the last three chapters. Rarely do I get up out of bed at night and spend three hours in a chair to finish reading a book which I just cannot put down. But I did this with this author.I am looking forward to his other books...it is great to find another author with many books to his name that I can enjoy for a while (I read so fast usually that I go through good authors too quick and have to find another one)."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I've been following Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pascoe series for years; the only thing bad about this the author is his unfortunate tendency to go out-of-print here in the States.This is an author whose writing has undergone a noticeable improvement over the years. The first books in the series seem more formulaic and even a bit dated when held up to later entries. But this is only comparing a writer against himself: these books still stand out among the usual British procedurals; Hill's distinctive characterization is present from the first book. It's definitely worth reading the series in order, if you can find all the titles. Doing so, you can trace the development of all the characters, most notably Wield and Dalziel, who usually steal the show from the intellectual and prototypically 'heroic' Pascoe. These two are in no way side characters; this is ensemble work.'On Beulah Height' is another great entry in the series, digging deep into the Yorkshire landscape and making a compelling story of local history. Buy, buy, buy, and tell your friends. I keep hoping that the more interest in raised in this series, the better our chances to see reissues of the earlier works."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"A few years ago I discovered Dalziel (pronounced &quot;deal&quot;) and Pascoe on A&amp;E. I became intrigued, and set out to read all Hill's many books on this infamous pair of &quot;thinking&quot; British cops. I am now almost caught up as &quot;On Beulah Height&quot; is the next to the last installment in Hill's series.I think the best way to read Hill's books is chronologically, but there are many of them. You can figure out the order by their publication dates. The stories are complex so even if you see them dramatized on A&amp;E you can still enjoy the written text as much of it is interior monologue/thinking. Hill writes books that eschew the pounding action of many current mystery writers (who give me a headache). His plots move vigorously, but they are thinking reader's books--somewhat like those of Colin Dexter.DCI Peter Pascoe and his wife Ellie have to be one of the nicest, most down-to-earth, and likeable couples around. Hill has tracked their courtship, marriage, marital problems, and the birth of their child Rosie, though the various cases Dalziel and Pascoe have undertaken. This book continues their story, while simultaneously filling out the lives of other characters: Dalziel (the fat man from Yorkshire), Weild(y) (the &quot;gay&quot; cop who rides a motorcycle and has a kindly heart) and the female cop DC Novello.&quot;On Beulah Height&quot; is a tough book, as it involves the disappearance and supposed deaths of several small girls. Interwoven through the search for the abductor/killer is the tale of Rosie Pascoe's fight for her own life. Hill has used a the device of a children's story entitled &quot;Nina and the Nix&quot; to structure his plot.The characters are believable, from the singer Elizabeth Wulfson to the &quot;retarded&quot; Benny Lightfoot. I like Hill's inclination to describe the interaction between men and women, husbands and wives, fathers and daughters, and lovers of both sexes. Hill understands human behavior, and his characters are quite believable.In the end, the loose ends are tied up. You may find one angle a bit stretched, but I am willing to give Hill the suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"I've just begun to read Reginald Hill in my constant search for new and exciting authors, and I seem to have hit the jackpot with this one. (I'm writing this review as I'm searching for the next Hill novel to put on my shopping list!) The characters are alive, the plot is intricate, the story is highly emotional, and the reader's involvement is intense until the last page has been turned. In my mind, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Fifteen years have elapsed since the small Yorkshire village of Dendale of was flooded in order to create a reservoir. However, the orderly moving of the residents took a bizarre twist when three young girls disappeared and the prime suspect Benny Lightfoot vanished. Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel never closed the book on this case.However, a drought has occurred, leaving the reservoir at an all time low. The village has begun to reappear. At the same time, graffiti proclaims the return of Lightfoot and a girl has been reported missing. This time around Dalziel and his partner, Chief Inspector Peter Pascoe, hope they capture the culprit before anyone else disappears.No review can do justice to the multi-layered, incredibly complex, but brilliantly written ON BEULAH HEIGHT. This novel has so many dimensions yet due to the tremendous talent of Reginald Hill, they all work and blend together so that the reader never feels lost. It's strongly recommend that fans read the entire series, but especially this masterpiece that showcases the mystery genre at its best.Harriet Klausner END"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Quite possibly the strongest of Hill's novels, *On Beulah Height* evokes, with eerie intensity, every parent's visceral fear of losing their child. At the same time, it explores the multiple and complex strands of love: between parent and child, performer and vocation, person and place, man and woman (or man)... And there are some nifty thematic hooks, like Mahler's *Kindertotenlieder* and a folktale-children's story, &quot;Nina and the Nix&quot; (complete with illustration), both of which play important parts in the narrative's development. As always, Hill jumps gracefully between different times and points of view. There is some occasional humor to leaven what otherwise might be an unbearably grim novel. Readers new to this series should be aware that this really is a *series*; while Hill does some necessary retreading in spots, in several instances readers do need to know the previous novels in order to make sense of the action or character development (particularly in the case of Sgt. Wield). And be warned: the Yorkshire dialect can be heavy going if you are not yet accustomed to it."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"One of the more disturbing books in the Dalziel and Pascoe series, in part because of the theme of serial child killing, but also because it shows that there are no easy answers. It's a complex and thought-provoking story, and one that easily supports re-reading. There is the mystery, yes, but there is also the psychological study of a village traumatised both by a series of unsolved child murders and by its forced relocation after its valley was drowned by a new water reservoir. It's also beautifully written by a master of prose. Hill brings his characters to full and vivid life, and they will linger with you for days.Ideally the series should be read in order, and I think regular readers already familiar with the characters will get more out of this book, but it can be read as a standalone. For those familiar with the series, Hill continues to develop the story of his ongoing characters, deftly weaving it into the main plot of the book. Note that there are references to events in the previous book (The Wood Beyond) which are slight spoilers for that book."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"In his recent Dalziel-Pascoe detective novels, Reginald Hill has stretched the genre well beyond its normal limits - by probing the psychological background and personal lives of his investigators (even, in this book, the Pascoes' daughter); breaking the narrative for flashbacks; and introducing subplots that, in the end, more or less flow back into the mainstream of the narrative. In The Woods Beyond, the main back-story device was too schematic to be convincing (see my review of that if you're interested); here, though, in spite of a story that is if anything even more complex, throwing in elements ranging from a child's fantasy to the Mahler song cycle Kindertotenlieder, Hill pulls it off more coherently.The case involves the disappearance of a young girl, which appears to have links to another series of disappearances 15 years earlier, in a Yorkshire village called Dendale. Around the time of the earlier disappearances, Dendale was de-populated, its inhabitants relocated, and the village disappeared under a new dam. At the time of the present case, the village's ruins are reappearing because of a severe heat wave that is drying up the dam-created lake. (This aspect of the plot is oddly similar to that in Peter Robinson's In a Dry Season. If Yorkshire really has such bone-dry summers these days, global warming must be a fact!)Mystery fans unaccustomed to Hill's latter-day style who come to this novel expecting a conventional, straightforward police procedural may find themselves thrown off balance. If that is you, I recommend you stick with it: your indulgence will be rewarded. Those familiar with the Dalziel-Pascoe series will respond to all its usual virtues, including the contradictory character of &quot;Fat Andy&quot; Dalziel, crude and sarcastic yet possessed of a kind of psychological x-ray vision that penetrates the lies, stratagems and evasions of a suspect in short order.One annoyance: the publisher of the American edition has seen fit to change the British spellings to American ones where they differ. That makes no sense, commercially or artistically. Any reader who enjoys, or can accept, the thick Yorkshire dialect in which the characters speak is hardly going to be deterred by a few spelling variants. What was anybody thinking?"},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"As an avid reader, I judge the success of a story by whether the solution, as it is revealed, raises the hair on the back of my neck and send shivers down my spine, not in fear, but in appreciation of just how inevitable and &quot;right&quot; the solution is to the puzzle. Naturally this reaction can only really happen when a story is so rich and absorbing that you can't tear yourself away. Reginald Hill almost always achieves sucess in his mysteries, but this one is a cut above.Long ago young girls disappeared in the hills on Beulah Height. The one survivor is now a successful singer who must struggle to search within herself for long forgotten memories to help Dalziel and Pascoe prevent another tragedy. When the pieces fall into place, it is like a kaleidoscope that suddenly spins into sharp focus and you wonder how you missed the picture right up until the point when all becomes clear. Read this one for the exhiliration of that moment. Mystery readers who appreciate the &quot;thrill&quot; of a breathtaking solution should not miss Reginald Hill's most suspenseful read."},{"Title":"On Beulah Height","review":"Crime fiction of late has taken on a much more substantial form, thanks to authors such as Reginald Hill and Charles Todd who have broken all stereotypes of the genre and created a deep and often disturbing look into human consciousness. Hill's On Beulah Height, could be one of the most startling and complex mysteries I have ever read. Most authors would not be able to construct such a work of fictional stature , but this is Reginald Hill and this is what he does best.I found it completely engulfing and alluring and was moved by the psychologically haunting suspense that keeps Yorkshire's Dalziel and Pascoe on their guard and at the peak of their talents.A must read for lovers of mystery.... or for those who just love a really really good book!"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"I have heard it stated that there is a very thin line between genius and insanity. Arlene the Sardine is very close to this line in dealing with the issue of death. Those who are scared of the potential of suicide might be very frightened by this book and would rate it low accordingly. The book, about a young fish who wants to become a sardine deals with death in an exceptionally playful manner... so playful that some could consider it macabre. This is a book one will either love or hate. Though, I was somewhat disturbed by the book... I believe that the book is exceedingly well done, with beautiful illustrations, and a playful narrative. It seemed reminiscent of the fairy tales of old... which were far more dark than today's Disney versions. It is a book definitely worth checkig out from your local library.Crazy James"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Well, I agree with most of the reviews that this book is not appropriate for kids. My daughter (age 3 1/2) constantly asks me to read the book, and her big question is, \\"Do you think Arlene really wanted to be a sardine? Why?\\" This book has opened up a can of sardines, so to speak. I have tried to explain that no animal willingly wants to die. I have also tried to explain \\"thronging\\" from a scientific standpoint so she can understand the purpose of it. I HATE THE BOOK. But, she loves it. She loves to act out the scenes such as getting caught in a purse net. We have even eaten sardines--brislings, too!The one redeeming quality of the book is the langauge. The author performs some wordplay that I think is very exceptional for teaching kids syntax. Basically, he rewrites the same sentence with slightly different structures several times. I think it is fabulous for reading aloud and teaching kids to read. I just think the actual theme and plot are romanticized and not something I want to read to my kids.True story: The first time I read the book to my daughter I read that the \\"grading\\" machine was a \\"grinding\\" machine. Wouldn't have made any difference the book is so death-centered. After getting the book from the library and being caught by surprise by its inappropriateness, I have realized I should preview anything I read to my kids now."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Arlene could be commentary, but why make it so complicated? This is a great book with brilliant artwork that young children love because things are made very obvious. I reconciles the fact that all the kids' books and cartoons personify small creatures and animals with the fact that we eat those smelly little things. It's a hilarious gift for most adults, unless of course they are the overly-sensitive mom-type. I personally enjoy reading this to children and friends alike."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Sick of sappy stories about teddy bears, bunnies, and tea parties? Arlene Sardine, a favorite story in our household, fills the void. The artwork is gorgeous and the story is realistic and fun. Added plus: your child will understand the word &quot;hermetically&quot;!"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Have to say, as a librarian and parent of 2 young children, I found this book to be an absolute joy. I actually laughed so hard I cried the first time I read it to my son. It's absurd, it's challenging, it's brilliant."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"My daughter is now two years old and she loves this book. It starts out with a little fish called Arlene that wants to be a sardine - it ends with Arlene accomplishing her life-long goal - and gives some details of the process.I think it is intended to be light-hearted, and since some reviews have concentrated on the grimmer aspects of the story (namely the heroine of the story dying and being packed in the can, or under some interpretations, turning life forms into commodities) I think I will tell you what my daughter enjoys about this book.1) Arlene is a little fish that she can follow through the whole book because Arlene has a red circle on her cheek.2) The fish swim \\"this way\\" and \\"that way\\". This seems to hold her attention - I think because the pictures are colorful.3) She has a particular fondness for the word \\"thronging\\".4) She likes to point to the pictures that show the different ways sardines are packed and say - \\"packed like this!!\\" She says it again, and again, and again...5) She likes to pretend she is eating the sardines at the end of the story.6) She claps when Arlene is finally a sardine."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"I am a children's librarian. Chris Raschka is a talented illustrator and artist, as he proved with books like &quot;Yo? Yes!&quot; However, success has made him, like Sendak, think he can do whatever odd thing he feels like, and his publishers seem to concur. As a result, we get this weird, morbid thing that critics may like but which no child will. The art is interesting."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"I am an educator and have read the previously written reviews about this story. In truth, I am horrified by them. To say that the book is no good because it discusses a topic that children are unfamiliar with, is rediculous. Of course my kindergarteners know nothing about sardines, but why shouldn't they? Maybe I read my job description wrong, but I thought I was SUPPOSED to teach them about things that they don't already know. I have not read this book to my students because of all of the contoversy surrounding it, but I wish I could read it to them. Surprise, surprise, children like to be exposed to new information, it peaks their interest in learning. Where would we be if we kept teaching the same information? Eighth graders would still be on the alphabet, and most of them would have dropped out of school because of sheer boredom. -------------In respone to those persons who feel that it is wrong to teach kids about death, (you'd better sit down for this) THEY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT IT!!! They always ask questions about death. They have had pets that have died, or family members, or their friends have told them about it (did your kid miss &quot;The Lion King&quot;), but we make it seem like it is such a taboo topic that they choose not to talk about death. They think it will upset you (obviously, they're right), so they keep those feelings in and they don't ask questions about something that they want to know about. It's amazing to me that people think this book has the potential to be damaging to their kid(s), but think it's fine to ignore a topic that their child probably has questions about. REALITY CHECK, it is not book that cause children to think about suicide, it is the inability to express themselves and their emotions. So go right ahead, repremand your children for seeking information on their own because they feel unable to ask questions openly. They will learn that they cannot express themselves openly, they should not seek information independently, and to believe everything that perople tell them. Why shouldn't they, they have no other resources for information than simple word of mouth. I am waiting for the day that children can get answers to their questions, rather than being told that it's not a good topic to talk about. ------------------------------------------------------------Furthermore, I think this book is wonderful. It shows children that there are steps to achieving goals, gives them a glimpse at a new type of animal, and at the same time, teaches them about the cycle of life. Arlene Sardine gets two thumbs up from this teacher."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Finally. A children's book that represents an honest view of life. Haven't we all gotten a little sick of everything Disney? What is wrong about telling an adorable tale of a little fish in the foodchain who aspires to be a salted and canned sardine? Nothing, and in fact, it is a 5 star effort! Thumbs up for Chris Raschka's attempt to honor the cycle of life and not try to relate another tired storyline like Charley the Tuna...."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Yes, my 4yr old and 2yr old love sardines and they love fishing. There is nothing wrong with teaching where meat comes from--it doesn't come from a bag or can from a store. It comes from an animal who dies and gives their life. That is why we don't waste food and we respect it in our home. I think it is witty and great book. Most adults find it amusing."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"While many are offended or upset by this book, I find 'Arlene Sardine' to be a wonderful book. What a great way to approach the rocky topic of death with kids. Picture books have the wonderful ability to take uncomfortable situations and help parents address with them children. Sometimes, they bring to light problems that a child is having that the parent never knew about! Plus, this is just pure fun - the art is hysterical and it is perfect to read aloud.So, yes, you need to preview before reading this to your young child. But you should be doing that anyway. No one else is going to for you!And, no, this might not be appropriate for everyone - but give it a try!

It's worth a look, if for no other reason than that it's quite unique."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"The artwork in the book is fabulous. The story is mediocre. The delivery is part poetic, part hallucinogenic, as if written while the author is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. These are my interpretations as an adult. I haven't asked children if they liked the story or not."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"I have yet to meet a child who has actually seen a sardine, much less eaten one. This book, from concept to execution, is one of the worst examples of the picture book format I have ever seen, and, being a librarian, I've seen plenty. Despite what other reviewers have written, most children will not find humor or comfort in the story and will not be &quot;uplifted&quot; by the illustrations. Kids are &quot;uplifted&quot; by COWS IN THE KITCHEN or DOUBLE TROUBLE IN WALLA WALLA, not by the death of a fish. The book is dark, ugly and pretty much a waste of a tree."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"This story is absolutely fabulous. I teach 4th grade and teach students with and without disabilities. I differentiated this story for all of their needs. They were truly excited to use web organizers for the vocabulary, they loved sequencing the story with pictures to orally retell, and loved the fact that the story continued even after the main character became a sardine. They had no clue what a sardine was. Boy were they disgusted when I brought in the example. They loved the repetitive language, and the pictures were awesome. I reccomend this to any teacher. Contact me for lesson plans."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Arlene, the beautifully illustrated brisling, wants to be a sardine. She swims into a net and doesn't eat anything for three days in preparation of becoming a sardine. Arlene dies and the rest of the story explains how people turn Arlene into everything she wanted to be. What's not okay here? Manipulation by the author to try and convince the reader that it was okay for Arlene to want to become a sardine. That Arlene would intentionally want to get caught in a net, starve herself, and die is so misleading for a picture book that wants to explain, realisticly, how sardines are made. Raschka attempts to comfort the reader and soften Arlene's death by including lines after her death like, &quot;...she was put on ice, in a box, with her friends,&quot; &quot;I'll be Arlene felt well rested on the conveyer belt&quot; and &quot;I wonder if Arlene was a little nervous for the final inspection.&quot; It's obvious, this isn't a story about grieving but it is a story about death. It's not the book you pull off the shelf when you want to comfort a child who lost her pet goldfish. Yet, Arlene's death would have been better explained (and more appropriate) if it were told with the same honesty that explains the process that makes her suitable for human consumption. Raschka's weakness to cushion Arlene's death is the only flaw to this story. How unfortunate because every other aspect of the story is right on the mark. Illustrations are magnificant, the format well designed, a perfect balance of story and illustrations. Raschka is a true talent, one of the best children's book authors/illustrators of this decade. He has already redeemed himself, in the eyes of this reviewer, by creating yet another amazingly terrific book, &quot;Like Likes Like.&quot;"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"arlene sardine made me laugh out loud..the story of a little fish named Arlene who wanted to be a sardine.. moral of the story = be careful what you wish for... goal of the story = incredible laughter..... caution for the story = will young kids understand or get real sad..?"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"It seems to me that the author may have been bored one afternoon and wondered if anything he wrote would be published.

However, the author in his notes &quot;about the author&quot; says &quot;yes he enjoys sardines&quot;.

Not many. Generally, they're considered pretty edgy \\"art-house\\" films. And then, how many films or novels have you seen or read that feature not only the death of the protagonist, but the powerful implication that the protagonist is only a victim because of (her) own hapless choice to attempt to join a group she perhaps shouldn't have joined? And finally, in how many films or novels are the viewers/readers asked not merely not to have sympathy for the demise of the protagonist, but enjoy--in fact relish--the death of the protagonist? I ask these questions, because this book asks us to have a double-standard for children's literature: what we might find tremendously challenging as an adult-oriented work, we're asked simply to present to children as a book about death? No. Sorry, folks. Raschka might have written some other well-received books, but this one rightly deserves harsh criticism."},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"I've been reading this book to my 3 1/2 year old for the past year now and he still really enjoys the story and its illustrations. The illustrations are a little impressionistic, which I think add some complexity to what the reader is looking at. I think this makes it a little more interesting and a nice change of pace on occasion. Arlene is the fish with the red dot on her cheek and my son loves to look for her on each page. I think it also teaches kids not to be afraid of death. After reading about it in various books (including the classic The Lady Who Swallowed a Fly), he knows that it can happen and it's a part of life. It's not something shocking to him and he's not afraid of it. The author describes Arlene's death, and what happens to her in her journey to becoming a sardine, in a very playful manner.

Books for even the youngest kids can and should contain the darker undercurrents of life, including death. But this book fails to broach the subject in an honest, responsible way.

Too bad there is not a &quot;no star&quot; rating because this is what this book should receive!"},{"Title":"Arlene Sardine","review":"Some readers may be pleased with the bluntness and directness with which the author described what happened to the snared Arlene, from her flopping around on the trawler's deck to her being cooked in a can.Some might think that this story was a laudable and unblinking effort to let children know, without any sugarcoating, what at least one part of the real world is like. I found this story to be revolting. My reaction was not due to my being squeamish about the subject or a refusal to face the truth. I have eaten many a sardine in my time,( one of which may have been Arlene), usually on crackers. The latest one was this morning, during a hike into the Selkirk Mountains of northern Idaho. It was delicious and I did not feel at all guilty as I gulped it down. Neither was the cause of my revulsion the fact that this was a children's story. I have no problem with telling children the truth about the world in so far as we understand it.One of the great truths of the World is that life lives upon life. (Perhaps somewhere there is a little Blue-Green Alga who believes that he has evaded this way of making a living, having ... energy from the sun, but where does he think he got his CO2 with which to make carbohydrates?) No, what revolted me was the author's obvious message that poor little Arlene Sardine was predestined for the blue point special at your neighborhood sandwich shop. It was clear that the only purpose that she ever had in life was to serve as a tasty treat for Mankind. This story turns a living organism into a commodity, whose purpose in life, which it looks forward to, is to be eaten by human beings.There is no hint or inkling from this book that Arlene might have lived out her life (and death) in any other manner. She might, for example, have become food for a Salmon, and it, food for another fish, and so on in the great round of life. She might have lived to procreate and therefore served to perpetuate her species, etc. etc. This story may true in one sense, but it is false in another because the child reader is taught not to confront the facts and learn how to deal with them, but to become desensitized to them. No, sadly, Arlene served only to perpetuate one of the greatest myths of our culture, and that is that all other living creatures have only one purpose, that of serving man, and that they enjoy doing so. In short, this story converted Arlene from a fellow life form to a commodity, to be used or discarded by Man as he sees fit. This is an important part of the mind set that has set our culture on a collision course with Nature, as Daniel Quinn brilliantly describes in Ishmael. The disastrous results we see all around us - atmosphere and water poisoned with over 70,000 synthetic chemicals, a population of 6.2 billion, surging beyond the limited carrying capacity of the Earth, Global Warming, just to mention a few of our more minor problems.The great question that our ancient ancestors had to face , ( and contemporary traditional peoples still do ),was that life lives off life, and how do they handle that fact? They coped with it in a manner that is in stark contrast to way our culture approaches the subject. What is astonishing is that they consistently came up with similar or even identical answers. Even more remarkable is the fact that they labored under a more difficult dilemma than we. They regarded other living creatures, not as commodities, but, on the contrary, as fellow travelers or even as elder brethren from whom they could gather much wisdom. Yet they had to kill their brethren in order to live. They solved their dilemma through the worldwide myth of the Animal Master. They believed that their prey animals were controlled by a prototypical animal spirit and that if they treated the animals with respect as they hunted them and afterwards dealt with their remains, the Animal Master would insure that the animals will not really die, but will reappear the next year and offer themselves to the hunters again. Thus these ancient peoples symbolically demonstrated that they understood and accepted the great round of life and death that perpetuates and informs the world. Our culture may consider this myth to be nonsense, but the test of a myth (which Joseph Campbell once defined mischievously as a lie that tells the truth) is: does it serve the people who live by it well? The Animal Master myth has served traditional peoples, probably for hundreds of thousands, if not for millions of years, and enabled them to live in harmony with the rest of the world without destroying either it or themselves. Our culture is 7 - 10,000 years old. Another of our foremost myths is that of \\"unlimited growth\\". Inspired by myths that defy biological principals, what chance do you give our culture to last as long as that of traditional peoples?Turning Nature into a commodity leads to the mentality of trying to patent living organisms or the dismissal of difficult moral issues. For instance, I happen to be pro-choice, but I do not pretend that there is no troubling ethical issue with respect to abortion. This book helps to propel us down a slippery slope that leads to such bizarre outcomes as the patenting of life forms, and the genetic engineering of the very food we eat without consideration of of the inevitable unforeseen consequences. Will we learn the error of our myths in time to remedy them? Not if our self-distructive myths continue to be passed on to the next generation in stories like Arlene Sardine."},{"Title":"AND IT WAS SO","review":"My family wore out our original copy of &quot;And It Was So&quot;.

It is such a sweet story with adorable pictures (and it was nice to finally see what the last picture was). The story teaches good lessons of both hard work and giving generously to others. The boys don't seem to have any problems taking turns doing things and all have good personalities.The best part of this book is that the three different jobs that the boys get end up turning their blue outfits into red, black, and white. My 4-year-old nephew has such fun when we quiz him about which boy turned red (Snipp), black (Snapp), and white (Snurr). My nephew also loves the vivid drawings and enjoys the characters of Snipp, Snapp, and Snurr.The only thing that I wish was not in this book is that the miller is seen \\"smoking his longest pipe\\", both in the text and the picture. This was a normal thing back when the book was written, but it is a bit hard to explain to a 4-year-old that smoking pipes is not a healthy habit to be imitating.Overall, this book is a winner! Very fun and sweet. :)"},{"Title":"Snipp, Snapp, Snurr, and The Red Shoes","review":"How wonderful to be able to share with my grandchildren the Snipp, Snapp, Snurr series of books that I loved as a child.

I wanted to read it because I usually find that the Booker Prize winning books (How Late it Was, How Late won in 1994) to be interesting reads, however I was sorely disappointed in James Kellerman's book. The only thing I admired about this book was the style. The author writes the entire book in the Scottish vernacular and entirely from the point of view of the main character, Sammy, who is a criminal who has just gone blind as the result of a beating inflicted by the police. The book in essence becomes the character, and the character becomes the book. This is an astonishing accomplishment for any novelist, and I am sure that is the reason Kellerman won the Booker Prize, however the character is so boring, stupid, and selfish, that it was impossible for me to enjoy reading this novel. Sammy's favorite word was the &quot;F&quot; word, and if you expunge this word from this 370-page novel the page count would drop to 200. Kellerman is a talented author, and I wish he would use his abilities to write about interesting people who could shed some light on human condition without boring the reader to the extent that they do not look forward to finishing the book."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"This book is like getting your first stereo. At first you might not know how to hook it up, but once you figure it out it's sheer heaven. Not since The Butcher Boy have I been carried through a text by the sheer beauty of the words juxtaposed against such intestine-tightening despair. Sure, the dialect can be tricky to grasp. But don't the greatest pleasures in life take some training. And admitedly there's a way in which &quot;nothing happens.&quot; But really, who cares (And actually a lot DOES happen). This is one of the most beautifully panic-producing novels I've ever touched. For the first half of the book I could only read 10 pages at a time because it made me so nervous. But once I hit around page two hundred I finished it in one sitting. People who don't get this book are the same ones who think Saving Private Ryan is how a movie should be. There has to be action, action, action and some soppy something or other to hang your heart on. Well, pick up this book and hang your heart on poor old Sammy. He's a heartbreaker extraordinaire, if I ever met one."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"&quot;No frigate like a book to take us lands away,&quot; said Emily Dickinson. Oh my, she's right. There are other worlds out there, lots of them. Kelman's book takes us to one, a unique one, right in the middle of Glasgow, in fact in the outer limits of consciousness somewhere - in the mind of a low-life petty thief named Sammy who stupidly assaulted two policemen and got beaten so badly by them that he is blinded. After that, everything in this book is generated, more or less, in Sammy's head as interior monologue (not stream of consciousness as others say) or by the speech of the characters Sammy deals with. Those characters do plenty of talking with an extremely limited vocabulary that nevertheless has an amazing expressive range proving, again, that Scotland is a nation of talkers, great talkers. It is also a welfare state with lots of red tape and institutionalized dullness. So much so that Sammy's difficulties with the DSS Central Medical board and with the DSS in general call into question the Scottish I.Q. and raise the query that they might have there some institutional madness as serious as that discussed in Bleak House. Some advice: Donay be turned off by ye Scottish dialect. Read the first three pages aloud. Aw fine. Aye, they make sense. Ah stories, man, stories, life's full of stories, there to help ye out. Aye right pal okay."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time but let me warn you it is a mess to read and if you are easily offended this is not the book for you. Full of swear words and written in dialect (which makes it very hard to read) this one is an acquired taste. If you have just finished reading Trainspotting (the only good book by Irvine Welsh & not the greatest movie) which has a glossary of terms it is a little easier. Winner of the Booker Prize because it is pure genus and a one-of-a-kind read. Completely original, written well before Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting and much, much better."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"It's a shame no one seemed to notice this book in America despite its Booker Prize. Kelman's low-to-the-ground style really conveys the despair of the main character, Sammy. This book has a haunting quality about it that's reminiscent of Camus' The Stranger, yet it is a much more confused, frenzied, quickening spiral toward oblivion."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Sammy,the sole tangiable charecter in this novel, represents the epitomy of the Glasgow looser; the street wise, urban survivor, subjected to an injustice by the authorities charged with upholding the law. Sammy is, of course, his own worst enemy, and as the plot unfolds, a broader complexity of character emerges. I was intriqued by this novel, not so much in the structure the plot,which had substance, but in it's structure and Sammy's: He appeared to be both the subject and, at the same time, the narrator. It is the narration which gives it it's uniquness. Some readers may be discouraged by the language. However, please persevere and look beyond; this is authentic Glaswegian ( they actually talk like this). And if you, the reader, persever and exercise patience, then you may benefit from a universal truth of Kelman's insight into urban suvival whether it be Glasgow, Chicago, Moscow, or a hundred other cities across the planet. In short, this novel ecompasses a universiallity in modern urban survivalism that embraces all urban cultures."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"I bought this book as a remaindered item on the strength of it's Booker prize years ago, knowing nothing of the author. This book is a breathtaking insight into the workings of a minor criminal mind over a short, tragic span of time. The style, 'stream of consciousness' I guess would be fairly apt, has been done to death but seldom with the power and authenticity one finds here. Authenticity is the key word, I think, the text painfully believable without a single false note, a remarkable achievement in itself. The self-destructiveness characteristic of this type of mind, the unfailing series of wrong decisions with their painful, infuriating consequences rings so true as to make one wonder how the author turned the trick. The style and message is strongly influenced by Beckett which should not put one off. Highly readable, coarse, coarse, coarse, but how could it be otherwise?"},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Ah, dear, how to write a review of a novel in which over half the words are unrepeatable in an Amazon review? The irony is that it's the lovely, chanting, profane interior monologue of the book that wins one over. From starter's orders here, we are inside the mind of a Glaswegian no-account who has lost his sight after having been \\"done in\\" by the police. He has also lost his girlfriend, his memory, and, to a certain extent, his mind.But what a lovely, melodic mind it is! For all the talk of the book's roughness and the vulgarity of its language, it is intrinsically a sweet book - the poor bloke who never had a chance, blinded, left lovelorn, up against everything the world has to throw at him. Added to this is Sammy's perspective on the world. There's precious little self-pity in it.So, we listen in on Sammy's thoughts as the bureaucracy, the police, the doctor, the lawyer all try to take him down. The recurrent image is of a wounded animal, defanged by blindness, beating the bars of the cage of this world with the mop handle with which he makes do for a cane, all the while drifting in a melodious incantation of meditation. I didn't want to put this book down. When I finally came to the end, I felt like saying to Sammy what he says to his son:\\"The worst of all this is saying cheerio to the likes of yerself, but what can ye do, ye've got to batter on, know what I'm saying, ye've got to batter on.\\"Aye, Sammy, don't we all?"},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"It took me a while to get used to the Scottish phrasing and accent, but this is definitely one of the most compelling novels I have read in a very long time. Sammy is an astonishing character: Full of good and evil, full of sympathy and loathing. He is a fascinating antihero, wish his story could have gone on forever. Pick up this book, be determined that you can get through the 'language,' and you will be rewarded with one of the most challenging, expressive, and engrossing tales you have ever read."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"One of the most interesting novels I've read in quite a while, How Late it Was, How Late is an introspective journey through the struggles of a newly blind ex-con. James Kelman's pseudo- stream of consciousness narrative presents the thoughts and emotions of the protagonist with unrivalled clarity. His unique approach to writing from the perspective of a sightless narrator has never been utilized in such an innovative and accessible (not to mention believable) way. The reader suffers alongside Sammy and is comforted in turn by his defiant philosophy. The book is truly an emotional masterpiece. The action is non-stop and liberally scattered with the ramblings of a compelling, defiant philosophy. How Late it Was, How Late, though unfit for children, must not be condemned for its language but rather appreciated for its natural, honest portrayal of the author's culture."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Warning: the entire book, all three hundred plus brilliant pages of it, is written in the roughest, most profane, no apologies made lower class Scottish dialect. Understandable? Yes. Easy going? Not necessarily. Acceptable for the kiddies and the easily offended? Let's just say that not a page goes by without a flurry of obscenities that would earn an NC-17 movie rating and a thorough soap-and-mouth washing out session.That being said, \\"How Late It Was How Late\\" is a rarity: a Scottish take on what can only be described as a Franz Kafka meets Twilight Zone experience. Nothing supernatural takes place- no ghosts, no impossible mutations, no science fiction absurdities- but the events that slowly unfold over the course of this dialogue heavy book are disturbing and frustrating in a way that can best be described as Kafkaesque.Sammy wakes up- on page one- to discover that his shoes are missing and that other than being hungover, he has no idea what happened in the past 24 hours. Within the hour, he is arrested, abused by the police, and when he wakes up sometime later, he is inexplicably blind. This all occurs in the first dozen or so pages of the novel, and from here on out, the reader is stuck inside Sammy's head as he- and we- struggle to figure out what is going on.Being blind, dealing with the police who seem to think Sammy is involved with something Sammy cannot remember, the bureaucracy of trying to prove that Sammy is actually blind- are details that pile up and make the situation seemingly unbearable. How Sammy, and Kelman describe and deal with these uncontrollable events make for a compelling and unforgettable journey.Again, this is not an easy read and without giving too much away, be warned that there is no neat little bow put on the end to tidy the mess up. Instead, Kelman gives us a powerful literary journey unlike anything else out there."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"When I finished the book, I didn't care to think about it any more. The story and writing was somewhat boring."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"A lot of people weren't happy about this book winning the Booker Prize in 1994. One of the main reasons for this is because of the frequent curse words. But Kelman is a realist, and curse words are part of the working class of Scotland. Another reason for the controversy is due to its subject matter. The main character, Sammy, is beaten so hard by the police, that he becomes blind. Again, Kelman is a realist, and there has been reported police beatings against the Scottish working class. All in all, this book may be controversial to some, but for many like myself, it's a fantastic read.Again, when is someone going to do a biography on the man?!"},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Well atleast this is one differnt book. It is totally unlike what you can expect of a Booker winner. I must say it is an extremely slow story, really not moving altogether. Moreover, written in Scottish slang it can be a tremendous task to comprehend. The story has no emotional buildup nor any character that you can remember. Page after page you hope for something to happen. But yet I always wanted to finish it. A strange book!"},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"The style of this book apparently is know in the trade as \\"stream of consciousness\\", but anyone who has ever set foot in Glasgow can see it's just standard weegie punter pub patter spun out into book length and format.I had high expectations coming to this book, having won the Booker prize and generally acclaimed by the critics. But as story lines go, it's average. As a piece of English literature, it's not even on the radar screens. As a piece of Scots literature, it's been heavily watered down (sorry to disappoint the other reviewers who thought the 'dialect' - in actual fact banter - was quite strong). If you're after a solid piece of contemporary Scots stuff in the same vein, Irvine Welsh (Edinburgh) is far better, you'll get a proper story line, some bare minimum of character development, more energy all round and better language. If you're wanting really classic stuff, then maybe Lewis Grassic Gibbon (Aberdonian).But to give the book credit where due, there are some strong points. If you have never been to Glasgow or Scotland (or if you have and are nostalgic - it does happen so I am told...), this book is full of those 'only-in-Glasgow' gems; but to repeat you don't have to be a great author to put them down on paper. If you've never been to Scotland you can have a taster of how depressing life really is there.There's bound to be literary critics out there who can dig out profound observations on human nature and modern society in this. But then again this sort of folk can see meaning in an old bag of chips or a soggy newspaper. And is hard to see whether Kelman actually intended anything with this book other than to make a few coins.Other good points. It's a pretty light read, you can steam through it in no time, and it's ideal for reading on the beach (if you have the luck), on the bus, waiting in a queue etc.If you can avoid spending the money, try borrowing from a friend or from the library. It's not one of those classic tomes you will be wanting to grace your own collection in years to come.If you're seriously wanting to find out more about Scotland and the way of life/language, the only real way to do it is through the cinema. Similar sort of approach to Kelman is taken by Ken Loach ('My name is Joe', 'Sweet Sixteen')."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"How Late it Was, How Late was recommended to me by one of the most naturally intelligent people I know; an intellectual dare I say. In addition, I read many reviews of this book which offered unwavering support. Well, after finishing this book, which is, by the way, is no easy task until you get accustomed to the Scottish slang and prose, I could only think, &quot;It's an intersting book, different from what I've normally read, but I'm surprised at the accolades (including the Booker Prize) this work received.&quot; The book is a stream-of-consciousness story, written in what I describe as Scottish Ebonics. With the lack of any normal or consistent punctuation, the book is slow-going at first until you train your mind to simultaneously interpret what is seen on the page, much in the same way a 7th grade student reads from a Spanish book. Oh, and if you're particular about foul language (which I am not), stay far away. Expletives rain from Sammy's mouth like &quot;you know&quot; and &quot;like&quot; fall from every teenager's tongue. Because the subject matter of the story has been discussed already above, I will say this: The book has been described (on the jacket even) as Kafkaesque. I can only think that it is being compared to The Metamorphasis in the sense that a man awakes to find himself changed and unaccustomed to his new surroundings. Well, I know Kafka, and James Kelman is no Kafka. (My sincerest aplologies to Lloyd Benson) As I find this review becoming too long already, let me just finish with a couple of thoughts. First, I DID like this book only because it offered something different and I think it did an admirable job portraying a down-on-his-luck, alcoholic trying to make sense of his world. The prose and unashamed irreverance readd as though you have direct access to Sammy's thought process. The bottom line is, however, that I think this book is somewhat overrated. It reminds me of how praise for a movie becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. A person sees the movie, leaves and thinks, &quot;Well, I'm not sure, but the reviews were great, so it must have been a great movie to deserve the praise.&quot; The final, take-home message: An interesting literary experience, which deserves the time to read, but not the exuberant laurels."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"People keep telling me that James Kelman took after Kafka with this book. I haven't read Kafka, but will now if he's half as good as Kelman.Sammy is portrayed as a lower class Scottish man, and James Kelman gives him the vocabulary to accomplish the rare feat of making a character human. Kelman does more than that. He gives a thrillingly brilliant tale of a man who hits rock bottom. The prose is equally funny and tragic, but always moving. Bravo to Kelman (and to the Booker McConnell Prize for giving him a well deserved win)."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"A friend of mine told me that you had to be a man to appreciate this book. Perhaps so, because the character and the story held no interest for me. I read other reviews that say the story-line was suspenseful. I did not find that. In fact, I put the book away with 50 pages to go because I was so bored and genuinely did not care what happened to our hero. The style was certainly original, but not Booker Prize material."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"I ordered this to learn more about modern-day Scotland, and because it was a Booker awardee I expected something interesting. I'm disappointed on both counts. The first several pages are probably the most vulgar, obscene screed I've ever seen and that was enough for me.

I'm reading my way through the Booker Prize Winners and this one is by far the worst of a wonderful collection of books."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Having read all of Irvine Welsh's books, I was looking for some more Scottish writers whose books are in dialect. Luckily for me, I found this in the Salvation Army shop for a couple of dollars. Now, I'm originally from Glasgow, so it was interesting in that regard, but I'm pretty much in agreement with Tam's review (see below). The book was apparently controversial because it's profane, but it's nothing really. People talk like that, worse even. Irvine Welsh writes dialect better and more consistently, allowing you to distinguish between Edinburgh and Glasgow accents (which you'll only get if you're from there, by the way). As for the plot, it's OK, Sammy the main character has some good lines, but at times I was frustrated with him. But that's what it's all about, I suppose. Worth reading, but if you're not from there, then you won't get the most out of it."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"I bought this novel for the simple novelty of coincidence in the author's name. My father was James Kelman, and his father too. My brother, and two nephews. Fine. I had once dreamed of writing great fiction, and was happy to see that at least a Kelman had. If nothing else, it would be something to pass on to one of my nephews. It is much more than that. It is brilliant, as fiction, as literature. It is an experimental narrative, &quot;seen&quot; through the recently blind eyes of the protagonist, which makes it an ordeal for the reader, echoing Sammy's far more taxing one. He leads us blindly throughout, and then just disappears, and we are none the wiser. Or maybe we are. This is not a novel of answers, certainly, and not even a novel of questions. It is a novel of indomitable man, battered, bruised and blind, but free as can be"},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"At first glance of this book I admit I had my doubts. The dialect is heavy and there are many expletives but after a few glances I gave the book the attention it deserved. The book was amazing I could not put it down. I felt as if I knew the lead character personally. Sammy, with all his faults, is a true antihero. He handles his blindness in a way I would have never imagined. I also enjoyed the relationship between him and his son. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind to give Sammy a chance to enter your life and tell his story."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"Ye open this book an yer thinking what's this no punctuation.

The dialect is difficult to understand(even for a Scot from Edinburgh), but in this case perseverance brings rewards.This is an intense and highly original novel. Sammy's trips around his local neighbourhood were as nerve-racking an experience as I can remember in a book. Every step he took filled me with trepidation.Ultimately 'How late it was, how late' was an uplifting experience, with Sammy the unlikely hero."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"I'm blown away by how excellent this book is. Genius. By the time I'd finished the first few pages I knew this was gonna be the best thing ever--ever, I say! Welcome to the inner life of Sammy. He's just woke up in a bed of weeds and can't recall a thing about it. What's that on his feet? Auld &%$*&# trainer shoes! Where are his leathers? So begins our odyssey.Stream of consciousness is not a huge favourite of mine; usually too much navel-gazing going on for my taste. Sammy isn't one for self-analysis, though. More than likely he's wondering about the polis, recalling randomness, or has song lyrics running through his head. Kelman really takes you inside Sammy's mind, like being there. Despite a lack of plot, 'How Late...' is exciting to read because it's so masterfully done. When something comes alive like that for me, I don't care what (if anything) happens or who it is being written about, that's more than enough reason to love the book.It's been said about this novel that \\"frankly, it's crap.\\" So passionately did someone believe in this book's lack of merit that they threatened to resign from a literary judging panel if it won the prize.

No question, it is not an easy book to understand, or to like. Dialogue pops up almost without warning, and certainly without a hint of punctuation; the narrative slips from third to second person, often within the course of a paragraph. And then there is the vocabulary.But these devices serve the ends of the book, the portrayal of a down-and-out, the pettiest of petty outlaws, one Sammy. He is not without his endearing traits, including his taste for American country music. Like most of us, Sammy has a bad attitude about bureaucrats of all sorts -- it just that he finds himself after these encounters bleeding on the pavement. From the profoundest depths, he speaks in universal rhythms that reveal the poetry of despair:\\"Ye wake in a corner and stay there hoping yer body will disappear, the thoughts smothering ye; but ye want to remember and face up to things, just something keeps ye from doing it, why can ye no do it; the words filling yer head: then the other words.... He shivered and hunched up his shoulders, shut his eyes, rubbed into the corners with his fingertips; seeing all kinds of spots and lights.\\"Equal parts \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" and \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" this rewarding novel is worth the struggle that it is to read."},{"Title":"How Late It Was, How Late","review":"This, This, This, This is the book that everyone pretended Irvine Welsh had written in Trainspotting - only he didn't.

By sharing her thoughtful, well-researched insights, Laura Sessions Stepp is able to help demystify what is often a difficult passage for both parents and teens.As the mother of three boys, 12, 15, and 17, I found this book enormously reassuring. By talking intimately with young teens and their families and friends, Ms. Stepp found that despite the pressures and challenges to succeed, fit in, and experiment with independence, teens still want what they've always wanted: to be loved and accepted while they discover who they are. As a corollary to this, Ms. Stepp assures parents that the role they play is still crucial even as it changes, that their relationship with their teens is all-important even as it transforms.We all know &quot;it takes a village,&quot; but often we're not sure exactly what that means. At the end of each part of her book, Ms. Stepp lists several things &quot;As Parents We Can...&quot; do to encourage our teens in their growth and development, and involve other positive role models in their lives. These tips are distilled from the chapters that precede them, chapters that illustrate WHY it's important to act on this guidance.&quot;Our Last Best Shot&quot; gracefully blends true-life stories with documented scientific research to give us a better understanding of all the influences at work in a teen's mind, from hormones to peer pressure. We get a detailed picture of the young teen that rivals all we know about infancy.The writing is clear, frank, and best of all, positive. We hear so much about the effects of divorce, teenage pregnancy, learning disabilities, overcrowded schools, alcohol and drugs, guns and violence, AIDS, and all the rest. It's refreshing to hear a sensible, rational voice that says, &quot;Stop. Wait. Most teens are great kids, and we can help them become even better.&quot;"},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"When my children were babies and toddlers, I found overwhelming amounts of information about their needs and care-- magazines, books, TV shows. Now that they are 15 and 9, I can't find much worth reading to help me with their needs. I found that this book was very helpful. The author interviewed many teenagers and profiled 12 of them in this book. The book is an interesting glimpse into their lives, and the lives of their families, and the unique problems they each face. Although this is not a &quot;self-help&quot; book, with prescriptions for how to solve the problems parents face, the final chapter summarizes the author's findings from the interviews and gives advice to parents. This summary should be copied and posted where every parent of a teenager will see it frequently because it's a very complete summary of things that teenagers need from their parents.I am also starting to work my way through the books listed in the bibliography. It appears to be a great resource for further reading about adolescents.Finally, I wanted to explain the reason I awarded only 4 stars. I felt that the book focussed too much on teenagers who have some kind of &quot;problem&quot;: poverty, drugs, neglect, etc. Although the book was useful for all parents of older children and teens, I think it would have been better for me if there had been a few more middle-class kids who are doing well in school in the book. That's the kind of kids that I am dealing with, and they still have problems. I suspect that's the kind of kid a lot of... customers are raising too."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"As the crisis counselor in a public high school and middle school I found this book to share great insights as to what works and what doesn't with this age group. It is presented in laymans terms and easily captures the readers interest. There is so little written information on pre-adolescents and the battles they face. I'd love to see a follow up on the kids the author profiled in about 10 years. Anyone that works with or has middle school age children must read this book."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"I am neither a parent nor a teacher, but I found this well-written, insightful book eye-opening.I bought it as a &quot;suggested reading&quot; gift for the parents of a young girl I have been mentoring, but could not put it down after reading the introduction! Ms. Stepp's intermingling of real life examples with research from the experts revealed so many things that a non-parent can do to change the world by helping children navigate early adolescence. Her inclusion of African American children among her subjects, and her sensitive treatment of the special problems their lives present brought her book home for me."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"I felt like I was reading \\"MY Last Best Shot\\" as I read through this book. I have three sons, ages 10, 12, & 13, and this book was lent to me by my middle son's teacher. I liked it so much I bought my own copy. Every chapter opened my eyes to something else I didn't know about or have not been doing with my sons. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with children near or at the pre-teen age level, particularly parents who find most parenting books boring, patronizing or unrealistic."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"The author extensively interviewed and spent massive amounts of time with each of 12 middle schoolers and early high schoolers in LA. Durham, NC, and a small town in Kansas. We get deeply into the lives of these youngsters and their families. We share everything from their triumphs to their getting into very serious trouble (one was suspended from school for a year for bringing an unloaded gun to school). What we learn is that this age group is one in which kids start to assert some independence and both teachers and parents have to give up some control. Stepp puts it well .. we must let kids climb the mountain but still retain enough control to keep them away from the edge of the cliff. Kids this age must believe that we are listening to them and care about what they have to say. Kids need good role models including adults other than their parents. This age group is so crucial to a child's development. The need for more independence is so important yet the dangers of serious mistakes is ever present. What I like about this book is that Stepp makes her observations and offers insights and comments without inserting an excessive amount of ideology. Msny books of this genre have political agendas, both feminist and conservative, This book steers clear of such agendi. This book is important reading for both parents and teachers. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"For Christmas 2000, I only requested a few gifts. Besides paper white bulbs and a red matte lipstick, I wanted this book. As a parent of younger children and a youth development consultant and writer, I had committed to reading it in the New Year!I read Last Best Shot in less than 2 days and enjoyed it immensely. In 12 profiles of young adolescents, the author touches on the turbulence but wonderful promise of young teens. She cuts through all the theoretical jargon with an amazingly graceful writing style. This is its finest strength---to communicate what experts in the field know about youth development in engaging storytelling profiles. This makes it a wonderful read for anyone, with children or without.Beautifully insightful, and at times poignant, the private look into the lives of these children gives you the freedom to draw many of your own conclusions. It is also extremely refreshing to see children from many backgrounds portrayed--Children of married families, divorced ones, white, city, rural, Hispanic and African American. My only wish is that we will see a followup. What will happen to all these children in three or four years?"},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"As a mother of a 14 year old child, I was so grateful to read that my vision was comparable to the author's. This book is all about provisioning up your child. It is easy to love a baby, unconditionally, but much harder when your child is in the teenage years and ready to challenge you. I liked the subtle messages that the author sent - give your child chores to do, give them a sense of self, love them unconditionally, and most of all, be a part of their lives. My heart went out to the children in this book who, in my estimation, are not going to make it."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"While waiting for clients to show up to see a house, I picked up this book and started reading. Having a new middle schooler, I found that I could not put this down because I could see him in so many of the situations. As soon as I got home, I went on-line and ordered it right away. I will be reading every page of this book. Very engrossing. You feel that you know each individual as you read about them. Also easy reading. As the mother of a three year old, I have many interuptions and it is nice to have a book that can be read in short spurts. This is a must read for anyone with children entering into those adolescent years!"},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"Parents of middle-grade kids will find this an illuminating, thought-provoking, carefully researched guide to the way 6th, 7th and 8th graders think and make decisions--and of the pressures in their world.

Facebook), internet issues and cell phone/texting use and abuse."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"Parents, Educators, Youth and Child Workers, Legislators, etc., would benefit greatly from the wisdom in this book. This tells what is on kids' minds today, danger signals, prevention, communication, friendships. This book tells why it is important to educate children about sex, to not \\"micro-manage\\" children in school, how standardized testing fails our children, the value of healthy/mentoring adult friendships, and the critical task of setting examples for children in our behaviors - acting like adults, responsibility, discovery, and relationships in particular.This book is incredibly well-organized and well-written on top of all the valuable information it imparts."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"Laura Stepp has given us a gift, a superb book on adolescents, what can go wrong and, more importantly, what can go right.

A couple of things that are especially great about it are: at the end of each section, Ms. Stepp includes a list of specific suggestions. At the end of the book, there is a chapter summarizing all the main points. This is especially parent when one parent reads it and the other parent wants to get a good summary to discuss main points.Amazingly, this book was as enjoyable to read as a novel. I found myself staying up late at night to keep reading it. I think that any parent who reads this book will be rewarded with a calmer attitude toward their tween/teen and more confidence as a parent."},{"Title":"Our Last Best Shot","review":"This book is a collection of case studies about middle school aged children from different parts of the United States. The author, Laura Session-Steps, spent a lot of time traveling and getting to know these children. She then lays out the case studies is a story like form that is easy to read and very informative. The book has a lot of vital information for students and teachers to utilize when dealing with todays adolescents. This book is definately worth buying and reading. I actually studied this book for a college course specific to adolescent development. The book really helped me understand the way an adolescent mind works."},{"Title":"The Reengineering Revolution: a handbook","review":"After the magnificent marketing of Re-engineering as a radical tool to be used in organizations in order to increase contemporary performance measures such as efficiency, quality and speed, many organizations have started sweeping grand re-engineering projects in the hope that they would reach promised lands. But results of such high-risky re-engineering projects were not much motivating. Upon initial results and understood problems of re-engineering, Hammer wrote this book to close the conceptual and practical gaps of re - engineering. Human side of organizations had been neglected and organizations had been thought as mechanical systems in the first article and book. This book is an endeavor to offset first stage of re-engineering theory and practice.As in other management models, strong leadership is seen as a critical factor for final success of re-engineering. I think, the reason of serious emphasis on leadership in this book is that some people who practiced re-engineering realized that organizations are also political arenas in which members fight for their privileges and long-term interests. From a humanistic perspective, it is normal to sabotage re-engineering projects which would change power structure in upper-levels of the organizations and would cause many people at lower-levels lose their jobs. It seems that leader is assumed as a man who would table political nature of organizations and lead people walk in dictated direction despite ominous results for them , namely leader is seen as an authority figure who is expected to overwhelm political conflicts between organization members. Ironically, leaders are also political figures, not neutral personalities exempt from corporate politics. I think, authors should think again on leadership and its role in re-engineering projects. Oversimplification is not able to solve most complex problems of organizations.Although Hammer and his apostles strongly oppose to F.W. Taylor and his approach, there is an important similarity in the logic of their models. Taylor was trying to fully understand the each detail managing the work performed, namely inputs, outputs, and procedures, by conducting time-motion studies, and after he was trying to find the one-best way to do job. It was possible to find best way if you understand all parts of the work performed. Today, this is absolutely what Hammer does. The most outstanding example of re-engineering is order-taking process that is too simple, too mechanistic, accordingly very understandable. Will you please tell me, how can Re-engineering can deal with a decision process. Do people follow a pure-rational mechanistic approach, which is recounted in all management books, when they intend to make a decision. Can you apply re-engineering model to this process which is much complex ? I think, the answer is NO. In this case, Why is re-engineering presented as a radical anti-Taylorist model ? It is so blurred.We have known for a long time that organizations are SOCIOTECHNICAL systems, but Hammer and his apostles place the emphasis on the technical dimension of the organizations, and other part is behaved as it is stepchild. Organization is consisted of two important structures, which are technical structure (hard structure) and social structure (soft structure). Social structure is also important and in most cases this part dominates and shapes the other part. Therefore there should be an equal emphasis on both of them. A pure-rational model which does not take social fabric of the organization into consideration is subject to failure in practical settings.The other problem of re-engineering I understood when I read the book is that \\"Information Technology\\" is exaggerated to the extent that it is perceived as a panecea. Such a conviction does not hold truth completely. We are reading and witnessing corporations which invest in information technology (hardware and software) and incur big failure costs. Without understanding the problem within the right context, technology is beyond a solution. \\"Packet problem and packet solution approach\\" should be abandoned. An organization must understand its problem with its real roots (not assumed) so that it would be able to produce right solution alternatives. \\"Inquiry discipline\\" is a prerequisite for long-run solutions.Overall, I think that should the conceptual and practical gaps are closed, re-engineering has a high potential to become a strong re-organization tool which would stamp on 21 century corporate history . This book is a good starting base in this long way. I recommend this book with three stars."},{"Title":"The Reengineering Revolution: a handbook","review":"If you're going to reengineer, this book is a valuable one to have-- in particular, I'd like to take the chapter about choosing a consultant and staple it to the doors of many a company (and I'm a consultant). The book covers elements of success, practical tips for making it work, and some case studies.What I find missing is the question &quot;Should I reengineer?&quot;. (The answer, I think, isn't always 'yes'.) It would be *most* useful if it first helped managers make sure that reengineering really is a Good and Necessary Thing, given the pain it inevitably causes a corporation. There's also a little bit of a sense that nay-sayers shouldn't be tolerated at all, and I find that a little bit short-sighted.Nice to have for managers and consultants."},{"Title":"The Reengineering Revolution: a handbook","review":"Hard to write an exciting review about business processing reengineering.

The book itself dives far more into the \\"how to\\" than the original Reengineering the Corporation. The work is divided into three parts - the first being a discussion of the elements of success, including leadership - which Hammer notes as the key ingredient for success. The second part of the book discusses avoiding the pitfalls of reengineering - including dealing with internal resistance and change management. The final part is entitled \\"Tales from the Road\\", where Hammer uses cases and examples to illustrate reengineering application. Written nearly 15 years ago, the book is getting a bit dated, but still contains enough to be worthy of a read."},{"Title":"The Reengineering Revolution: a handbook","review":"Michael Hammer is truly a proactive manager. His ideas strike hard and are STILL needed here in the US and abroad. He helped us prune our organization so it could grow. Reengineering will take on many forms as the business world around us changes, but the concepts are rock-solid and they will be the best foundation for a business that wants to continually improve.Hammer covers all of the proactive bases: smart thinking, system thinking, futuristic thinking, and positive thinking. If you want to your business to always be operating at its maximum performance, you should follow his advice. Some of the ideas he promotes are found in SUCCESS BOUND, another book that teaches you how to be a proactive thinker.One of my favorite quotes is, &quot;The starting point for organization success is well designed processes.&quot; Unfortunately too many business managers tried to implement reengineering concepts, but they failed miserably because they didn't take the time to learn from Hammer as to what &quot;well designed&quot; meant.Read this book and you will find out and you will put your organization on the road to proactive success."},{"Title":"Implementing 802.11 with Microcontrollers: Wireless Networking for Embedded Systems Designers (Embedded Technology)","review":"This is an excellent peek into the low-level infrastructure of 802.11b radios. The micro controller enthusiast as well as the 802.11b WiFi-curious should find this book to hold many fascinating details. Fred takes the reader though his thought process and lab notes as he decodes and explains, down to the chip level, how the typical PRISM-based 802.11b wireless card works (Intersil developed then sold to Conexant the PRISM chip set used in millions of 802.11b wireless network card). In the process, Fred's light-hearted style of writing entertains the reader with trivia. Linux experts will, of course, realize that this is old hat for an x86-based Linux system. Fred acknowledges the fine contributions of the Linux word and adds his genius in the 8/16-bit micro controller world. The key difference in Fred's book as compared to the Linux driver code is the simplicity of Fred's explanations. The reader is given code that he or she can apply to the real world.Beginning with chapter 1, Fred explains to the reader why he embarked this journey. That is with the lack of public information of PRISM-based 802.11 network cards, Fred had a huge task ahead of him. Chapters 2 and 3 explain the design of 2 experimental Microchip PIC (Chapter 2) and Atmel AVR (Chapter 3) \`AirDrop' products (...). The AirDrop products allow the user to practice what they learn. In chapter 4 Fred lets the smoke out of several PRISM-based compact FLASH-style 802.11b cards and begins to put together the pieces of a bigger puzzle; the secrets held in the 802.11b ROM structures. At this point, the reader feels as if they are reading a mystery novel. In chapter 5, Fred discusses the interface of the micro controller covering two modes; memory and I/O. Chapter 6 begins a journey through the CIS (Card Information Structure) where the reader learns how to query the 802.11b card to find out the basic operating parameters. At this point, the reader could use the information to work with a compact FLASH memory card (The book does not cover memory cards, but the information is applicable). In fact, Fred's software has many routines needed to work with the memory cards; a clear bonus. In chapter 7, the reader learns how to work with the 802.11b NIC (Network Interface Controller). It is at this point in the book where the reader gains the respect of the TCP/IP heavy-weights. Reading Fred's first book (Networking and Internetworking with Micro controllers) would be helpful and recommended but is not necessary. The remaining chapters of the book teach the user to apply what they have learned illustrating various network related activities such as pinging, telneting, etc. to the AirDrop 802.11b world. Two nice bonus chapters cover how to implement WEP (Wireless Encryption Protocol) security, and the new ZigBee wireless protocol.If you've wanted to learn how to interface 802.11b network cards to a micro controller or have a burning desire to learn what's inside that wireless adaptor card on your system this is a great book to learn from, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Implementing 802.11 with Microcontrollers: Wireless Networking for Embedded Systems Designers (Embedded Technology)","review":"This is the best of the Newnes \\"red\\" books.

I'm sixty-seven years of age. I'm a Blackfeet Indian from Browning, Montana. With what little education I have, I have, I'm going to try to write the version of our true ways in our history and legends.....Some of these stories may sound a little foolish, but they are very true, and they have much influence over all of the people of this world, even as we all live now.\\"THE SUN CAME DOWN is a legendary history of the world, told in the distinctive voice of one of the last Blackfeet Indians who remembers what the elders taught him.THE SUN CAME DOWN shares a major body of North American religious myths as handed down by such Blackfeet tribal elders as Yellow Kidney, Shoots First and Bullchild's own grandmother, Catches Last. With the same vividness that has kept these stories alive for centuries, Bullchild retells the legendary history of Creator Sun, who made the earth by spitting on a ball of dust; of Napi, a Coyote figure who is both humananity's bane and helper; and Ku-toeyis, the hero the Sun sent to undo Napi's mischief. In the final chapter, \\"Honoring Creator Sun,\\" Bullchild recounts the origina and cultural importance of Plains Indian ceremonies, including the Sun Dance.These legends, some familiar, most unknown, capture the raw force of the original oral traditions. With robust energy, flashes of raucous humor, and lyricism, these legends expose a culture rich in spirituality and humor. This is a rare sampling of the spirituality, mythology, and psychology of the Native American."},{"Title":"Gilles Deleuze's","review":"To be perfectly honest, this book helped to reinvigorate an interest in Difference and Repetition, a book that I had formerly passed over because on first read I found the contents inaccessible, at least at the time. And - in all fairness - Williams' book offers a number of hints that helped me to understand Deleuze's magnum opus. But that is really all this book has to offer: hints. As one reviewer pointed out, it can work to Williams' detriment that he insists on keeping a constant dialogue with analytical philosophy. I would go one step further and say that Williams' habit of repeating the same complaints which would-be analytical philosophers might raise, and always deferring any lucid answer to these questions, borders on tedium. This is not the only thing that is tedious about this work, as one quickly becomes aware after sampling just a bit of the prose. For instance, Williams often interrupts his train of thought with bizarre and unhelpful remarks (e.g. \\"Who are you stranger? What reasons brought you here?\\").If you're looking for a clarification of Deleuze's chef d'oeuvre, this book will help to some degree. If you don't feel like weeding through the tedium of \\"Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition\\" I recommend looking elsewhere - Manuel Delanda's \\"Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy\\" is a nice alternative."},{"Title":"Gilles Deleuze's","review":"There are two commentaries on Difference and Repetition in English. There is this book by James Williams and there isDeleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Reader's Guide (Reader's Guides)by Joe Hughes. I have gone back and forth in terms of which I think is better. The first time I tried reading through both of them I thought Joe Hughes' book was clearly superior. I am currently taking part in an independent study/reading group on Deleuze and have started reading through them again and this time around I am finding James Williams' book to be superior. Ultimately I think they both have strengths and they both have weaknesses. Neither one of them is perfect, but they complement each other fairly well so I recommend reading both of them. Anyone coming to Difference and Repetition for the first time is going to need all the help they can get.I will try to list some of the strengths and weaknesses of this book. A number of the reviewers have complained about Williams' tendency to bring in critiques from analytic philosophy as well as his tendency to throw in sometimes cryptic interjections throughout the text.I actually think that both of those \\"weaknesses\\" are strengths, at least in principle. In regard to his tendency to bring in critiques from analytic philosophy, I think it is often very difficult to understand a philosopher if you do not understand the reasons or arguments that underlie their positions. Simply listing a philosopher's positions on various subjects is usually not very helpful. Williams attempts to present the kinds of critiques he thinks analytic philosophers would make in regard to Deleuze's positions and then attempts to figure out how Deleuze might go about answering them. Again, this seems like a good tactic in principle, as a way of clarifying the nature of Deleuze's arguments. Unfortunately I do not think that Williams is always entirely successful in clarifying Deleuze's arguments. The major problem I had with Williams' execution of his plan is that he almost always puts off answering the questions he raises which forces the reader to \\"keep them in mind\\" as they await the answer. Ultimately the ability to hold onto questions and search for the answer is a skill that is necessary if you are going to study philosophy seriously; however, for an introductory text it seems to me to be asking too much of the reader. The first time reader of Difference and Repetition is going to be struggling simply to understand what is being said. In my opinion, requiring first time readers to hold onto questions (questions that they are unlikely to even understand on a first time through) and await the answers is too much to ask. Personally, I think it would have been better if Williams had either answered the questions as soon as he raised them, or waited to raise them until he was ready to give the answers.In regard to the interjections that Williams intersperses throughout the text, I think this was also a good idea in principle. It is often impossible for first time readers to understand highly abstract ideas without examples, and it amazes me how few philosophers offer concrete examples of their abstract ideas. It almost seems as if philosophers got together and decided as a group that providing examples was below their station and should be left to commentators. The interjections that Williams intersperses throughout the text are meant to be concrete illustrations of the abstract ideas he is discussing. On many occasions, I thought this really helped. Unfortunately, on many occasions I did not feel like Williams' interjections were successful in clarifying the text.Ultimately I think another reviewer hit it on the nose when they said that Williams offers hints. Anyone coming to this book hoping that Williams will make sense out of the whole of Difference and Repetition is going to be disappointed, and, to be fair, that is probably too much to ask of any commentary. I think what Williams does offer is what my Kant professor liked to call \\"islands of intelligibility\\". Williams will be able to make small patches of Difference and Repetition more intelligible for the reader but it is up to the reader to expand on those patches. Williams is also forced to leave out a great deal but that is simply due to the nature of the text. Difference and Repetition is an extremely rich text so any commentary is going to have to be selective in terms of what it includes and what it leaves out.So those are some of the strengths and weaknesses of the book. I think some of the weaknesses are balanced out by Joe Hughes' book so I recommend reading them together. There is also, apparently, another commentary on Difference and Repetition on the way by Henry Somers-Hall which I believe is supposed to be released sometime in 2012. So hopefully it will provide another angle from which to view this amazing and frustrating text. And finally, I cannot end my review without mentioning what I think is the best book on Deleuze in English:Difference and Givenness: Deleuze's Transcendental Empiricism and the Ontology of Immanence (Topics in Historical Philosophy)by Levi Bryant. If you only had time to read one book on Deleuze I think it should be Bryant's book. But hopefully you have more time to devote to Deleuze than that..."},{"Title":"Gilles Deleuze's","review":"This book is good. But, if you want something more complex, more historical, this is not the book you need. The quotes of other philosopher are zero.

Her Hungarian parents moved with the infant Mary from newly-formed Czechoslovakia to Trenton, New Jersey in 1921. While growing up she visited Uzhhorod with her mother a couple of times. On one of these visits she met her future husband and started a correspondence. She moved to Uzhhorod in 1938 on the eve of World War II to marry the Hungarian man she had fallen in love with. Mary had two children and lived through World War II, the Holocaust, the transfer of Uzhhorod to Soviet Ukraine and her husband's imprisonment in the Siberian Gulags. She is kept apart from her American family by Soviet bureaucracy until her mother is finally allowed to visit in 1962.The story of her life will give American readers a very accessible point of view on the history and society of the Soviet Union and western Ukraine. Her experiences as a single parent in a small regional capital in the Carpathian Mountains will be of interest to students of women's studies, Soviet history, and Ukrainian life.My parents are from a small town just outside Uzhhorod and I have visited the city four times. I found her story to reflect the charm and mystery of this remote corner of the world very accurately and completely."},{"Title":"The Loom and the Lash","review":"ms. fennessey was my fifth grade teacher. we put on the play the loom and the lash for black history month. there were songs and dancing it was a lot of fun and very educational too. ms. fennessey believes in putting drama in teaching, we would play park bench ect.

A brief explanation accompanies each major section. Focus is given to cultural, archeological and theological aspects of the book. Wiseman interacts with various scholars as he endeavors to be a faithful interpreter. The author stresses the importance of keeping God's law as it stands face to face before the kings, the leaders of God's people and the nation of Israel as a whole. Yahweh, the undefeated King is utterly sovereign, yet the responsibility of men is not undermined in the book. The unfaithfulness of the leaders, particularly the elected kings of both (northern: Israel and southern: Judah) kingdoms to God, his covenant, and his message through the prophets brings about fractions and ultimately division in the dynasty (kingdom). The role of the prophets as God's spokesmen is emphasized by the author. One of the strength of this work remains the author's interest in applying the message of the book to the Christian life. In other words, the message of the book of kings is relevant to the modern church and the people of God. ."},{"Title":"1 And 2 Kings: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"As the dean of a Christian college/seminary, we use this book as the textbook for one of our \\"Through the Bible\\" courses.

Learn How to Program Using Any Web Browser is written for absolute beginners to learn the basic principles of programming -- or at least that's what the cover would have you believe.The language is suitably light and simple, the book well-structured and broken down into easily digested chunks. The order in which concepts are introduced is fairly traditional for a language tutorial: first we get types, variables and statements, before moving on to conditionals, loops, and functions, followed by arrays and objects before finishing with event-driven programming. Davis' decision to leave string handling till last seems a little perverse and personally I would have introduced functions earlier.My real complaints about this book centre on the abstract nature of the discussion. There are very few real world examples that could be useful to anyone. The best you get is a version of \\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\\" in Chapter 3, and an 'auction' application. The book would have been improved dramatically if the end result of your study was a few things you could actually point to.I also have a complaint about the target audience for this book. The web page for the book at the publishers states that \\"The target reader is likely a twelve- or thirteen-year-old, who is just starting to get curious about what makes a computer work -- or an office worker who has been using computer applications for years, and would like to spend some time delving deeper into what makes them tick.\\" Most adults and even teenagers don't want to 'learn how to program' as much as they want to learn how to use a tool to perform a task. If your tool is JavaScript, then it's almost certain your task is related to building web pages, but this gets little real attention from Davis. For even younger students, this book totally lacks anything to hold their attention -- the lack of real-world examples hurts here.I also take issue with the title: this book doesn't really teach 'programming' much at all. It certainly teaches you to write JavaScript, but where are the sections about the real lessons of programming, such as top-down vs. bottom-up design, or breaking a task up into chunks? Even debugging has little coverage -- a single thirty-page chapter, half of which is specific to JavaScript or the throwing and handling of exceptions. Since the work of Papert and others at MIT twenty-five years ago, we've learned a great deal about how to teach programming concepts in a simple manner, but Davis appears to have ignored all this and given us a language tutorial. The publisher's web page for the book says \\"very emphatically, this is not a book about programming JavaScript.\\" If that's so then I'd argue that it isn't a book about learning the principles of programming either.It is obvious from this book that Davis is an excellent writer; if he had tried to write a book to teach JavaScript and had focused on the tasks for which it is often used this, volume may have been superb. As it is, he has shot for a higher goal and fallen far too short.If you would like to check it out for yourself, you can go to the web page for the book where there is sample chapter, the Table of Contents (though they call it a \\"Detailed TOC\\" as distinct from the 'Table of Contents,' which is just a list of 11 chapter titles) and index, all in PDF format.I went looking for a book that I could give to my 11-year-old daughter now that she has become interested in \\"what Daddy does.\\" I'm still looking, I'm certain that this one isn't it."},{"Title":"Learn How to Program Using Any Web Browser","review":"Davis has chosen a novel approach to teaching programming to a novice. This book merely assumes that you have access to a browser on your computer. It doesn't even need Internet access, though that doesn't hurt. Davis shows how by editing simple text files, you can cobble together HTML pages and JavaScript code within those pages. You are taught JavaScript. It has many of the features of any langugage. Conditional expressions, loops, etc.He has produced a nice, minimalist approach. An experienced programmer might quibble about the limitations of JavaScript. But what the heck. If you are new at programming, you'll easily learn all the key ideas here. Plus, you'll pick up some useful knowledge of HTML along the way. Given the ubiquity of the Web, knowing both HTML and JavaScript can be quite useful, jobwise.Also, you can compare the differences in coding HTML and JavaScript. The former is declarative, the latter procedural. Davis doesn't seem to go into this, but his approach lets you learn both styles."},{"Title":"Learn How to Program Using Any Web Browser","review":"I always glance at Programming books when in the computer section. When I saw Harold Davis' book what struck me was the title's ending \\"...using any Web Browser\\". Any book on programming must decide on SOME computer language.

This book is easily readable and combines only needed information for tasks at hand.I have not yet completed the book, but already I can see that Mr. Davis has used solid programming techniques.

From the standpoint of anyone involved in Organizational Behavior/Organizational Development, from manager, practitioner, academic, consultant or team member, this book provides many useful insights and has the feel of actual fieldwork used in its writing. The book is laid out in such a manner that it can be applied in any given situation. The ten guiding principles are structured and repeated in various collaborative work settings consistently. This allows the reader to apply the principles in their unique setting. The ten guiding principles are then explained for each general situation with a short description given for when the principles are not working and, more importantly, when they are working. Too often in this field books are written from a purely academic viewpoint or &quot;this is how you fix it\\" approach. This book is different in that you can sense the fieldwork in the research and you see how things are supposed to work as well as when they are not working. This gives the reader the option of working on a group's deficiencies while complementing their achievements. This book is a \\"must have\\" for anyone interested in improving team communications."},{"Title":"Beyond Teams: Building the Collaborative Organization","review":"This is a wonderful book and a must have for anyone looking to strengthen their organization.

It appears that Father Romero had this idea in mind when writing his book. He takes a number of the primary complaints, disagreements, or falsifications of the faith from Protestants, divides them into chapters, and then answers each one with solid Biblical references. He also educates the reader on the proper translation of certain words that seem to be problematic for those outside of the Catholic faith. At the end of each chapter, he lists writings of the early Church fathers to show how the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for two thousand years. Also at the end of each chapter are endnotes (some of which take up almost as much space as their respective chapters).The topics covered range from Mary to Purgatory to \\"statue worship.\\" He also defends transubstantiation, which always gets my friends of other faiths riled up. He covers marriage annulments, which do not always get a lot of attention from apologists.All of this is done in a very straight-forward, plain talking manner that is neither offensive to Protestants nor is it egotistical sounding. I've come across a few apologists who are very headstrong with their defense of the faith which, while not necessarily wrong, might turn off Protestants from studying further. Father Romero's writing style is more like a \\"sit down over a cup of coffee\\" than an out-and-out religious debate.I highly recommend this book. It's an enjoyable read that won't weigh you down with a lot of philosophical jargon or lose you with lots of \\"big words.\\" I also recommend a number of the books that Father Romero uses as references, particularly the Karl Keating and Scott Hahn books. Another excellent apologetic is \\"Why Do Catholics Do That?\\" by Kevin Orlin Johnson. His writing style is very much like Father Romero's, with a little more humor spread throughout his book.

Protestants may be quite surprised to learn the background and history of Catholic worship styles and customs, it is not necessarily what their pastors have taught them. Catholicism is NOT anything near the so-called &quot;pagan religion&quot; that some Protestant pastors/teachers say it is. Far from it. Catholics that want a solid support against the New Age/Liberalist/Revisonist trends that are scandalizing the faithful will find this book very refreshing. Father Romero has done a great service to both Protestants and Catholics with this book. I will recommend it to all my Christian friends, both Catholics and Protestants."},{"Title":"Unabridged Christianity: Biblical Answers to Common Questions About the Roman Catholic Faith","review":"This book is a very practical guide to what Catholics believe. It is written is practical style, setting forth in each chapter a basic tenant of Catholic faith, followed by a series of Protestant objections and Catholic Responses to each objection. This format makes the book easy to follow and a great source for quick research or for group study discussions. As a protestant, I am trying to educate myself on what Catholics genuinely believe, and I've concluded that the best source for that information is not from Protestant critics but from those who are themselves Catholic. The author, a Catholic priest whose ministry emphasizes teaching about what it means to be Catholic, quotes from much Scripture in this book and provides citations and footnotes to numerous Church documents to support the points made.For purposes of gaining a better understanding of what the Catholic Church teaches, I highly recommend this book. It is also beneficial for developing a mutual sharing of faith between Protestants and Catholics so that each can better understand what they have in common as well as their actual differences. From that point, a more meaningful, productive and spiritual conversation may follow."},{"Title":"Unabridged Christianity: Biblical Answers to Common Questions About the Roman Catholic Faith","review":"If you're a Catholic you MUST own this book and read it so that you can defend your faith.

Why should I assume that the Catholic Church is wrong without looking into the matter myself?\\" It's been my experience that most people don't really know what they believe or why they believe it, much less what or why anyone else believes. If you are an \\"Anti-Catholic\\" protestant who thinks that the Roman Catholic Church is the [..] of Babylon' then, with all due respect, PARK YOUR PRIDE, remove the chip from your shoulder, get comfy and open your mind and heart and read this book.

In Omoo, however, Melville shores up his powers of characterization, creating a fine supporting cast of individuals.If you are only familiar with Melville's later work, you will be surprised by the wry sense of humor Melville flashes throughout. Detailed descriptions of practical jokes, drunken brawls, and cultural faux-pas will make you smile, and sometimes laugh out loud. Certain passages are actually a riot!Also, in this novel (as compared to Typee), Melville's intrusions into the narrative are less glaring than they are in the previous novel. Yes, some of the diversions take the steam out of the narrative, as in Typee, but these diversions oftentimes give necessary exposition to illuminate characters' motivations.The beginning of the novel effectively captures the claustrophobic atmosphere aboard a whaling ship, and the crew are indeed a motley lot.Though you do not have to read Typee before you read Omoo (although the first page of Omoo is, literally, a continuation of the last page of Typee), I recommend you read both in conjunction. Be prepared to absorb a beautifully rendered atmosphere, describing the life of two roving beachcombers in the South Pacific in the early 19th century."},{"Title":"Omoo: A narrative of adventures in the South Seas (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"I am approaching the writer Melville with little prior knowledge about the man Melville. Apart from the Whale, read 30 years ago, I knew only Typee before taking up Omoo. Omoo is of course a sequel to Typee. While Typee's core theme is the narrator's life in captivity among an intact tribe of 'savages' in the Marquesas, Omoo continues his adventures as an island hopper, a sailor involved in a mutiny, a jailbird, a farm worker...All is told with a light hand, in short chapters. Interspersed are thoughts about colonialism and missionaries and about the fate of the native population of the islands. There is lots of ethnology on mainly two exotic tribes: the population of the whaling ships, and the people who live on Tahiti. The attacks on the missionaries seem to have been toned down a bit in view of criticisms at home. The sequel was less well received than the first book.What strikes me as curious about Omoo is the extent to which the author hides behind a mocking and sometimes self-ironic tone. He is not much given to reflections about himself, or at least not to sharing those with us. What do we conclude about the character of the hero? Obviously he has some problems integrating in his various social environments. He is always the outsider. He runs from his first ship, is an exotic guest in Typee, runs away, joins half-heartedly in a mutiny on his second ship, stays apart from the jail crowd and 'walks away' from prison, doesn't like the work on the potato farm, escapes from some unclear danger in the next village... Would one extrapolate so far, does it seem likely that he will succeed in settling down to any longer term project? He seems unsteady and shallow, aloof without much depth to offer. The story itself is fairly simple, the author does not appear to have a message above the adventure narration and a few rather superficial thoughts on the evils of civilization. In other words, one hopes he will grow up some time. Let's see."},{"Title":"Omoo: A narrative of adventures in the South Seas (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"The word that keeps coming to mind as I think about this book is \\"charming\\". Melville was in a good mood when he wrote \\"Omoo\\", no doubt enjoyed looking back on a very pleasurable period of his still-young life. While it is true that \\"Omoo\\" wasn't nearly as successful as \\"Typee\\" had been, it is still an impressive work for a young man in his mid-twenties.I enjoyed his portraits of the people he meets, and especially of his doctor friend, \\"Long Ghost\\". His descriptions of Polynesian life and the historical context are quite interesting. And it's funny: Melville had very good sense of humor, displays it throughout \\"Omoo\\".While the book is mainly a picaresque story of adventure, recounting the details of daily life in an exotic setting, and is a much happier book than \\"Typee\\", there are a few scenes that preview Melville's later narrative power. Here is the \\"Julia\\" in a tropical Pacific gale:\\"Under such a press of canvas, and with the heavy sea running, the barque, diving her bows under, now and then shipped green glassy waves, which, breaking over the head-rails, fairly deluged that part of the the ship, and washed clear aft.\\"And here is a glimpse of the brooding quality of his later work:\\"But my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray, spectral shadow cast over the heaving billows. It was the dawn, soon followed by the first rays of the morning. They flashed into view at one end of the arched night, like - to compare great things with small - the gleamings of Guy Fawkes's lantern in the vaults of the Parliament House. Before long, what seemed a live ember rested for a moment on the rim of the ocean, and at last the blood-red sun stood full and round in the level East, and the long sea-day began.\\"But these are very isolated examples. By and large, \\"Omoo\\" is a great contrast with Melville's other books. It is a light, easy, and amusing read. Highly recommended for Melville fans.Helpful critical works on Melville:Newton Arvin - \\"Herman Melville\\"D.H. Lawrence -\\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\".F.O. Matthiessen - \\"American Renaissance\\"Note: This particular edition is from the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of Melville's works, and is an MLA Approved Text. As such, it is authoritative, but it lacks an explanatory introduction, which may be a slight drawback."},{"Title":"Omoo: A narrative of adventures in the South Seas (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"As Melville stated himself, Omoo is only a sequel to Typee in that it follows the events that occur to the narrator after his experience with the Typee people from his first book. Only referred to once by his nickname Typee, the otherwise unnamed narrator agrees to temporary employment on the whaling ship Julia but finds himself in the middle of a crew that is dominated by a first mate while the captain has abdicated his responsibility and retreated into his infirmity. Upon the rejection of appeals to the local British consul to be exempt from active duty due to their own infirmity and the insistence of the mate that they get back to work, the narrator joins a group of mutineers that are taken ashore at Tahiti and confined to a makeshift jail from which escape is absurdly easy.Along with his fellow escapee and roving companion Doctor Long Ghost, the narrator proceeds to wander among the islands, seeking nominal employment only when it requires little effort and changing plan and direction upon momentary impulse. The two wanderers work for a pair of Australian and British planters briefly, then hear of other Westerners obtaining respectable employment as translators/private secretaries to chiefs of some of the clans and consider that that prospect might be enjoyable as well as respectable. As soon as they settle on one occupation they discard the idea in favor of something more appealing.The book takes on the rambling, episodic shape of their wanderings and lacks the cohesive narrative arc of Typee. In that book a thread of tension inherent in fear of the narrator that his benevolent captivity masked the true intentions of his cannibalistic captors of preparing him for a nice, hearty meal. In Omoo there is no realistic sense of danger. The rovers roam freely, escape captivity easily and possess an ease of mobility that the character in the first book never attained. This book is a loose narrative that merely serves the purpose of providing a framework in which Melville can describe the local culture, including brief explanations of dress, history, lifestyle, industry and so on.The most riveting portion of the book occurs early, with the description of the whaler and its crew. Notably, Melville's experience on a whaler such as the Julia not only enabled him to describe a whaling ship with verisimilitude but also provided him with the setting for Moby-Dick. The Julia and its crew is a greatly inferior forerunner of the more vividly realized Pequod and its array of memorable characters. No real whaling is described in Omoo and the conditions that precipitate the mutiny and subsequent Tahitian adventures are never sufficiently conveyed. The mate John Jermin is a weak predecessor of Captain Ahab.Omoo is intermittently interesting and the depiction of the native life varies in the extent to which it is successful. After reading the facts of Melville's experience from which he derived the narrative, I can see that he indulged in a great deal of fictional invention, conflating events and creating composite characters. What he failed to do was to create a compelling story. I would recommend the book only to readers who, like me, are curious about the books that Melville wrote before Moby-Dick changed the course of his career and secured his position in world literature."},{"Title":"Omoo: A narrative of adventures in the South Seas (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"This book can be read on its own even though it is the sequel to TYPEE. There are 82 short chapters that cover life on a whaler and various experiences on the island of Tahiti as well as surrounding islands. We get a feel for life on a whaler and for life on the islands and how foreigners, especially missionaries, influenced the natives for the worse.Omoo means a rover or one who wanders from island to island. Thus the title fits the feel of the narrative, but also points out a shortcoming as the book roves too much. We are taken from situation to situation a bit too abruptly. There are many characters and events that are introduced, but usually only on a superficial level. I would have liked more in-depth analysis from Melville as many of the characters were just that--characters. Also there are many, for me, unknown nautical terms used that made the reading hard work.However, enough of the stories give you the sense of being &quot;omoo&quot;, especially in a time vastly different from our own, that I recommend the book, even with the many sections that make you plod."},{"Title":"Paris in the Terror: June 1793-July 1794","review":"Most books on the \\"Great Terror\\" are page after page of dry text. This book takes you onto the streets of Paris and into the mind of Danton, Marat, Corday and all the other players, describing no only their actions but also their history and the events that made them who they became.Do not make the mistake of starting the final two chapters leading to 9 Thermidor (24 July) late in the evening. If you do, there is a good chance you will be up all night. In particular, the character, actions and plain bravery of Joseph Fouche, the greatest survivor in history, will leave you in awe. I recommend that while you read you have an interactive map at hand so you can walk the dense center of Paris with the actual participants.Greatest tragedy of all is that shortly after the book was published the author, Stanley Loomis, was killed while walking across the street and hit by a car. Irony is that it was a Paris street."},{"Title":"Paris in the Terror: June 1793-July 1794","review":"I'm not a scholar, I'm a computer programmer who likes to read history. As a relative layman, I found this to be one of the most gripping history books I've ever read. It's relentless focus on the personal aspects of these men's lives makes this book read more like a novel than a history.It is certainly not an impartial view of the era, but it does not claim to be. This liberates the author to portray some of the characters like the Batman-villains they were, and makes for an emotional and engrossing read."},{"Title":"Paris in the Terror: June 1793-July 1794","review":"The first half of Stanley Loomis' PARIS IN THE TERROR relates the life of Charlotte Corday and the reasons behind her quest to end the reign of the sickly mass murderer, the sociopath, Marat. This part of the book is extremely welcomed because I've found no other book that recounts, so completely, the life of Charlotte Corday. There are few books, too, that describe, so well, the miserable existence of Marat. Loomis goes on to recount the welcome end of both Danton and Robespierre. Although Loomis covers these last two men well, the definitive books on both are FATAL PURITY, ROBESPIERRE AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION by Ruth Scurr and DANTON by David Lawday, both essential works. Before the terror, in 1793, a Girondin stated before the National Convention, \`I foresee civil war set afire in my country, spreading its ravages everywhere and tearing France apart. I see the monster Dictatorship advancing over piles of ruins and corpses.' The France that these three psychopaths destroyed was, says Loomis, a land \`of pleasure. The theatres were cheap and many. They were also of the highest degree of excellence. There were many fairs or public festivals that one could attend free of charge. Nor were the working classes all starving. Their gastronomic standards appear, in fact, to be higher than today's. Caf&eacute;s of every conceivable political or artistic complexion were plentiful, and in them a considerable part of most men's day was spent in idle and animated conversation.' Loomis' writing style is highly avuncular, one that enwraps the reader in a warm, extremely comfortable embrace. It also gives the personal histories of those who confronted the guillotine--totally heartrending accounts of misery and bravery, like the story of the mother--condemned to die--who faints when she sees that her 16-year-old-son is in another group of condemned. Thanks to her fainting she is given a stay of a couple of days, during which Robespierre is himself beheaded. She is thusly saved, although her boy faces death: 'Look' he says to the executioner, holding out his hand, 'I'm not even shaking!'

An old Chinese Communist leader, Zhou Enlai, was asked by a reporter to sum up the important lessons of the French Revolution. In reply he answered that it was too early to tell what those lessons might be. Whether that particular story is true or not it does contain one important truth. Militants today at the beginning of the 21st century can still profit from reading the history of that revolution.Although the revolution began in 1789 its decisive phases did not take place until the period under discussion in this review, that is from June 1793 with the expulsion of the (for that time moderate) Gironde deputies from the National Convention. That event ushered in the rule of extreme Jacobins under Robespierre and Saint Just through the vehicle of the Committee of Public Safety. That regime, the Republic of Virtue, as it is known to militants since that time and known as the Great Terror to the author of the book under review and countless others, lasted until July 1794. It was in turn ousted by a more moderate Jacobin regime (known historically as the Themidorian Reaction, a subject of fascination and discussion by militants, especially the Bolsheviks, ever since).Mr. Loomis takes great pains to disassociate himself not just from the excesses of the period (the executions) but seemingly the whole notion of democratic revolution at that time. He essentially has a position in favor of a constitutional monarchy, and let the revolution stop there. In short a regime run by a Lafayette-type, but with brains. Great revolutions, however, do not go halfway despite the best laid plans of humankind. That said, why would militants read this book which paints everyone to the left of the most moderate Girondists as some kind of monster or at least an accomplice?If militants only read pro-revolutionary tracts then they are missing an important part of their education- the fight against patented bourgeois mystification of events. The terror in Paris is a question that needs to be dealt with while defending the members of the Committee of Public Safety as they attempted to defend France against counterrevolutionary Europe and also promulgated some kind of social democracy to maintain their base among the sans-culottes.That said, every place Mr. Loomis places a minus we do not necessarily place a plus. We need to do our own sifting out of the revolutionaries from the pretenders. Mlle. Corday by all accounts was a royalist at heart before she murdered Marat. Marat was by all accounts a fanatic. You cannot, however, make a revolution without theses Marat types. A combat-type revolutionary party, if such a party existed in Paris at the time which this writer does not believe did exist, would rein a Marat in.Danton still seen to me an equivocal character who wanted to stop the revolution at the threshold of his house, literally. A Danton-Robespierre political bloc could have carried the revolution over some tough spots. That was not to be. The fault lies in the personality of Robespierre, more so than Danton. Moreover, the execution of the leading Hebertists was a serious mistake, as it weakened the Committee's base of support among the sans-culottes.Robespierre and Saint Just are portrayed here as little more than monsters. But without those two figures the contours of the revolution would have been different, if it had survived the Coalition forces at all. The question of the defense of the revolution takes short shrift in Mr. Loomis's account. That is the book's abiding failure. Robespierre headed the key administrative component of that defense. Saint Just was as instrumental in the military aspect of that defense. One can rightly ask, with the possible exception of Carnot, who else could have organized that defense? One should moreover note that a revolution brings to the fore all kinds of personalities- it however, can never to reduced solely to that element. Thus, militants should look elsewhere in order to find more ammunition in defense of Robespierre and Saint Just from the charges levelled at them in this book. Apparently to the author of this book and others they are in desperate need of defending. Nevertheless, they are worthy of honor in any militant's pantheon. Enough said."},{"Title":"Paris in the Terror: June 1793-July 1794","review":"Paris In The Terror, June 1793 - July 1974, Stanley Loomis; J.P.

Lola Schnabel is one such artist. And she exposes her art in &quot;Remember Me,&quot; revealing a scratchy collage of mind-bending photos and paintings. Warning: contents may take a bit of time to digest, but they're worth it.Schnabel's drawings/paintings are vivid and sharp. Sometimes they're just pencil drawings, minimalistand deliberately smudged in places. Others have thin layers of bright paint on them. Her photographs are quite different -- much softer and blurrier, as if seen through a thick window. They seem much more distant and grounded.Schnabel (who had a role in the movie &quot;Basquiat&quot;) doesn't waste time trying to lure in viewers. Her work is just there, and it has no pretenses. Her work has a rough, exhilarating quality, like a an urban crazy quilt. As an added bonus, Rene Picard wrote an essay to accompany &quot;Remember Me.&quot; It serves as a good counterpoint to the artwork, as Picard spins up some poetic prose about Schnabel's art and persona.Schnabel's work is full of light and color. Specifically, her photos have light and her paintings/drawings have color. Splashes of vivid color spread over her drawings and paintings -- sometimes stylized, sometimes just accentuating the rough pencilwork. And her photographs are simply lovely -- horses in the woods, friends and family, graveyards.Beautiful and vivid, budding artist Lola Schnabel's work is like a pile of rough diamonds -- unpolished but still precious. The title is a pretty fortunate one -- &quot;Remember Me&quot; shouldn't be forgotten."},{"Title":"100 Ways to Disappear and Live Free","review":"Dunno where there were 100 ways, I found this as an ebook somewhere, and it was pretty much one way they mentioned.

In which case, only the latter part is valid, and there's a bunch of advice in here that isn't valid.Also, by the end of the advice on how to disappear, you aren't really living free. You're living in fear, being very cautious of neighbors.

Every bit as suspenseful as REBECCA but with a more engaging heroine, it kept me on the edge of my seat almost from the beginning.Mary Yellan's mother dies, leaving her alone with a farm and no one to help her run it. (Apparently, in 19th century England, it was unthinkable that a 23-year-old woman should simply hire some help and keep the farm.) She sells up and goes to live in a distant county with an aunt she hasn't seen for ten years, but whom she remembers as pretty and vivacious. The aunt Patience she finds, however, is much changed. Now married to an abusive, drunken tyrant, Patience has relinquished her former self and become a cringing, wheedling shadow to her brutal husband. The couple reside at Jamaica Inn, an infamous establishment that respectable travelers have long abandoned.The situation deteriorates further when inquisitive Mary discovers her uncle is involved in illegal dealings that include murder. Horrified, she stays at Jamaica Inn only for the sake of her aunt, whom she intends to rescue. She's befriended by the sympathetic vicar of a neighboring parish, and by her uncle's handsome brother, Jem, to whom she feels oddly drawn, despite his questionable livelihood as a horse thief.In true Gothic style, the story hovers on the edges of believability. It doesn't pay to think too much on any one point. Mary displays the obligatory intelligence, pluck and curiosity of the gothic heroine, yet loses her courage and/or her smarts at just the points where her hesitation advances the plot. The villains of the story are pure evil without clear motivations. Jem is the most realistically drawn character.But they don't write like Daphne DuMaurier anymore. Her richly descriptive style sets you squarely down in the midst of the Cornish moors, makes you see the stark granite rocks, feel the heavy air closing around you. Her pacing is nearly perfect, dragging only in one or two spots where I think she falters in her effort to prolong suspense. The story moves along so briskly that you're almost hypnotized into not noticing the plot's weaknesses. It certainly isn't hard to shuffle them to the back of your mind.JAMAICA INN is well worth the read, especially if you're feeling a bit weary of \\"flavor-of-the-month\\" fiction. In particular, I found Ms. DuMaurier's portrayal of the local squire as a kind-hearted, blustering dullard interesting. I wonder if that was a reflection of current (1936) British attitudes toward the gentry. In a similar vein, the vicar's thoughts on religion must have been provocative at the time."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Excuse me miss 17-year-old from the Netherlands but you just gave away the entire plot of the book.

Kelsana 6/4/02"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"In \\"Myself When Young\\", author Daphne DuMaurier tells of a riding expedition on Bodmin Moors where lost and tired, she put up at a local hostelry called Jamaica Inn. \\"It was my first sight of the place that would later grip my imagination . . . a temperance house in 1920, it had been a coaching stop in the old days, and I thought of the travelers in the past who must have sought shelter there on the wild November nights, watched by the local moorland folk. No temperance house then, but a bar where the little parlor was, the drinking deep and long, fights breaking out, the sounds of oaths, of men falling.\\"And grip her imagination it did!Du Maurier brings to life all the sounds and sights she imagined she saw on that day at a wayside inn with so much history. The lonely local, the brooding weather, the harsh tors looming over the moors and the bog, all make for what is now the almost trite accoutrements to any Gothic melodrama. But in Du Maurier's expert hands and imagination, the story that evolves could never be thought hackneyed.Mary Yellen, a staunch working class young lady must leave her beloved farm on southern coast of Cornwall for the bleaker northern side. Here she will live at lonely Jamaica Inn with her mother's sister Patience and her innkeeper husband, Joss Merlyn. When she arrives, Mary, who prides herself on her good sense, intrinsic goodness and her willingness to work, finds her situation at the inn in dire opposition to anything in which she believes. Her heart breaks when she discovers her aunt has become a shadow of her once frivilous self, broken by the drunken Josh and his rude occupation. Mary's dream of travelers stopping at the inn and taking the usual friendly custom aburptly dissipates when she realizes the inn is no longer in use, but like her aunt, is just a shell of what it once was. Most distressing of all, she concludes that Joss's business is a treacherous and nefarious one which instead of commanding the respect of the local villagers and townspeople, causes them to turn away in helpless fear and disgust. Her guilt by association follows quite naturally and Mary vacillates between what she knows is right and her love of her childlike aunt. In her mind, her future spins out before her, likely to trail in the wake of her aunt's disastrous path.The light of hope shines in the appearance of the landlord's brother, Jem. A much younger man than Joss, but similar in looks, Mary can well imagine what had enticed her aunt so many years ago. In spite of herself, she finds she has feelings for Jem that she must put aside as she comes to terms with what she must do for her aunt and her community. Like Du Maurier's other female heroines, Mary eventually succumbs to the world of men; she is dependent, knows it and comes to terms with her lot only by accepting her fate.The story is told in the third person; we eventually discover the secret of Jamaica Inn as Mary does. On all levels, the story and its telling are superior to other books of this genre. Often dismissed as a romantic escape, the novel is nothing of the sort---it rather depicts the marital relationship and other man/woman situations with a violence that is disturbing. Mary does not find romance, she accepts that Jem is no better than another strong male. Another aspect of Du Maurier's fanatastic Cornwall comes alive as it did in her other novels, Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel and The House of the Strand. As a backup to the book, rent the Jane Seymour mini-series of the same name. The film representation doesn't really do justice to the literature or theme of Jamaica Inn, it relies instead on the brooding atmosphere and desperation of the heroine's plight rather than the true horror of the man/woman relationships.I have read this book many times, but I find the best way to enjoy it is on unabridged audio--acted by a trained reader brings the words alive and forces you to listen (instead of skipping over) to the passages describing the moors."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Even if it is not as good as Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel, or The Scapegoat (but better than the House on the Strand), it is still a page turner, vivid and descriptive and, in the best DuMaurier tradition, very very dark. That said, my rating would actually be closer to 3 1/2 stars.Mary Yellan is an appealingly scrappy heroine, if somewhat prone to foolhardy actions. I liked that she had guts and that she could be honest about her feelings about a man she had no business loving. Another plus for this book: I bought her falling in love with the roguish horse thief Jem Merlyn. I myself found him sexy (wish there had been more of him in the book). Their chemistry was a nice reflection of the less benign pairing of Mary's poor Aunt Patience and the brutish Joss Merlyn. Perhaps my favorite line because it spoke volumes in few words is &quot;Now Mary understood why she hated her uncle.&quot; Or something to that effect.DuMaurier goes a little overboard in the description of the moor and the tors, although I admit it is necessary to establish the setting. A big reason I do love DuMaurier books is the strong sense of place and time. I suppose that this particular setting was not as interesting as - say - the estate in Rebecca. I knew so because my eye would dart down the page and the next for quotation marks in the hopes that a conversation would break up the lengthy descriptions.In short one could do a lot worse than this book in the general realm of fiction but as far as DuMaurier fiction is concerned, one could do somewhat better."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"The poetic language and tasteful suspense makes Jamaica Inn and Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier two of my favorite books. Jamaica Inn is a brilliant story, made even more mysterious by Tori Amos' song of the same name. It was her song about the book that made me seek out books by DuMaurier and once again Tori is genius. This was one of the best books I have ever read. Both the book and the song reveal the complexities and horrors of human behavior. DuMaurier also has a rich knowledge of the English countryside and uses fantastic imagery to transport the reader to the moors of Southern England."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"As this story opens, Mary Yellan's mother dies leaving this young adult on her own in a dangerous time. On her deathbed her mother tells her to go live with her Aunt Patience at an inn called Jamaica Inn near the Cornish coast (Corwall, England). Immediately upon arrival at Jamaica Inn she knows something is wrong since her once colorful Aunt Patience has turned into a simpering wimp and her Uncle Joss Merlyn is a towering cruel character with dubious past and present. Soon Mary learns about criminal activities surrounding Jamaica Inn and it's inhabitants. She is drawn into a mystery so intense and frightening that she'll brave the trecherous moors to escape.This is one Daphne Du Maurier's best books. Don't miss this tale of twisted greed and terrible peril -- this is an EXCELLENT book that'll keep you up past your bedtime as you won't be able to put this book down! Buy it! This book earned itself a permanent place on my shelf!"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"When I decided to read Jamaica Inn, it was through sheer boredom on a rainy afternoon - what perfect weather it turned out to be to read about the dark happenings in cold, windy Cornwall! It is centred around the terrifying and surprising discoveries Mary Yellan, recently orphaned, makes about the goings on at her new home, Jamaica Inn. This book will leaves you constantly surprised, guessing and re-guessing the benevolence of its characters at every turn and makes for an enjoyable tale of mystery and suspense."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I read this book because someone told me at one of my book signings that Jamaica Inn was the most frightening book she ever read. After reading for several hours right before bed, I awakened terrified, in a cold sweat. Since then, I have studied Du Maurier's style and it is masterful. She has the ability to make the main character feel so real, you imagine you are walking in her shoes. Long after putting the book down, the characters remain with you, as does Jamaica Inn itself and the surrounding countryside. Her books have influenced my own writing. It is a shame that during her lifetime, her books were seen as romance, the pinings of a woman... This is suspense at its very best."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This author has written many books set in Cornwall, the south west corner of England. As with her other successful novels, Jamaica Inn captures the environment at that time of secrets and smuggling as well as evoking the beauty of the Cornish landscape."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I had no experience with Daphne DuMaurier before this book. She was mentioned in a previous novel I read by another author, and I thought her worth a try.I am so glad I picked up this book! While it does not have quite the suspense of Sherlock Holmes (my very favorite detective) it does have plenty of its own kind. I love to solve a mystery and this book left me guessing right up to the end!The romance in the book is not overdone or risque, making this a perfect read for someone more conservative, as well. The characters are well developed, believable, and interesting. I did not want to put it down! I brought it on vacation with me as an \\"outdoor only\\" book (so I would not lose or damage my kindle) and I ended up sitting in my room finishing it because I just couldn't stop! I definitely recommend this read. I would put her in the realm of authors such as Susanna Kearsley or Ciji Ware. Worth a look :)"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I just re-read this book after a decade, and if anything, I enjoyed it more the second time around. There's no denying the story has flaws, particularly the constant references to the weakness of women and the ending, but it's positive points outweigh the negative for me. It's one of the best gothic novels ever written.For starters there is the creepy run-down inn located on the lonely moors and inhabited by the violent, murderous Joss Merlyn and his downtrodden wife, Patience. Into this world comes Mary Yellan, a young woman with no other family in the world who has led a very sheltered life with her mother up to this point. She is immediately appalled by house and it's landlord, and only her loyaltly to her aunt Patience compells her to stay. When the true horror of Joss Merlyn's illegal activities become known to her Mary has to decide what to do. Into this mix is thrown Jem, the landlord's horse-thieving brother who also manages to steal Mary's heart, and the ambiguous albino vicar of Altarnun.The landscape plays a prominent part in the story and the descriptions of the moors are beautiful and haunting. Like all great gothic novels, the erotic tensions simmer just below the surface. My interpretation might be controversial but I believe it is obvious from the start that Mary is sexually attracted to the brooding Joss Merlyn even though she tells herself she despises him. Her attraction is evident right after she meets him when she notices that his hands are capable of both extreme violence and gracefulness, and she is unsettled by this. She constantly sees him reflected in his brother Jem, and there is one scene towards the end, where he runs his finger across her cheek and tells her if he was younger he would have courted her and riden away with her to glory.\\"She went then to her bed and sat upon it, her hands in her lap; and for some reason forever unexplained, thrust away from her later and forgotten, side by side with the little old sins of childhood and those dreams never acknowledged to the sturdy day, she put her finger to her lips as he had done, and let them stray thence to her cheek and back again.\\"Jem is a less dangerous version of Joss, but he hasn't been completely tamed and still has some of the wildness in him that excites and frightens her. The vicar on the other hand is bloodless and without passion. Mary takes off her wet clothes and strips down to almost nothing in the carriage with him and he barely seems to notice, although she becomes self-conscious of his close presence and she fears he is going to attack her when they are alone on the moors at the end.Throughout the book there's a constant threat of sexual violence against Mary from both Joss and the drunken men at the inn. She struggles to contain her desire for Jem, much more consciously than older gothic heroines. I found it interesting that all of the terrible events that unfold on Christmas eve happen because she refuses to spend the night in Launceston with Jem. She even makes this connection herself. Usually women are punished for following their desires, but in this case it seems she is punished for not doing what she really wants to do.I know some people don't like the end because it seems completely out of character for Mary to suddenly just change her mind about returning to Helford and jump in the wagon with Jem, but it seems to me she has finally decided to throw caution to the wind and do what she wants to do. That means turning her back on the respectable world represented by the Bassats and the good folk of Helford for a life of adventure on the road"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Jamaica Inn is a great book that is full of surprizes and twists and turns. Very suspenseful and a classic. Mary Yellan is a fantastic character full of adventure, you will feel adventurous yourself. A great book that kept me up late at night and deprived me of sleep, but this book is totally worth it.This is the second Daphne DuMaurier book I have read. It is only my least favorite of the two because the other book was Rebecca, my favorite book of all time. Daphne DuMaurier is my favorite author.P.S. I am a freshman in highschool. My mom got me to read Rebecca and I loved it so much that had to read another, Jamaica Inn was a great book and I recomend it to all women ages 14+, a man wouldn't understand."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Enjoyed the book immensely. Daphne DuMaurier's descriptions are supberbly detailed so one feels they are present in the area and amongst the characters."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Actually a 3.75 for me. I wasn't completely enchanted with the goings on of Jamaica Inn.Although this was not Ms. Du Marnier's most famous work it should not be over looked. It has held up surprisingly well for a story written in 1936. By today's standards it is wordy and over-descriptive leaving the readers mind to wander. It was a also bit jarring to keep seeing the characters first and surnames being utilized. It was another minor note that became annoying as it went on. Again differences in acceptable writing styles have occurred since this book was written.Regarding the story itself, the synopsis is designed to not provide a lot of information about what the story holds and I actually liked that - it added to the mystery of the piece. The pacing of the plot was designed to increase the tension of the moment and it did - very well. The characters were drawn vividly enough so they had definable personalities and possibly my modern brain kept bumping into the stupidity of some character actions - they were quite visual. Some of these characters could actually serve as the prototype for famous clich&eacute;s such as the drunken landlord, the albino priest, the drab & fearful wife, the boggy moor. This is a multi-layered story covering quite a few dark crimes people commit that fans of historical literature shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Another great book by De Maurier. She leads you through the hardships of Mary that her Uncle Josh puts her through to the love of his brother. The horror of Josh's business and the insanity of her Aunt. Another book you can't put down."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Watch out for a five-star review entitled \\"A beautiful story\\" by Iman, a young woman from the Netherlands. The review gives away a major plot point. Do not read this review if you have not yet read the book.Jamaica Inn is a very well written gothic novel. Our heroine finds herself in a situation that is really terrible, and for me the book would have been intolerable if it were not for the fact that the main character, Mary Yellen, is a plucky, courageous and smart woman. The situation she finds herself in is terrible to think about, and makes the stakes very high. The characters are are well formed and interesting, and the setting is Cornwall, which becomes a character in itself; a brooding presence.Although sometimes referred to as a romance, Jamaica Inn has very little of the usual romance novel trappings. It's more about how women can be strong and intelligent and not give in to their situations, written at a time when women were still being looked down upon as helpless beings who were not very smart.Spooky, thought-provoking and sometimes infuriating, this book seems like the spunky younger sister of the novel Rebecca. If you haven't read Rebecca, you'll definitely want to after reading Jamaica Inn."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"One of duMaurier's best - a rich, romantic, and atmospheric gothic romance - a classic."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"First off, I rarely read fiction, much less romantic fluff. Don't let the New York Time's proclamation, \\"A Fine Romantic Tale...\\" scribbled on the book's front cover scare you off. There's little romance in this novel--only a trickling of emotional feelings surface periodically. Rather, the book offers suspense, superb writing skills/dialogue and rich location/time period imagery. A wonderful page-turner and fun read."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I picked up this book after reading the author's bestselling book, Rebecca. I expected something similar. I didn't read many reviews before reading it. I never do because I feel some people reveal too much information. Amazon's synopsis is pretty vague. A girl goes to live with an aunt at a remote Inn with a mysterious reputation.If I had known what what was behind the big mystery at Jamaica Inn, I'm not sure I would have purchased the novel. With that said, after reading the book, I'm glad I read it. Jamaica Inn has convinced me that Daphne du Maurier can keep a reader spellbound regardless of the subject.In Jamaica Inn, Mary Yellan promises her dying mother that she will go live with her Aunt Patience after mother's death. Mary is a strong and independent girl, but promises her mother that she will go to her Aunt, who she cheerfully remembers as amusing and full of life.The woman Mary Yellan encounters is radically different from the girl Mary remembers. Patience lives with her husband Joss Merlyn at an old and remote Inn that people seem deadly afraid of. Joss is a violent and alcoholic man who makes his wife tremble in his presence. Mary, however, makes a vow that she will not allow herself to be afraid of him. Strange events at the Inn, however, make it impossible for Mary to remain brave. There are strange sounds and voices coming in and out of the Inn during the wee hours of the morning. Mary's Aunt Patience, pleads with Mary to simply cover her head under her blanket and ignore anything she may hear. Mary's curiousity, however, gets the best of her.When Mary discovers the truth about the events that take place at Jamaica Inn, she knows that she must get herself and her aunt out of there immediately. There are only two people she can turn to, Francis Davey, a local vicar Mary befriends and Jem Merlyn, Joss Merlyn's younger brother. Although Jem bears a strong physical resemblance to Mary's terrifying uncle, she find herself strangely drawn to him. Jem's unpredictable and unruly behavior make it hard for Mary rely on him for protection.Jamaica Inn is not quite up to par with Rebecca, but the suspense has Daphne du Maurier written all over it. I wasn't totally crazy about this book, but I still plan to read every novel written by this author. Any book written by Daphne du Maurier is a must read."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Like the other raters here I can't stand when someone gives out the whole summarization of a book. The point is to give ratings.This book: another highly recommended read by Daphne du Maurier. I'm a fan of the author and like her other books she has done a fabulous job here. It's an easy shorter read and good for anyone that enjoyed Frenchmans Creek, Rebecca or My cousin Rachel.Thanks to the other raters who have respected the intentions of thes reviews."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"\\"Roads? Who spoke of roads? We go by the moor and the hills, and tread granite and heather as the Druids did before us.\\" Why I have waited so many years to read more of Du Maurier's books I'll never know, but there are definitely more of hers in my immediate reading future!It's early 19C in Southern Cornwall and Mary Yellen's dying mother asks her to sell the family farm and join her Aunt Patience and her husband at Jamaica Inn in Northern Cornwall. Mary arrives and finds that no respectable person will venture near the inn, nor will the carriages stop there for respite. Her once lively and personable aunt is now a terrified shell of a woman married to drunkard inn owner Joss Merlyn. When Joss prepares to entertain \\"guests\\" Mary and her aunt are instructed to stay in their rooms and keep their eyes and ears covered -- although our spunky heroine does peek out the window and sees mysterious comings and goings and Mary suspects smuggling.Mary also becomes friends with her uncle's younger brother Jem, a ne'er do well horse thief (among other things) and the mysterious albino minister Francis Davey. A mischance on the road on the way home from the village on Christmas Eve puts Mary in the middle of her Uncle and his nefarious companions in the midst of a more gruesome crime than smuggling, thus setting in motion a terrifying set of circumstances building up to a nail biting finish on the Bodmin moors.While this one got off to a bit of a slow start for me, by the last 50 or so pages I was on the edge of my seat as Du Maurier gradually built up the tension and mystery for a rocking good finish, and a big surprise twist at the end. I really enjoyed the way the author used the spookiness of the moors and the surrounding terrain of Cornwall to set her scenes and it greatly enhanced the feel of the book in general. 4.5/5 stars."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Daphne du Maurier's 1936 JAMAICA INN reads much like the portions of WUTHERING HEIGHTS told in Isabella's letter, or that concern Cathy Linton's stay at the house later in the novel: like Heathcliff, the menacing antihero Joss Merlyn glowers and threatens, and storms in fury at the young heroine (here his niece, Mary Yellan). But Du Maurier's Heathcliff is mixed with quite a bit of Hindley Earnshaw besides, and shares the latter's weakness and fondness for drink... making him vulnerable to his own wagging tongue, which exposes to his niece his horrible and unforgivable crimes which are all part of his business.The comparisons to Emily Bront's only novel may seem invidious, given that Mary Yellan can be no Catherine Earnshaw (nor Joss Merlyn no Heathcliff), and that some of the plot twists in this novel seem telegraphed a bit too readily. Du Maurier, a lifelong Bront enthusiast, tried to match the famous Haworth sisters again with her next novel, REBECCA, which is in effect a writing of JANE EYRE... and there she came closer to succeeding. But JAMAICA INN is a marvelous Gothic in its own right, and even had Du Maurier never written another novel after it she would still be famous for the achievement of this work. It beautifully showcases her great gift of narrative description, which was probably unmatched among other realist English novelists since Hardy. Mary Yellan's first night among her uncle's sinister cohorts (climaxing in her remarkable vision of a menacing rope end) is a tour de force, as is her encounter with her husband's work on a stormy Christmas eve. This is a book hard to put down, and it remains one of Du Maurier's most memorable."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I definitely recommend this for anyone who loves the classics (like Wuthering Heights), and also for a mystery reader."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Mary Yellan's sense of adventure and spirit not easily tamed really captured me. I thoroughly enjoyed her excursions on the moors. Daphne Dumaurier did an excellent job of transporting you there. Mary Yellan's loyalty to her Aunt Patience is to be commended (staying on at the Jamaica Inn throughout all of the strange occurrences when all she had to do was leave). Jamaica Inn is a good piece of classical work. If your daughter likes Nancy Drew mysteries she should try this classic."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Very mysterious and scary, but over all great story. A sure read."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"An account of the dark reality of life and human nature. A grim way of life in crime, murder, and abuses. The characters are caught in the horrid crimes of the times. Of smuggling, luring and purposely wrecking ships, murdering passengers and crew, and retrieving the contraband for a wide spread and voracious black market. The story takes place on the English Coast, in the 18th century, when this was a regular and almost accepted practice back then. Those who profitted from the greed and the darkness' of the crimes, were people from high standing in thier communities, to the lowest riff raff of society. While I value the book as a source of awareness, and for a good history lesson, of this time in history, I found it dark, sinister and depressing. Maybe that was the whole point to the book. The heroine Mary, was even hard for me to like very much. She did show some strength of character and high morals, surrounded by wholly immoral sinister and weak people. But she just seemed too naive, too simple, and too much the victim. I thought the book was predictable in the outcome and rather slow going, almost boring. I didn't like the message of this book for women. Maybe I am getting too critical or am just bored of reading night after night after night, I don't know. That is why I chose a Classic this time. There is just so much trash out there, I thought a good classic would be a safe bet. I should love this book for being a classic, shouldn't I? Maybe I was expecting too much. Sometimes when I finish a book, as I am putting it down, I think to myself, \\"dumb\\" or \\"stupid\\" or \\"stupid ending\\" or \\"waste of time\\". I want to read books, that I don't want to end, that I can learn a little bit from, that are thought provoking and inspirational, and that I can't wait to turn the page because I want to find out what happens next, not because I can't wait to finish it. This book was almost in the latter category, for me. I am glad it was not long. I give it a guilty 2.5 stars. I suppose expecting every book I read to be riveting is just too much to expect, I suppose good books are like good movies, far and few between.Kathy Struewing"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This is a well written book with vivid descriptions of places and people. Maybe I was expecting too much. It was a little more dark and depressing than I would have liked for a vacation read, and it held nowhere near the suspense and intrigue as Rebecca (one of my favorites). It never really made me care for the lead character (Mary) - I just kept feeling that everything she did was stupid and for no reason. It was also very predictable since you know who is going to turn out to be the bad guy as he is the only other character you've been introduced to.Not duMaurier's best."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"For anyone who likes romance and suspense, this book is for you. I agree that sometimes the book drags on, but then so do many classics...I'm not very picky but I have read many books, and so from experience I say that this book is not one to miss out on...it's not as harsh as some other of Daphne Du Maurier's books, such as My Cousin Rachel, which I had to put down after a few chapters because it depressed me too much."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I've read this book several times. First as a 14 year old, again in my twenties and again recently. It is a gripping tale set on the windswept moors in the south of England. I've actually been to the moors and visited Jamaica Inn itself and it is a lonely, wild and windswept place.It is a gothic tale seen through the eyes of a young woman sent to live at Jamaica Inn. It involves wreckers (people who draw ships to the rocks in order to get their cargo when they sink) and it is full of intrigue and surprises.If you like this one readFrenchman's Creek (Virago Modern Classics)(my favorite DdM book),My Cousin RachelandRebecca by Daphne Du Maurier.I'd also really recommendCold Comfort Farmby Stella Gibbons, a darkly comic parody written in the 1930s where poor Flora encounters all sorts of eccentric relatives. It is a slim volume but extremely good; humorous rather than scary and absolutely worth reading. Not all the ends are tied up, and what the dotty aunt experienced in the woodshed is left to your own imagination."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Although not as deep emotionally as Rebecca, DuMurier did a nice job in changing the setting and time period to one that is totally different. I enjoyed the book because of the strength of the character and the dramatic scenes which carry along the reader into the world of the English moors. It is almost as though you are in the raininess of an English winter and can smell the Christmas Eve fair. Her character analysis of many of the different players in this novel are masterfully done."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"It may be becasue I am an inexperienced reader, or I do not appreciate the more complex novels - only simple plots, or that this is the first Daphne DuMaurier book that I have read, or that I am under 13 (used this review sheet for children) or that it is the most recent book I have finished (well there are a lot of \\"well it may be because\\"s, so I will get on with the review) but I think that this book is the best one that Daphne DuMaurier has written. She never goes over the top with description, or never reveals too much or too little (if it's a mysterious character) about a person's personality. She does everything just right, and weaves the words of the book brilliantly.In my personal opinion the part where Mary was taken to the shore (I won't reveal too much) dragged on a bit. I kept loosing my place in the book and I found it didn't really matter where I started reading again, but that was just one chapter.For some reason I think that this book is good to read on holiday, somewhere in Britain, even if it's not Bodmin where this book is set (well, Jamaica Inn is near Bodmin anyway)."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"A few years ago someone suggested to me that I would enjoy the gothic writing style of Daphne DuMaurier. That, in itself, was a true statement, and Rebecca remains one of my favorite novels.Recently I chose Jamaica Inn, after carrying around the weighty Atlas Shrugged for two months. At a scant 240 pages, this novel has a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time.The death of Mary Yellan's mother, and a deathbed wish that she go to live with her Aunt Patience brings Mary to the much feared and maligned Jamaica Inn. Upon arrival Mary meets her Uncle Joss Merlyn, the landlord of Jamaica Inn, who lives up to every ugly scrap of reputation he has earned. A drunk; a bully; a spouse-abuser....Joss Merlyn is instantly disagreeable and unlikeable.But Mary finds that Joss is much more than just ugly words. Meryln heads up a band of 'Wreckers' who lure ships to their doom with a false beacon, then murders the passengers and crew, and plunders the ship and sells off the goods. Horrified by this discovery, Mary struggles with her urge to flee Jamaica Inn, and her duty to protect her Aunt.Mary also encounters Jem Merlyn, the n'er do well younger brother of Joss, and Francis Davey, the Vicar of Altarnun, in the near vicinity. Unsure of whether Jem is friend or foe, Mary finds herself drawn to him, and continually seeking out the aide of Vicar Davey.But in the end, Mary's trust seems ill-placed, as the real head of the band of smugglers is revealed, murders and imprisonments occur, and the truth comes to light about the goings-on at Jamaica Inn.Where this novel falls short, even without comparison to Rebecca; is in the brevity of the tale. With a sparse cast of characters; the end is in sight long before you turn the final page. The gloom of the moors is touched upon, with afternoon walks surrounded by mist and foreign noises...late night escapes from impending danger, and the threat of cut-throat smugglers ever present...but the suspense of all these situations is short lived, as the story moves on....Perhaps a little further fleshing-out of the gloom and doom would have added more enjoyment to the story; at least for me, as I have a great deal of affection for DuMaurier's ability to delivery dark, gothic foreboding and trepidation.Nevertheless, the story moves along at an easy to follow rate, and is enjoyable. Though I cannot give it a five star rating, I do recommend it to fans of DuMaurier."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"\\"It was a cold grey day in late November. The weather had changed overnight, when a backing wind brought a granite sky and a mizzling rain with it, and although it was now only a little after two o'clock in the afternoon, the pallour of a winter evening seemed to have closed upon the hills, cloaking them in mist.\\"How's that for setting the mood right off the bat??When Mary Yellan's mother was on her death bed, she begged Mary to make her a promise. Mary's mother said that when she died, she wanted Mary to leave their little farm and go live with her aunt Patience. Trying to look out for her daughter, Mary's mom was afraid that life would be too hard for a young girl on a farm by herself and wanted her to have an easier life. Little did she know the fate of things to come.With all her belongs packed into a small trunk, Mary set out for Jamaica Inn, which was owned by her Aunt Patience and her Uncle Joss. Mary had only met Patience once, but remembered her mother's sister as a vivacious and carefree woman. But when she told the coach driver where she was going, he tried to talk her out of it. He said no one went to Jamaica Inn, especially a young woman. It was an evil place. However, Mary had promised her dying mother, and good or bad she had to keep that promise.When Mary arrived on that cold, rainy night, however, she found that Aunt Patience was no longer the young vivacious woman she used to be. She was older, thinner, and perpetually frightened. She was a shell of the woman she used to be. And the man she married, Joss Meryln was a huge, hulking man with a mean streak a mile long and an evil glint in his eye. Joss told Mary she was to help out around the Inn and as long as she minded her own business, everything would be fine.But Jamaica Inn was no travelers Inn. It was old, crumbling and falling apart. No one every stayed there. Mary couldn't figure out how the Merlyn's made any living off of it.....until the night when she was woken from her sleep by all the wagons. As she peered out the window (when she wasn't supposed to do), she saw a bunch of men unloading boxes into the storage rooms in the Inn. As she snuck downstairs to get a better look, she overheard her uncle threaten a man who wanted \\"out\\".But just when Mary was trying to figure out a way to get her Aunt Patience away from this place, a strange man stopped at the Inn. He was dark, rugged and handsome.....and was Joss Merlyn's younger brother, Jem. He seemed like he wanted to help Mary, but could she really trust someone with the last name of Merlyn??I read the story Rebecca a couple of years ago, and while I really enjoyed it, I wasn't \\"wowed\\" by it. I finally realized I just had too many high expectations for such a famous book. Not so with Jamaica Inn. I knew nothing about this one. In fact, I hadn't even heard of it before I started looking for books to fit into the challenge. From page one, du Maurier ran with the \\"eerie, dark\\" Gothic setting and told a brilliant story. Mary was a smart, strong, independent young woman in a time when those qualities were not usually used to describe a woman. Jem was the proverbial \\"bad boy\\". A handsome horse thief that was fun and likable, du Maurier created a great anti-hero in Jem. Will he do the right thing in the end.....or will he be just another Merlyn?? I guess you will have to read the book to find out!!For a book that was written over 70 years ago, Jamaica Inn was incredibly readable and highly entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely. A great Gothic tale of thieves, murder, and even a little romance. Definitely worth reading and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"After recently reading Rebecca by Du Maurier, I decided to read another of her novels, and this was #2 in a collection I received from my local library. Though I did like Rebecca quite a bit, this one absolutely blew me away.Jamaica Inn and Du Maurier kept me guessing til the bitter end. Furthermore, Du Maurier's characterizations and incredible use of metaphor have you living, breathing, and dreaming in the moors of the English hills, through the eyes of her often troubled female heroines.You will be enraged, disgusted, enthralled, and wanting more throughout every page of the novel. Though I'm in the midst of a house move and have a very active toddler, I spent every free minute in the last couple days with my nose in this book!In other reviews I'd read people mentioned they weren't thrilled with the ending; to that end, the very last two pages were a bit much, but the actual denoument of the book was fantastique!!!FIVE STARS for another novel well written and much appreciated. Too bad there are not many authors like Du Maurier that find their way into print anymore (but if so, email me whom they are!)"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Jamaica Inn is an amazing book which captivates readers with amazing literary merit. Daphne Du Maurier chooses her words carefully, and it is apparent in her writing of Jamaica Inn. Through her descriptions and personification of the English land to the careful sketch of Aunt Patience, her use of language is complete and gives a tone of mystery to the novel. \\"Sometimes the hills were purple, inkstained, and mottled, and then a feeble ray of sun would come from a wisp of cloud, and one hill would be golden brown while his neighbor still languished in the dark.\\"(26). In this quotation, Du Maurier illustrates the intense, dark, yet forbearing terrain of the moors of England near the dreaded Jamaica Inn. Seeping as it seems, the overtone is dark and mysterious. As with the landscapes, Du Maurier takes careful time drawing up the characters of the book, \\"This was the old Aunt Patience, with nervous hands and twitching mouth, which glanced over her shoulder as she talked. It was pitiable to see her, and Mary caught something of her agitation\\" (100). Such attention is paid to the crucial points of character through the simple yet foreboding descriptions. Her tone throughout the book is clear, and sets a stage for the overall plot and ending. A certain amount of mystery is played in every page and keeps the reader enthralled. \\"But this sudden coming to grace, this quick and exquisite moving of his hands, was a swift and rather sinister revelation, sinister because it was unexpected and not true to type\\"(17). This message and tone of mystery, deceit keeps the reader on their toes and is magnified in each sentence that flows on each page. Jamaica Inn is a truly captivating novel and is one to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"A mysterious, thrilling , romantic novel. You can see one character's fear in his jumpy movement, hear another's anger in his dirty talk. You can also smell the moral decay of the Jamaica Inn.At first, the story is really scray.Although the story won't happen in our daily lives, it is so attractive that you can't put the book down at all."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This exciting novel is very deep psychologically. Young and ignorant Mary Yellan is suddenly faced with the terrors and dangers of the world, when her loving mother tragically passes away and she travels to live with her dark and immoral uncle, Joss Merlyn. Not even the wise advice of the coach driver could prevent Mary from disobeying her dying mother's plead that Mary would join her Aunt Patience at Jamaica Inn. And so Mary Yellan's courageous journey begins in the coach heading for Jamaica Inn in the pouring rain. As Mary arrived at Jamaica Inn she already had a sense of the building's dark power, but never did she dream that she would become helplessly entrapped in the inn's vile and crumbling walls. As days turn to weeks, Mary's curiosity for her uncle's mysterious trade grows. Customers are not accepted at Jamaica Inn, instead, during the night, covered wagons arrive at Jamaica Inn carrying strangers and illegal goods. Mary discovers the evilness of the inn and desires to leave it immediately, but she knows that she can't abandon her aunt with her heinous uncle. To add to her troubles, Mary meets the landlord's brother and falls disastrously in love with him. However, this love is tormented by doubts as Jem's behavior changes and clues lead to his guilt of a murder. Mary found him to be so charming, however he is a horse-thief. Can Mary survive this dangerous situation?"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This book is truly a gothic classic. It kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page. I was instantly drawn into Mary Yellan's world and I found myself bonded to her and horrified as to what happens. Mary Yellan's mother dies leaving her alone on her farm with no family left but a aunt whom she hasn't seen for ten years. Mary decides to fullfill the dying promise she made with her mother to go and live with her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss Merlyn who own Jamaica Inn on the untamed and wild British moors. Soon, Mary finds herself trapped in the villianous and wild schemes that are going on within the inn's crumbling walls.I adore Daphne Du Maurier and I understand perfectly why some many people read her books. She has the most amazing ability to dance along the fine line of reality. The way she expresses herself through her characters is always so haunting and depressing it becomes addicting."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Having fallen in love with Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier, I was anxious to read something else by her. I was not disappointed with Jamaica Inn.It's the 1800's and Mary Yellan is a twenty three year old woman who has lived her life on a farm in Helston. She helped her mother with the family farm after her father passed away. When her mother loses her will to live, she shares with Mary her final wish. She says that Mary is to go to live with her Aunt Patience in Bodmin after she dies. Patience' husband Joss Merlyn is the Innkeeper of Jamaica Inn.Mary arrives at the gloomy inn, and is shocked by the woman her Aunt Patience has become. Formerly outgoing and cheerful, now she is nervous, quiet, aloof and frightened. Her husband, Joss is creepy, mean and secretive, and Mary realizes early on that this is not a place for her or her aunt, as danger lurks within the crumbling inn.(p. 159....\\"She thought of Aunt Patience, trailing like a ghost in the shadow of her master, and she shuddered. That would be Mary Yellen too, but for the Grace of God and her own strength and will.\\"Mary wants to escape but she is torn because of the promise she made to her mother. She feels her aunt is not safe with Joss, an alcoholic, and she wants Aunt Patience to escape as well. Strange things are going on at the inn on the Cornish coast. I don't want to give spoilers, but there are never any guests and is not even open to the public, and secretive things happen late at night at Jamaica Inn.MY THOUGHTS - If you like Gothic novels, and stories that evoke the atmosphere of horror and dread, then this novel should be perfect for you.RECOMMENDED - 4.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This is only the second Daphne du Maurier book I've read (the first was 'The Scapegoat'), and I enjoyed it. The story line is good, as are the descriptions of the Cornish countryside. Indeed, the author seems to have a real feel for Cornwall, even though she was born and brought up in London. Not for her the sugary rustic platitudes of other English &quot;country&quot; writers. And bear in mind, too, that she was only in her twenties when she wrote this: quite an achievement.Inevitably the book is somewhat old-fashioned in its style. The prose is inclined to be a bit wordy. But the characters of the Merlyn brothers and the Vicar are well drawn. A slight disappointment, however, is Mary Yellan herself. I found it a little difficult to engage with her, and a rather characterless, even priggish young woman comes across."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"If you love to be transported to Victorian or post-Victorian England, you will enjoy this story of a woman suddenly on her own. I personally love the syntax, style of dialogue, discription of life, and the discription of the English countryside of this period."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"more. Even though I like some of the others who reviewed this book prefered Rebecca. I do not however think these are two books that should be compaired. Yes, I agree that they were both about young girls but that is about where the similarities end. Jamacia inn does share the same writting style that Daphne Du Maurier is famous for but I do not believe she wanted this book to be another Rebecca. When reading this book forget the others by Du Maurier and I believe that it will be more appreciated, because you will not expect another Rebecca which this particular book is definatly not."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"It's hard not to get caught up in the fantasy of this book. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Expecting a story similiar in style to Rebecca, I was disappointed. Although it was not what I expected, I was surprised I enjoyed it, even though the romance element was definitely hard to find. In various books the history of smuggling on the English coast has been mentioned and this story centers around these crimes explaining in much more detail. Therefore, it is an interesting history lesson."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I prefer Du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel and Rebecca to Jamaica Inn. If you enjoy her novels, you will probably enjoy it, however, it is not her best work. The book, while descriptive, becomes tedious about half way through. You almost want to choke the main character, Mary, for continuing to be so blindly loyal to a derelict uncle by marriage and his patheticly weak wife. Not a 90's book for your daughter!"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I saw the dreadful movie based on this book when I was MUCH younger & found it confusing and dull (one of those in which flipping of long hair is supposed to translate as good acting). After reading Rebecca about five hundred times, I decided to give this book a try. After all, how many movies are better than the book (ummmmmm, thinking hard, none!). This book turned out to be a fun, gothic novel. Problems: too fast paced, heroine does some pretty stupid things, ending is kind of unbelievable, bad guy is a little easy to spot. Good points: story keeps moving along & doesn't bog down, scenes and descriptions are wonderfully done, characters are three-dimensional, ending of the story is what you'd hope would happen, hero sounds like a major hottie. It made for a good read, especially when I made allowance for the period in which it was written. I especially liked how the author gave you a glimpse into the brains of the bad guys and you got a slight taste of what they might have been like if they hadn't been trapped in their situation. It would be especially good to read on a stormy night when you're alone in the house!"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"It has been 5 years since I have read Jamaica Inn. It started as a requirement for my Enlish class to read and do a review on an author randomly picked by my teacher. I would never know the impact this book along with another, Rebecca, would have on me. I was never much of a reader before this experience and to this day I remember Daphne Du Maurier's books vividly. She will always remain my favorite author."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I read this book because I enjoyed Rebecca and liked the gothic feel of this novel, and it was successful in creating that classic gothic atmosphere. However, somebody has to say something about the completely unbelievable romance side of the book. It cheapened the entire story and just about ruined the book for me. Mary Yellan is first presented as a strong character, one who can stand up to her abusive uncle where her aunt has caved in. And then we are supposed to believe that she falls head over heels in love with her uncle's brother, whom we are told is merely a younger version of her uncle. He was a repulsive character and it was not at all believable that Mary would find anything in him to be attracted to. The whole idea turned what was otherwise a suspenseful gothic mystery into a cliched bodice-ripper. It was almost like reading two different novels in one. Why would a character like Mary degrade herself in this way and end up becoming just like her weak Aunt Patience who follows her husband around like a whipped dog? Besides making me roll my eyes constantly as I was reading and wonder what kind of idiot would fall for that kind of man, this aspect of the book sends a very bad message to women."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Few readers of similar genres will find disappointment in Jamaica Inn.I remember reading Du Maurier when I was in my teens half a century or so back and something made me recently pick up Jamaica Inn. I could barely put it down. I was quickly caught up in the tangle of plot and character and emotion- woven together so very well it seemed to flow right around me, over me, through me- and I thought of all the newly written novels- no offense intended- about which a main selling point is, \\"Wow! You won't be able to put it down!\\" This is the real thing. If you've been reading similar mystery/drama that stops at simply taking you through the motions of the plot without fleshing out detail- even characters- novels which when you read that last page, you know what came to pass but it somehow feels empty and leaves you wanting, this is a book for you.I agree, by the way, with the writer who said \\"You've just given away the entire plot.\\" This is not an English class book report, folks. It's a way to express how we all feel about the style, the nuances of a writer's skill. I'm amazed at how many reviews do reveal the entire book. Man, that's like taping a favorite ball game or film- only to have some moron with \\"spoiler\\" on his breath happen along to tell you the ending before you've popped in the DVD....LolFor an entertaining and very personal and candid glimpse into Ms. Du Maurier from her childhood into her early twenties, do read \\"Myself When Young,\\" her first autobiographical work. Experiencing the young Daphne and her youthful interpretations of her world will surely enhance your understanding of her characters and plots."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Since I loved Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, I thought I would give Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn a try. The writing is wonderful but the story not so much. I kept waiting for Mary Yellan to get her poor aunt out of Jamaica Inn and head for a better life somewhere else. However, this was not to be.The characters seemed to be almost caricatures for me and I figured out fairly quickly who the man was behind all the evil. I also could not relate to the ending since Mary Yellan talked about living a life like a man and farming on her own.This is not my favorite Du Maurier novel."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Georgian England. Twenty-three-year-old Mary Yellan had a bad feeling in her gut during her coach ride to her new home. The coachman himself tried to warn her against the place, but Mary had promised her dying mother that she would go live with her aunt Patience and her uncle Joss Merlyn after her mother's death. And so, she will do it, no matter what the coachman or her own instincts tell her. But Mary had never imagined what her new life would be like at Jamaica Inn. Why on earth would her aunt and uncle buy such a place? Not long after moving there, Mary discovers that Uncle Joss, an abusive and brutish alcoholic, doesn't let in any guests other than the occasional drinker into the inn. Instead, he uses the place for smuggling alcohol and tobacco. However, other sinister things occur there as well, one of which is possibly murder. Mary is alone at Jamaica Inn. Her once beautiful and bubbly aunt is now frightened and of very little use. The only two people nearby who can possibly help are a mysterious albino clergyman and Rem Merlyn, Joss's younger brother -- a tall, dark and handsome horse thief with a callous character and a possible dark secret of his own.Jamaica Inn had a creepy, gothic language from the very beginning, and I couldn't help getting sucked into the suspense and horror that is her uncle Joss and his dark dealings. Daphne du Maurier was a talented author of gothic novels. I had only read Rebecca, and thought I'd give her other books a whirl. Jamaica Inn, while not as good as Rebecca, is riveting and horrifying, but has the right touch of romance to give it a little bit extra. The vicar of Altarnun is a true enigma, a very creepy character, and I couldn't help feeling trepidation every time he appears in a scene. Rem Merlyn is also a dark and mysterious character, but I kind of hoped that he would indeed become Mary's love interest. Mary is a young woman before her time. She doesn't want to get married because she believes that marriage breaks a woman's spirit. One look at her aunt would confirm her prejudices. The ending is flooring, but not as flooring as the one in Rebecca. Still, Jamaica Inn is a wonderful gothic that you will want to read. It'll keep you turning the pages until the late hours of the night. Daphne du Maurier was a definite talent. I have The Scapegoat with me and I look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I found myself strangely identifying with the heroine even though our lives are completely different. This book has stuck with me and I will read it again and again."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Some reviewers were more critical than I. If a book causes me to be anxious to get home to read it, than I give it 4 stars. Now I will describe what specifically I liked about Jamaica Inn:1. The characters were fairly 3-dimensional.2. DuMaurier's descriptions made me smell and visualize the Inn, the moors and the characters.3. I couldn't predict what each character would state next, nor what what actually transpire next."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"although lacking more character development, a wonderful example of du maurier's story-telling ability. a delightful read. mary's strength is admirable, and the romance is mostly left to the imagination. i think most would enjoy that"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I first read Jamica Inn as an inexperienced teenager living on dreams and fantasies of finding true love and living happily ever after. I thought the story of Mary and Jem was a wonderful love story, over coming all obstacles, giving up all for true love, over coming evil, and setting off for a life of romance and adventure. Ten years later and no longer dreaming of love and happily everafter I reread this book. It depressed me. Mary, by going off with Jem, had condemened herself to the same life that had drained her aunt of hope and vitality. Drink and time would eventually turn Jem into the same abusive character his brother had been. When the kids started coming and there was no steady income, no secure shelter Mary would turn into a shrew.It really depressed me.The story was suspensful, and the author was a gifted writer. Just don't think too long on the future of the two lovers after the book ends."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"DuMaurier's best works rise above the formulaic romances that have become clich&eacute;. Not this one. The protagonist's inner conflict does not spring from the same insight that created \\"The Scapegoat\\" or \\"My Cousin Rachel.\\" This poor girl of the moors is a bore. The most interesting character isn't in the book enough to compensate. Try another one instead."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"\\"Jamaica Inn\\", Daphne du Maurier's classic 1935 novel of suspense and romance, holds up surprisingly well as an entertaining read. Set in the author's rugged and half wild native Cornwall, the brooding Bodmin Moor is a key component of the story.The year is 1815. A young woman named Mary Yellan, who has helped run a small farm with her widowed mother, is suddenly an orphan with no place to go but the home of her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss Merlyn at the remote Jamaica Inn. The Inn has an evil reputation, and Mary soon discovers the reason is her brutal Uncle Joss, who has intimidated Aunt Patience into snivelig subservience while engaging in a mysterious and presumably illegal enterprise.The plucky Mary refuses to knuckle under to Joss Merlyn; her curiosity will put her in the path of a vicious criminal gang which will threaten her with kidnapping, rape, and murder. She will be attracted to Uncle Joss's enigmatic and handsome brother Jem and seek uncertain assistance from the mysterious albino priest Francis Davey. The hard truths of Jamaica Inn will change her life forever.\\"Jamaica Inn\\" is highly recommended to fans of Daphne du Maurier, and to readers looking for a well-written period romance."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I have to say, this book by Daphne du Maurier is a little underwhelming.The writing is, as expected, gorgeous. Just like in Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, it is very atmospheric. There is, no doubt, an air of Emily and Charlotte Bronte's style about it. Considering that I am a huge fan of both Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, that's a big plus. Du Maurier is also very skillful at building suspense. A feeling of dread and foreboding is maintained throughout the novel making it an intense reading experience.But the writing is not the weakest point of Jamaica Inn. The story itself is. For me the mystery of Jamaica Inn and the crimes it hides is too simplistic. Nothing much happens in the story besides Mary Yellan trying to figure out what awful business her dreadful uncle is a part of and whose brain is behind the whole crime scheme. She figures it all out very quickly indeed. And we along with her. There are simply not enough characters in this book to not figure out who the biggest bad guy is. As for the perpetrator's motive, I don't think I quite got it.And romance. While there are some great conversations, the love story is a bit rushed and underdeveloped IMO. The heroine is smart and strong-willed, but her attraction to the hero is too quick and her decision at the end of the book is strange. Maybe this is what a genre of gothic romance is all about though? An atmospheric story with a romance of the complexity of an average Harlequin novel? I don't know, I am not very familiar with the genre.Anyway, in spite of my slight disappointment, I am still interested in exploring Daphne du Maurier's works in future, but I hope they are more akin to Rebecca rather than Jamaica Inn. Are they?"},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"I have read this book several times and always enjoy it, but it's got issues, the main one being that it's utter nonsense from beginning to end. Gothic novels are not supposed to dwell in the pragmatic, but in this case, every decision the heroine makes is ludicrous, and yet we're supposed to believe she's intelligent. I can't explain her worst decision without giving away the ending, which I don't want to do. Excessive, repetitive description of the weather and the landscape will frustrate many readers. Still, I always get sucked in by the romantic atmosphere and the heroine's determination to bring her murderous uncle and his cohorts to justice. Rebecca is a much better Daphne du Maurier novel."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Although the plot is not always intriging, the plots twists the DuMarier throws in every so often kept me reading.

She must go and live with her mother's sister, Aunt Patience and her dark and dangerous husband, Joss Merlyn. They keep the Jamaica Inn on a lonely forbidding spot on the Moors - but no casual passer-by's stop there, nor any coaches. Mary soon learns there is something grim going on. Her uncle is involved in some violent and illicit trade, and there is a sinister person who is directing her uncle's secret business. It would be difficult for Mary to leave, but she won't leave without her Aunt Patience. Despite the violence from Joss, Aunt Patience has turned into a scared, fluttering, fey creature who seems unable to leave. Then there Jem Merlyn, her uncle's much younger brother and for whom Mary begins to feel a conflict of emotion. Can she trust Jem? He is her hated uncle's brother after all.

I put the book down after about 140 pages. It has utterly no sense of period, just like the standard historical-romance novels of 2011. It's set some time shortly after the Napoleonic Wars concluded (1815), but might be happening in 1715, 1615, or even 1915, as long as the references to the nineteenth century were changed or expunged. Du Maurier's ear is strictly middle-of-the-road 1930s; she apparently couldn't even appreciate the Cornish accents among which she lived. The flatness of her diction makes the heavy sentiments that course through the book seem forced and artificial, and the characters seem hackneyed. If you're looking for richness of language and convincing realization of period and place, don't bother with Jamaica Inn."},{"Title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"This book tells the story of Mary Yellan, who comes to live at Jamaica Inn, a place with a very bad name. She meets different persons, good or bad, and what I like so much about the story is that in the end the people she trusted, appear to be bad and de bad people are the good ones. Take Jem Merlyn, the man she falls in love with, but who also is the man that she thinks is the murderer of her aunt Patience. But it seems to be that it was the vicar of Altarnun who mudered her uncle and aunt. And in a very small place of her mind she must have known it from the beginning, for he always made her nervous. He was a strange looking man, but very, very clever. And he had twisted Mary just around his finger. But it seemed that the vicar loved her too. He told her:&quot;If you had been there, I would have killed you too, no not you Mary Yellan&quot;. Yes, he was so very nice and kind to her that he must have loved her. Anyway he still would kill her if she'd do anything that'd delay their journey. Eventually there are men coming after them, they have dogs along them and the vicar first releases Mary of the belt that he'd put around her and than he kills himself. Then I consider the book as ended. The exitement is over. But still I love the book, and I wish I'd never read it before, for then there would still be a first time.

It shows behind the scenes photos, & info from on the set. It shows how the Freddy makeup was done for part 1. I am a horror fanatic & was very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Screams and Nightmares : The Films of Wes Craven","review":"I have been an avid fan of Wes Craven and his movies, But this book gives you more insight on his better movies, and gives you respect for his unsatisfactory movies. As well as getting inside his head and knowing what these movies really mean, After reading it you know what each movie is &quot;really&quot; all about. For anyone who is interested in Horror movies, or any genre of Movies, you should definately read this book."},{"Title":"Screams and Nightmares : The Films of Wes Craven","review":"It is an old version but I have received it in a good condition. The size and number of pages are larger than I thought."},{"Title":"Screams and Nightmares : The Films of Wes Craven","review":"At first thought, many people probably would have thought director Wes Craven to be some kind of unbalanced oddball because of some of the films he has made. Not to mention some of the gnarly and overly violent scenes he has created in his numerous films. What kind of a person would of made \\"The Last House On The Left\\", or \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\"?. Or have a geiser of blood shooting up from a teenaged boy's bed in the original \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\"?. Well, Mr. Craven. That's who. Newbies just finding his work and learning more about him, might be surprised to find that Mr. Craven is the exact opposite of what you would of thought. Instead of coming across as some crazy horror film director, he comes across more as a polished and highly intelligent man who looks and dresses like a college professor. \\"Freddy\\" star Robert Englund even once made that comment after meeting Wes for the first time after auditioning for the first Freddy movie. This book delves right into the entirety of Wes' career and offers glimpses into the makings of each ones, not to mention his own life. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio on August 2, 1939. One other interesting note was how his family were a deeply religious baptist family. The religion and the nature of his family's religion is something Wes goes on to discuss a bit further in the book. It's also incredibly interesting to know that Wes never saw a movie untilhe wasin college. The good and the bad from his work is brought to the forefront and dissected. A running theme thru the book is the effect that horror, and many of Wes' films, have had on the world. Is it good?. Is it harmful to children?. Is it responsible when someone commits a crime and says they did because of watching \\"Scream\\" or any other movie?. That is some of the interesting bits you will read about in this book. Author Brian J. Robb, an autobiogrpaher who has done work on such other people as Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, River Phoenix, and Leonardo DiCaprio, does a nice job of getting the information there and making it easily accessible and interesting to read. Granted, the book isn't entirely perfect. It's a thin and light book that could probably be read in one sitting. Also, many of the quotes seem like they were taken from many other sources. It doesn't feel like Wes had directly talked to this book or was involved in any interviews for it. I'm just guessing. It would of been better if it had a tad more in depth, but I'm not really complaining for as it is a great book. The \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" films are thoroughly researched and talked about here. It is kind of odd that every single one is accounted for since 4 of them had nothing really to do with Wes at all. I did get the feeling that Wes wasn't properly treated at time by New Line over the \\"Elm Street\\" series. These films were what really made Wes known, until a little movie called \\"Scream\\" came out to terrify theatergoers in 1996 and made Wes not only a household name again, but proved that he is master and back at the top of the horror list. Much talk and detail goes into all 3 of the \\"Scream\\" films as well. Overall, this is avery entertaining and enjoyable read. From his trouble with getting a film done, going without money, and the ever present cencorships board, and other things you will read about in this book, Wes Craven has had his struggles. But as always, he rolls with the punches and he always gets back on his feet again. This is a book that satisfy fans, newcomers to him and his work, and genre buffs all over the world."},{"Title":"Screams and Nightmares : The Films of Wes Craven","review":"This is designed for big, big, big fans of Wes Craven. It is a slim book whose text seems to be primarily based on magazine articles and newspaper clips. The book gives a fairly good overview of Craven's history and philosophy in a readable and serviceable style."},{"Title":"Screams and Nightmares : The Films of Wes Craven","review":"This is a brilliant book and particually good if your a big fan of Freddy Krueger films, like me. It tells us of Wes Cravens past and of his past and present movies."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Warm, witty and inspired, this is commentator/sometime political candidate Pat Buchanan's best book. While his politics are great, what sticks in my mind is his description of the human dimension of growing up conservative, Catholic, and pugnacious in 50s America. Buchanan is a master of the brief and compelling character sketch whether of beloved family members or controversial political figures like Richard Nixon."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Buchanan is straightforward in telling why he thinks what he thinks in this intimate portrayal of his developmental years. In the 1950s Washington, D. C. was not the metropolis it is today. Buchanan grew up in the nation's capital during a time of innocence and traditional family values. He describes the cultural influences he had in that era and how strong Christian values established his worldview. The impact individuals had on him, such as his dad, are discussed as he talks about the influence being more by example than rhetoric. He mentions sensing change in the air in the nation's collective viewpoint while in graduate school at Columbia University. Buchanan is a gifted writer. Books like this affirm the essence of what has become cliche, i.e., that truth is often more interesting than fiction.Buchanan connects his personality with something larger than self, however as he links his life with the nation. He discusses where the country has been and the direction in which it is headed. He contrasts that with the social consensus found during the days of his boyhood. One senses that he feels that as others have passed the torch from one generation to the next, he feels responsible for making sure generations following him inherit a nation for which to be thankful."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Pat Buchanan. The name conjurs up images of a rough and tumble campaigner for elected office, a man that minces no words in regard to his political beliefs. Right From The Beginning puts a strong perspective on growing up in the 50's as a conservative and a typical teenage boy in that era.Buchanan is sometimes witty, sometimes circumspect, but he is always honest. Conservatives and liberals alike should read this book, if not for the honesty, than for his insightfulness into the world of an adolescent in the greatest peacetime boom in the history of the world."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Having had the opportunity to meet Pat in person, I get the sense that he truly believes it is not too late for America. While his prescriptions may be a little hard to swollow, they are honest and not without compassion. His life was built on a foundation of duty to God, Mother Church, Country and Family. If everyone understood that fact, none would dare to question his motives and desires."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"The man is brilliant and an extremely talented writer and TV commentator. Another great asset this author has is a sense of humor. He does not take himself seriously. He is loyal to his friends in good times and bad. He does not apologize for his ethnic heritage,his deep love of his native land, his deep religious faith, his Jesuit education. He is a well rounded person. I am always impressed with his TV appearances in that he never raises his voice or tries to speak over another guest. His manners are genuine. We need more Pat Buchanans!"},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"The great thing about this auto-biography is the description of Catholic familylife in Washington DC in the 1940s and 1950s. The Buchanans were all-in whenit came to the church and the life surrounding it. And for Pat Buchanan, nothingcould have been better. Lacking money didn't mean an improvished life. Standingup for yourself wasn't seen as polically incorrect. It was all for one, and one for all.The most disappointing thing about the biography is that Buchanon deliberately leaves out much of his work for Presidents Nixon and Reagon."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"\\"Right from the Beginning\\" is the enjoyable autobiography of Pat Buchanan. His account of growing up in the middle decades of the twentieth century in Washington, D.C. is a page-turner, and he stresses how growing up in the pre-Sixties era was much different from doing so afterward. Some of the anecdotes that Buchanan relays in the book are laugh-out-loud funny.The book continues with Buchanan's path through college and graduate school to his days as an editorial writer in St. Louis. He tells the story of his hiring by Richard Nixon.The closing section of the book concerns the political situation as Buchanan saw it when the book was published in 1988. He believed that the moral climate of the country was far more important than the state of the economy, and was an unceasing advocate, not of d&eacute;tente, but of the defeat of the Soviet Union.Buchanan also has one of the best writing styles ever, and the fact that this book is still in print twenty years after it was published is indicative of how good it is."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"A very insightful and readable biographyof American perpetual Presidential Candi-date Pat Buchanan, who used to be verygood on the McLaughlin Group.

There's no doubt about that. However, we shouldn't let his witty charm obscure that fact that he is a hate-filled protectionist who wants a lilly-white America.People who talk about &quot;culture wars&quot; and &quot;purifying&quot; America scare the bejabbers out of me."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"I have come to the conclusion that Buchanan is right.Very right.Ultra right!!GET IT (YUK!

The one that's most blatant, and the one I will limit my discussion to, is related to his overt support of diabolism. Here is a quick review: I am troubled by Buchanan's constant exaggerations and half-truths. He is hampered by a load of contradictory and absurd assumptions of the school that he follows. I unequivocally don't know what Buchanan's problem is, but it has been, and is, my graet undertaking to raise issues, as opposed to character slandering. Buchanan's social and political comments are categorized as &quot;hyperphosphorescence.&quot;DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON ANOTHER HYPOCRITE POLITICIAN'S BOOK."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Buchanan's witty prose and charming dilect. He is obviously skilled in \\"spinning a good yarn\\" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"&quot;Right from the Beginning&quot; is a very interesting, easy read. It is, primarily, a personal, rather than a political, autobiography of Pat Buchanan. Those seeking an insight into the Nixon or Reagan White Houses will be disappointed. Those searching for an understanding of what makes Pat Buchanan the man that he is will be very satisfied. The book is, for the most part, a series of personal and family antidotes which Pat uses to tell the story of how he got to where he was in 1990. Here and there he will interrupt the anrrative to insert a philosophical statement about life, religion or politics. To this St. Louisian who grew up in the Catholic school system a few years after Pat, there is much which seems familiar. For me, this book took the emotions on a roller coaster ride. The first section, dealing with his grade school years, is my favorite part of the book. In it Pat records the environment in which we lived, the things we were taught and the lasting beliefs which we still hold. The second section, dealing with his high school and college years records a lot of pranks and activities which are not part of my experience and which I did not find to be very enjoyable. In the third section, dealing with his career, my enthusiasm rebounded, in part because of the references to places and people in St. Louis. The greatest value in this book is the understanding it gives one of Pat Buchanan. Many public figures are hidden behind the facades created by their managers. We often have difficulty understanding what their core values are. The Pat Buchanan we see is Pat Buchanan. &quot;Right From the Beginning&quot; shows us what makes the Pat Buchanan we see and admire."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"If one wished to understand how life was in the 50s and 60s as well as to understand the mind of a genuine conservative, one only needs to read Right from the Beginning. Pat grew up as a Catholic in Washington DC, attending Catholic high schools and universities. Anyone who was an altar boy or who attended Catholic schools could identify with this story. It is a brilliant piece of writing by a brilliant man."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Pat Buchanan has been labeled everything from dangerous to nazi. This book proves that he is just the opposite: a strongly principled man who wants what's best for his country.Buchanan explains his conservative beliefs within the framework of growing up the son of a devout Catholic scrapper and the student of tough Jesuit priests. Although he spent much of his childhood raising hell, his upbringing was about morals and care of the soul. In Buchanan's time, care of the soul meant defending American freedom from the encroachment of Leninist communism. He didn't hate the Russians, but the system of government that was devouring half the world's freedom.To the left-leaning critic who is undoubtedly screaming, \\"what about America devouring the other half\\": you're preaching to the choir. Buchanan has consistently asserted that we shouldn't be meddling in other countries' affairs. He recalls traveling to Japan and concluding that we were wrong to indiscriminately A-bomb the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He goes on to say that our president prodded the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor so that he'd have an excuse to enter the war. That's hardly the voice of an imperialistic interventionist.Nor is Buchanan a cut-throat capitalist. At the end of the book, he talks about an America of morals being infinitely more desireable than an America of laurel-resting decadence. He observes that democracy is by itself an empty vessel that can be filled with evil intentions just as easily as it can with good intentions. The moral fiber of our people, says Buchanan, is what ultimately defines us. Compare our grandparents' generation to ours; Buchanan's point is painfully obvious. To recapture our country, Buchanan insists we recapture education, freedom of religion (rather than tacitly mandated secularism or cowtowing agnosticism), and the Supreme Court. No arguments from me.Some people have speculated that Buchanan is a closet white supremacist, an accusation which this book shoots down. Having grown up with two black maids, having recoiled at the treatment of a southern black man who couldn't enter a whites-only restaurant to mail a letter, and having a brother who speaks of dog-tagging an equal number of dead white and black Americans in Vietman, Buchanan clearly has no time for racial discrimination. He writes about welfare depriving black Americans of their dignity, and even suggests that an ammendment prohibiting racial discrimination be added to the US Constitution.Other than the pleasure of glimpsing into the life of a man I greatly respect, I took from this book many lessons about where our new and supposedly more advanced society fails. By deemphasizing personal responsibility and blaming our problems on society, we're creating a generation of excuse-makers and softies. By acquiescing to anybody's ideas and summarily treating all ideas as equal, we replace values with anything-goes. When people don't have something to believe in, they don't believe in nothing; they believe in anything. There are many more nuggets in this book."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Pat gives a heartwarming story about his family, and how the family is important to childhood. This book is filled with anecdotes; some happy, some funny, and some sad. The reader will get to know the author, as well as his family, in this well-crafted book.As a college student, I view Pat as a fatherly figure children can look up to. He is NOT a hate monger like so many from the left and the media portray him to be. He is a traditional, old-fashioned American conservative who believes deeply in family values. Although Pat sometimes takes his views to extremes, he does so because he cares deeply about them.Pat is a dedicated American that MAINSTREAM voters should turn to as our next President. He is a good role-model for children, and truly believes in the government helping people empowering themselves-not the people empowering the government.Read the book. It is a good read from a very talented writer. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"A charming tale of a young boy growing up in 1950s Washington, DC.

Right From the Beginning paints the picture of a man starkly in contrast with the media portrayal of the former presidential candidate."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"This so-called &quot;mainsteam media&quot; LOVES to attack Buchanan. If you believe what they say of him, then his autobiography will totally change your view. He writes some of the best commentaries that I have ever read, and this book proves his writing talent. One of the better books out there."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Right from the Beginning offers great insight into the human side of Pat Buchanan. Buchanan details his life from his childhood in Chevy Chase, Maryland to his days as Director of Communications in the Reagan White House. Buchanan speaks for Main Street Americans from the heart. This is the way America was intended to be. An outstanding book that will arrest your attention. You will not want to put Right from the Beginning down after starting. A must read for all REAL Americans!"},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Pat tells it like it is, growing up in the 1950s, dealing with the liberal 60's, and offers new ideas for today. My favorite part of the book was in the back, where Pat offers about 10 key points to his platform. For instance, Buchanan supports lifting the term limits of the presidency. There are lots of other interesting tidbits you'll find buried in the book, and it is highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Pat Buchanan was easily the most electrifying person in theRepublican primary. In his book, &quot;Right From The Beginning&quot;,he explains where he came from, what he believes, and why hebelieves it so strongly. His love for America is clear.Whether you agree with him or not, you will respect himafter reading this book."},{"Title":"Right from the Beginning","review":"Buchanan provides an insightful and entertaining account of growing up in the 50's. Family, honor &amp; religion are returned to their old central positions (unknown to kids who grew up in the last 3 or 4 decades of the 20th century) and his story is told in a rollicking and educational way.Who'd a thunk that DC had communities of hard working middle class folks (to believe the media is to KNOW DC is a breeding ground for lowlife scum)and that their adolescent angst was tempered by faith in their elders and their religion!If I had to recommend an history teacher to my local college prep academy (and my pool of choices was folks who are active media personages) I'd strongly endorse Buchanan. He has the Irish gift of great storytelling which he combines with a weath of experience and keen insight.Finally, to read Buchanan is to recognize the diabolical falure of the American Media cartel. It doesn't take long at all for a reader to recognize that here is a man like themselves --- not the fascist dragon of McCarthyism that the media sells us."},{"Title":"Total Immersion","review":"This is the second book I have read by Allegra Goodman. Last year I read her beautiful novel &quot;Kaaterskill Falls&quot; which was a deserving National book Award finalist. In that work, which was a much more serious one than this earlier book, she depicted in beautiful detail the struggles within a small Jewish religious community. This has sent me back to her earlier books. &quot;Total Immersion&quot; is her first, a collection of short stories which Ms. Goodman published at the age of 21. To put it quite simply, I am just astounded at the talent and insight into a broad range of human types and settings which this writer has shown at the tender age of 21! She writes with total maturity and self-assurance. In these stories she again explores the world of small (mostly Jewish) communities in a variety of settings, mainly in Hawaii of all places! The stories are light in touch and always a pleasure to read. The characters and conflicts are well drawn and all balloons of pretension are mercilessly punctured by the author's delightful wit. Ms. Goodman has also included an extremely handy glossary at the back of her book with all the Jewish and Hawaiian terms used in her stories. Now I can't wait to read &quot;The Family Markowitz&quot; (her next collection) and I am eager to see what she will produce to follow the wonderful &quot;Kaaterskill Falls&quot;."},{"Title":"Total Immersion","review":"I loved Goodman's Kaaterskill Falls, which I thought was truly magical. I was not as pleased with this book. I felt that the stories were disjointed and the characters not particularly well-developed. I was hard pressed to hear the beautiful voice Goodman fashioned for herself in her later works."},{"Title":"Total Immersion","review":"Did she really write these stories at 21? I'm seething with envy. Allegra Goodman is everything the back cover promised - gifted, brilliant, swift to get to the truth of things. She's also full of gentle irony and very, very perceptive. I must, however, say that the fact that the stories in the book deal with almost exclusively Jewish characters may somewhat hinder its being enjoyed by readers unfamiliar with that religion and background. But, all in all, it is a wonderful collection of stories both intelligent and tremendously funny."},{"Title":"Violet (Seven Brides Series)","review":"I have just finished reading VIOLET.

But the tranformantion into someone who can love from someone who didn't feel he deserved to be loved was wonderfully touching.

This is about Jeff & Violet.Description from the back of the book:Broken and bitter, Jefferson Randolph could never forget all he had lost in the War Between The States--or forgive those he had fought. Long after most of his sex brothers had found wedded bliss, the former Rebel soldier kept himself buried in work, only dreaming of one day marrying a true daughter of the South. Then a run-in with a Yankee schoolteacher taught him that he had a lot to learn about passion.Violet Goodwin was too refined and genteel for an ornery bachelor like Jeff. Yet before he knew it, his disdain for Violet was blossoming into desire. But Jeff feared that love alone wasn't enough to help him put his past behind him--or to convince a proper lady that she could find happiness as the newest bride in the rowdy Randolph clan.*** I love this series but so far it's my least favorite. It was still good but just didn't measure up to the others. I wasn't big on the setting & I kept getting the impression that the author forgot at some points that Jeff only had 1 arm. At one point he said that Jeff grabbed Violet by the shoulders & turned her to face him which I guess could be possible but then at the end of the book in an intimate moment \\"His HANDS were soft but strong\\". I also felt that there were a few loose ends left when the book was over. I wanted to see the Rodeo & find out what happened with the twins & a few of the others but it never happened. Well, although this wasn't my favorite it was still good & I highly recommend this series.P.S. Leigh Greenwood is a male author & not a female.

They fought their attraction but knew it was hopeless. You have to read this book even if you haven't read the others. It explains so much of emotional suffering and the happiness that can be discovered when you are not looking for it.

Yet their damaged inner child makes him feel incapable of loving or worthy of being loved.Jeff Randolph, bright and sensitive, believed strongly in the cause of the southern states and just as strongly that war was not the way to resolve the problem. His father taunts him for being a coward and threatens to kill him himself if he doesn't fight. Jeff does the only thing he can do and follows his older brother George into the conflict. In doing so he loses his left arm and spends the rest of his time in a yankee prison camp.Returning home, Jeff already riddled with feelings of inadequacy, uses his disability to keep other people from getting close. He despises Yankees and his only dream is to return to the family home in Virginia and the gentle life he once knew. And of course a gentle southern belle to go with it.Jeff finds his place as the family banker. He sees it as a means to obtain his dream. Family obligation lands him in the middle of a quarantine at his nieces school. There he finds the most irritating Yankee woman who not only sees beyond his disability but finds something in him to love as well. Through his insecurity he drives her away and in doing so realizes he can't live without her. When tragedies strike he comes through for both his family and his woman. Violets unconditional love and his own courage opens his heart to love of himself, his lady, and his family, dispelling his father's legacy forever."},{"Title":"Violet (Seven Brides Series)","review":"The sparring between Violet & Jeff keeps u wondering when they will finally give in to liking each other ..

You can't read one without them all, as they are all truly part of each other.I really like the fact that the author is a man. It is a nice chance from the ordinary and goes to show that anyone (male or female) can do what they set themselves out to do."},{"Title":"Violet (Seven Brides Series)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this book. It's right up there withLaurelin my favorite books.To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to reading this particular brother's story. Jeff was so unpleasant in the previous books of this series that I wondered how on earth Leigh Greenwood would manage to make a hero out of him. Well, I think Leigh succeeded. Jeff comes across as the tortured hero all right, but his actions speak more for habit than anything else--a fact pointed out by Violet on more than one occasion. I have to say that his constant hang-ups about \\"Yankees\\" got rather annoying but he did finally see the light, so I'll let it go.Violet was far more likable than I was expecting. Perhaps it was the fact that she was a little older than most heroines in romances today, but she seemed far more sensible and level-headed. Not that she didn't have spirit or a temper; she just knew how to control herself. I really liked her.My biggest complaint has to be the tiny, and I mean tiny, part of the story that dealt with Violet's uncle's silver mine claim. It felt like it was added as an afterthought, almost as if the publishers didn't think there was enough suspense in this story. I think it would have been a wonderful story without it. But, that's just my opinion.This story contains graphic love scenes."},{"Title":"The Mole Sisters and the Question","review":"it was funny when thay thought that thay were fish and other things (This review is by a six-year-old reader.)"},{"Title":"The Mole Sisters and the Question","review":"I am a big fan of this series.

In this one Agatha and James set up housekeeping in a neighbouring village in order to catch a murderer. This is enough to get Agatha going over the deep end and she imagines all kinds of scenarios with her and James. It turns out they do catch the killer in the end, and they go back to their own village. The story doesn't end there though, and Ms. Beaton keeps you hanging at the end of the book for the next installment."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"Very good mystery. Beaton has a way of creating characters that you either loath or love. She accomplished this even more than usual in The Walkers of Dembley. And, as usual, Agatha was up to her old tricks.

Bundle up and enjoy."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"Fans of this long running series (19 books and counting) who, like this reader have not read them in order, will delight in this introduction of Sir Charles Fraith who will (has) figured so prominently in some of the later books. THE WALKERS OF DEMBLEY is also a pivotal story in the ongoing romance between Agatha and James.As the story opens it is six months since the events of AGATHA RAISIN AND THE POTTED GARDENER. Agatha is just completing her agreed upon six month return to the London PR world. She had discovered that she had not lost her talent for PR but that she missed her new life in Carsely too much to even consider coming out of retirement on a permanent basis. When she returned to Carsely so discovered that she too had been missed by her new friends in the village, and perhaps even a bit by her next door neighbor James. In hopes losing some of the unwanted pounds that London living had put on and, as always, in pursuit of James, Agatha joins the newly organized walking club which quickly leads to yet another investigation for her and James.This is a wonderful addition to the series, one that should not be missed by any fans of the later books. Those new to the series might be better off beginning with AGATHA RAISIN AND THE QUICHE OF DEATH (the first in the series) although this one could be read and enjoyed on it's own. Longtime fans of the later books might be a bit surprised to discover a slightly different Sir Charles than the one that appears in later books."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"all the agatha raisin books are a delight to read. you just want to take a break with a cup of tea, and see what trouble she gets herself into with each new book in the series. buy them all. and now they are on CD's - of course only get unabrdiged - they are mysteries, you know"},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"I found Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley to be a much less successful book than the earlier three books in the series. The mystery can barely qualify as one. Agatha is an unpleasant terror for much of the book (which makes for less than happy reading). The new characters are unsympathetic. The victim is particularly so.So should you read the book? Yes, you're stuck. The book contains a lot of development in the Agatha Raisin-James Lacey relationship that will leave you high and dry if you skip Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley. Sorry.During Agatha Raisin and the Vicious Vet, Agatha agreed to work in PR again in London in exchange for surreptitious help with her ruined garden. As this book opens, Agatha is finishing up her six-month stint in London at Pedmans, the firm that bought out her PR old firm. It's been an unpleasant experience and her final dinner leaves a bad taste for everyone but the client.In Dembley (part of Gloucestershire), the cause-devoted, militant Jessica Tartinck is organizing the Dembley Walkers (a ramblers society) into another planned confrontation with a landowner who has blocked the public way while armed with a shotgun. Jessica savors the chance to make a splash. The others aren't so enthusiastic. After that meeting, her written challenge to Sir Charles Fraith is returned with an invitation to tea if the ramblers will avoid one of his fields that has been planted. Jessica's friend Deborah Camden is sent to check out the path. Jessica decides to ask permission first and captures the attention of Sir Charles who asks for her telephone number. Thoroughly charmed, Deborah recommends that they go along with Sir Charles and the other ramblers agree . . . except for Jessica who decides to challenge him on her own.Meanwhile, Agatha returns to Carsely and finds that her handsome next-door neighbor, middle-aged bachelor James Lacey, has also been leading walks. She immediately joins the group and irritates him again by trying to organize things.Soon thereafter, Jessica is found murdered in Sir Charles' field and a witness places Sir Charles in the vicinity. Concerned for her new friend, Deborah calls on her friendship with Mrs. Mason, head of the Carsely Ladies Society, seeks to engage Agatha to find the killer. Before long, Agatha and James are operating undercover, posing as a married couple, to penetrate the Dembley Walkers.In the process, Agatha finds it frustrating to be pretending what she so desperately wants . . . to be Mrs. James Lacey. James, in turn, finds the whole matter even more annoying for different reasons.Before the book ends, Agatha finds herself in a race to stop a murder.Those who like romantic mysteries with an emphasis on \\"romantic\\" may find this book to be a four-star effort."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"In the fourth book in the Agatha Raisin series, our heroine is again put right in the middle of a vicious murder.

Of course, Agatha finds herself miserable, and finds that living with James is not the romantic getaway that she had hoped for.This series is one of my favorites and this book shows Agatha at her finest.

They seldom have any trouble finding conflict especially with their pushy, outspoken and obnoxious leader Jessica Tartinc leading the charge. As this book begins Jessica has gone too far even for her followers and she heads off to confront a local aristocrat on her own. When her body is found on said aristocrat's land the suspect list includes not only the gentry but also the walkers themselves. Because one of the walkers is the niece of Mrs. Mason, the President of the Carsely Ladies Society, and has therefore heard of Agatha and her amateur sleuthing Agatha's assistance is requested. Needless to say, this gives a big boost to Agatha's ego but by the end of the book she finds out that maybe the reference that she received wasn't nearly as complimentary as she had thought.Much to Agatha's delight, the strategy decided upon requires her and her neighbor James Lacey to move into a flat in Dembley and pose as husband and wife in order to infiltrate the group of walkers. Agatha, who has been chasing Lacey since the first book of the series is soon dejected however because her pretend marriage just doesn't work out at all like she had planned. Unknown to her however she is much more attractive to James when she isn't trying to get her claws into him and he becomes more and more fond of her as the book progresses. This part of the plot in fact leads to a bombshell of sorts at the end of this book, which will leave the reader very anxious to get their hands on the next entry in the series.Despite the bombshell however this is probably the least enjoyable of the first four books in this series. The mystery itself plays a much larger part in this story than in the previous books, which would at first glance appear to be a good thing. Unfortunately the mystery is not suspenseful or for that matter interesting enough to carry the plot on it's own and all of the little side plots that involve the other characters in the book fall very flat. The problem may well be that for the most part the old comfortable characters in Carsely are basically absent from this book leaving only the new characters introduced for this book and quite frankly most of these new characters are fairly wretched creatures. It is really hard to get involved in a story when most every person involved makes your skin crawl. The whole notion of a cozy mystery is sort left by the wayside when there is absolutely nothing cozy about the story or it's characters.I am a great fan of this series and if you intend to read any of the books following this one then this is a must read because of the interaction between Agatha and James. Just don't be at all surprised if after reading this book you find that instead of feeling all warm and fuzzy, like your supposed to feel after reading a cozy mystery, you just feel numb."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"This is another winner from M.C. Beaton, but not as good as many of her other works. Unlike nearly all of her other works, this is not subtable for a very young audience as it deels with issues of sex and sexuality.

It took me a while to figure out what was bothering me and I finally realized that Agatha, in this book, had resorted to namecalling in her insults and some of those names are quite vicious. She has in all the books been quite tart with others but in this one, she is downright vicious.The leader of a rambling group (a group of people who get together to walk &amp; enjoy the country) from a nearby village is murdered. A friend's niece is one of the suspects and she asks Agatha to investigate. Agatha, naturally, agrees to do so and she &amp; James go undercover as a married couple in the nearby village.The suspects are plenty and none of them are likeable. Not even any of the secondary characters are that nice.I would hesitate to pick up the next book in the series if it were not for the cliffhanger ending of this one."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"I love Agatha Raisin. M.C. Beaton has created one of the finest character studies of small provincial towns I have come across. I've found myself laughing aloud several times with each book that I pick up and I bless Beaton for that.In her previous three stories, the mysteries have stood second stage to Raisin's interactions with people in the town. And that was just fine. But here it seems that Beaton is attempting to turn Raisin into a bumbling Mrs. Marple alluded to in every story. But it doesn't work. Beaton just can't set up a mystery on par with Christy and in her efforts to do so, Beaton sacrifices much of what was so enduring about her first three Raisin stories.I did not especially like this book though I plan on reading more Raisin novels in the hopes that Beaton once again captures the magic of her past triumphs."},{"Title":"Agatha Raisin and the Walkers of Dembley (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 4)","review":"AS usual I enjoyed another Agatha Raisin doing her thing. Her thing this time also gets her really involved with James Lacey. Agatha has returned to Cotswold village after six months in London. She is not back long before someone murders one of the walkers of dembley, a group that gets together and walks on the weekend. They follow old trails that have since been planted in crops. The farmers, of course, do not like this as it destroys their fields. After one is killed, another is killed. Who could be doing this? One of the walkers, one of the farmers, a lover? Agatha and Lacey keep asking questions until they figure it our. Or do they? I can see the village and the people in my mind as I read.

I have not been reading them in sequence and I am really glad I did not read this one first. I did not find this story as interesting as the others in the series that I have read. This story lacked the humor that I am accustomed to from M. C. Beaton's other books.This story deals with class prejudice.It is about a group of Walkers from Dembley, England more often called Ramblers in this story. This is no ordinary group of ramblers that like to ramble in the countryside. This group is described as an odd bunch of leftists who like to demand their walking rights and aggravate aristocratic landowners by trespassing on their private property. In the group are teachers, waiters, an IRA sympathizer, and a male chauvinist.The group has a major falling out with the leader, Jessica. Jessica is a bully and Marxist sympathizer. Jessica wants the group to trespass on Sir Charles' property. The others refuse so Jessica decides to walk by herself and is found murdered. Agatha Raisin and James Lacey go undercover and discover by accident the real murderer. Unfortunately, this happens after a second member of the group is found murdered.All the members of the walking group plus Sir Charles are prime suspects. Sir Charles is a ladies' man and has an interest in one of the ramblers, Deborah.It is Deborah who convinces Agatha to help Sir Charles by finding the real killer so that Sir Charles would no longer be a prime suspect.Agatha is a middle aged PR professional and amateur detective. Throughout most of the book she creates a fantasy romantic life with her neighbor James Lacey. She eagerly suggested that she and James should pose as husband and wife and infiltrate the Dembley Ramblers so they could learn more about the characters involved.James for most of the story is indifferent towards Agatha. He likes being a bachelor.

This one is as good as the others in the series -- although the first one, Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death, is the best.I suspect I liked the first book best because James Lacey played so little a part of it. The biggest mystery in this book, as in all of the them, is what lively, clever Agatha sees in the priggish James Lacey. He's a snob and a pill. There are women who think they're nothing without a man -- even one as boring as Lacey -- but Agatha certainly doesn't strike me as one.

Being a rather cranky, middle-aged female myself, I found Agatha charming in her cantankerousness. The writing is amusing without being cloying, and I actually chuckled aloud several times.

One is the mother who bore her. The other is the mother who raised her. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the story begins in Poland where Eliza Wolf, a young Polish Jew, is living a hardscrabble life as a member of the resistance.Eliza soon comes to the realization that fighting and motherhood do not go hand and hand, so rather than risk the life of her year old daughter, Mina, she comes to a decision that will haunt her all of her life. She entrusts her daughter to the only person she knows in the rural Polish village of Kowitz, a gentile named Wanda Zbyszek, who happens to be a laundress and the town whore. Eliza vows she will return to reclaim Mina after the war.The fates intervene, and Eliza arrives too late to claim Mina, as Wanda has wrongly assumed Eliza to be a victim of the holocaust. Consequently, Wanda and MIna have left the chaos of post-war Poland, finding a means of getting to America. There, Wanda changes her name and re-invents herself, becoming the woman she always felt herself to be. It is in America that Wanda, now known as Maria, raises Mina, who remains ignorant of her past.Meanwhile, after fruitlessly searching for her daughter to no avail, Eliza eventually emigrates to Israel, where she, too, creates a life for herself, but always in her heart there is a great sadness for the daughter whose fate is unknown to her. Although she marries and has two other children, she grieves still for the daughter she knew only briefly.Once again, however, the fates intervene. Mina will go on a journey that is born out of sorrow but will end in great joy, as the veil to her past is lifted in a way that she could never have imagined. This is simply a well-written, superlative novel that tells a spellbinding story that will hold the reader in its thrall.

Wanda shelters and protects the child, and when she migrates to the United States after the war,she assumes a new name and identity, as Maria Prychek, and takes Mina with her as her daughter.Eliza fights against the Nazis in the forests of Poland, but after the war is unable to locate Mina and Wanda. She migrates to the fledgling re-established State of Israel, that is fighting for her life, which is attacked by five Arab armies. She then marries and establishes a string of hotels in Israel.We read of the fates of both families and of Mina whose path takes her to Israel, just before the Six Day War, when Israelis feared for their survival and that of their country. As the armies of the Arab powers surrounded Israel and large mobs in Cairo and Damascus cried out for Jewish blood. she meets Eliza and her son, but they do not recognize each other as mother and daughter.Events later unfold leading to the partial discovery of Wanda's identity and visits between the USA, Poland and Israel, as the truth is slowly but engagingly brought to life and the ends tied up.

W W II was before my time, but I remember most other events related in the book. Haddad's strength is in character development and bringing to life Israel and Jewish life. I cared about Mina, Wanda and Eliza and for days I was lost in this story.I read it again in my early 40s. While it is a great story, it feels like Haddad spent a lifetime writing for teenagers and made her first steps into adult fiction with &quot;A Mother's Secret,&quot; which is unsuitable for teenagers because of content and a sprinkling of the F*** word. Many heavy subjects, such as Mina's conversion, which could have been a short story by itself, was written in a light, breezy tone and passed on.Mina's first meeting with her mother was unconvincing. I did not believe Eliza would not recognize her, especially if she looked &quot;just like Paula Feurstein.&quot; Same first name, Polish, Jewish, looks like her aunt...Eliza would have had to have been an imbecile not to catch on (I wonder if Haddad is a mother herself).Take &quot;A Mother's Secret&quot; for the great story that it is and don't expect a literary style that rivals Hemingway or Steinbeck.

I would say that any criticisms lodged here against this interesting work, from the typical Japanese Nationalists trolls whose primary ambition is to share their confusion with others, should be completely ignored.Every legitimate WWII historian, including not a few brave scholars in present-day Japan, understand and accept the basic facts and figures surrounding the Nanjing Massacre and the trail of brutality that led from Shanghai in 1937-38. The documentation is extensive, from numerous Western eyewitness accounts to intercepted Japanese diplomatic cables. Magazine accounts of these events can easily be found in Western libraries and even on eBay. Yet Japanese nationalists want us to believe that a massive \\"conspiracy\\" has led to an \\"untrue version\\" of the Massacre. But the conspiracy rests solely with JAPAN, not the Allied Nations. Nationalists will point you to absurd Japanese press coverage of post-massacre Nanjing, which is nothing more than skewed occupation propaganda. Likewise, published revisionist accounts by Imperial Army officers in Nanjing, offered in defense of the nationalist position, are usually no more than denials or excusals for their own indifference during the Massacre.The fact that a member of the Imperial House is accused of being a primary instigator of the Massacre is of utmost concern to Japanese nationalists. But the Nanjing Massacre should not be considered as unusual conduct for a Japanese military that also brutalized Manchuria, Hong Kong, and Singapore citizens, killed over 200,000 laborers on the Death Railway from Thailand to Burma, and ravaged innumerable Philippine villages, culminating in the Rape of Manila. The Imperial Army's abandonment of their own conscripted settlers in Manchuria and mass slaughter of Okinawans in 1945 also speaks of the evil that pervaded Japan's military before and during WWII. You can go to any of these places, talk to the survivors and still see physical evidence of Japanese military atrocities. Yet Japanese nationalists, often motivated by insecure needs to believe in a delusional glory of the past, deny anything that would place Japan's military actions in a bad light. The question is why citizens of the world should trust such revisionists who essentially possess the same arrogance and racism of the former militant regime which they extoll and worship? We should not.While I have great fondness for Japanese culture and people, I am dismayed by the distorted histories that are still found today in their own schools. Many Japanese I talk to say they learn of Japan's real WWII past only in college. Japan today should not be judged by the ridiculous extremists who comment here and those old men in high places who try to suppress their national shame. The good news is that with more internationalization, young Japan is slowly coming to grips with their past. Recent TV doramas such as \\"Song of the Canefields\\" (reciting Imperial Army atrocities in Okinawa), have educated many young Japanese better than the heavily-edited history textbooks in ther schools. The recent actions of fanatical extremists in Hiroshima and anti-Japanese sentiments during football matches in China also have placed Japan on notice as to their obligations to resolve past offenses."},{"Title":"The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography (Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes)","review":"I am a Chinese and I have read some books and watched some videos about the Nanjing Massacre.

Don't forget that it happened only 60 years ago and the survivers hasn't died out. If you want to lie, please wait to those people pass away.Secondly, what is the casue of the war? Did China invaded Japan? Tell me which one happened frist, Pearl Harbor or bombing of Tokoy? Why there are 3 million Japanese troops stayed in China during 1937-1945? What did they do? Were they in vacations?Third, why there are millions of Japanese \\"residents\\" lived in Machuran, or the northeast part of China? And Why they could occupy most of the land, forcing Chinese people to leave? Why the Japanese \\"residents\\" did not pay tax to local Chinese government but pay tax to the Japense troops?

Moreover, the fact of the Japanese government which distorted history and referred to the 1937-38 Nanjing massacre (an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people were killed) by the innocuous title of \\"incident\\" is absolutely outrageous!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography (Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes)","review":"In 1997, historian Iris Chang resurrected American memories of what was once a sensational scandal. In \\"The Rape of Nanking,\\" she gathered stories and pictures of the Imperial Japanese Army's conquest of that city in 1937, when it was the capital of China.Her book was a best-seller, and other Chinese-Americans also were documenting and publicizing these events, though with less impact than Chang's.But if Americans had almost forgotten the Rape of Nanking, neither the Chinese nor the Japanese had. \\"The Nanjing Massacre\\" brings together essays by three young historians exploring the historical interpretations of the event in China (by Mark Eyholt), in Japan (by Takashi Yoshida) and in the academy (by Daqing Yang).Chang's book was attacked by Japanese militarists. \\"The Nanjing Massacre\\" is a good place to start evaluating these criticisms, which were mostly unfounded.What Yoshida calls \\"Japanese conservatives\\" have denied the massacre, or, if admitting some small atrocities occurred, claim they were no worse than things done to the Japanese.None of the essayists doubts the Japanese slaughtered, raped, looted and burned their way across Nanking (or Nanjing) city and province. But they do doubt the honesty, clarity and reliability of the writing of the event's history on all sides.Eyholt reports that Chinese governments, both Nationalist and Communist, have generally found reasons to play down the massacre. The Communists have preferred to ignore it, and declined to seek compensation, because the regime has wanted economic cooperation with Japan.The level of cynicism displayed by the People's Republic government and the Chinese Communist Party is hardly surprising but nonetheless breathtaking: In the early '50s, the Communists blamed westerners in Nanking for aiding the Japanese. The truth was, any Chinese who survived did so because the Japanese were afraid of Western public opinion.In the '80s, Chinese students began investigating the massacre and publicizing it. Throughout the 20th century, from the May 5 movement in 1919 to the pressure on Chiang Kai-shek to resist the Japanese invasion of 1937, Chinese public opinion has been uniformly anti-Japanese and far more nationalist than the governments have been.The situation in Japan, as reported by Yoshida, is as would be expected. Japanese public opinion is overwhelmingly against admitting or apologizing for the massacre.The governments, the courts and what Yoshida calls \\"progressives\\" (a jumble of democrats, old socialists and decent people) hold the formal control of organs of \\"public opinion.\\" Government ministers who say the massacre never happened are forced to resign.But books exonerating Japanese war criminals outsell books telling honestly of the war in China by a hundred to one.Americans have invested a thousand times as much effort in understanding the Holocaust as they have in understanding Japanese war crimes. But editor Joshua Fogel warns against easy comparisons between the two forms of genocide. They are, the essayists agree, not directly comparable crimes.A great deal of the controversy has surrounded the exact total of rapes and murders. China has settled on a figure of 300,000 slain.Japanese revisionists have attacked this statistic. They argue that if they can show that the numbers were inflated, that would prove the massacre never happened at all.Anyhow, the relevant answer is not a number. The answer to \\"How many Chinese were killed at Nanking?\\" is \\"all of them.\\"All three essayists miss this point, which is, after all, the main one. Yang, in particular, surrenders to the fascists on the question of responsibility.Now that the story is falling out of the hands of the participants and into the hands of the professional historians, the fundamental problems not only do not receive better answers, they are being wrongly answered.The most egregious example concerns the extent to which higher levels of the Japanese army and government were aware of and tolerated or ordered the rampage.Historian Yang looks for a piece of paper either implicating or exonerating some group or other, though the answer is obvious to anyone. The fact -- and it is a fact -- that the Japanese exterminated almost a whole province, except about 200,000 Chinese who managed to crowd under the shelter of American and European flags, proves as much as anyone could want that the Rape of Nanking was calculated, deliberate policy of the army and the government."},{"Title":"The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography (Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes)","review":"It is so amusing how long Chinese and pro-Chinese Whites praise Iris Chan's fabricated photos and testimonies.

There weren't more than 300,000 Chinese in Nanking then.2.)

Throughout history, the Japanese have always waged war and rationed hurt to humanity. Perhaps this aggression stems from a Napoleonic Complex due to the men's generally effeminate physiques. The Japanese have one allegiance, and that's to their Emperor(Hirohito). By the emperor's own account, Japan \\".. a beautiful country built from the geniuses of other nations,\\" But let's be fair...Japan has made contributions for mankind; For example, hundreds of lives(some argue thousands, but it's been proven to be a gross exaggeration) were sacrificed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki to prove to the world that nuclear weaponry is much more devastating if you're hit with not one, but TWO A-Bombs. It's no wonder that many so-called \\"American\\" Japanese were put into internment camps. Indeed, it is not hard to surmise that the U.S.atomic bombings on Japan were not only a means to end the war, but more so to discipline a nation that harbored murderous intentions of killing innocent people and spreading their growth-stinted genes to women of different races, thus cursing the rest of humanity . War is always terrible, always great, but during the span of one week in 1945, angels took the forms of B-29s, ensuring that a hateful generation would never threaten peace-loving, civilized societies."},{"Title":"The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography (Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes)","review":"if it's true, they will be a tokyo massacretoo sad and brutal"},{"Title":"The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography (Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes)","review":"In China, a dynasty's history is written by its conqueror so that the conquest is totally justified.At Tokyo Trial, a.k.a. International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the Allied powers, especially the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union and China, did the same thing to Japan.To justify their own atrocities against the Japanese civilians, such as the U.S.A.'s atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other carpet bombimgs with napalm on over 60 cities of Japan, Soviet Union's unlawful attack on the Japanese residents in Manchuria, lots of, lots of \\"more barbaric crimes\\" were needed to be fabricated at the trial.Furthermore, most importantly, the fabricated history should be regarded as \\"legally\\" validated truths.In the following 7 year occupation of Japan, the Supreme Comander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) and the General Head Quarter (GHQ) ran a \\"brain washing\\" programme called \\" War Guilt Information Programme\\" in order to \\"disarm\\" Japanese fighting spirit that concerned the U.S. authority a lot. It completed with the meticulous censorship that covered over the whole madia, publications and education. Even the very existence of the censorship was completely concealed.I have to admit that the \\"brain washing\\" have been very successful as regards the whole world still believe the judgments of the trial are all true, with the exception of some patriotic Japanese scholars and researchers who are trying to refute the unjust accusations Japan had to accept.By the way, I rated this book with 3 stars just because it has good, extensive bibliography including the books that demonstrate how the Tokyo Trial proceeded one-sidedly, that how the \\"Nanking Massacre\\" story have been fabricated for the propaganda purposes and that debunk most of those alleged atrocities of the Japanese Imperial Army.Not to mention the contemporary documents that, in fact, admit no massacre was actually witnessed by those \\"objective\\" foreigners other than the Chinese Army propagandists.In fact, according to a document written by the Chinese prosecutor of Nanking Justice Court, when the Court sent people to interview citizens of Nanking after the war ended, almost nobody accused the Japanese Army. Furthermore, some even claimed that the atrocities occurred in Nanking were, actually, done by the Chinese Army.Those are the facts that every scholarly work should include at least for verification. And if you read those books, written by so-called \\"Massacre Denial Fuction\\" authors like Higashinakano Shudo and Tanaka Masaaki etc..., you should get much more broader picture of what really happened in Nanking, December 1937.Unfortunately, however, the authors of this book simply dismissed the denial theses without examining them while ignoring their own misreading and misconception towards whole issue. Consequently, they grossly failed to make good counter-arguments to the denial theses. That means, I hate to say this but, this book is just another representative of \\"Nanking Massacre\\" theses that are unsubstantiated and sloppy, and yet emotional enough to make a forced analogy as if denying the \\"Nanking Massacre\\" is the same horrible act as the denial of the Nazi Holocaust.Precisely because of that belief, it appears, they would never come to think that the denial theses of the massacre may contain some truths, like Inquisitors never recognised the heliocentric theory.Maybe, it is these people who must face some painful truths, not the Japanese they are accusing."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"A reporter for Time magazine in the 1950's, Stanley Karnow witnessed the changes in French society as the country struggled to recover from the devastation of World War II and the maintenance of its colonial empire (eventually leaving Indochina and North Africa). Internally France coped with strikes, alienated youth, and the ineffectiveness of the Fourth Republic governments. The rest is there as well--the cafe culture, the love of wine, haute couture, the structured class system . . . Karnow tells us what he observed and experienced. As a foreign journalist, he observed everything and writes with a journalist's eye for detail. Married (and divorced) to a French woman, he also gives us insight into French family life and traditions. If you ever wanted to know what French life in the 1950's was like--told in form of a memoir--then this is the book for you. One caution: Some additional knowledge enhances the reading. When you read this book, you might want to have a Paris street map or travel guide handy."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"If you love France you will love this book.

What do the French think about food, work, wine, sex, intellectuals, language, fashion, Coca Cola? It is all here in this delightful book and it is not what Americans think. Yes, it is a report from a foreign country."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"The title of this excellent book is a misnomer. Although there is a great deal about Paris, the book as a whole rambles over much of France and even the Mediterranean. Beginning in the late 1940s when Karnow first went to Paris on the GI Bill to study and through much of the 1950s when he served with TIME in their Paris office Karnow lived in Paris. This book is a distillation of his memories and notes he kept from that period. Karnow, however, gives himself free rein to range over a host of topics, sometimes delving into French history, if it helps illuminate his topic. The result is a very personal view of France in the fifties. There is a great deal he doesn't discuss, such as French cinema and art in the decade. He writes of some of the literary figures, but not with any especial emphasis.The range of topics that are covered in the book are not encyclopedic but they are exceptionally varied. He will write about wine, food, crime, famous politicians, infamous politicians, housing, French manners, Algerian patriots, people he knew, and a host of other subjects. Some of the chapters could be anticipated, such as a long chapter on French wine and a tour through the French wine districts. Some are unexpected, like a chapter on a man who was the last in a line of hereditary executioners. There is a good deal of name dropping (folks like Samuel Beckett pop in for brief cameos), but not too much. He writes of people whose names remain famous, like Christian Dior, and of many others, especially colleagues, whose names are not so well known.One of the best things about the book is that while it may not give you all the facts about Paris and France in the fifties, it definitely gives you a feel for the time itself. It is also fascinating for what it reveals about the politics of the time. Karnow worked for TIME, which espoused a conservative Republican point of view (though more moderate than what would later characterize the late 1950s NATIONAL REVIEW), while Karnow himself was a liberal. In much of his political writing, therefore, one gets a sense of his take on one things on the one hand and the take of his employers, looking over his shoulder, on the other. The book therefore indirectly tells the story of how much of America felt about France during the fifties.I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested either in the years following the war or in France or Paris in general. It is entertaining and informative at the same time.I'd like to add that the photograph on the paperback edition of the book (and I supposed on the dust jacket of the hardback) is one of the most remarkable I have ever seen of Paris. A couple somewhere in Paris (the angles make it look to be somewhere east of Montmartre) looks over Paris with Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower off in the distance."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"I really enjoyed this book. While I won't go over the top and give it a five-star rating, I found it a fascinating look at both French culture and Europe immediately after WWII. The title is a bit misleading - the stories Karnow has to tell are not Paris-specific ans much as they are France-specific. The cultural landmarks one might expect - painters, writers, musicians,filmmakers - expats and natives alike - modernists who filled up city up after the war, during the '50's are notoriously absent, despite the interview-appearances of John Huston, Audrey Hepburn and Ernest Hemingway.Karnow was a stringer for Life Magazine during the '50's and was widely dispatched during his tenure. Rather than a history specifically about the city and its culture during the Eisenhower-era, this book is an omnibus of cultural information - the history of the guillotine, caf&eacute; culture, visits with the crown-princes and princesses of Hollywood, and the beginnings of Algerian resistance to French rule.Karnow's done a fine - and sometimes gripping - job of creating a *petit-histoire* keyhole for us to view his Parisian decade through. While it didn't necessarily cover the bases I had hoped for - (e.g. George Orwell's 'Down and Out in Paris and London')- it filled in a lot of the gaps that lead to the student uprisings in 1968. This book may or may not be for the French-cultural novitiate or for those seeking reprisals of Goddard films, but Karnow's account of Paris - his personal narrative - freights its own reward."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"Having lived in Paris during the late 'fifties, I was immediately attacted to the Karnow book by its title.

Paris has been called, with much justification, the world's capital of nostalgia... and if one has been fortunate to have seen it when one was young and in love, well... And then it was the \`50's, for some of us of a certain age, a decade that evokes nostalgia if you airbrush out the threat of nuclear annihilation, McCarthyism, the Korean War, the possibility of being stricken with polio at the beginning of the decade...I first came by Stanley Karnow by reading his quintessential book on the American war in VietnamVietnam: A History, shortly after it was published in 1984... just barely enough time after the war to provide some perspective. Rightly, he won the Pulitzer Prize for it. Scholarly and authoritative, Karnow cut through so many of the myths surrounding the war in ways that I had not seen done before by a \\"mainstream\\" journalist. Paris in the Fifties was published in 1997, and given his literary pedigree, and my Francophile nature, it was an essential read.And there is much to like if you are willing to just sit back and enjoy the times. Like many Americans of the post Second World War era, who followed their predecessors after the First World War, Karnow explained how they flocked to Paris to live in the excitement of the \\"city of light,\\" in often limited financial circumstances. This book is a collection of 21 vignettes, based on his dispatches to Time Magazine. However, as he says in the Preface, the stories appear in \\"greatly revised form,\\" so for me, the most fascinating part would have been the how and the why of the revisions, which, of course, you're not offered.As one would expect from a reporter who lived in France for a decade, there are articles on gastronomy and wine (\\"In Deepest Beaujolais.\\") A facet of the political system is covered by an article on Pierre Poujade, whose name would be lent to a movement of small shopkeepers and others who felt they were being left behind (Sarah Palin and the Tea Party?). He also devotes stories to French Guiana, the last man to operate the guillotine, youth, society's elite, and the crime beat. Karnow broke the news about the disaster at the Le Mans 24 hour auto race, when racers crashed into the crowd, killing 83 spectators. Naturally there is also a story on the French intellectuals who inhabited the cafes along St. Germain; his article takes its title from one of Simone de Beauvoir's novels:The MandarinsBut I had some major disappointments. One of the classic defects of a journalist's memoirs is the over injection of the comings and goings of the journalist and his friends, set against this \\"exotic backdrop.\\" There is far too much name dropping, and precious little insight into how the country works. He mentions the working class neighborhood of Belleville, that supplied so many supporters to the Commune, but do a story on it? No. Rather the tourist's familiar beat of St. Germaine. Karnow, who writes the classic book on the Americans in Vietnam was in Paris when Dien Bien Phu fell, ending the French involvement. There is really nothing on how this impacted the home front, or the military. His story on Ho Chi Minh, \\"Ce Petit Annamite\\" could have been downloaded from Wikipedia; it contained no personal insight, but was only a familiar regurgitation of his life, and then only to 1923! The Algerian War of Independence started in the same decade; his coverage is not insightful there either, and conveys little of the anguish of the struggle. Some of Karnow's historical formulations are skewed, to say the least. For example: \\"By July 1954 Premier Pierre Mendes-France had achieved peace in Indochina...\\" A strange peace indeed, the peace of the vanquished. And: \\"Tunisia had been a rich Roman province before its conquest by the Arabs...\\" What? What happened to the Punic wars, not to mention the occupation of North Africa by the Vandals after the fall of Rome. Several hundred years are missing in Karnow's statement. Did Tunisia go down hill after the Arabs got a hold of it? And there is the matter of all that un-translated French which might cause annoyance to the non-Francophones. (But it really is your fault, if you don't understand... I think Charles de Gaulle said that).Enjoy the nostalgia, and ponder how four decades might change your perspective. Since is IS Paris, I'll round up to 4-stars."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"A lively and vigorous memoir about the life and times in Paris, France and the Mediterranean.Added bonus: excellent drawings or sketches by Karnow's wife Annette.Kudos to Karnow's wife #1 for roughing it out in the USA."},{"Title":"Paris in the fifties","review":"I should have loved this book.I love travel memoirs, memoirs of life in foreign countries.I love Paris.I love journalism memoirs.This is a memoir about being an American journalist in Paris during the fifties.But the fact remains that I didn't love it.I liked it well enough, and there were many moments I found interesting and engaging.

Not a lot, just enough to know that if you have a lousy computer then the program will probably run equally as bad.With that out of the way, I cannot say enough good things about this program. I used an older version of DA Plus in school and was instantly hooked. Today, as a marathon runner and triathlete, I need to be able to analyze every aspect of my training- including nutrition. Coupled with a good sports nutrition book, DA Plus allowed me to create a nutrition plan that was perfectly tailored to my needs. The program's enormous database has nearly every food you can think of, plus you can create foods that might not be on the database. By entering in a daily menu, you can see exactly how well you're acheiving your nutritional goals. DA Plus has a wealth of printable charts that compare your daily intake against your goals. For example, I was able to determine that I was getting too much sodium and used the program to determine what foods were the culprits.You don't have to be a competitive athlete to appreciate DA Plus. I installed the program on my wife's computer and she absolutely loves it. Always conscious of her caloric intake (as are most people), DA Plus allows her to quickly determine her daily intake, allowing her to make quick adjustments to her diet. Plus, the huge database shows her what foods to avoid when we go out to eat at a restaraunt.In the end, this program is perfect for the individual who has done their homework, which can be acheived by purchasing any nutrition book.

Bunchy is quick to identify the blackmailer--but just as the blackmail plot seems about to unravel murder steps in, and Allen must not only uncover the blackmailer but a killer as well.As is often the case in a Marsh novel, some readers will spot the killer long before the book's finish--but as typical of Marsh, getting there is most of the fun. A number of favorites return in this novel, including painter Agatha Troy, previously introduced in ARTISTS IN CRIME, and Allen's charming mother; the novel also includes a number of romantic subplots that Marsh handles with considerable effectiveness. Neither newcomers nor old fans will be disappointed; recommended."},{"Title":"Death of a fool","review":"This is perhaps Ngaio Marsh's best example of an upper-crust English murder mystery. The characters are so finely drawn that it makes you wish they would show up in her other novels.

The mystery is rather intricate. Some of it is discernible IMHO, but some is not. The characters are interesting but some seem like charicatures. William Andersen's dialect was impossible to understand; many other characters (as usual in Marsh books) use many British idioms not readily understood in the US. But, these are annoyances only. \\"The Play's the Thing.\\" The 5 Sword Dance, a continuation of an ancient pagan ritual, is described in great detail. Interestingly, I was reading the entry on Dancing in the encyclopediaMan, Myth & Magic, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural 24 Volume Complete Set(orMan, Myth and Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (24-Vol. Set)) at the time! Synchronicity--per C. Jung (seeThe Tao of Psychology: Synchronicity and Self). There's a lot of psychology in Alleyn's solution to the case. What amazes me the most though is how people (assuming Marsh's characterizations are realistic) can be so foolish in dealing with a murder investigation. But, \\"it takes all kinds...\\" It's a pretty good mystery, I liked the ritual aspects, but not her best IMHO.

Unfortunately Lord Robert, known as Bunchy to his friends, is murdered after he discovers who is responsible for the blackmail. Alleyn now feels the case is personal and vows to track down the murderer if it is the last thing he does.This is a complex mystery involving some long hidden secrets and some very nasty characters who prey on people's weaknesses. Agatha Troy appears in this novel and Alleyn renews his attempts to persuade her to take him seriously as a possible husband. I enjoyed this book and found it difficult to work out who committed the murder as there are plenty of clues but plenty of red herrings too.If you like your crime novels in the classic mould then try this Ngaio Marsh.

Unfortunately, Bunchy gets too close to the truth and pays for it with his life, leaving Alleyn both distraught at the loss of a good friend and responsible for catching the killer.I've read nine Ngaio Marsh mysteries now, and overall I'm still struggling to understand why she's considered so good an author. Death in a White Tie is certainly more accomplished than some of her previous efforts. The clues are there for the alert reader, the plot mechanics fit together, and the writing is less clunky than Marsh's previous efforts. The 1930s setting has an exotic appeal for readers today and the book feels more open and real than, say, A Man Lay Dead.On the other hand, this is still a puzzle rather than a novel, where the solution depends on who was in what room when and whether the police can engineer a confession through a series of unlikely interviews. Having the police themselves point out how unlikely they are to succeed doesn't actually excuse it. None of the characters are particularly interesting or appealing, including Alleyn himself, and there's no real depth here. The book also feels unnecessarily long, padded out with a few too many characters and conversations. I can only guess that the rules of evidence in 1930s England weren't what they are now, because this isn't the way I'd want to see police behave.Alleyn is his usual self here: nobly lacerating his finer feelings to discharge his duty as a policeman and unprofessionally involving friends and family in his investigations. He is the only character permitted to solve even the slightest part of the mystery; no-one else is allowed to shine. It's made clear Alleyn has solved the mystery long before the reader is enlightened, as per usual, but when we aren't shown how his mind works this adds nothing to the book's interest. Alleyn also resumes his puzzling \\"romance\\" with Agatha Troy in this book, which leads to a fairly repellent exchange with his mother about what women want.As far as Golden Age mysteries set amongst the English upper classes go, this is pretty standard fare. It's pleasant enough for whiling away a couple of hours, but no more than that."},{"Title":"Death of a fool","review":"This is one of my favorite Marsh mysteries and I was delighted to find a CD audiobook version.

I wanted to find out how the romance between Inspector R. Allyn and Agatha Troy progressed as crimes were solved."},{"Title":"Vectorial mechanics","review":"This is by far the best book I know of that deals exclusively with Newtonian Mechanics. This book once brought the author a fair amount of fame because of its popularity, but nowadays virtually no one in American academia knows it ever existed.The author has explicitly based the whole treatment of Newtonian Mechanics, both Statics and Dynamics, on a set of axioms that he proposes at two parts in the book: one set of axioms is for Statics, which he treats first, and the second set of axioms is for Dynamics, which is treated in the second half of the book. He supports these axioms by referencing the idea that physics is based on empirical fact, and that empirical fact aligns well with these axioms. The author never loses sight of the fact that students might need to reference these axioms, and the principles derived from them----as such, he has carefully documented where many of these results can be found in the book, both in the index and elsewhere, and he has presented the principles themselves for easy study.The author has geared this book toward engineering majors, and as such many of the examples are from engineering----mostly Mechanical Engineering (ramps, levers, pulleys, trusses, etc). However, the author has made his treatment as mathematically general as possible for this level, short of introducing confusion. This is done by providing at least one example for EVERY physical principle in the book that was derived from the axioms. Further, the author undoubtedly had a profound knowledge of both Mechanics and learning it, as the examples are ingeniously chosen so that the reader gains the best understanding possible. What is also impressive, and something you will not find in virtually any Newtonian Mechanics text written today, is that the author employs both analytic and synthetic methods in the text (Physics problem solving with and without a coordinate system), and the author has miraculously found a way to give the reader a thorough understanding of each methods strengths and weaknesses------------this is marvelous. A problem I can foresee for the prospective reader, as I've encountered it myself, is that the text assumes the reader is fairly well acquainted with Descriptive Geometry, which is a synthetic geometry method that was once taught to all Mechanical Engineering majors; as a sidenote, a good book I've used to remedy my lack of knowledge in this subject is the 1946 edition of Ervin Kenison's \\"Mechanical Drawing\\", which covers both the basic Euclidean Geometry needed for Descriptive Geometry, and the methods required in Descriptive Geometry for this book.The homework exercises range from the easy to the difficult, and one can actually do them after reading the text material that accompanies them.However, and this is an important point: this text has, on average, exercises that are more difficult than the ones in modern American texts that are supposedly at the same level-------if you want a thorough understanding of Classical Mechanics this book may be for you, but if you want exercises that are simple so that you are never perplexed, look elsewhere. It is worth mentioning that the solutions to many (perhaps most) of the exercises can be found in the back of the book; this text would be excellent for serious self study without this, but its inclusion makes the text even better suited for that purpose."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I ordered the hardcover edition of this book from ... , and it is unfortunate that it is not readily available in the US. At least the softcover edition is now available, and worth acquiring for anyone interested in a glimpse of what life-and thought-was like nearly 4000 years ago. I was unaware, before reading this volume, that Gilgamesh, despite it's significance and popularity in its day, does not come down to us in any complete form. George provides both a background of the civilization that produced Gilgamesh and also a history of the various partial versions that have survived and been found. Throughout the text he is careful to explain where different versions disagree, where he has interpolated fragments from other versions to fill gaps, and where no known version exists. He appends translations of various fragments and of earlier Sumerian poems of &quot;Bilgames&quot;. While lacking the completeness, and therefore coherence, of the Homeric epics, George's translation of Gilgamesh offers at least a peephole, if not truly a window, into a civilization very far removed from ours. Despite the distance the desires and fears-particularly the fear of death-expressed seem very human and recognizable. In fact, and in spite of, the archaic structure of the verse, Gilgamesh seems more human to me than many of the semi-divine heros of Homer. Certainly not light reading, but very much worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This was the first translation of Gilgamesh that ever really grabbed me. I had waded through plodding, tedious translations (mostly in prose) before, and been left feeling like Assyriologists must be the most bored people in the world.George's translation, however, is in verse and adds vigor to what appeared to me, for years, to be a bland jumping off point for bigger and better epics of later eras. I flew through this translation, hanging on every word, and was almost sad to see it end.The notes and critical bits were nice as well, and the numerous lacunae showed me just how little of the full story we really have. Heartbreaking, really, and it made appreciate those bored people I used to pity.If you're new to The Epic of Gilgamesh and want an engaging, readable verse translation of it, this is the one to buy.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a fascinating tale of great historical importance. Composed 1500 years before Homer's epics, the story is one that modern man can readily understand and appreciate. Gilgamesh was the more than capable ruler of the ancient town of Uruk; his strength and physical beauty were unmatched by any in the land, and his subjects adored him. Although he possessed so much, Gilgamesh wanted desperately to live forever like a god. He was two-thirds god and one-third human, but he refused to accept his destiny to die. If it were his lot to die, he wanted to perform great deeds so that his name would never be forgotten.The story opens with the story of Enkidu, a wild man of nature who was to become Gilgamesh's best friend and accompany him on his dangerous journeys. The first trip takes them to the Land of the Cedars where Gilgamesh sets out to kill Humbaba, the guardian of the forest. When he later slays the Bull of Heaven, the anger of the gods is turned upon him and Enkidu, leading to new suffering by Gilgamesh. In desperation, he seeks Utnapishtim in the land of the gods; Utnapishtim was granted eternal life after preserving mankind in the wake of a great flood. Gilgamesh again finds only heartache for his troubles. Returning to Uruk, he preserves the story of his journeys and deeds in writing, and it is, perhaps ironically, in this written record that Gilgamesh is recognized today for the great man he was.One learns much about the ancient gods in this tale, and the story of the great goddess Ishtar's role in the related events is pretty amazing. When Ishtar invited Gilgamesh to be her husband, he issued forth a litany of former lovers whom Ishtar had turned out and cursed, boldly rebuffing Ishtar's advances. It is this brave act that led to most of Gilgamesh's later troubles. Even Enkidu, whose reported bravery is belied by his reluctance to aid his noble friend in several situations, is rather astonishingly disrespectful to the goddess.N. K. Sandars does a remarkable job of putting the epic in its proper historical and literary perspective. A glossary of relevant gods and characters is particularly helpful. Along with providing a short history of the man, the gods, and the epic itself, she goes to great lengths to explain her method of producing this modern translation. There is no one extant copy of the Epic of Gilgamesh; a number of tablets, in varying degrees of condition and legibility and differing somewhat in the details of the story, have been compared and contrasted in order to produce the story as she presents it. Perhaps the most useful part of the introduction is an explanation of the form and style of the text. The text was originally told in verse, and Sandars explains that she chose to produce the text in narrative form in the interest of readability. As the order of events is not universally agreed upon, she explains why she chose the order she did for events. One annoying feature of the text, at least to the modern reader, is the constant word for word repetition of speeches between characters, and Sandars does the reader a great service by alerting him/her to this and explaining the rationale behind its use by the ancient writers.The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest written texts in history, yet its theme is timeless, its characters all too human, and its appeal universal. Sandars' modern, narrative translation transforms the historically important epic into an eminently readable, quite enjoyable story. The tale of a great flood in this incredibly ancient tale has raised eyebrows ever since the text was discovered. The parallels to the Biblical tale of Noah are obvious, adding great strength to the argument that the legend or memory of a cataclysmic flood was common to diverse cultures in the ancient Near East. Those familiar with the ideas of Zechariah Sitchin will find this story especially fascinating and illuminating."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story-- perhaps 4 thousand to 5 thousand years old. Originating in ancient Sumeria, it spread throughout the Near East and the version we have has been reconstructed from Akkadian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Hurrian translations inscribed on clay tablets. Its themes and motifs (including a divinely ordained Great Flood) influenced the development of other great poetic works and mythological traditions, including those of ancient Egypt, Israel, and Greece.The story here is mythic and powerful. I won't try to summarize it other than to say that it raises truly timeless questions about what it means to be human-- questions about love sex and friendship, about nature and civilization, of the simple joys in life and about our desire to do great deeds, about our fear of death and the impossiblity of escaping it.There is much about this story that may seem archaic, naive, and odd to first-time readers, ranging from the description of Gilgamesh as 2/3 god, 1/3 mortal (which may perplex folks who try to work out how that can happen hereditarily speaking), to the repetivite narrative voice that stem from the conventions of orally performed poetry (which does seem a bit odd when being *read* silently in a book). However, once one learns to see beyond these curious features, it is apparent that _The Epic of Gilgamesh_, as it has come down to us, is a brilliant and clever piece of poetic craftsmanship and storytelling. The use of recurrent images and motifs, the narrative symmetries and ironies (e.g. how, after Enkidu's death, Gilgamesh leaves the city, puts on animal furs, and goes off into the wilderness... becoming much like Enkidu was at the beginning of the story). In truth, I would not hesitate to say that the _Epic of Gilgamesh_ is, from a poetic point of view, as complex and sophisticated as any of Shakespeare's plays.The Penguin edition of the poem, I should add, offers a loose prose translation that is quite satisfactory and extremely readable. Those who are more interested in the stylistic qualities of the original may prefer a more literal translation, while those more interested in the history of the poem and its sources, may prefer a more scholarly edition-- but for the general or first time reader, Sandars' edition should be more than suitable."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read)."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Not having read scores of Gilgamesh translations, I really don't know how many stars to give this one, but I am very happy with it. In addition to giving a 'complete' version, mainly from Standard Babylonian texts from the Nineveh library but supplemented from other sources (even Hittite editions) for the sake of having a complete story, the book publishes in separate chapters, older, more fragmentary sources. Even Sumerian versions are covered. Also, in the beginning is an excellent treatment of the history of the rebirth of the Gilgamesh epic and the state of cuneiform translation and research in general. No speculation about the epic on literary or religious levels is given. George doesn't bother to tell us about the literary or historical relationship of Gilgamesh to the bible, nor does he try to use the epic to define for us Mesopotamian religion. He is simply interested in providing a good translation and is very thorough and scientific in cataloguing his sources and judgment calls, yet he hands us a lively and fluid English text."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I recommend this Penguin Classic, but it offers more thorough scholarly apparatus than usual for the series. This is not meant as a criticism! But, a beginner may find a \\"version\\" such as Stephen Mitchell's easier to start with for an overview of the storyline, and a briefer introduction and helpful endnotes. The poem itself is not lengthy, but the ancillary texts and sources, as Andrew George shows us, do take up considerable space which may please enthusiasts but discourage newcomers to this epic poem.George prepared for Oxford UP in 1999 a two-volume edition, and this Penguin adapts the core of the English translation for a wider audience. It appears ideal for a college classroom or the reader wanting to learn more about the lacunae, the gaps, the language, and the editorial decisions made by George and fellow translators. A fascinating appendix shows how out of grammatical markers, syllabic, and half-syllabic cuneiform incisions the sounds and rhythms and absences that fill this most ancient of narratives turn into what we can understand. To a point.Terms such as \\"louvre-door,\\" \\"glacis-slope,\\" \\"hie to the forge,\\" and notably Ishtar's exhortation to \\"stroke my quim\\" give a rather archaic diction to parts of the translation. George aims obviously for precision in such terminology, but this does clash with the more demotic vernacular chosen by Mitchell in his popularization. Mitchell's also considerably more erotic and develops passages that in their original state, reading George, remain terse. Again, George approaches the thousands of fragments that are still being assembled nearly 150 years after their discovery and observes that this epic is still, amazingly and poignantly, one in progress as we await trained Assyriologists able to decipher not only the later Akkadian but the considerably more challenging and often cryptic Sumerian sources. It's a shame that in a region where so many billions have been spent to destroy the area between the Tigris & Euphrates that a few thousands can not be provided for the study and restoration of the oldest story text we have ever found."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Andrew George gives you the best of both worlds. He reprints the Old Babylonian version of Gilgamesh, which I find the poetry to be gritty, raw and exciting. (. . . until the maggot dropped from his nose.) He also gives you the newer versions of the story,including tablets 11 and 12. I found that these two additions to the story, written at a later date, did not quite match the OB version. Each version twisted the story from the original Man vs. Hero, into Man vs. King and then Man vs. God. I do believe, though, that this is the best of any Gilgamesh book you will read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I fully agree with the previous reviewers who praised the qualities of this book and the translations by Andrew George. The introduction and supplementary material that accompany the standard version of the Gilgamesh epic really help to put this story into the proper historical context.This was my first reading of the Gilgamesh epic and what surprised me most about this story was its humanistic focus, especially considering that most of the literature at that time focused on the gods and how they created the universe and mankind. We learn about the superhuman heroes Gilgamesh and Enkidu, who openly spited the gods by performing deeds that ran counter to their interests. After Enkidu dies, however, Gilgamesh gets a reality check and attempts to avoid a similar fate by searching for the secret of immortality. Instead, he only discovers that even a powerful king like himself will never be able to escape death. But he also learns that instead of performing silly quests like searching for immortality, Gilgamesh should &quot;seize the day&quot; and actively use his time among the living to perform actions that will make a king great to his people. In this way, he will be able to ensure that his name lives on among future generations. Now this is great literature!As other reviewers have commented, Andrew George's translation of the Gilgamesh epic is very approachable and makes for very entertaining reading, even for the general reader (like me) who is not a serious student of ancient history. However, if you want to study the history of the Western literary canon, you have to start here in Mesopotamia."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Warning.

This is a definite must read for fans of mythology and epic heroes. The story centers around Gilgamesh, the partly divine ruler of Uruk, who is troubled by the fact he will one day die. Through the course of his life he goes on great adventures, slaying beasts that dwell in the forest and trekking through darkness in search of immortality. The feats are not without their effects, however. By the end, Gilgamesh will have become a different man than he was before. Symbolically, the story addresses issues of friendship, bravery, how we are changed by living our lives, the relationship between refined culture and nature, and how we constantly deny our own mortality. &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is an excellent, philosophical tale of one's search for meaning in a brief life."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Great read none-the less but the way it's written makes it really confusing to people who have never seen the form of language."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"The bronze-clad walls of Ur are no more.

Millennia have passed and yet the Epic of Gilgamesh still remains the definitive comment on the human condition. Where else are we to find such wisdom and acuity? It speaks tellingly of transience; of heroism in the face of oblivion; of love, companionship and the loss thereof.I cannot possibly say how accurate this translation is but how beautifully it reads. Sandars also captures the liturgical roots of the Epic so well in his sensitivity to rhythm.The longevity of this masterpiece is no accident. Join Gilgamesh as he strides into the Great Forest, afire for fame and life everlasting."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Three centuries before the Common Era the poets of ancient civilizations wrestled with the issues of man's existence on earth and lamented the ephemeral nature of life. Compiled from fragments of clay tablets representing Sumerian, Chaldean and Assyrian cultures this Epic has survived for over five thousand years--with the capacity to fascinate modern man. The Penguin Classics edition, whose cover displays the famous scene of Gilgamesh wrestling lions, opens with an extensive and scholarly Introduction by N. K. Sandars, fully as long as the actual saga. With occasional short lines of free verse, this timeless tale is rendered mainly in prose--making it much more readable. This edition also offers a map of the Ancient World to oriente readers.Perhaps originally written as a thesis these erudite pages present the following topics: the History of the Epic, The Discovery of the various Tablets, Historical Background, Literary Background, The Hero of the Epic, The Principal Gods of the Epic, The Story itself, the Survival of the Epic, the Diction of the Epic, and Remarks on this Version.Recited by ancient poets long before committed to clay and preserved in a visual format this story opens with a Prologue about Gilgamesh, King of the mighty city of Uruk--separated from the Persian Gulf by the biblical city of Ur. The seven successive sections of the epic present the Coming of Enkidu, the Forest Journey, The Death of Enkidu, the Search for Everlasting Life (or Eternal Youth), followed by a tale-within-a-tale: The Great Flood sent by wrathful gods, the Return of the hero, and ultimately the death of the protagonist, Gilgamesh.As with the Homeric epics, this was a time when men interacted with powerful gods--beings often at war with each other who demonstrate all the vices and foibles of manipulated mankind. \\"A mixture of pure adventure, of morality and of tragedy,\\" the story presents a wise and godlike King on a quest to preserve mankind in the flower of youth, and to cheat his inevitable end in the dusty embrace of Death. Here we find all the passions of mortal man: love, honor, lust,vainglory, friendship, self doubt, ambition, grief, and determination. Despite his crown, manly beauty and godly heritage, Gilgamesh proves a splendid Everyman who represents the human race in its age old struggle with the meaning of life.Even the frequent use of epithets and the required repetition of oral tradition do not prevent this prose version from being both readable and entertaining. Long before the Greek classics emerged the scattered tablets of the Gilgamesh story lay waiting to be discovered and collated; even today they speak to us directly and poignantly about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I am an Honors student at Boston College, this text was chosen for one of my classes.

Here man first begins to define a &quot;self&quot;. There is dream interpretation that historically is continued with Joseph in the Bible and still alive with Carl Jung. Some symbols, such as the slaying of the Lion are ancient and almost universal. The Flood story shows up here, and perhaps latter repeated (or in a new form) in the Bible and Noah, with new meaning. What's fun about these myths is that they are compact and open to interpretation. For example, I perhaps see the defeat of Humbaba (the guardian of the Cedar Forest), as the start of our environmental crisis."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Dating from the third millennium B.C., &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is one of the earliest surviving epic poems in world literature, and like some of its obvious counterparts, to wit, Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey,&quot; Virgil's &quot;Aeneid,&quot; and &quot;Beowulf,&quot; still has the power to attract and fascinate readers even at the dawn of the 21st century. Like &quot;Beowulf,&quot; Gilgamesh is a king whose initial goal is to establish his own eternal fame.Gilgamesh, the child of a goddess and a priest, is, at the start of the epic, driving the people of Uruk crazy with his boundless energy and restless enthusiasm. The people beseech the gods to send a companion for their king. This companion comes in the form of Enkidu, a wild man who communes with beasts in the forest. Gradually, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become the closest of friends. While the search for fame and glory continues, it becomes only too clear that the focal point of the epic is the relationship between the king and the wild man. Without peers or equals, the two live almost exclusively for each other and through each other. Other ancient epics, of course, feature complicated relationships, but &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is rare in the sheer intensity of the homosocial bond.The wanderings and quests of Gilgamesh and Enkidu find their highest purpose in the pursuit of eternal life, which, again, surfaces because of Gilgamesh's relationship with Enkidu. Mortality becomes the overarching theme of the epic. A theme which we continue to deal with, the epic intersects the drive of science, pseudoscience, and magic throughout human history.Stylistically, the most notable feature of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is repetition of phrases. Even in conversation, one sees the same sentence, sometimes modified, come from two or more characters, even at relatively great distance from each other in the actual text. This demonstrates very powerfully the oral origins of the epic. Repetition, which could become tiresome, draws us further into the story, as it forces us to pay closer attention to the significance of what is being said, as well as important numbers (7 and 12 appear most frequently), and images.The adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu amongst gods, beasts, and natural forces, are compelling, interesting reading. Certain parallels between the ancient Mesopotamian epic and the Judeo-Christian biblical narratives that post-date it, have been well-documented. N.K. Sandars' introduction is extremely detailed, giving the history of the region surrounding Uruk, the history of the text itself and how it has been read, compiled, and studied since the 19th century, provides excellent background on the complicated mythology of the ancient Mesopotamians. A solid read altogether."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Almost five thousand years ago. It is unthinkable. To comprehend that ancient time, one would need knowledge and power of imagination that would be no easy to measure or value. Even than, one couldn't possibly be any nearer that time. It is shrouded in mystery.Origins of entire history of literature, of written words/worlds, emerge from these tablets. And here we find first (written) quest for immortality. And tragedy which is found in fact that that quest cannot ever be successful. That man is forever compelled to roam that vast universe of his, and to raise his voice in vain, constantly fighting for something that is as far away as things can be.Gilgamesh is a real beaut. Of it's style, importnace, structure numerous books have been written. But those are reserved for scholars and for those of you out there who are burning with desire to know. Gilgamesh greatness lies in a simple fact. It lies in realising that it doesn't matter how far have we gone in comprehending world around us, or how much we advanced technologically. However far we may have traveled, when facing this book, we learned that we are still troubled, and still defined by the same troubles heroes of old had been. What does that teach us?

The epic of Gilgamesh, is one of the oldest known scriptures ever written by the human hand. Yet still the epic captivates audiences and the reader while still delivering a powerful and meaningful message about our humanity. The epic itself is one of the most interesting accounts of a Sumerian hero. However the language of the unknown author has the capacity to move, and to entice. The novel continually involves the reader, even from the beginning, with a question. It asks the reader to identify with the characters as if they were the characters and to still remember the ultimate lesson of life, to enjoy. Not only addressing the elements to keep a reader's attention, but revealing powerful and important aspects of being human. Among these is to understand ones place, and to realize that life is only what we make it, and how we live it.

The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, one story about the Epic of Gilgamesh concerns a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist who ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true). Unfortunately, I don't recall the guy's name anymore, but it's true.The Epic of Gilgamesh is notable for the fact that it's considered the oldest text understandable by a modern reader without special knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--since his concerns are easily understandable to a reader of any day and age. He is motivated by several concerns, such as his fear of mortality and death, the ephemerality of life on earth, the desire to accomplish heroic feats to prove himself worthy of immortality, to protect his friends and loved ones, and to destroy evil and preserve the good. He is also concerned with honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, and happiness.It's also the most ancient text for which we have an author attribution. Around 1200-1300 BC, a Mesopotamian by the name of Sun-Liq-Unnini compiled the well-known \\"Standard Version\\" of the epic. He wasn't actually the \\"author\\" of the text, but it seems likely he was steeped in the historical tradition and the different versions of the text which had come down over the years in both the Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, and he seems to have gone to some trouble to gather and compile the best versions of the various stories and legends about Gilgamesh in his \\"edition,\\" which became the most widespread and popular version.We also know that he was employed as an exorcist, an important job in Mesopotamian society, since they were called on for everything from driving out evil spirits in the ill and sick, to making sure dwellings and new buildings were free of evil spirits, to blessing farmland that was about to be planted for the new season.By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 B.C., but these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.Another interesting historical character is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"A half god and half human, Gilgamesh was a King of the city of Uruk.

Sandars translation for approximately 31 years now - not nearly as long as this tract has been around. I probably don't have to inform you (if you've dug this deep into Amazon checking out Gilgamesh) that our discovery of its existence - a little over a century ago caused quite a stir - we actually found there was a text, scribed in the middle east no less, that was indisputably of greater antiquity than the Bible. Many opine that the inception of comparative religious studies was the result.Nowadays - we have a plethora of Gilgamesh translations from which to choose - the Gardner, most notably, perhaps. But the Sandars volume still has value. The text reads well - and the extensive 50 + page introduction is informative, remarkably free of interpretation - large in the scope and range of its research - yet, like the translation itself - economical and to the point.Before the reality of resource limitations became common knowledge (not so long ago), Gilgamesh had interest mainly for scholars and literati. Now, a quarter century later, Gilgamnesh is required reading for all. Our debt to our Mesopotamian culture is substantial, and its recognition demanded.

Theyfound a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains,among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood,though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the otherGods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he wasbut two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions! The poem was his epic, and there was indeed an historical figure of the samename.This is an interesting artifact for its insight into human history, if nothing else. This particular translation is more bland in the explicit ... references, etc., than others,but it faithfully retains the story.A valuable piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh dates from the third millennium B.C., making it the oldest epic poem in world literature. It is a relatively short work, which explains why over half of this little volume introduces the ancient text of the first ancient hero. The fullest extant text of the Gilgamesh was found in the Akkadian-language on 12 incomplete clay tablets found at Nineveh in the library of the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal. The narrative gaps have been filled in, somewhat, by fragments found elsewhere. Historians think that Gilgamesh might have been a ruler in southern Mesopotamia, although there is no historical evidence for any of the exploits covered in this narrative or the five poems written about the hero. Cultural anthropologists believe that Gilgamesh was a great king whose name became associated with pretty much every major legend or mythical tale in that culture.Unlike some translations that go tablet by tablet, this translation by N. K. Sandars breaks the epic down into six main narratives. The two most famous of these would be &quot;The Story of the Flood,&quot; with its obvious parallels to the stories of a great flood in the Bible and Ovid's &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; and &quot;The Coming of Enkidu&quot;/&quot;Ishtar and Gilgamesh, and the Death of Enkidu,&quot; which Captain Jean-Luc Picard narrates in the Star Trek: Next Generation episode &quot;Darmok.&quot; Both of these are relevant points because in working from the known to the unknown they are both avenues of introducing Gilgamesh to which students will readily await. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the fundamental mythic tale in Western Civilization, but tends to be relegated to the shelf in most classes unless in happens to be included in an anthology. His quests for the Spring of Youth and immortality have been echoed in so many other tales. I have always thought that Gilgamesh is a more important figure than Beowulf, but that would be a decidedly minority opinion. I just wish this little volume was not so expensive because I think that hurts its utility in classes dealing with mythology, legend and/or folklore."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I'd heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh over and over again from history classes, to the use of it to confirm events in the Bible, but had never bothered to read it before. Perhaps it is the word \\"Epic\\" in the title that had conjured up mental images of a giant tome written in verse that deep down I knew I would never comprehend. Then suddenly one day I decided that I needed to at least OWN a copy, even if I never managed to read it. When I opened up my amazon box, imagine my surprise when I pulled out a thin little book of only 128 pages.The introduction is well worth the read, and actually makes up the majority of the book. For people like myself who had no prior knowledge of what the Epic of Gilgamesh really was, this intro is invaluable. It gives not only the history of the tablets, but also goes into the meaning of the tale, and tons of historical information that really added to my enjoyment of the story.The actual Epic goes from page 61-119 and is very interesting to those who have read other mythologies. The characters are very human though I won't say that in today's frame of mind that they are entirely likeable. The story follows King Gilgamesh who is 1/3 human and 2/3 god though the discovery of his brother, their quest to fight Humbaba, their battle with the Bull of the Heavens, and Gilgamesh's search for immortality. To be honest, I wouldn't say that this is a \\"must read\\" but it is certainly a very interesting read, simple to follow (at least in this translation) and a real eye opener to the beliefs and customs of the time.I highly recommend this version to those that are reading it outside of a classroom or discussion setting, because the intro was a lifesaver with the background and historical context that it gave.

It tells the story of Gilgamesh, 2/3 god and 1/3 man, king of Uruk.In the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is a strong king, building an amazing and beautiful city. However, the people are unhappy with him because he takes all sons from their fathers and leaves no virgin to her lover. There being no man alive who can contend with Gilgamesh, Aruru (a goddess of creation) made Enkidu, a man-beast strong enough for Gilgamesh to respect. After a harlot sleeps with Enkidu, he leaves the forest and comes to town to find Gilgamesh. The two wrestle, and after some time, Gilgamesh is finally able to throw down Enkidu. But Enkidu's strength is admired by Gilgamesh and the two become as brothers.Wanting to forever keep his name the mightiest, Gilgamesh goes with Enkidu and slays the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba. This act greatly angered the god Enlil - and this act would ultimately bring great heartache to Gilgamesh.The goddess Ishtar was impressed with Gilgamesh's actions, and she asked him to be her lover. But Gilgamesh then rattled off a list of all the men she had hurt and her wicked actions, and gave her a &quot;thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Angered, she had Anu create the Bull of Heaven, which attacked Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They eventually slay the bull, but victory is fleeting. In the aftermath, Enlil gets revenge by sickening Enkidu with a deathly illness.Gilgamesh now goes on a long journey, seeking everlasting life. He visits Utnapishtim, man of everlasting life. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about the great flood that wiped out most all of the world - save for what was on his ark. For preserving life on earth, Utnapishtim was given eternal life. But for Gilgamesh to be young again, he must recover a flower at the bottom of the sea. he gets it, but it's quickly taken away by a serpent. Everlasting life is not to be Gilgamesh's lot.He returns home, and is exalted as the greatest king ever. Gilgamesh lears important lessons about justice and mortality. His journeys and experiences have truly made him a great king.While redundant at points, this is an amazing tale, told in a straightforward manner that makes it a swift and compelling read. A truly amazing work."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"It is hard to put into words how meaningful this book is. It was inscribed into clay tablets some time around 2000 BC--the same distance from Christ as we are--yet its central message is universal. The message is that man, fundamentally, is committed to establishing a legacy.What does \\"legacy\\" mean? It means status after death. Men fiendishly pursue status in life, and they seek to perpetuate that status to last even after they have died. Gilgamesh reveals to us that this is not some culturally created ambition, but is rather a psychological fixture that transcends the ages, stretching from this exact moment all the way back to the beginning of history. And rest assured that men will be striving to build their legacies until the end of history, too.As the modern industrial age has clearly demonstrated, having all of one's material needs met is not enough for happiness. Gilgamesh illustrated this four millennia ago. He is the king of Uruk, has access to any woman he wants, is indomitable on the field of battle, is loved by the Gods, and surely has as much food and riches as he can imagine. Yet this man, who seemingly has everything, is brought to tears by the thought that he is a finite being who will inevitably die. His solution to this problem is to forsake his life of riches and journey into the forest to slay the monstrous Humbaba. As he puts it,\\"If I die in that country I will die without rancour, [...] Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures; men will say of me, \`Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba.' Long after the child has been born in my house, they will say it, and remember\\" (71, 2).For status, Gilgamesh puts it all on the line. He is ready to die fighting a savage beast, far away from home, so that he will be remembered.When I first read this book, it impacted me deeply. But at the time I did not fully grasp its significance. I only began to truly understand it when I read the book \\"Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence.\\" Some readers might be perplexed by this. What is the connection between these two books? The connection is this: evolution has endowed male apes with a deep lust for status. This is because high status apes produce the most offspring. Thus, according to this perspective, the philosophical problem of death is merely an epiphenomenon stemming from the basic drive to accumulate status. That is, the problem of death is subordinate to, and serves the purpose of solving the superordinate problem of status. The reality is that before man was philosophical, before he even had language, he was fixated on accumulating status. Gilgamesh supports this view in the simplest, most eloquent way. For you skeptics, I strongly encourage you to read Demonic Males and then read Gilgamesh. The parallels are remarkably clear. Once you digest the facts, a great deal of phenomena will come into sharp focus.It suddenly makes sense why we humans have such great difficulty finding happiness: because our brains were designed to constantly pursue status, and to never be satisfied. It suddenly makes sense why Gilgamesh was so existentially troubled: his brain was structured to build a tower of status up into the heavens."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This is another from my \\"what haven't I read that maybe I should have\\" period.

Unfortunately, none of the versions was entirely preserved. Therefore, attempting to provide a \\"correct\\" version of the story is nonesense. Instead, one has to accept that many versions are possible; each one with its pros and cons.In my view, the translation done by Sandars is a succesful one. Surely there are omissions here and there. Of greater impact -maybe- is the fact that the story is re-written in prose (although the original was a poem). However, Sandars has aimed at getting a fluent and \\"readable\\" version in English without betraying the essence of the epic.

They found a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains, among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood, though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the other Gods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he was but two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions! The poem was his epic, and there was indeed an historical figure of the same name.Recently, in my home town, 8th-grade students were assigned the poem to study, in this very translation, but because of a rather innocuous passage referring to a \\"harlot\\" who used her blandishments, including a reference to her nakedness, toinfluence a friend of Gilgamesh (Enkidu), the teacher was persuaded by an angry parent to black out the offending phrases, resulting a dispute over censorship which made headlines here.Mountains out of molehills!This is an interesting artifact for its insight into human history, if nothing else. This particular translation is more bland in the explicit sexual references, etc., than others, but it faithfully retains the story.A valuable piece of literature.Joe Pierre"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"So many translations are either painful transliterations, coming from someone who knows the language better than his mother tongue; or they arwe car-crash renderings into a stale &quot;academica-eese.&quot; Andrew George manages to avoid the Scylla and Charybdis in this translation. I hope more people with the &quot;gift of tongues&quot; can add some honey like Seamus Heany did in his beautiful rendfering of Beowulf a few years of god. These stories are beautiful, and we need to transpose that beauty in to English.I love the format of this book. It has the standard text of Gilgamesh, but has copies of all the alternate texts and readings, so you are getting the full whammie with the book. George also included maps, &quot;dramatis personae,&quot; helpful chronologies, a glossary of the oddf names you read in the story, adn a publication history. His essay on &quot;from tablet to stone&quot; is helpul in expalining all the lacunae and the gaps in the poem.I love the illustrations which seve as a sweet spice to the text you are reading. You can actually picture Gilgamesh moving in the ancient Babylonian realm, going forth conquoring and to conquor.This book is designed for college level reading, and it more than delivers with all of the goodies. You rarely see a book this good, that hits all of the targets in tyhe right way.

K. Sandars. Penguin Classics Revised Edition. 128 pp. London : Penguin, 1972 (1964) and Reissued.Although many perhaps don't realize it, we live in a truly great age of translations, being awash in an abundance of texts that would have been the envy of earlier readers. The classics of every age and every culture - or those that have survived the hazards of time - are freely available in all kinds of versions. These range from the productions of outstanding scholars learned in the ancient languages, all the way the way through to the adaptations and reworkings of non-specialist enthusiasts, some of whom can also be very scholarly in their approach.I don't really know how many translations of Gilgamesh are currently available, but the newcomer could do worse than select that of Sandars. He freely admits that his &quot;isn't a fresh translation from the cuneiform&quot; because such a translation would require a detailed knowledge of Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite, a task which he tells us he is not competent to undertake (page 50).He adds that extensively annotated and accurate scholarly translations exist in English, French, and German, but that these hardly suit the needs of the ordinary reader. He himself, however, has made full use of them in preparing his own version, a version which as an ordinary reader myself I've always found wonderfully readable.His book falls into two parts. First we are given a 50-page Introduction which I personally found to be quite interesting and informative, although predictably conventional in its interpretations. Sandars accepts the standard definition of the Sumerian word DIN.GIR as meaning &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods,&quot; as do almost all others who write on Ancient Mesopotamia, though readers of Zecharia Sitchin will have their doubts (see Sitchin, 12th Planet, p.169).Following the Introduction we are given the text of Gilgamesh, mainly in Sandars' lucid and sensitive prose, though with a few passages in verse. The book is rounded out with a 'Glossary of Names,' and an 'Appendix of Sources' which gives full bibliographical details of the scholarly sources utilized by Sandars. It also includes a useful map, and is printed in a large and easy-to-read type.As a non-specialist Sumerophile I like Sandars' text and have re-read it several times. Here is an example of his verse, with my obliques added to indicate line breaks:&quot;Hear me, great ones of Uruk, / I weep for Enkidu, my friend, / Bitterly moaning like a woman mourning / I weep for my brother. / O Enkidu, my brother, / You were the axe at my side, / My hand's strength, the sword in my belt, / The shield before me, / A glorious robe, my fairest ornament; / An evil fate has robbed me...&quot; (page 94).Others may have rendered this passage better, but to me it effectively communicates the despair any man would feel at the loss of his closest friend. There are other similarly moving incidents in this strange and compelling story, a story which is essentially tragic though not unrelieved with an occasional bit of humor.Here is an example of Sandars' prose:&quot;My friend, I saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful. The heavens roared and the earth roared again, daylight failed and darkness fell, lightnings flashed, fire blazed out, the clouds lowered, they rained down death. Then the brightness departed, the fire went out, and all was turned to ashes fallen about us. . . . (page 79).Gilgamesh was sleeping when this experience occurred, but I wonder if &quot;dream&quot; here really means &quot;dream&quot;? Perhaps, but what this passage evokes vividly for me is an ancient man's experience of being very close to the site of the launching of a huge rocket (See Zechariah Sitchin, 'The Stairway to Heaven,' p.127). Everything seems to be there - the roarings, the flashings, the dark clouds of smoke from the exhaust, the fall of a residue of &quot;ashes&quot; from the firing. I wonder if a modern witness of a Cape Canaveral launch could do as well . . .Gilgamesh's tragedy is that he was partly human : &quot;... the great gods made his beauty perfect.... Two thirds they made him god and one third man&quot; (page 61). But who were these &quot;gods&quot; whose lifespans were so much longer than those of humans? And how did they make Gilgamesh two thirds &quot;god&quot;? Did the Sumerians just dream all this up for purposes of 'entertainment' ? Or were they more accurate reporters than they are credited with being ?The Sumerians were adamant in asserting that they themselves created nothing at all, neither agriculture nor irrigation nor architecture nor engineering nor astronomy nor mathematics nor writing nor anything else, but that their _entire_ civilization was given to them by the &quot;gods.&quot;Of this civilization we find Gilgamesh lamenting : &quot;Here in the city man dies oppressed at heart, man perishes with despair in his heart&quot; (page 72). But would human beings have deliberately created a system in which widespread despair was unavoidable? Or was something else responsible for establishing the civilizational patterns that, as a reading of Samuel Kramer's 'History Begins at Sumer' will convince anyone, are still ours? Is &quot;civilization&quot; a euphemism for a non-human system of exploitation?There are many mysteries in this profound and moving tale of Gilgamesh's friendship with the wild man Enkidu, his frustration over the human lot, and his courageous attempt and failure to discover a solution. But whether you read his story in Sandars' version or in some other, make sure to read it. It's a story you will not easily forget."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk (and in real life he was the king of Uruk), is the first tragic hero recorded by the human race. Though many of the epic's tablets were discovered in Assurbanipal's Assyrian library (7th century B.C), parts of this book appear to originate from around 3000 B.C. Long before the Assyrians, 1800 years before the Hebrews, and, in fact, before anybody as this story originated with the hard-bitten people of Sumer, the first civilization, who happened to have been utterly lost from history until the 19th century A.D. The very civilization to invent the wheel, the city, the sexigesimal system governing the sweep of hands on your watch and, most importantly, writing. Say \\"alcohol\\", and you speak Sumerian - as they apparently invented that too, while the word has not changed for over 5000 years. \\"Hard-bitten\\" because while the Egyptians would celebrate Nile floods, Sumerians cursed themselves for having deserved such punishment as a flooded Tigris or Euphrates. To Egyptians the sun was life. To Sumerians the sun was relentless. Suffering is an excellent source of creativity (though the Egyptians did well with less) and Gilgamesh reflects this in both its creativity and diagnosis.Although very old, his story is forever new. Gilgamesh is - as stated in the introduction - emblematic of our concern with mortality, the struggle for knowledge and escape from the common lot of man. As a mortal, Gilgamesh is condemned to death, but he doesn't take his fate lying down. So, like all good mythologies, he sets out on a great adventure to rectify his problem, encountering gods, monsters and his best friend, Enkidu, the \\"savage man\\", who is at home with the animals, until enticed by the civilized Gilgamesh with a woman - something he never saw before. Perhaps a symbol of man's complications when leaving his natural state.Most interestingly Gilgamesh reaches \\"where the sun rises\\" to meet Upnapishtim. Upnapishtim is by now famous for saving \\"the seed of all living creatures\\" on a boat, whose dimensions are given by a rogue god friendly to man, all before a great worldwide flood sent by other capricious gods because humans were making too much noise, keeping the gods from sleep. (That Noah mimics the Upnapishtim myth should be no surprise as Sumer influenced the Levant for thousands of years after its passing.)When Enkidu dies Gilgamesh morns, \\"How can I rest when Enkidu, whom I love is dust and I too shall die and be laid in the earth forever.\\" In the end Gilgamesh is \\"mocked by fate, lost opportunities, wasted hopes and swallowed by death\\". Apparently, no matter how many gods you have - and the Sumerians had hundreds, one even for the pick-axe - death remains a mystery and confidence of reward a hunch.A wonderful journey into the mind of humanities first civilization, greater understanding of scriptures to follow and a clear signal that the deepest concerns of our human condition remain unaltered no matter where or when."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"One of the things I like best about this book is not the words but the layout and graphics. Reading it is pleasant and effortless.Everyone should read The Epic of Gilgamesh and I highly recommend this \\"version\\" (not translation) as the best place to start.

He did achieve immortality through this Epic."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This is absolutely one of the best translations of Gilgamesh available. Andrew George gives us a taste of what the original versification was like. He also translates all the extant versions and fragments of versions of the epic, and this is important. Not only do the versions augment each other and fill in the gaps that time and entropy have literally carved, shattered, and eroded into the original tablets, but they key us into the variations that the generations of years of cross-cultural retellings have wrought. Gilgamesh becomes Bilgames, etc. etc. Finally, an appendix at the back of the book discusses the process of translating the text from the tablets. In many ways this is the most fascinating part of this volume. Along with these good points, we are treated to line drawings taken from period artwork illustrating the epic, so we see the gods, goddesses, and strange monsters as they were visualized by the Babylonians. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I recently ordered this version to prepare for teaching Giglamesh in a Humanities I course. I had read the famous Sandars version, which compiles the various tablets into one coherent prose narrative. However, Andrews' new version attempts no similar gloss: the work is revealed as a fragmentary masterpiece, with gripping passages of narrative trailing off into maddening gaps and uncertainties. The Introduction offers a very informative, concise overview of Gilgamesh scholarship and the state of the work itself. It is truly humbling to realize how little we have of this great work, yet what we do have literally changed our understanding of the ancient world. And as Sandars suggested in his Introduction to the earlier Penguin volume, it is amazing that such an old, fragmentary work from a forgotten culture still has the power to move us. This sounds like academic hyperbole, but even in its most authentic state, the work is powerful; we see Gilgamesh's grief, his desperation, and his bitter defeat upon losing Enkidu and the possibility of eternal life. The translation carries some powerful imagery that somehow surpasses the more fluid prose translation; perhaps this is a bit of chiaroscuro (sp?), the lost passages showing the more complete, brilliant ones in greater relief.Even better, this translation includes all the various fragments of the Gilgamesh story, as well as the ealrier Sumerian version of the epic, which is much different than the Standard version. It's a remarkable volume which is fun to pour through and reconstruct this ancient world on the dawn of civilization. It truly inspired me to teach this work to my students, emphasizing how such a powerful work can rest on only a handful of broken tablets."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This epic from the Assyro-Babylonian culture (parts of which were probably written as early as 3000 B.C.) contains perhaps the earliest known example of man's quest for immortality (the version I read was the translation by N. K. Sanders). According to Samuel Kramer, the prologue has the oldest known reference to Lilith, who is an important female demon in Jewish legend. Apparently, a historical Gilgamesh actually existed and ruled Uruk in Mesopotamia in the first half of the third millennium B. C. (probably in the first dynasty of Uruk). In the epic, the god Anu attempts to curb the harsh rule of Gilgamesh, the son of the goddess Ninsun and a mortal priest of Uruk, by the creation of a strong and wild man named Enkidu (or, Eabani) (many scholars regard Enkidu as a symbol of primitive man). After a fight between the two, they become friends and have a number of adventures. In one tale, Gilgamesh is wooed by Irnina (or, Ishtar). But she is rejected by Gilgamesh and the bull sent by her father Anu to destroy him is killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu (some regard this story as a nature myth in which Gilgamesh represents the solar god of the spring season and the goddess is the goddess of love and fertility). Later in the epic Enkidu is stricken with disease and dies. Gilgamesh is devastated and wishes to avoid a similar fate. He goes in search of eternal youth and immortality (perhaps the earliest example of such a quest in literature). After more adventures, which includes him learning the Babylonian story of the great flood, he finds the answer to his quest; but, it is quickly lost. Even though this is probably the earliest epic, it has considerable allegorical significance. It is perhaps the earliest known description of man's quest for the meaning of life and the struggle to avoid death. What is learned is that death is inevitable and man should enjoy the life he has."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"You wouldn't think a 4000-year old story about a dead king would be that interesting or exciting, but actually, I enjoyed this book. The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, the translater, Andrew George, says a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true).George also makes the interesting claim that the text is the oldest written text accessible to a modern reader without special archaeological or scholarly knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--he is concerned with fundamental issues of life and death--honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, happiness, and so on.I also enjoyed some of the historical details George provides in the introduction. By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 BC, according to George, but he points out that these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.An interesting character George discusses is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic.Anyway, the introduction and epic made for more interesting reading than I had imagined."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"N. K. Sandars' presentation of Gilgamesh is an outstanding achievement of editing, interpretation, and paraphrase. \\"Paraphrase\\" rather than translation, because she admits that she is unable to read the cuneiform in which the epic was written over four thousand years ago; instead she's compared all the literal scholarly editions available and turned them into very readable and moving English prose. This was easily the finest version for the nonspecialist reader when it was published in 1960, and to my mind it remains unsurpassed.Readers primarily interested in the cultural background of Gilgamesh will want to look at more recent scholarship, but for the rest of us Sandars's rendition of the text is as powerfully engaging as when it first appeared.Though tyhe original Gilgamesh is a verse epic, and Sandars writes prose, readers looking for the intensity of poetry will find it here, in what's really a splendid \\"prose poem.\\" In fact, Sandars's prose strikes me as more, not less, satisfying than David Ferry's currently popular verse translation, which is competent but, to my mind, rather lackluster.Although Penguin has issued a newer translation in verse by Andrew George, I hope they keep N. K. Sandars's version in print. It's brilliantly done."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Penguin scores again with this revised version of the ancient tale of Gilgamesh, it also includes lots of reconstructive information and fragments from other related tablets with alternatre translations.

In other words, all literature. The timeless epic relates the events in the life of an ancient, mighty king who is given a great friend, and then loses him. Humbled, saddened, he seeks to understand why. Along the way we meet goddesses and monsters and romance and take a trip to the underworld. Though the story is really quite simple and straightforward, this is not an easy read. So much time - nearly 5,000 years! - has passed since it first started taking shape. The culture is so altered from our own that it may not be immediately clear to a modern audience what's going on and why it should care. So on to......the historical introduction. A must read for anyone who wants to gain the full experience of the the tale. The historical introduction written by Andrew George is - in a word - wonderful. One word isn't enough. Here are more: thorough, readable, and accessible. Gilgamesh - as epic, as history, as mythology, as evidence of the rich complexity of the lives of those who went long before us - has long deserved this kind of affectionate treatment. What do I mean? Mr. George is clearly energized by the work that he does and has labored hard to make available to a broad audience this unfortunately all-too-obscure tale. He has leaped impossible gaps of time, culture, language, and context and managed to bring Gilgamesh, and thankfully, Enkidu, back to life.Now the translation. I have not seen better. The arrangement of the text, with careful attention paid to both the chronology and the logical sequence of the various fragments, and the contextually-relevant inclusion of part XII...just brilliantly managed.Finally, parents, get this book, inform yourself in the intro and then read it to your kids.

The conflict that ensues ends with Gilgamesh and Enkidu becoming as brothers, but not before Enkidu finds himself alienated from the wild beasts with whom he once kept company.Interestingly, Enkidu himself had been sent on his way to civilization and Uruk by a trapper who had been frustrated by the wild man's success in thwarting the trapper's attempts to ensnare game animals. The trapper introduced Enkidu to a temple prostitute, so that after lying with the woman the animals would no longer associate with him. One can't but help but wonder if such a story might have been a precursor to the that of The Fall of Man in Genesis. As in the case of Adam taking the forbidden fruit from Eve, so was Enkidu banished from the primal garden after consorting with the woman."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I need this book for my freshman orientation class and instead of paying fifteen dollars for a new (and taxed) copy, I bought it in near-perfect condition for seven bucks. This was a great find!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I was reading these thirty-some reviews of The Epic of Gilgamesh, starting the old Sanders one in prose, which isn't half bad. Almost none of translations and/or reditions (translation made from other translations, rather than from the original Akkadian in cuneiform alphabet)...none are really bad, but you certainly can get different slants on the story, and twisted episodes, and missed tone, and so on.The scholarly translations by Assyriologists (A.George, Foster, Kovacs, Dalley, and so on) are usually too scholarly, and interrupt the read with all the problems that still abound. (Almost a third of the epic is still missing, for example.) The renditions, poets and wanna-be's like Jackson and Ferry, tend to wander off into their own thing; John Gardner (Grendel) included: he's sexy, but he ain't Sin-leqi-unnini (the supposed 'Homer' of the version found in an ancient library in 600 BC). Stephen Mitchell, a great Rilke translator, doesn't let on that he doesn't really read the Akkadian, so that's a rendition without your knowing whose versions he worked from. There's a lot of fudging going on in the Gilgamesh racket. It's a whole sub-story to the epic itself, and almost as much fun.But if you wanted to get as close to the original text as possible, dig up the 1948 translation by Alexander Heidel (whose text seems sympathetically ancient: the book's typeface makes it look like a dissertation from that era, font by Underwood). But Heidel is closest to what the original sounds like: The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parellels: \\"A translation and interpretation of the Gilgamesh Epic and related Babylonian and Assyrian documents.\\"But really everyone named above, and maybe three times that many in print today, all take it beyond Heidel's crude (albeit with an ancient beauty, almost like an artifact) level, but I think they all err, in going too far, or not far enough, or getting too far from the original, or just keeping a good read going. The politics of getting to the original tablets, by the bye, and the technology of reading the ancient clay fragments covered in cuneiform script three to four thousand years old, is a worthwhile epic in itself. There are 'Gilgamesh wars' out there that you'll never hear about, having to do with careers, withheld translations, transcriptions, etc. And why not, the stakes aren't really that small: this is the very first of work of literature, predating Homer by a thousand years and much longer if you look at earlier versions, the Old Babylonian and the Sumerian mess. Why indeed not lock in the 'definitive translation'?But enough of human ambition; one final suggestion: if you want to read a version that stays quite close to the original, whatever that is/was, but brings the sensory dimension up to modern taste, and teases out a good deal of the humor that's arguably in the original but which most translations miss, then I'm pleased to inform you that there is yet one more Gilgamesh cropping up in of all places, at Lulu dot com, as a graphic novel. The cartoonist has added his own humor--it feels like/looks like it's for 14 year olds some of the time--but he's also brought out the intrinsic humor of the original, has certainly rendered the scenes vividly, keeps his own contribution distinct from 'the original', and the text for the pure epic reads as well as the best ones above and keeps the reader forefront, not the scholarship. Check it out at Lulu.Qualifier: It's not finished, but two out of three installments are there, through about Tablet IX (a total of 12), where Enkidu falls sick and then Gilgamesh sets out bereft and alone on his quest for immortality, learning lots of secrets as he goes, including that of the story of the Flood. This is Noah's arc, but written down some one to two millenium before Genesis. When one George Smith first cracked the code, in the 1872, there were riots. It was Darwin all over again, to the literalists of faith, of which there were then as now, many.A neat new book (2006) on all that is out, listed here in amazon: David Damrosch's The Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh.Back to the graphic version:A comic book reviewer, former editor at DC Comics, one 'Occasional Superheroine,' begins a pretty favorable revew with something like: Ancient Sumeria meets Krum... This is about right: the epic bleeds through in all its strength and Sumerian-Babylonian wonder and feeling, and the cartoons provide a tongue-in-cheek commentary that's much more sophisticated than it at first appears, with its Ally-Oop hero and his hirsute side-kick. The Bull of Heaven, the giant monster Humbaba, Shamhat and Enkidu out there on the steppes unchaperoned, spoiled little vindictive Ishtar... it's really worth a gander.Curious note: the artist and writer seem to be brothers, or a father-son team.

The very style of it is clearly designed to be read out aloud, with repeated lines varied, like in modern blues, combined with heavily alliteration.The vigour of this poem, which is four thousand years old, is astonishing. Literally, modern writers could learn a great deal from this long-extinct style of writing.My favourite part is where Gilgamesh crosses the ocean at the edge of the world: the poet writes something like: \\"He rowed one mile. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed two miles. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed three miles...\\" etc. This is magical writing, evoking the style of oral tale-tellers of the time. One gets a real sense of Gilgamesh's trip into the murky and Jungian darkness of the outer ocean.Also, of course, there is a lot of fine detail of Assyrian life, such as the details of the palaces; also, the mythological monsters are fascinating, such as Humbaba the ogre, who attacks people with somethign called an \\"aura\\", which seems related to later Gnostic ideas about the multi-layered universe.To round things off, we get bits of five even more ancient Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, or Bilgames, as he was then called. These deal with tales that precede the later Epic. I particularly liked the tale of the captured prince who watches out for the attack of his allies that will liberate him and vanquish his captors.Unfortunately, the Epic of Gilagmesh and most of these poems are fragmentary. I'd like to have known what exactly happened to the Scorpion-People that Gilgamesh encounters; or what the nature of the Stony Ones was.We will probably find out some day, as there are plenty of tablets either waiting to be excavated, or awaiting study. Unfortunately, many of these tablets, read and unread, were kept in museums in Baghdad.

Gilgamesh, created by the gods and more powerful than any man, was once an unstoppable force. He took what he wanted, and the people feared him. They pleaded with the gods to control him and so the gods created another man, Enkidu, who was his match in wisdom and cunning and was yet different than him in many ways. Whereas Gilgamesh was a ruler over men, Enkidu roamed freely with the beasts of the fields. Where Gilgamesh lived to conquer, and took advantage of his people, Enkidu protected the beasts from their enemies the hunters. Somehow, though, opposites attract, and these men became fast friends - and Enkidu helped to soften his friend, redirecting his ambitions and channeling his strength, helping him to become a protector and shepherd of his people who would eventually be heralded as a great and heroic king who had established the foundations of a great nation.It's a wonderful story, that can be read on a number of levels. It is a heroic story, that can be read like the heroic stories from various mythical cultures. It is a parable that explores what it is to be human, and how one can accept one's fate and that one will die. It is a story with many intriguing parallels to other great stories, that have defined cultures and beliefs - there are parallels here, for example, to the creation story of the Bible, to the story of the Fall, and to the story of Noah and the great flood. It is the story of a journey, through which a number of themes can be explored: the nature of man, the significance of gender, death and immortality, friendship, memories, and the character of the hero. Finally, it can be read as a kind of anthropological document in which the peoples who wrote it are coming to grips with the importance and meaning of the shift from a hunter-gatherer type people to an agricultural-based civilization. Enkidu can be thought of as a nomadic group that joined forces with, or was assimilated into an agriculturally based community, and then this is the story of how they, together, conquered or destroyed a forest-dwelling people, but came to see as a result that their own civilization could some day be lost as well. From that perspective the epic can be seen to carry a kind of unwitting ecological message about the impact and costs of civilization: that in order to maintain itself, an agricultural-based, military civilization must constantly be in search of resources outside of itself, and destroy those who claim those resources. Then, of course, we'd have to ask questions about a culture (not so far from our own) that tells just this story about itself and treats its own founders, the plunderers of other nations, as heroic and godlike.A rich book, and rewards re-reading and reflection. It's short and you could read it in a couple of hours - but it rewards study. This translation reads well and feels fresh, not like some old dead book. The historical introduction is useful, too, for after you've read the actual book a few times, even if it's a bit dry in comparison to the liveliness of the text itself."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This poem is perhaps the oldest \\"book\\" known so far. It is supposed to have been first conceived by the end of the Third Millenium B.C. It tells, in a direct and somewhat naive way, the adventures of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, in Mesopotamia. In the beginning we are told of how Gilgamesh got to be king, and how he felt lonely, since he lacked a friend worthy of him. The gods listen to him, and tell him to send a whore to seduce Enkidu, a savage man who lives with the beasts and behaves as such. He is the \\"good savage\\", totally in a natural state and without a civilizatory stain. It is chilling to think of this particular story as an ancient memory of our life in pre-civilization times. The prostitute manages to seduce him (any resemblance to Adam and Eve is granted), and then the beasts reject him. He has become fully human. This passage is a wonderful metaphore of the civilizatory process which we humans experienced in immemorial ages. Enkidu has to learn to drink milk from a jar and not directly from the breasts of animals. He has to learn to wear clothes, drink wine and sleep on a bed.Enkidu fights Gilgamesh, showing him his strength and courage, which makes him the inseparable friend. After that, Gilgamesh feels the urgency to leave his legacy in this world before his inevitable death, another humanizing feature, since the individual already shows a full conscience of his mortality and of himself, and thinks of the future. So, both friends depart for the Woods, presumably current Lebanon (the Cedar Forest), where Ancient Mesopotamians got their timber, so scarce in their country. To conquer the Woods, they must kill the giant Humbaba, guardian of the forest, incarnation of Evil and presumably the first reference to the Devil in literature. In doing so they infuriate all the gods except one, and one of them must die. This is how Enkidu gets sick and dies after an excruciating agony. This fact turns out to be devastating for Gilgamesh, because it confirms the inevitability of his own demise. Ravaged by his friend's death, Gilgamesh sets out on a journey to try and find a way to escape from mortality. He travels to the East, beyond the mountains, to the Country of Sun, to try to cross the Sea and reach the land of Dilmun (kind of a preserved Garden of Eden), where Utnapishtim lives, the only human to have survived the Flood (it raises your hair to see a reference to this cataclism, centuries before the Bible), and consequently granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh reaches the \\"garden by the sea\\" where a young female vineyard tender lives. She tells him frankly that he will never find what he's looking for, since Death is unavoidable. It is humans' Fate, but to humans it has also been granted the possibility of happiness, and so the girl advises him to \\"fill your belly with good things... have fun and rejoice. Wear clean clothes, bathe in fresh water, caress yout little cildren and embrace and make your woman happy\\", for that is also the Fate of Man. Gilgamesh can't give up and convinces the oarsman to take him to Dilmun. Utnapishtim, puzzled, receives him and tells him he'll live forever if he stays awake six days and seven nights. Of course he can't make it, and when he wakes up Utnapishtim tells him the story of the Flood, suprisingly and suspiciously similar to that told later in the hebrew Genesis (let's not forget the long years of Hebrew exile in Babilonia). Gilgamesh makes a final effort, ripping from the bottom of the sea the \\"plant that gives you your youth back\\" but later, while bathing in a well, a snake steals the plant, changes skin and leaves. Unconsoled, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk and dies.It is difficult to exaggerate the historical and literary importance of this work, since in its brief span it collects all that makes us human: civilization, glory, the conscience of Death. It also gathers primeval memories, the process of going out of the African plains and building cities, the search for supplies and the fear of the beasts of the forests. The tale of the Flood confirms for us the memory of cosmic catastrophes which since the remote past left an indelible mark upon us. Indispensable reading."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Overall, a decent rendition. I was looking more for a direct translation of the poetry though, whereas this is a rendition of the already-translated poetry into prose form. I felt like it was dumbed down for the reader, but it's still Gilgamesh, and therefore a great story."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"One of the most fascinating books I've ever read. The episodic tales of Gilgamesh, which were recorded around 3,000 BC from even earlier oral traditions, pre-dates the Old Testament by 1,600 years at least. There are clear parallels--such as Noah (Uta-napishti, known by the Babylonians as Ziusudra) who, after surviving the Flood, is elevated to an immortal, heroic status in Sumerian mythology. Also fascinating is the story of Gilgamesh rebuilding the ancient prediluvian cities after the Flood. One can't help but address Biblical implications since the patriarch was an Akkadian.This tale, if even partially true, conflicts with young-earth Creationist belief that the continents and landscape of Earth was completely redefined by the Flood (which some argue was responsible for the Grand Canyon). Surely that level of destruction would have destroyed any mud-and-brick cities. And yet, we have evidence here that the Sumerians were at least aware of prediluvian cities, meaning there were remnants of those cities. If one chooses not to believe this story, and treat it purely as fiction and myth, then how would one deal with the problem of Gilgamesh pre-dating Genesis? The Noahic flood and Adam and Eve stories in Genesis were derived from even more ancient epics like Gilgamesh. These tablets go so far as to explain that God created man from clay, which obviously parallels Genesis' \\"dust from the Earth.\\"Gilgamesh was, in my opinion, one of the \\"mighty men of old, men of renoun\\" (Gen 6:4). The patriarch Abraham was from Uruk, the capital city reportedly built by Gilgamesh. He was clearly educated and successful, so he would have learned of Gilgamesh and Uta-napishti in his youth. The epic of Gilgamesh has been found in several temples in Uruk and other ancient cities in Abraham's homeland (circa 2,000 BC). To the skeptic I offer this: There is a hint of truth in every myth."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"Or something like that. I'm sure I've gotten the quote slightly wrong. But be that as it may it does very much sum up much of this stories reason to be. The epic of Gilgamesh comes down to us from Sumerian times though its kernel may indeed be older than even that. Based on the story of a great god-king fellow it is does not appear to have come down to us totally 100% complete. This version has a fairly informative preface introducing the reader to some of the academia behind the story and while it didn't really engage me overmuch it was admittedly useful in understanding the story.And the story touches very much on a number of central tenets of humankind which is perhaps why it's proved so popular not only amongst an academic readership. Comprehensively taking the reader into subject areas such as mans quest for power, his insecurities regarding mortality and the nature of friendship and indeed some philosophy of leadership and it's relation to those ruled this book is a very good addition to any \`classics' library you may be building up for yourself or your children.It must be pointed out however that this isn't the sort of ancient classic I'd hand to a newcomer to the genre. The prose format of the story combined with the expressions contained in it as well as the simple fact that certain lines and couplets are incomplete do make this a bit of an acquired taste. Certainly I'd visit Homer or Virgil first and perhaps stuff like Beowulf before diving headlong into this somewhat more obtuse read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"The translation here reviewed is lucid and readable, yet never deviates from the spirit of a text in transition, from scattered tablets to complete work. However, George does a wonderful job of maintaining the flow within this patchwork epic. In some sense it feels as though you're reading the tablets themselves under his guidance and assistance. There is also a great introduction to basic Near East culture and history, as well as an interesting appendix on the creation of an ancient Babylonian translation. The illustrations are also interesting.Footnotes were nonexistent (though they were usually unnecessary--George has an introduction before every chapter). Also, the repetitive, partial fragments that George has translated after the epic are bit needless in an exoteric translation, though the poems were a nice touch."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"I have to say that I didn't enjoy reading this edition of Gilgamesh as much as I thought I would. Probably the most bothersome aspect was that the text was littered with missing phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. It's not like the editors are to blame, its just that story is taken from hundreds of clay cuneiform tablets, not one, it seems, that was intact. In fact, most of the story is cobbled together from multiple sources in order to create a most complete edition.On the other hand, the fact that this story was written down so very, very long ago, perhaps 1000 years before the Odyssey and the Iliad were written down, and that there is so much there, motivated me to make sure I learned the story.True, you can read a \\"cleaned up\\" version, but there's nothing like reading the primary text. Footnotes at the bottom of the pages would also have helped. Mercifully, the text isn't that long and it does read relatively quickly. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"This version is a very popular adaptation of the Gilgamesh story because it contains N. K. Sandars' crucial introduction which is just as important as the translation itself because it includes information about the discovery of the tablets in Assyria dating back to the third millennium BC and then goes on to explain the difficulties that scholars have had in rediscovering the story from these artifacts and how during this long laborious translation process found themselves actively engaged in evolving the story, and thus the mythology, which had developed from other sources and had certainly influenced ancient hero epics that proceeded it. There is no one version of Gilgamesh. There are very many. Having a good introduction like this makes reading the story even better because we understand its significance beyond being just a very old fable.The story of the translation of the epic of Gilgamesh is every bit as important as the epic itself and maybe more so because of its relevance to modern questions about the authenticity of the accounts held by popular traditional sacred texts. It is impossible to ignore the resemblance the epic of Gilgamesh has to Greek mythology as well as to the Judeo-Christian Islamic religions. Elements of the story such as Gilgamesh being part god part man, the flood story which is vertically identical to the one in Genesis and the underlying quest for immortality will peak interest and is probably the main reason why most people want to read the epic of Gilgamesh. The discovery of the tablets only increased popular scholarly opinions that religions have their roots in mythology and here is yet more evidence to back that position. Thus the epic of Gilgamesh and the story behind it is an essential classical text for ancient storytelling and how they evolve with time through the civilizations that come in contact with them. The Epic is not just Gilgamesh but the gradual progression of important themes in life that humans deal with by developing these legends and fables.Sandar's work also contains an important treatment of the story and an explanation of the role of the gods which are essentials to understanding what the story is about. Gilgamesh is hard to read without these initiations because the era and the setting in which the story was written must be dealt with or else the plot which contains abundant and rapid interactions between the gods, their attributes and the consequences, will not make any sense to the reader. The ancient ways, and we are talking ancient going back some 5000 years at least, are not our ways. Here gods are superabundant and are responsible for every aspect of life and with an outcome, such as the setting of the sun by scorpions, there is also a god who is bringing the fiery ball down into the underworld where two more gods are there to catch it and who influence our lives somehow.Gilgamesh is another world, almost alien, giving us a glimpse into how our ancestor's explained themselves and the world they found themselves in. It goes to show how far our modern understanding of why we are the way we are and why things are the way they are, has gone."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","review":"There are two different versions of this book being sold by Amazon.The one version is the more current and is translated by: Andrew GeorgeYou can get that one here:http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1263331576&sr;=8-1Then there is the older version translated by: N.K.

From the Noah-like figure Utnapishtim, to the ark, to the story of the magical plant that gives life, to the sleep that falls upon Gilgamesh, or the birds that Utnapishtim sends out to see if the flood has abated, one cannot deny that the Noah story was pieced together from EOG.

In 152 pages, McKay has created characters I want to spend more time with and get to know better. Cadmium is the oldest girl and is learning to drive and pass her \\"A\\" levels. Indigo is the brother who dreams of exploring the Artic. Rose is the youngest who shows an affinity with paint as an infant.We meet Saffy in the terrific opening sentence of the novel, \\"When Saffron was eight, and had at last learned to read, she hunted slowly through the color chart pinned up on the kitchen wall.\\"Through her exploration of a painter's color chart the story of her adoption into the Casson family is revealed. She learns that she was born in Siena, Italy and brought to England by her grandfather when her own mother died in an automobile crash. Although the focus of the story is on Saffy's search for her place in the family, the rest of the characters are so wonderfully drawn that the reader feels a personal connection with each one of them. The way the family members interact and care for each other is touching yet tremendously funny too.Caddy's driving lessons (and her crush on the driving instructor) are hilarious. I laughed and laughed as I read. Indigo's valiant attempts to conquer his various fears are profoundly moving. Rose is a no holds barred artist. Her realistic view and handling of their father and his dismay at his unconventional family is cheering.I sought this book out when the Junior Library Guild chose \\"Indigo's Star\\" as a selection this fall.

I found this book to be a very boring; this book was not interesting because it is so confusing.At first I thought that Saffy was a boy because they would switch between Indigo and her, but later on I figured out that that Saffy was a girl. This book is about this family who lives in house called a \\"banana house\\" because when the moved into there house there was a plate over the house that said banana house. Saffron has always wondered why she doesn't fit in with her brothers and sister. Come to find out the people who she thought was her mom and dad are really her aunt and uncle. Her mom had died in a car crash and her dad left her when she was very young. Her sister Cadmium is now taking driving lessons from a guy named Michael who she secretly likes. The youngest sister Rose is a baby who is into everything including paint in the beginning she sucked a tube of paint and she turned that color. Indigo is the only boy and loves to read his grandfather old exploring books and he wants to be an explorer some day. The mom is a stay at home mom and the dad is an artist. The reason this book is called Saffy's Angel is because her grandfather passed away and left her a stone angel in Italy. Saffy's family goes on a wild goose chase In Italy looking for this stone angel. If I were rating this book I would probably give it two and a half stars.

I didn't expect to enjoy it, since it's been some time since I've purposely read a children's book, and yet really did. The Casson Family is as interesting and charming, as they are chaotic. Somehow, they feel more like a family than one would expect, and readily accept friends (true friends that is) into their close-knit group.I'd have like to see more of Saffy with her family instead of this newfound friend, Sarah, because I felt as if the story was really about family, but it all worked. I suppose Saffy needed something that belonged to *her* as opposed to the family, and with Sarah, she found that. In the end, Sarah became a part of the family, accepted for who she is and her place in Saffy's life, and the rest of the Casson children accepted her as another sister. While she's Saffy's friend first and foremost, she's also very protective of the rest of the Casson's."},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"Saffy's AngelBy: Hillary McKayThere are five main characters in this book.

There's very good character but the plot was not so good. The reason I didn't like the plot was because it was meaningless. Her parents die, her grandfather dies, he leaves her inheritance and she goes to find it. But what makes this book special is the way the author brings the characters to life. Saffron has a pretty colorful personality.She loves art, as do all of them and is sad that her name color, Saffron is not on the color chart on the kitchen wall.All of the Casson children have their names after colors.

It looked interesting and filled with suspense and adventure. Our favorite character overall in this book was Indigo. Sarah's father was extremely funny and interesting. The way that Sarah hid Saffy and allowed her to come with her (without her parent's permission) was kind and a good deed from a close friend. Bill was a rude, obnoctious father that didn't really care and didn't seem to know anything about his family and children, adopted or not. Saffy's \\"Aunt\\" was almost the same as Bill. But she wasn't mean or obnoctious. She just spent all of her time in the shed, painting. Indigo had to make dinner and everything.

When she finds out that she's adpoted, she decides she wants to go to Italy to find an angel statue left to her in her grandfather's will. This is an odd book about a terribly irresponsible and inept family which got under my skin and charmed me after awhile. I ended up understanding through their actions how they loved each other."},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"To grab a child's interest, books written for them will usually concentrate on something fun or interesting that they might like to be a part of. In the case of \\"Saffy's Angel\\", author Hilary McKay has combined two or three different fantasies a child might enjoy. The fantasy of belonging to a big crazy artistic family. The fantasy of living in a big crazy house full of mysterious boxes and items. And the fantasy of solving a mystery of one's very own.In this story, young Saffron (Saffy) finds that she is not her parent's child after all. In fact, she was the daughter of her mother's sister, adopted at a very early age. When Saffy's grandfather dies and leaves her, \\"Saffy's angel\\", the girl sets off on a quest to recover that which is rightfully hers.The book isn't too dissimilar from \\"From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" in that the story revolves around a mystery (solved by children) and a statue. The story itself is bright and lively and never gets bogged down by characters, plots, or settings. McKay too has created imaginative people, each with a distinct and subtle personality. Many parts of this book are quite amusing (for instance, Saffy's mother leaves a note that tells the others that she'll be hanging the paintings done by the juvenile delinquents she works with that reads, \\"hanging Young Offenders in the library\\"). And the story is a good one. Top notch, in fact.My qualms (and I did have one or two) involve that old bugaboo \\"the artistic vs. the sane\\". How often do we read stories in which nice sensible people are considered troglodytes because they act normally and with reason, rather than scatterbrained and \\"artistic\\"? In this case, the reader is well set up to dislike Saffy's adoptive father. Bill mostly does not live with the family, preferring to live in London with his art and visit occasionally. Everyone is perfectly happy with this arrangement, and Bill is often set up as the jerk with too much common sense. Whenever somebody dies he inevitably acts the pompous unfeeling cad. On the other hand, the book really doesn't give enough credit to the fact that though an unwelcome parent, he's obviously far more capable than his too often negligent wife. When the children become ill, he is the one to separate them so that others do not become sick. He is capable of saying no to the children when they do something stupid or potentially dangerous. His wife, on the other hand, is completely unfit to be in charge of children. She spends all her time out of eyeshot or earshot of her kids in a shed where she paints. She never says no. When the children (miraculously, only one is a complete brat) act in inappropriate ways, \\"Eve (their mother) always stuck out these grim times as bravely as she could. After all, she would tell herself, she had known from the day the children were born that they were in every way more talented, intelligent, and wise than she would ever be\\". Which is her excuse for letting them drive to Wales with her terrible driver daughter at the wheel, sit on window ledges paralyzed with fright, or eat paint found in garbage cans.I loved this book. I disliked the mother. Beyond that flaw, it's an enjoyable romp with children that (with the exception of the youngest little spoiled creature) you grow to love slowly but surely. I would recommend this readily without any hesitation to anyone wishing to read a fun British adventure. It is truly a book that should be better known."},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"I rented this audio CD from the library and it was wonderful! Too bad that you do not stock it."},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"ISBN 0807208248 - Before I picked up this book, I'd read a review, someplace, that referred to the book as \\"British comedy\\". Since it's a childrens' book, that made me curious. I've never read - or listened to - a childrens' British comedy. And I still haven't. This is nothing even remotely like a British comedy, unless you're going to count Julia Sawahla's accent.Saffy's parents are both artists. Her father maintains a studio in town, while her mother paints at home. Her father is prententious and, apparently, untalented, while her mother is subtle and skilled. This only comes to light slowly, as does everything else in the story. Saffy's siblings are... colorful. Literally. Indigo, Cadmium and Rose have all been named for colors on the color chart; knowing this is why Saffy - Saffron - is so bothered to discover that her name is not on the chart at all. Eventually, her parents tell her that she is actually the daughter of her mother's sister, who died in Italy when Saffy was a baby. Saffy feels as if she's lost her family and sometimes, to guard against their rejection, she rejects them first. A minor collision brings Sarah, a wheelchair-bound neighbor, into Saffy's life just when she needs a friend. When the childrens' grandfather dies, Saffy's father ridicules his will. He hadn't owned anything and couldn't leave the children anything! Still Saffy is certain that his note about \\"Saffy's angel\\" is real, and her angel is out there. All she has to do is find her.Sawahla's reading, and her accent (I know, that's so American to say), is probably what made this book for me. The greatest negative in the story are the parents, quite possibly the worst - and most oblivious - parents in the history of the world. The kids, however, all make up for it.

Our main character is 12 year old Saffron, or Saffy as she's called on a daily basis. We also meet Saffy's family. her mother and father and her three siblings. Saffy's mother, Eve, spends most of her days in the shed, painting, and the father, Bill, spends his week in his studio in London. The four Casson children mostly cares for themselves, being a painter doesn't leave much time to raise children(it's not that the parents doesn't love their children!).One day Saffron starts pondering why her name isn't on the coloring chart. All her siblings are named after a color, why is she named after a spice? Saffy's world turns upside down when she discovers the truth.One day Saffy argues with her dad, she runs after his taxi and in frustration throws his lunch after the car(which is long gone) as she turns around to head home she crashes into the wheelchair of the girl next door, Sarah. Sarah more or less force Saffy to become her friend(the Casson kids kind sees Sarah as a stuck up snob). It doesn't take the girls long to become the best of friends.All of the sudden the Casson childrens grandfather perishes. In his will he leaves each of the children an item, most of the things are long gone. Saffy has been left an angel and she is somehow sure that this angel really exsists somewhere, but where? Saffy has some vague memories of an angel in a garden. After a little while Saffy get's a lead on the angel, it might be in Sienna in Italy, how does she get there? Saffy needn't have worried, Sarah is used to getting her way and manages to persuade her parents that a trip to Italy is just what they need this holiday. And just like that Saffy is being smuggled away to Italy to find her angel.Saffy's older sister, Caddy, is taking driving lessons and to say that Caddy isn't a particulary good driver might actualy be an understatement. Perhaps the reason for this is Caddy's crush on her driving teacher, Michael? The lessons are at least very entertaining for the readers, here's a little excerpt from one of Michael and Caddy's driving lessons:\\"What do you notice about this street?\\" he asked conversationally.\\"Lovely gardens,\\" said Caddy, getting out her hamster.\\"It's one-way! Turn right, I said, and instead you turned left up a one-way street! Then you parked in the fire station exit. And that mirror is for looking behind you, not admiring your lipstick in!\\"Since I'm already quoting I have to add the description of my favorite character in this book, Indigo, Saffy's younger brother:Indigo was a thin, dark-haired little boy with anxious indigo-colored eyes. He had a list in his head of things that did not matter (such as school), and another list of things that did. High on Indigo's list of things that mattered was his pack. That was how he thought of his sisters. His pack.This book is a quick, warm and humorous read. Can be recommended for girls age abt. 10-16 years old."},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"This book was a delightful read.

But in the midst of all this, one girl tries to find her place.The four Casson children are all named after colors on the color chart, thanks to their artist mother, Eve. The oldest is Cadmium (Caddy), then Saffron (Saffy), Indigo, and Rose. One day, Saffy was looking at a color chart and discovered she was not on there, and soon learned she had been adopted. The other children told Saffy, who was severely upset, that her adoption made no matter and she was still part of the family. Saffy was the daughter of Eve's twin sister, who died in a car crash in Italy. Saffy's grandfather brought Saffy to Eve's family in England. After grandpa died, he left something to each of the children. To Saffy, all he left was \\"her angel.\\" Saffy leaves to go to Italy with her new energetic friend to search for the angel, but comes home fruitless. But then, almost entirely by accident, Indigo figures out the puzzle of Saffy's Angel, and retrieves the angel sculpture for Saffy.Saffy's Angel was an excellent read with memorable characters, humor, and fresh storytelling.A few of the unforgettable characters were Saffy, Sarah, and Caddy. Saffy was funny and simply enjoyable. She always said what was on her mind and was stubborn. In Siena, Italy, where Saffy and Sarah went along with Sarah's parents to search for the angel, Saffy checked her mother's old house and garden multiple times before accepting defeat. Sarah was bound to a wheelchair, but she never let that stop her. Perhaps she was even more stubborn than her friend Saffy, but Sarah was certainly more resourceful. Sarah was always thinking of clever ideas to get what she wanted and to overcome numerous obstacles - it was Sarah who figured out to get into the garden at Saffy's old residence in Siena. Caddy was a genius in disguise. She had street smarts and even some book smarts, but was failing out of her college classes and driving tests. She helped her siblings out of tricky situations, such as Rose's stolen painting, and was a compassionate person.There were many funny things going on in Saffy's Angel. One was Indigo. Indigo desperately wanted to explore Antarctica, but realized that he needed to overcome his fear of heights. Therefore, to compromise that, he would sit on second-story windowsills and just sit. One time, Caddy forgot to help in back inside, so he ended up sitting on the windowsill for hours into the evening. Another funny happening in the story was when baby Rose swallowed a tube of paint and had a yellowish tint to her skin for a few weeks after. Yet another humorous event in this story was Saffy's journey to Siena. Sarah and her parents had been planning on going, but Saffy was not invited along. Sarah and Saffy planned a way to bring Saffy along, so Saffy hid inside a beanbag chair sitting inside the car on the ride. When they were halfway there, Saffy popped out and scared Sarah's parents, who were then forced to bring her along.There were quite a few examples of originality and fresh storytelling in Saffy's Angel. One was the Casson's house. It was called the banana house, but did not resemble a banana for even have a banana's coloring. It also had a spacious garden, in which guinea pigs grew more than any plant. Another original element were the names of the children. The children, as mentioned before, were named after the color chart, which was very unusual, yet delightful. Another original element was Caddy's driving lessons and tests. She would purposefully fail the tests so she could continue the lessons, as she had a crush on the instructor.Saffy's Angel was an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good book. It had memorable characters, comedy, and pure originality, making for a great book.-Elizabeth H =]"},{"Title":"Saffy's Angel (Costa Children's Book Award (Awards))","review":"I would reccomend \\"Saffy's Angel\\" to a reader that likes a cliffhanger and a reader who likes a page turner type of book that is hard to put down.

But Wilkinson totally did not understand this issue. He dealt with scores of troubled teens and came to the conclusion that their parents were to blame. He did not take into consideration personal responsibility. We are accountable for our decisions. Parents can teach morality, but can't make their kids moral. They can take them to church, but can't make their kids believe. They can warn about the dangers of drugs, sex, alcohol, but can't stop their kids from harmful lifestyles. They can encourage mature decisions, but ultimately kids have to make their own decisions.It is my understanding that supposedly Wilkinson admitted that he should have not written this book. Parenting is tough. I've been to war, and I've had kids, and war was easier. But I am not responsible for my children's choices. This is a dreadful book, and I suspect some who've read it may have decided to not have children. What would Wilkinson say about the parents who prayed, taught their kids to be responsible, yet the kids still turned out bad? Even in the Bible there are plenty of examples of good parents whose kids didn't do well.If everything is the fault of parents, then parents of troubled teens should blame THEIR parents...in other words, no one is to blame. This is absurd. Parents do the best they can, some don't do a great job, but even kids whose parents were neglectful often turn out OK. The reason is individual choice."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Charity is income redistribution without results. Ask yourself: what does charity typically go to? It typically goes to feed and clothe people. Ten dollars given to charity, e.g., may help a homeless person get a meal for a couple of days, but does it get them a home? No, it helps them be more comfortable, last a bit longer, in their deprived state. In fact, charity, because it may help to mask the severity of our social problems, does the opposite of real change. Liberals are typically interested in seeing real change: a change in society's values such that charity is no longer a necessity. This is not \\"income redistribution\\" but social change.I am not saying that charity is wrong or immoral, just that emphasizing it over real social change reflects a certain picture of priorities: i.e. to make people more comfortable with the satus quo. Liberals tend to look to the future, whereas conservatives tend to look for immediate rewards (like tax breaks). A real sacrifice is one that benefits future generations (our children).Look into Mr. Brooks' background. He is neither innocent nor objective. This is a book with a secret agenda. Its agenda has a lot to do with O'Reilly's war on the SP's. Religion is touted as the answer to everything. If all people were just religious... Most are. See where we're at?Anyway, is giving in order to be rewarded with heaven really \\"charity\\"? Wouldn't that be the reverse of selflessness?"},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Although Brooks' facts may be true, that south dakota gives 78 percent more to charity than san francisco, what does that really tell us about his central premise, that conservatives are more charitable than liberals? In my opinion, it says very little. In this assertian, whats brooks does is to assume there is only one kind of liberal and one kind of conservative. That the attitude of a conservative in south dakota is the same as a conservative in san francisco or new york. Of course, on average, christians are going to donate more money to charity than non-christian. It is a part of their religion. But what about secular conservatives and christian liberals? Certainly both of those categories exist to a substantial degree. Wouldn't a comparason of christian conservatives and christian liberals, and non-christian conservatives and non-christian liberals be more... i dont know...scientific?And although as another reviewer notes, \\"He takes pains to indicate that factors OTHER than political affiliation -- religious belief above all -- are of primary importance in predicting how much and how often one gives.\\" what is the point of citing poltical values as a cause to charity other than to sell books?

This is great. I enjoyed it when I was in U.S. 40 years ago. This is a trait I admire a lot. The book was written at 2006 when everything seemed to be all right. The situation is now completely different. U.S. really needs health care and social security provided by state. I hope Obama will get it through the congress. I also hope that the Europeans will give more time and money to charity, but it is not an alternative for the security provided by state.The book skips important matters which must be remembered when traditional American values are praised. The ecological footprint of U.S. is much too large. The living standard may be high, but the personal cost is high, too. The Americans work more: they have short vacations and long working days. In Europe we think that it is wise to work less. One can live well with less money.I hope U.S. will clear the mess which conservative politicians have caused."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"In the national press release for this book, the big \\"news\\" is that \\"religious conservatives donate far more money than secular liberals...\\". What an interesting spin! What makes it especially interesting is that in an October 2003 article by Arthur Brooks in the Policy Review, he states that religious liberals give and volunteer at rates comparable to religious conservatives. Now that is an apples to apples comparison, but not very interesting \\"spin material\\". I wonder why the press release didn't contain the findings found on Mr. Brooks' own web page showing that the \\"working poor\\" give more to charity than both the middle and upper class. That statistic wouldn't sell books to his conservative audience, I guess. And while Mr. Brooks tries to come off as a neutral observer \\"shocked\\" by the results of his studies, all the other articles he has written on the internet shows he has no love for the liberals (one article entitled \\"The Fertility Gap\\" predicts the demise of the liberal party because they were having 41% fewer babies than the conservatives!).I question the need for this book: if you are giving your money and time to those in need out of true compassion, why do you need to compare yourself to others? If you have a need to compare and judge and belittle others, I really question that you are that compassionate.

Brooks:Thanks, Marilyn. There's no evidence that conservatives look for (or receive) tax write-offs more than liberals do. But to your other point, it is always possible that folks like you tend to give in different ways from conservatives - ways that are not picked up in the data. The evidence is pretty incomplete on this point, although it suggests that conservatives actually give informally in some ways more than liberals (e.g. giving blood).

As a Briton with no political affiliations but a great interest in, and respect for, the USA, I am trying to reach a balanced view. Professor Brooks brings formidable statistical evidence to support two observations I made long ago on the aspects of the world I happen to have experienced, but of which I had no more general proof until I read this book. First, Americans are on average - and it is important to stress that \\"on average\\" - far more generous, hospitable, and civic-minded than Britons and Continental Europeans: I doubt many strangers have found such a warm welcome in most parts of Europe as I have found when I visited different parts of the States. Second, from what I have seen of charitable giving and active citizenship, conservatives are, again on average, likely to be more generous with their time and money than the self-styled communitarians of the political Left - or rather, to be perfectly precise, those with an active religious faith are more likely to be generous, and those with an active religious faith are also more likely to tend to the political Right. As they would be the first to point out, this does not imply that religious believers are innately \\"better\\" or more generous people - but it is logical that those who believe in, and love, an All-Seeing, All-Powerful God Who approves of, and may even reward, Compassion have a far greater motive to act compassionately than those who do not. Professor Brooks simply confirms these personal conclusions. Indeed, the book's title is misleading because there is nothing at all surprising about it: conservatism has always had a paternalist streak, and \\"compassionate conservatism\\" is something of a tautology. The only thing that was unexpected was the degree of difference in generosity between different types, which was even greater than I for one had anticipated. However, although Professor Brooks' statistical approach is powerful evidence for what was previously only suspected, there are always two inherent weaknesses in reliance on statistics alone. First, it cannot be stressed enough that all these conclusions are \\"on average\\", and there are always exceptions to the overall pattern: there are some mean people on the Right and some generous people on the Left, because there are some religious believers on the Left and some irreligious people on the Right, as well as some religious people who do not live up to their religious obligations and some atheists who are as generous as any believer. Second, one should never take statistics at their face value without questioning the basis on which statistics are selected.

BTW, religious libs, get a nod for doing some of the hard work of making the world a better place (so I guess that some change is in store for anyone who reads this book)."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"I first heard about this book on the Michael Medved show, and I was intrigued by the fact that this politically liberal professor had more concern for the nature of giving than he did for his own ideological peers. Many hard-line conservatives will, of course, use the material here to slam their liberal opponents, but in so doing, I think that they miss the point that Prof. Brooks was trying to make. Charity of any kind is a gift to the recipient and the giver, not a club to beat people with.When I recommend this book to my politically liberal friends and family, it's because I want them to have a better understanding of the difference between private giving and government funding. Private giving is shown to be much more focused and beneficial to all concerned. Government funding taxes us, takes a cut for operational and administrative costs, and distributes the funds to the needy according to the dictates of those in power. Even if we put aside the argument over how much good is done this way, how much better off would the country and the world be if the more secular and liberal people simply matched the private giving of the more religious and conservative people?When I hear a wealthy politician say that we need to raise taxes in order to help the underpriveleged, the first thing I wonder is \\"How much did YOU personally give last year?\\" It might be a good thing for anyone to ask as they debate the merits of public vs. private funding.

If that's the one point you take away from \\" Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatism\\" it's a good thing. Most American's old enough to vote should know by now relying on the government to cure the country's ills doesn't work and never has. It takes the individual with the heart and desire to make life better for others to make a difference. If you go through life walking past poverty feeling good because you paid your taxes, think again. Both sides pay their taxes (hopefully) yet this research shows conservatives dig a little deeper into their own wallets and schedule and give more. Arthur C.

This can be seen, if nowhere else, from reviews of this book. The split between parties has morphed into a split between philosophies (\\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\") and increasingly, worldviews (here, \\"religious\\" and \\"secularist.\\") It has become hard to talk about much of anything fairly across \\"party lines.\\"Brooks tries to do so. He does not pull punches: he states the facts clearly and succinctly. But he tries to soften the sting of the blow of his argument by telling anecdotes, including the story of his own journey. He writes in simple language, and anticipates contrary arguments well.Brooks' own argument is that religious people, and by default conservatives, are more generous than liberals. If you read the critical reviews below, you will not find any that really challenge his main points. In fact, unless he has made his statistics up (which seems highly unlikely), his argument appears essentially incontrovertable. In America, religious people are in every measurable way dramatically more generous than secularists. The same holds true when you compare religious America with secular Europe, or believers in Europe with non-believers. Everyone who reads Dawkins, Harris, Goldberg, Carter, or other often recent attacks on \\"Jesusland\\" should read and ponder the facts in this book deeply. It is said that a lie gets halfway around the world before truth puts her shoes on; I hope these facts can outpace the propaganda.Even a conservative Christian like myself may find some of the contents of this book surprising, though. It appears, for example, that religious non-Christians in America are equally generous. As we interact with the more angry members of the Dawkins / Goldberg faction, I think it would be wrong to adopt a triumphalist or in-your-face attitude about such facts. As Brooks seems to recognize, we need to look deeper than politics, to the value and need of each individual, including those with whom we disagree.Brooks' argument is pretty straightforward and sometimes a little dry. Brooks helps bring it to life by writing in a conversational style. It's not hard to read, but in the end is basically a bunch of statistics dressed up in words.

Brooks found the evidence to show anyone who's never crossed the divide.The basic story is that people who possess religious and conservative values tend to be more charitable with their income, percentage wise, than secular and liberal people. The reasoning though is quite interesting, since it's not simply that they only give more to conservative or religious causes, they give more to all charities all around.The statistics and numbers are quite compelling, not only does he supply all of the studies he quotes in the appendix, but he goes in depth into the mind-set behind the numbers, so it's not just a dry book on numbers.Aside from answering the basic question of who's more charitable, and why, there's not much else. The book does get repetitive at points, but he does thoroughly cover the material, so he gets an A for effort when it comes to coverage on the subject.It's an easy read, and enjoyable, regardless of your political affiliation or spiritual outlook."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"For years, the common wisdom in our culture has been that conservatives are selfish, self-centered, and greedy.

The media was wrong. And the liberal politicians were wrong.As it turns out, to the surprise of Arthur Brooks, the opposite is true. Liberals care but mainly with other people's money. Their rhetoric isn't backed up by their personal generosity with either their time or their money.On the other hand, the most generous group in America are conservatives. Religion seems to be the major factor and, for whatever reason, conservatives are made up by the faithful. They give and give a lot - more than any other factor, age, geography, income level, education, gender or any other control measure, being a person of faith is the major factor in a person's charity.Until their arms grow longer and their hearts measure up to their rhetoric, liberals need to tone down the political propaganda. America is the most generous nation on earth and conservatives the most caring, giving people."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"The statistics, which seem sound enough on the face of it because of the credible sources, are quite fascinating. The ones I found the most interesting were the ones showing that those who didn't think the government should be responsible for people's welfare are MORE generous and charitable than those who do. Is this a case of let the government do it, but I don't want to do it? Liberal are often painted as the ones with empathy; this certainly raises questions about that generalization. Brooks also makes a case for the role of government welfare in eroding personal responsibility. Regardless of one's ideology, this is a troublesome point.However I have a real bone to pick with the author's definitions. On the issue of religion, he divides people into \\"religious\\" and \\"secular.\\" That may sound alright in theory but it's not. The proper phrase in opposition is \\"nonreligious.\\" In my graduate research methods courses(my field is social psychology), this would have been a big no-no. One must always use parallel terms. He may not mean to slant but he does. \\"Secular\\" and \\"nonreligious\\" have different connotations regardless of the ostensible definitions. On the one hand, \\"secular\\" has a bad connotation to the highly religious, arguably worse than \\"nonreligious.\\" On the other \\"secular\\" as in \\"secular humanist,\\" means something quite different than nonreligious. What little research there is on atheists (a large segment though only part of the secular humanist movement)suggests that they are MORE moral in general than those who are merely apathetic or indifferent to religion. But in his book they are all lumped together. I suspect that they are more generous than the merely nonreligious. Is he trying to slur atheists? One wonders.Thus the author seems overly bent on trying to establish that religious people are somehow morally superior to nonreligious. Much research from both history and the social sciences belie this. They may in fact be more charitable, if the stats are accurate, and that is indeed a fascinating finding which speaks well of the average churchgoer. But I'm aware of other studies in psychology, for example, that show that atheists are just as moral as churchgoers in the areas studied. Social psychologist Gordon Allport found long ago that there is a different between those who attend church because they sincerely believe in the principles (intrinsic motivation) vs. those who attended church for their own social gain (extrinsic motivation). Obviously Brooks doesn't have access to that distinction so this is not a criticism of him, only a caveat to those who want to sing hosannas (pardon the expression)to the religious and castigate the nonreligious, without distinction. Ultimately we have to judge the singer, not the song. Most statistics are not cut fine enough to allow us to do that.He also tends to slant the adjectives in favor of the groups he obviously favors. Thus a difference of only 5 or 6% becomes a huge difference in the way he words his interpretations. On the other hand, at least he doesn't slant against groups such as lesbians. He's not a rabid fundamentalist and is fair to gay families.However, for all these criticisms, I think the book is is well worth reading for the stats. Just ignore his questionable interpretations of some of the data. It certainly is food for thought about the conventional view of supposedly compassionate liberals and mean conservatives. As always, the truth is far more complex than simplistic statements thrown around in the media and for political purposes."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Syracuse professor Arthur Brooks thought he knew the answer to his own question.He expected to find that liberals outgive conservatives, perhaps intending to serve as a motivator for political conservatives: get out there and start giving! Instead, the evidence surprised him so much that he first believed his findings were in error.Skip to the end: Powerfully documented and impeccably researched, \\"Who Really Cares\\" may surprise you. For example: households headed by a conservative give 30 percent more to charity than liberal families, despite earning less money. Another example: those who actively express a religious faith are 38 percent more likely to give money to a good cause; they are 52 percent more likely to donate their time for charitable purposes.Brooks is not just a statistician reciting raw data. He argues that charity benefits every level of society and helps improve the culture. \\"The evidence in this book shows that charity unleashes enormous benefits not only to the givers themselves, but also to their families, communities, and the nation.\\" (p. 173) In writing the book, Brooks hopes to motivate a national discussion about the merits of giving away time and money to the good causes in our own neighborhoods and parishes.Despite the challenge of rendering sociological data in readable form, Brooks writes with a clear, engaging style that encourages the reader to keep turning the pages.

Given the rigorously academic perspective of Brooks, I was surprised at the positioning choices by the publisher. The front cover endorsement came from Townhall.com along with inside cover quotes from the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Pat Roberston. Since the book has positive messages about political conservatives, I simply chalked it up to marketing to the choir, so to speak. Unfortunate (because many people will be less likely to pick up the book), but that's the book business. As I worked deeper and deeper into it (it's not the snappiest read), I was both grateful for the knowledge gained as well as concerned by the increasingly obvious agenda of the author. His dogged obsession with Ralph Nader (he uses the same out of context quote at least 4 times in the book) and other prominent liberals became tiring. His selective objectivity was also concerning. For example, in one anecdote he writes that while families in San Francisco have much higher incomes than families in South Dakota, they both give the same average amount to charity. He never seems to consider the radically different cost of living between the two locales. This is an obvious omission. He also quotes Christian scripture when it suits his purposes. He attributes, \\"From each according to his abilities to each according to his needs\\" to Karl Marx en route to an overall message that religious people are far more personally generous than secularists. But Brooks doesn't bother to point out the extreme similarity between Marx's perspective as expressed in this quote and the very first Christians (\\"All those who had believed were together and had all things in common; and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.\\" Acts 2:44-45). I also take issue with the author's view that \\"selfishness causes poverty\\" (page 140). I've simply met far too many generous poor people at home and abroad to stomach this ignorant perspective. Disappointingly, the book devolves into an increasingly didactic tone. Toward the end, Brooks decries the title of a seminar for liberal politicians--\\"I Don't Believe in God, but I Know America Needs a Spiritual Left.\\" He doesn't even comment about the content of the seminar. Presumably because he didn't attend. While I appreciated the opportunity to learn many new facts about the profiles of the most charitable Americans, I can't recommend this book to anyone looking for a balanced approach."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"It should be obvious to any clear rational person that liberals are only concerned with helping the poor with OTHER people's money."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"The numbers are pretty amazing.

As a social scientist myself, I am always open to well-supported new ideas, even if they challenge my preconceived notions. Brooks claims that his book explains why people give and why they don't, and that his explanation is based entirely on data. Unfortunately, the book suffers from two obvious and fatal methodological flaws. As a result, he explains nothing and his data are meaningless. Don't get me wrong. His conclusions may or may not be correct. It's just that his methods of using the data don't support the conclusions he makes.In short, he concludes that religious conservatives are more likely to be charitable with their time and money than secular liberals and this charity is learned in the more-intact families of religious conservatives. I won't quibble over his political classifications, i.e., that conservatives tend to be more religious, have higher representation among the working poor and have more stable families. My argument is with his analysis of charitable giving.First, causal explanations such as he is providing are not possible from the type of data he uses. Brooks' data sources are all correlative, for example, he finds that religious belief correlates with charitable giving. However, as any first-year graduate student in the sciences can tell you, \\"correlation does not equal causation.\\" Sunlight does not cause people to get out of bed, but the two are highly correlated. When scientists find correlations in data, they then develop hypotheses to explain the reasons for the correlations and test those hypotheses. Critically important is to test alternative hypotheses and see which offers a better explanation for the data. Brooks finds correlations between religious belief and charitable giving. He then looks at religion and related factors as the causal agents, finding more correlative data to support his hypothesis, but nothing from which a causal inference can be made. In short, he makes a very weak argument.The second problem with his method is that he does not explore alternative explanations for the correlation of religious belief with charitable giving. Let me propose one that I think provides a much better explanation for the correlations he finds. Quite simply, geography, specifically urban vs. rural location, plausibly explains his findings. Virtually everywhere in the country, rural areas are more conservative and more religious than urban areas. Costs, both from taxes and from everyday living expenses, are higher in urban areas. People also spend much more time commuting in urban areas.These factors pose a problem for Brooks' because his conclusions on money are based on comparing charitable contributions to gross income, not available income after expenses. This is not a new concept. Economists define disposable income as income available after taxes. They further define discretionary income as what is left from disposable income after expenses. When these adjustments are made, urban dwellers income advantage over rural dwellers is substantially reduced. This is the money that is available to save, donate to charity or to make discretionary purchases.Brooks is a researcher and should know this. A quick Internet search found a marketing map of regions in the U.S. showing discretionary income. All regions were relatively close, ranging from a low of $20,749 for the West North Central Region to a high of $27,337 for the New England Region. This compares to gross income figures he used for his analyses, for example (p. 32) comparing average income in South Dakota of $45,364 to San Francisco with $80,822. By ignoring the higher taxes and cost of living in San Francisco vs. South Dakota, he has seriously overstated the difference in rates of contribution.My Internet search also found a study conducted by The Chronicle of Philanthropy about the same time as Brooks' analyses. This study adjusted for taxes and living expenses, thus comparing charitable giving with discretionary income. Their findings showed that San Francisco, arguably one of the most secular and liberal cities in the country, was 10th among the top 50 largest cities in its level of charitable giving. A look at the list showed that there was no obvious pattern of giving between cities considered liberal or conservative, religious or secular. The main point here is that Brooks' use of gross income was a grievious error. No one can donate to charity money that has already been spent on taxes and necessary living expenses.Brooks also used other measures, most often the amount of time volunteered to charity. Again, the pace of life in urban areas is more hectic than in rural areas. So, any proper comparison must be made to what could be called discretionary time. Another quick Internet search showed that commute time in New York City was 30 minutes more per day than in Dallas. A state-by-state map of commute times in the U.S. showed similar differences, with average commute times in many rural states being about 30 minutes less per day than in more urban states. As with money, time donated to charity must be considered relative to the time available to donate.Unfortunately, Brooks failed to consider these major differences between urban and rural areas. As a result, he concluded that conservative, religious people are more charitable than liberal, secular people. The differences he found can just as easily be explained by considering the facts that rural people have significantly lower taxes, lower living expenses and more time. It just happens that those same rural people are more politically conservative and more religious. In short, correlation does not equal causation."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"This was a Christmas gift that has alraedy been read. The rating I gave the book is based on comments from the book recipent. Suzanne LaHaye"},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Arthur C. Brooks tries to convince us that liberals are less generous than conservatives. It is only possible to support this argument if 'charity' is defined narrowly enough to eliminate all the ways in which liberals express their generosity.In a NY Times/CBS poll conducted on 2/27/07, the question \\"Would you be willing to pay higher taxes so that all Americans have health insurance , even if it meant you had to pay $500 more a year in taxes?\\": 63% of Democrats would be willing to spend the extra money out of their pockets, only 33% of Republicans would being willing to add more to their tax burden. This is a clear \\"apples to apples\\" comparison of the propensity to be our brothers keeper since it does not involve spending \\"other peoples' money but asks if you would spend your own money to solve the problem of health care for all.George Lakoff in \\"Whose Freedom\\" makes the point that liberals think systemically and conservatives think personally. It follows that the problem of neediness will be addressed differently by these two thought systems. The conservative considers only personal responsibility so he gives from his pocket. The liberal see a systemic injustice in income distribution so he works to make a more just society. It's important to note,for instance, that liberals DON'T believe that corporate CEOs are necessarily bad people but that the cumulative effect of corporate influence is bad for society. In other words its the SYSTEM that is unjust not the person.It's not hard to see that because he can only conceive of a world of personal responsibility, the conservative thinker would be more apt to open his pocket and give. That is not equivalent to saying he cares more. He just has a simpler solution to neediness.I suggest that a truer measure of \\"charity\\" is a comparison of foreign aid contributions by extreme capitalist nations (i.e. the USA) and more socialist nations (i.e Holland, Denmark, Sweden etc.).The Millenium Goals is a UN backed project that seeks to have wealthy nations (US, Japan, Europe..) contribute a minescule 0.07% of annual produced wealth by 2015, to emerging African nations to secure their people things like clean water supplies, mosquito netting to prevent malaria, very inexpensive medicines to curb fatal diarrhea in infants, and other extremely cost effective purchases. Here are the statistics country by country:Denmark-0.81%, Netherlands 0.82%, Norway 0.93%, Sweden 0.92% and US 0.22%I submit we should be talking about \\"compassion\\" and not \\"charity\\" .By the way Americans, when polled on foreign aid, believe that we give about 25% of the budget in foreign aid. When asked what would be a fair figure the median answer is 10%. In point of fact we only budget 2% of our wealth to foreign aid and much of that is military. Maybe the problem to our lack of charity is to oust conservative politicians who mislead the general public about our true lack of charity as a nation.In figures published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Sweden gives more than seven times as much real foreign charity as America.Two addenda:The Feb. 2007 edition of Scientific American cites a University of Minnesota study that found that merely thinking about money makes people less likely to give. \\"When money is on the brain, people became disinclined to ask for help when faced with a difficult or even impossible puzzle. And individuals who think, even subconsciously , about money are less helpful than others, the researchers report\\".Jan 24th WSJ: In his opinion piece today, Arthur C. Brooks confirmed my observation that conservatives are less likely to see the needful circumstance of others as deserving of help since they believe that achievable market remedies are available to all. In this regard conservatives do not take seriously the hopelessness and despair that all too often characterize the mind set of the impoverished. He confirms my view that conservatives lack deep empathy and are quick to find ways to absolve themselves from deep and lasting responsibility to be their brothers keeper."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"The Author negates most of his premise by starting off saying that Danes are the happiest people on earth. Denmark is very socialist, has incredibly high taxes, and is also very secular. Only 5% of Danes regularly attend Church compared to 43% of Americans.The author's conclusion based on his statistical analysis is that religion and conservatism are the means to a happier nation.It seems like he cherry picks his data to support his conclusion. His analysis is often speculative and surprise surprise, his speculation always supports conservatism and religiosity.It's an interesting read non the less, which is why I gave it two stars. If you are conservative, you'll love how he backs up your beliefs. If you're liberal, you'll leave unconvinced and questioning his methodology."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"How ironic that this book should appear in the year that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, two of the world's richest men, announced history's most incredibly generous charitable contributions. Both are atheists, as are Ted Turner, Sir Richard Branson, and George Soros, three more of the most generous and concerned citizens of the world. All of these incredibly generous men have no religious affiliation and are unmistakably liberal politically. Even Warren Buffett, who is never outspoken about these matters, backed John Kerry in 2004.It's also quite a stretch to assume that religious affiliation automatically equals political conservatism.Case in point, the Jews in America. We practice religion in every conventional sense, and retain the societal values the author associates with conservatism - respect for the individual's voice, and care of our own needy without relying on the government. Indeed, the charitable generosity of Jews is so legendary, that the successful Jewish fund-raiser has become a caricature.And yet, Jews vote disproportionately for liberal Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer, sometimes varying slightly only to support otherwise conservative politicians who strongly back Israel. Jewish Republican politicians are uncommon, and invariably lean strongly toward the \\"moderate\\" (i.e. liberal) end of the party's spectrum - NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Arlen Specter, the late Sen. Jack Javits, etc.So this book is interesting, but hardly provides the certainty assumed by the other reviewers."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"This is a worthwhile book that did a lot to break the stereotyped image of tightwad conservatives. However, some of the statistical support is a bit thin, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the conservative and religious viewpoints of the author."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"After reading all of the 34 other customer reviews of this book, I ordered a copy of this book from a local bookstore, so that I could check the accuracy of the claims I had read about the book, and to see if I could find any obvious flaws. I was really disgusted with what I found when I spent around three hours searching through the book.I then phoned the author and told him about my many complaints (in a nice and friendly manner I'd like to add). His responses also disgusted me.My complaints were,--the jacket blurb describes him as a \\"professor\\", yet I found so many errors of basic reasoning that couldn't possibly pass a peer review of social scientists, that I found it difficult to believe hereally has a \\"PhD\\"--no PhD has his name attached to it in theDissertation abstracts database. I told him this, and he said he got his PhD from the \\"RAND graduate school\\" in Los Angeles. He expressed no curosity about that database or the absence of any mention of his in it. (NOTE: a library worker at the university library I use told me that that database probably has omissions. The absence of a Ph.D record for someone in it does not necessarily mean they don't have a Ph.D she said).--he cites data about liberal vs conservative blood donating but neglects to consider whether the data was collected during a war or not. Conservatives are disproportunately represented in the military, andsurely donate much more during a war than otherwise, when relatives are fighting. (note: the book's index bizarrely omits the word \\"blood\\" or anything else that would allow the reader to find his claims about different rates of blood donating in the book.)--his wording counts EVERY PENNY of taxed money thatliberals want spent on needy persons as \\"otherpeoples' money\\" that liberals egregiously want tospend rather than their own. When I asserted to himthat 30 percent or more of tax money is OUR money, he got embarrassed andconceded the error of symantics.--he counts every single penny given to churches as\\"charity\\". I find this especially outrageous. As if all the money spent on church buildings, religious pamplets and books, religious instruction in schools, commercials for the church etc... are all \\"charity\\"! Also: charity is supposed to be voluntary is it not? I know lots of people who claim that a large measure of their free will was taken from them by the force of their church's religious indoctrination. E.g., another man in Baton Rouge (Phil Beaver) says the indoctrination was so effective that it was psychologically impossible for him to stop being a Christian (which he has) until his parents died. Phil thinks Christianity should be entirely abolished.I complained to Brooks about this EVERY PENNY assumption of his, citing building construction of a local Catholic Church, asking him to imagine the reaction of atheists who give to beggars.--there also is the obvious objection that since churches provide benefits to their members, financial contributions from their members is partly self-interested repayment.--When I told Brooks about the amazon reviews that complained about hismeasuring caring by monetary giving of total income,rather than of disposable income, I was really disappointed by his response. I explained to him that this definition creates a bias favoring rural conservatives with low rent, growing their own foodetc, and against liberals concentrated arounduniversities and urban areas. His response was to prattle on and on about his not paying attention to such reviews and to other things in the \\"popular press\\", without ever addressing the content of the complaint.--I complained about his not giving a definition of\\"liberal\\". He protested, saying that he DID. I said that the words \\"liberal\\" and \\"...definition of\\" were in the index, but the cited page gives no definition (this is true!). It merely says that he used self-labels given by persons surveyed.I explained to him that many people I've met who call themselves \\"liberal\\" IMO aren't much liberal, citing my ex-friend Larry, who is \\"anti-conservative\\" but likes racist jokes (that disgust me), fails to empathize with rich capitalists caught in free-market binds, etc etc..."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"A great read. The only thing I would fault is the subtitle about \\"Compassionate Conservatism.\\" I always hated that combination of terms because it implied that Conservatism was not Compassionate before George W Bush came along. I knew it always was, but thanks to Arthur Brooks, I have the data to validate my assumption. One surprise I had was the extent to which support for government programs replaces the desire to behave charitably. So the next time a liberal lectures you, saying how much they care for the poor, lend them this book."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"In this book, sociologist Arthur Brooks surveys a wide variety of studies of charitable giving patterns in America. To his stated \\"surprise\\", he finds that the behaviors that foster charitable giving (as well as the transmission of values encouraging such behaviors in future generations) are more in line with modern conservatism than with modern liberalism. Note: I did NOT say that Brooks found that \\"conservatives are more charitable than liberals\\". He takes pains to indicate that factors OTHER than political affiliation -- religious belief above all -- are of primary importance in predicting how much and how often one gives, and that, at the present time, such factors are present in conservatives to a larger degree than liberals. Far from inducing conservatives to a sense of smug, Pharisaical superiority, Brooks' main goal is to help liberals (to which tribe he once belonged) to confront the often huge gap between their professed values of \\"compassion and caring\\" and the practical outcomes the mere avowal of such values does, or doesn't, yield. Since facing up to a flawed image of oneself is not easy for most people to do, it's no surprise that most of the self-proclaimed liberals who have reviewed the book have resorted to attacks on Brooks' hidden motives. They should keep in mind that Brooks has THEIR best interests at heart.In a sense, Brooks' most controversial point is contained in the chapter \\"Charity Makes You Healthy, Happy, and Rich.\\" Here, he argues that encouraging charitable giving sets up a \\"virtuous circle\\" whereby all of society is enriched and made more prosperous, and that such activities are more effective than government intervention. He notes that the residents of secularist, socialist Western Europe consistently report lower levels of happiness and fulfillment than those in the United States. This reminds me of Dennis Prager's argument that one of the primary faults of socialism is that \\"socialism makes people worse.\\" At the least, it does appear to suck some of the higher meaning out of life. The subjective argument is strong, but I'm sure that many who advocate a \\"social safety net\\" (perhaps interlaced with such new strands as a universal health care system) will see in this argument the advocacy of a return to soup kitchens and bread lines.Brooks repeats himself in several places (e.g., in the use of matched-pairs descriptions), and the surfeit of statistical results makes for some fairly dry reading. (This despite the fact that the REALLY heavy statistical data is consigned to the appendix. I can see statistics professors using such data as the basis for some thought-provoking classroom discussions.) Even so, this is a hard book to put down, and Brooks deserves credit for making this subject palatable for a general audience. He also merits no small amount of admiration for his professional courage. The discipline of social science is not known for a high level of charitable behavior when it comes to those who question accepted notions."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"This book confirms with research something that conservatives already know. Some of the reviews by those on the left express their indignation about the findings because they happen to be giving people. Obviously opposite examples can be found in any group sampling. Conservatives don't generally try to paint liberals as uncaring. The problem has been liberals trying to paint conservatives as uncaring and ungiving because of opposition to the government being the primary source of giving. When people control more of their own money, they are free to give from their own hearts as they see the needs arise in their own neighborhoods."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"I had heard of this book a couple years ago, but didn't buy it until recently, after I heard a religious functionary joking about how conservatives don't care about the poor anyhow, and it irked me. He should have known better. I remembered hearing of this book, so I ordered it and read it. It is fascinating, VERY WELL RESEARCHED, and VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED. I can see why it makes lefties want to pan it. It reveals that Conservatives, who leftists typically accuse of selfishness, turn out to be far more charitable than liberals. Conservatives give more money, INCLUDING TO SECULAR CAUSES, volunteer more hours, donate blood more often and even are more likely to be kindly in ordinary ways, such as being willing to stop and give a lost person directions, than do liberals. Reading the book and then reading some negative reviews, I conclude, and not for the first time, that liberals like to pan books they consider antithetical to their pet causes, even though they don't want to let any mental fresh air into their closed minds by actually reading what they are slamming. That way they do a bad deed by lowering the book's ratings for no rational reason at all, and can increase their self-esteem by helping their cause. Professor Brooks is well-respected scholar and author and he covers this subject in a way that would hold the interest of anyone who can think at all, enlightening while entertaining.You would do yourself a favor by reading this book, and practicing what Professor Brooks preaches: his research proves that if you do so, the life you improve by becoming more charitable might well be your own."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Some of the reviewers here seem to think this is mostly a partisan issue of which side - liberal or conservative - is more virtuous and compassionate. I think that's unfortunate. The author's aim is clearly to understand what makes people give to charity and how to increase charitable giving, not to make a narrowly partisan argument for one side or another. This is certainly about far more than Democrats vs. Republicans.I particularly enjoyed the author's attempt to delve into the more transcendent side of giving, that is, the part of giving that brings out the best in people, that gives meaning to life, that makes life worth living. Another fascinating aspect of the book is the author's attempt to measure how giving to charity actually increases the giver's income by an astonishing $3.75 for each $1 given.Reading this book, I often thought of Christopher Hitchens' book \\"God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.\\" A debate between Hitchens and Brooks would be quite entertaining, and I think Brooks would prevail on the point that a secular society is not a very charitable one."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"See the excellent review of this book in the 12.22 Wall Street Journal entitled: Yes, There Are Two Americas by Wilfred M. McClay. In it, he relates an anecdote from a liberal candidate running for office after a long day of door-to-door campaigning:\\"If I'm ever hit by a car, I sure as hell hope that the next guy to come along will be a conservative.\\" I asked him why. \\"Simple. A liberal will blame the unsafe conditions of the highways, blame budget cuts and keep driving. A conservative will get out of his car and help.\\"This isn't about two equally valid approaches, liberal (systemic) and conservative (personal) - it's rather about getting the job done. The fellow laying on the highway doesn't care about systemic approaches and if more liberals (please notice I said \\"more\\" and not \\"all\\" - I don't want to generalize as there is room for improvement among us all) were willing to get their hands dirty rather than just wring their hands about the plight of the world, the less fortunate among us would all surely benefit."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Professor Brooks is a liberal, raised by liberals, who for many years accepted without question the almost universal belief among liberals that conservatives are stingy while liberals are generous. Then he actually studied the question and was STUNNED by the results he found. Maybe you'd expect conservatives to contribute more than liberals to religious charities, but for conservatives to contribute more than liberals to SECULAR charities? THAT surprised him, as did the fact that conservatives are more generous than liberals any way you measure it and at every income level. To his credit professor Brooks didn't argue with the facts but rather set out to find out WHY. This bookWho Really Cares: The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatismis the result.As it turns out, the \\"why\\" is only partially related to political beliefs, having a stronger relationship to other characteristics (religious belief, etc.) that themselves strongly influence political beliefs. Professor Brooks also researched whether private charity is better than government welfare; the answer, no surprise to conservatives, is overwhelmingly YES, for a host of reasons.Most of what has gone before will be \\"news\\" primarily to liberals, but Professor Brooks goes on to prove that giving to charity is also good for the GIVER, not merely because giving to charity (no surprise) makes you happier but because giving to charity (to MY surprise as well) makes you more prosperous!In conclusion Professor Brooks issues a call to action for liberals: just because up until now they have, as a group, BEEN less charitable than conservatives by every possible measure that is no reason for them to CONTINUE being stingy. Professor Brooks is measuring what \\"is\\"; what \\"will be\\" is entirely within everyone's control.But liberals will have to ADMIT it first."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Brooks carefully defines charity as \\"voluntary giving\\" as opposed to taxes, which are clearly not voluntary. He shows the common attributes that exist among the highest percentage givers, AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. He makes a wonderful point about charity being independent of income by studying who gives blood. Those who work, those who are religous, those from strong families, and those who believe in self-reliance more than government always and consistently give the most.Some economists think that the wealthy give \\"to make themselves FEEL better\\". Brooks shows they give because \\"giving makes them better\\".The book is readable. The book is worth the price. The book drives out some long-standing myths about charity and philanthropy."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Brooks started out buying the usual stereotypes of conservative selfishness and liberal generosity. That the political left is compassionate and charitable to the less fortunate is the sturdiest plank of the liberal belief system.Masses of research later, Brooks was forced to admit he had swallowed a lie. In fact, there was plenty of proof, unanswerable piles of proof, that it was the Christian conservatives who had hearts of gold when it came to giving to others; liberal secularists had hearts made from lumps of coal.Here is one telling fact: \\"Families in San Francisco give almost exactly the same amount to charity each year as families in South Dakota\\" (p 31) although the families in San Francisco had a 78% more personal income. So maybe the secularists in San Francisco give a lot to friends instead of charities. Well, no. \\"People belonging to religious congregations were 8% more likely to give money to family and friends...Furthermore, the value...was, on average, 46% higher\\" (p 39).By all measures, a Christian is simply more charitable. More likely to give to the homeless, to feed the homeless, to donate blood, or even to return the correct change. Religion matters. Beliefs matter. And, apparently, lack of belief matters, too. Secularists were not only less charitable, they were always more likely to grumble that charities 'waste donations'.Nor is this a pattern found only in the US. In Europe, where religion seems to no longer exist, private charities have simply vanished. Europeans prefer to believe that their tax system is their charity, but it is not. Simply put: Americans give more to charity--much, much more, no matter how things are calculated. They also volunteer more, or, at least, the Christians among us do. American secularists tend to stay home, like their European counterparts.I am currently reading \\"Shutting Out the Sun\\" a book about Japan, where the author mentions that the homeless Japanese are being cared for by...Christian Koreans.Religion matters."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"This is a well-researched, respectful, compassionate book that reveals the TRUE American character: one of remarkable charity at home and abroad, with money, time, and talents. My hat is off to Brooks for gathering the difficult to locate information and carefully documenting the facts about American culture and spirit. We are a giving people. THIS is exactly the trait we must not lose--not from a consistently overbearing nanny state mentality or from a lack of compassion that is springing up as a reaction to governmental interference in every aspect of our lives. God, family, and country are sound principles that form the basis for our compassion and have made this country the envy of the world.

Brook's intent isn't to do either/or, and he states that quite clearly a number of times throughout the book. He even states that he started this book to PROVE that liberals were more generous. OK, so religious people are the most charitable, conservatives are next, and secular liberals are the least charitable. So? Most liberals I know are good hearted, well intentioned decent people. Many are family and friends whom I adore and have stellar characters.His two main conclusions (one being intentional, the other a surprise to him) are 1. Conservatives are a lot more \\"compassionate,\\" \\"caring,\\" \\"altruistic,\\" and \\"charitable\\" than the left, liberals, and the media (STILL) give or ever gave them credit for, and 2. We ALL need to become more charitable for the sake of our society, country, and ourselves. EVERYONE is a winner because of charity.In the Appendix he describes the painstaking process of going through and collecting data and statistics to represent realistic numbers and data. He describes the pitfalls of methodology that many polls and studies fall into to skew data (intentionally and unintentionally) and processes and procedures he and others use to acquire more accurate data.I see many critics of this book noting the promoting of a \\"political message.\\" Of a biased political agenda and so on and so forth. I would ask the critics to think of something: If I believe that MY ideology results in \\"X\\" and YOU believe MY ideology results in \\"Y\\" and then someone comes along with impeccable data to back up the FACT that my ideology actually results in \\"Y,\\" how could I possibly say it is \\"biased\\" or \\"political?\\" It may have \\"political\\" implications but facts are facts. If only throughout my life I found out that ALL I believed was actually true, factual, and reality. But life isn't like that and we are all fallible. Integrity comes when one can honestly look at facts contrary to their own personal beliefs and say, \\"I was wrong.\\" and then ask what this means for themselves and their outlook on certain things."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"What do you think about the so-called compassionate conservative?

And how does this affect your own giving--of your time, blood, and money?

For you statisticians out there, he explains in his appendices the many studies he used as well as his use of regression analyses to get beyond association and into causation. And what's the good of giving? Is there a benefit to the voluntary giver?

Mintz writes: 'And while Brooks does provide data supporting the connection between charitable giving and civic engagement in the US and other nations, why is it that we are not a nation of voters if we are such a nation of givers?'.The author notes more than once that those who give do so because they don't see the government doing much to solve problems. The same reason so many people say they don't vote. They see nothing positive coming from government, other than stuff lobbyists want. Which often involves stuff big business wants.The author also notes that ALL religious folks, or those who attend religious services on a regular basis also are the ones who tend to give the most and more often than secular folk. That all depends on where one lives in my opinion.Case in point is liberal Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco headed by Cecil Williams who is probably the best known charitable group in the city. So its not just conservatives, although there are more conservative churches and thus more members giving more money to causes.And the sad fact is SOME liberals and SOME conservatives assume the government should or will take care of those less fortunate. Even though about 25 cents out of every dollar going to welfare actually is getting to the recipients. How many conservatives demounce social programs, yet love the fact their parents get Social Security, Medicare and Medicare drug programs?Sadly I think some people hate the truth, and as the authors and others have shown, people in places like South Dakota, Nebraska etc., give much more to causes that serve people than those in big cities where sadly, giving to oneself is #1, because in smaller communities people often know the poor in a more personal way and thus can see where their monies are going.So rather than complain, do something to change the situation if you are one of those who isnt giving?"},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"While many are disbelieving in the conclusion of the proposition, the research, logic, and findings are inescapable.

Brooks reaches this conclusion by reviewing a mass of available statistical data -. A substantial appendix provides detail and background to these surveys conducted by independent research bodies during the decade preceding this work. He is candid in admitting that it is not necessarily a conclusion that he was predisposed toward. They are, he admits, \\"contrary to my political and cultural roots.\\" This fact, he says spurred him to even more rigorous analysis which failed to overturn the inescapable conclusion.Amongst other findings he notes the US electoral map and the charity map are remarkably similar: \\"For example, registered Republicans were seven points more likely to give at least once in 2002 than registered Democrats.\\" Furthermore, he finds, \\"religious people are far more charitable with their time and money than secularists.\\" And \\"people deeply embedded on the political left are usually not part of a \\"culture\\" of giving.\\"Most of the research is presented lucidly ad compellingly. My one cavil being the author's tendency to present and then re-present similar findings with minor variations. The style becomes somewhat repetitive. The section which for me was the hardest to digest was one in which Brooks discusses the notion that charity stimulates prosperity not only at societal level but also at the individual: the so called \\"Rockefeller Hypothesis\\" first stated by the founder of the eponymous philanthropic foundation. Brooks presents a statistical analysis of the causal relationship between individual giving and individual prosperity about which I remain skeptical.These last concerns aside this is a book that belongs in collections devoted to the serious study of charity, philanthropy and the third sector."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Arthur Brooks' book \\"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatism\\" is a most revealing work that should certainly be read by those wishing to understand the cultural divides that have developed over the OECD nations since the Cold War ended - though they have roots going back before World War I.What Brooks shows is that, in essence, there is a divide between a gentle, relatively feeling-oriented (\\"feminine\\" or \\"marianismo\\") religious conservatism characteristic of Red America and a tough, radically thinking-oriented (\\"machisma\\") secular liberalism characteristic of Europe, Canada and Blue America. Brooks shows that the extreme secularism and devaluation of traditionally feminine traits like compassion and passive acceptance has created many social and economic problems for Europe, Canada, East Asia and Blue America. He shows very clearly how the decline of religion is related first and foremost to the decline of volunteering and charitable giving, illustrating that the most socially progressive countries (like those of Scandinavia) have the lowest rates of charitable giving and volunteering in the world. This is because the general belief is that everything should be publicly regulated and that people who cannot take care of themselves should be supported by taking money via high taxes from those who can. He also shows that Europeans, Canadians and Blue Americans are unusually pessimistic and unhappy, which some on the Right attribute to their lack of belief in an afterlife related to the disappearance of religion. The better-known decline to lowest-low fertility in much of Europe, East Asia and Canada can be seen in the same way.Brookes also shows how the influence of religion and conservatism on the level of compassion in a society is independent of factors like gender, income and location. His point that welfare receivers are extremely selfish whereas the working poor are extremely generous is extremely revealing, and he also shows the economic benefits of a more charitable and less regulated society where people are more tolerant of wealth being made in large quantities without taxation. He shows that those states of America with the stingiest unemployment benefits have the most job growth and attract migrants from states where wealth is taxed to pay for welfare.I do have some genuine criticisms of the book. Many social and ecological indicators clearly reveal that there are benefits to a tough, fully masculinised society (e.g. much higher environmental standards) yet Brooks does not consider this or assumes it to be too well known. In reality, the very fact that Europeans are much more assertive, selfish and materialistic than Red Americans is contrary to common perceptions of the US as a materialistic culture.Also, the key OECD nations of Australia and New Zealand are not discussed at all. Australia, being culturally conservative and akin to Red America, is a particularly grievous omission. (My calculations suggest Australia's charitable giving level is higher than Europe but not nearly as high as Red America, which I think now reflects Australia's relatively high proportion of \\"secular conservatives\\"). East Asia could also have been studied better: I imagine its charitable giving levels will show conservative praise for Hong Kong as counterproductive.All in all, even if flawed at times badly, \\"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatism\\" will reveal the battle between conservatives and liberals to be quite different from what people think: instead of a battle between manly conservatives and feminine liberals, the culture war is (and I imagine always was) precisely and emphatically the reverse. Even if you do not buy this book, it will alter your prespectives on how cultures function."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"I have read half of this book so far.

It is clear that the liberal left believes itself to be compassionate merely because it advocates the government's forced redistribution of income. In reality, although we all (left or right) are subject to the same tax and income redistribution structure, liberals voluntarily give significantly less in both time, money and self than conservatives quietly do -- day in and day out.

In this book, the author lays out the statistics and does an analysis showing who gives and why they give. The answers will be earth-shattering for some and intuitive for others. Basically, those who give the most to charity are more likely to be religious and politically right of center. This is because they see it as an individual duty to give to charity. Those who give the least to charity are more likely to be non-religious and politically left of center. This is because they believe it is society's (aka the government's) role to help the needy through welfare programs. This thesis is solid for anyone who views it with an open mind. This is a great book for putting this thesis in print. The only critique I'll give the book is that it seemed to be repeating the same point in different ways. 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Brooks shares some important data here, and while there are those who will argue till the cows come home about whether the data themselves are accurate, my instinct tells me they are. However, the book comes across with such a pronounced conservative political bias, it frequently overwhelms the objective data. Brooks builds a convincing case that data show religious Americans of all stripes--both conservative AND liberal--give vastly more than their secular counterparts, and then he jumps to the conclusion that these data support conservative principals regarding taxes and social services.He further claims that his purpose is to defend \\"compassionate conservatives\\" against the unjust accusations of the secular liberals, and to inspire those liberals to put their own donations behind their considerable rhetoric. He does this in such strident anti-liberal tones that the only ones likely to hear his message are those of his own fold. . .one doesn't inspire good action out of people (secular liberals in this case) by first spending over 150 pages telling them how selfish and unreasonable they are.His use of statistics is unfortunately compromised by sloppiness with numbers--for example defending elimination of the estate tax by claiming that heirs are \\"likely to give much of it away\\" a few pages after he has shown statistics that a $20,000 inheritance generates on average $82 in donations.If Brooks had stuck to reporting what the numbers demonstrate, there is a great deal of useful information to be gleaned about who gives and who doesn't. If he had then gone on to exhort ALL OF US to give more than we do he'd be doing the nation a great service. As it is, this is a work that will largely soothe religious conservatives into complacency and raise the blood pressure of liberals, while changing very few minds. A missed opportunity, to be sure."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"I heard Arthur Brooks give a speech based on this book and my first thought was, \\"Every American should listen to this guy!\\" That speech is what caused me to read the book, though I must admit the speech was more inspirational. The book reveals important facts concerning the benefits of being charitable as individuals and as nations, based on numerous studies. It dispells the popular notion that Americans are selfish and greedy, when we are actually the most giving people on earth. Another important discovery is that government charity actually hurts more than it helps, and can exaserbate the problems it aims to solve. Mr. Brooks ended his speech by saying the moment we turn our giving over to the government is the moment we cease to prosper as a nation, and this book provides the evidence for that statement."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Reading the reviews here was rather disappointing. Conservativestended to essentially say, \\"Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, We're better than you\\".Liberals tended to be defensive, instead of resolving to give more.Now, as I'll point out below I have some serious problems with thebook. The reason I gave 2 rather than 1 star is that I hope it willinspire people to contribute and volunteer more. And I do thinkits an important topic, worthy of debate of how we make a betterworld.With that said, these are my serious reservations about it:1. Questions about the statistics.I believe the standard survey is designed that IF there is no biasbecause of loaded questions or other reasons, and IF it is truly a randomsample, then 95% of the time the margin of error will be on the order of 3%for the TOTAL survey.I question how random surveys are nowadays with call screening.Beyond that, there were claims made in the book that I would guessare statistically meaningless. I checked it out & returned it to the library,so I don't have it exactly, but I remember one footnote saying somethinglike Group A at one income level gave 2% more than Group B who madethe same income.My hunch would be that Group A & Group B at that income would be suchsmall samples that the margin of error would overwhelm the supposed difference.This touches on the very premise of the book. Bottom line was that liberalsgave ~ 2% of income to charity, while conservatives gave ~ 3%. But evenfor the total sample, I believe that this is well within the margin of error fora standard survey. But of course liberals and conservatives are subgroupswith smaller sample sizes, so the margin of error would be even greater,and thus the central claim of the book would be even more statisticallymeaningless.I read this book fairly carefully, and skimmed the footnotes and appendix,where the author explained the statistical methodology. At no point doI remember a discussion of margin of error. Its possible that I missedthis, in which case I would be grateful if someone could point out the pageswere margin of error was mentioned. Otherwise, it is a very odd omissionfor a book devoted to statistics and would lead one to to suspect the authoromitted it because it largely destroyed his case.2. Definitions of liberals and conservatives:I believe the book defines liberals and conservatives by what they callthemselves. However, it is at least possible that someone who is sociallyconservative (anti-abortion, pro-gun, anti-gay, etc.) and economically liberal(supports universal health care, higher minimum wage, etc.), would call themselves\\"conservative\\" or vice-versus & similarly for socially liberal, economicallyconservative individuals.This could skew claims that conservatives give more to charity than liberals.3. The attack on the inheritance tax:Out of all the problems in the world today, that Paris Hilton doesn't have enoughmoney is the least of my concerns. The book makes the old canard that inheritancesare \\"double taxed\\". First off, in a lot of cases that is not true. If someone buys apainting for 100K, dies later, & then the heir sells it for $5 million, at least $4.9million is never taxed.Secondly lots of money is double taxed. If a plumber fixes a leak for me, I pay them with money that was already taxed, and then the plumber pays taxes again on that same money, and then the plumber pays taxes again when they buy something.So spare us the Paris Hilton pity party.4. The attack on justice:The book quotes Nader \\"If there was more justice, there would be less need for charity\\",and then spends pages attacking that statement.Companies run brutal sweatshops, when they could easily afford to pay workers a living wage, and hire more workers so they don't have to work such long hours. Wasteful spending includes billions of dollars paid to CEOs who do an absolutely miserable job, and clearly did not earn their paychecks.To take one example, if there was more justice in the world, some of the money sweated from exploited workers and given to overpaid CEOs could have gone to worker's wages in Haiti. They would have had better houses, that would not have collapsed as easily in the earthquake. This could have saved hundreds of thousands of people in the tragedy a few years ago and lessened the need for charity.5. Lack of historical perspective:The book makes the claim (which I'm highly skeptical of) that increased charitablecontributions lead to more economic growth. Another claim was that increased taxeslead to less charity.Yet if you look at US history, up to the 1940s, there were catastrophic economic depressions that we have avoided since then. In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, there were far less taxes, and thus presumably much more charity.The book did not really cover any history. It tried to document the ^ charity -> ^ economic growth as I recall with just a few years of data (another case of small sample size leading to statistically unjustifiable conclusions?)The book also claimed that Americans are happier than Europeans because the US has less taxes, more charity and children. A historian would immediately say that Europe has also suffered much more than America from wars in the last century. The memory of the massive bloodletting from the World Wars has to have an affect on happiness.6. Questionable environmental and economic assumptions:The book specifically says ^ charity -> ^ GDP. But GDP is a horrible measure -just the total monetary output of goods & services in a nation, without any attempt tomeasure the value of that output. Thus, pollution, divorces, medical costs,funeral expenses, and repairs from auto crashes all increase GDP. It also doesn'tmeasure unpaid work, for instance volunteering for charity.I believe there are much better measures, such as GPI (Genuine Progress Indicator),that attempt to subtract out output that is clearly negative and add in unpaid work.Whether GPI, or another stat is the best measure, I won't attempt to judge, but GDPdeserves a well overdue burial.Another claim in the book is that having kids is an unqualified good. If the kids areadopted, I agree. However, If the kids are leading to population growth, that hasserious environmental consequences.7. The claim that liberals believe in redistribution of wealth and conservatives don't:Conservatives believe in redistribution of wealth upwards from the vast majorityof Americans to a tiny elite. Among the many policies they promote toward this goal -No-bid, corrupt contracts that funnel vast amounts of taxpayer dollars tomilitary contractors.Corporate welfare, such as the taxpayer paid stadium built forthe baseball team President Bush owned.Increased taxes on money earned through work and decreased taxes onunearned income such as interest, dividends, and inheritances.Cuts to Social Security and Medicare ostensibly for deficit cutting purposes.This is when they are indifferent to the main drivers of the deficit - tax cuts forthe rich, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the recession caused by WallStreet speculators.8. No rating of different types of charity:The book called someone giving to the Heritage Foundation \\"charity\\", becausethey \\"sacrificed\\" and \\"who are we to judge someone's motives\\". Um, if you givea $50,000 contribution to a group that will lobby for a $5 million dollar tax cut foryou, and support criminal rights for toxic waste dumpers that mean millions morefor you, is that donation really a sacrifice?I don't think it was explicitly stated, but I get the feeling that any donation to a non-profit group would qualify as \\"charity\\" by this reasoning. With the exception, based on the book's attack on justice, of groups working to guarantee rights - for instance a group working for universal health care.Again, I don't think it was said in so many words, but the implicit impression gained was that the above premise is the book's argument (which would perhaps explain why the book finds that liberals give less than conservatives to charity).Apart from the question of groups working for your favorite political solution, there wereother problematic non-rating of organizations. Every other cause was judged equally worthy.Setting aside political causes, which are inherently controversial, and perhapswill never lead to a undisputed conclusion, I still believe that most people couldcome to a consensus rating of other causes.For instance, these three causes would be rated:Highest: Group providing services to low income people(example: a medical clinic in a slum)Medium: Artistic group open to the public(example: an art museum that is low cost and has many free days),Lowest: Artistic group largely closed to the public(example: an opera company that can only be seen by buying $50 tickets).9. \\"Charity\\" in many cases is just disguised spending on the part of the giverSomeone may give $1 million to a college, but they get a building named forthem. There children also go to the front of the admission line, bumping morequalified kids out of an elite school. Others spend megabucks on the symphonyor the opera and get appointed to the board as a result. For many upper classtwits, that is a big status symbol.10. Conclusion:I feel the author promotes navel gazing. His definition of \\"who reallycares\\" is skewed toward that which makes the giver feel good. Fora book that should be about how to make the world a better place, thereis a remarkable lack of interest in \\"what really works\\". One thinks ofSocial Security and Medicare, which made a dramatic improvementin reducing poverty rates among the elderly.One thinks of the difference between the economic system in the 19thcentury and 20th up though the Great Depression, versus that after thatperiod. In the earlier period, it was almost totally dependent on charity,with very little government. It was also much more miserable, with higherpoverty rates, more destructive economic catastrophes, and lower lifeexpectancy.In contrast, the latter period with much more government had less poverty,higher life expectancy, and unemployment insurance and other governmentprograms helped cushion the impact of destructive economic times.The author is not really interested in what works to help make this a betterworld. Charity is his be all and end all for \\"who really cares\\", no matter ifit more charity / less government leads to worse outcomes then less charity /more government. As long as someone can smugly sit, gazing adoringly attheir navel, and thinking \\"I'm so perfect because I give to charity\\", the authorcalls that person someone \\"who really cares\\".In contrast, someone who advocates more solidarity and fundamental humanrights such as the right to health care is denigrated by the author as someone\\"who doesn't really care\\". This even if action by the whole community leadsto better results than relying on individual charity.But ultimately, it doesn't matter if all my objections are correct.We still live in a world in which millions die each year from hungerand preventable or treatable diseases.It doesn't really matter what liberals give in relation to conservatives,because no group gives enough in relation to the need. So I urge youto give & volunteer more."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"This fascinating book carefully anaylzes and evaluates a wide range of market research studies concerning giving habits and reaches some surprising conclusions. The author is an experienced market researcher and very even-handed. This ought to change the tone of the political debate in this country."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"The book uses data from many sources to prove that the one overwhelming predictor of generosity is religion. Political affiliation is almost irrelevent - the statistics for religious liberals and religious conservaties are identical. Religious people are statistically more likely to give than secularists (91% to 66%), and give more of their money (3.5 times more than secularists), are more likely to volunteer their time (67% to 44%), and volunteer more of their time (almost twice as much). The fact that the conservative population is more charitable than the liberal population is due to the fact that religious people tend to be politically conservative.Brooks defines religious people as those who attend a place of worship at least once a week (roughly 30% of the population), and secularists as those who do not believe in a diety or attend a place of worship one time a year or less (20% of the population). That clearly leaves a large \\"middle class\\" where I suspect the statistics are hazy.Contrary to comments in a previous review (by Richard Bennet), Brooks does address the issue of who the aid is given to. The statistics hold independent of the recipient of the donation or how the donation is solicited. Compared to secularists, religious people are more likely to donate to secular organizations or when the recipient is not local or is unknown. Religious people are more likely to make a donation when asked (by any organization, religious or not) than secularists.Brooks also addresses the issue (in an entire chapter) of comparing US generosity with the generosity of other countries. Foreign aid as a percentage of GDP by the US federal government may be smaller than some nations, but private donations more than make up for the difference. For example, even accounting for the cost of living, Americans give twice as high a percentage of their incomes as the Dutch (and since there are many more Americans than Dutch, the total dollar amount is overwhelming). Brooks does have some data on other countries that shows the religious versus secularist statistics are not limited to the US population.There is a lot of discussion in the book about the definition of charity which in some ways is more interesting than the statistical conclusions. How do you compare \\"compassion\\" versus \\"charity\\"? What is more important, motives or actions? Can charity be measured simply by donations or should the results of the donations be considered? The one area that Brooks is clear on is that charity must be consensual and beneficial. Charity is a personal, voluntary sacrifice for the good of another person. That means government aid as a result of taxation is not charity since the giver is forced to give (pay taxes).Overall, this is a very good book with a lot of references and data contained in a long appendix. Data is from multiple sources including religious and secular charities and government organizations. Its well written and the numbers and statistics don't overwhelm the reader. Its obvious that the conclusions will be controversial and some are very surprising (such as the working poor are the most charitable of any group, but the nonworking poor are the worst even though they both have the same income)."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"I bought this book because I teach a course in which we read Tocqueville's Democracy in America and I was looking for current information to supplement our discussion of Tocqueville. The book is on the whole a wonderful book but it has one flaw that leads me to give it 4, not 5, stars. The flaw is conveyed in the book's subtitle: \\"The Surprising Truth about Compassionate Conservatism.\\" Now, as Brooks demonstrates, it is indeed the case that conservatives are more charitable and more likely to volunteer than liberals. Nonetheless, as Brooks also points out, this is the case because conservatives are more likely to be religious than liberals and the religious are more charitable and more likely to volunteer than the non-religious. By far the most important variable accounting for charity and voluntarism is religious participation, as Tocqueville asserted over a century and a half ago. It could be that Brooks (or his publisher) wants to obscure the relative importance of political ideology and religion in order to target an audience that will purchase the book, and one can hardly fault him for that. After all, his CSPAN discussion of the book was held at the Heritage Foundation. Still, as he states on pages 47 and 50, religious conservatives and religious liberals give to charity at the same rate--91%-- although religious conservatives give 10% more than religious liberals. Religious liberals are slightly more likely to volunteer, however, and although among all liberal and conservative households, liberal households earn 6% more than conservative households (p.22), I suspect very strongly that religious conservative households earn at least 10% more than religious liberal households. I say this because religious liberal households are almost twice as likely to be African-American (23%) than the population at large (about 13%) and altogether African-American households earn only about 62% of white households. In other words, the only significant difference between religious liberal and conservative households, that the latter give 10% more than the former, is probably exclusively a function of differences in average household income.Now, in case someone is inclined to dismiss my comments as ideologically driven, I will point out that I am a former Heritage Foundation fellow. My comments are not meant to disparage conservatives or laud liberals. Far from it. My point is the same as Tocqueville's --it is religion, not political ideology, that is essential to the civic health of America.Brad Lowell Stone"},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Brooks research shows that 1) Americans are charitable, 2) Conservitives/religious individuals care, 3) government negatively impacts charity, and 4) charity will make your life better.

If you have faith in the Almighty you're more likely to love (\\"charity\\" according to 1 Corinthians ch 13) your neighbor.The one negative is that the book has a political slant. No, it doesn't say we need to vote conservative and Brooks goes as far as even challenging liberals to change their philanthropic ways. But, it seems as if everything in our society revolves around politics.Brooks is a clever writer that uses common language.

This is a very stable and robust find, and it turns out that it does not depend on the kind of charity: money, time, treasure, blood donations, secular or religious causes, in all those categories conservatives, especially the religious kind, are by far more giving and generous than anyone else.

My wife has been a professional volunteer coordinator for more than 15 years, in both religious and secular settings. There is nothing in these statistics that contradict our personal experiences.So, what does Brooks say? \\"The conventional wisdom runs like this: Liberals are charitable because they advocate government redistribution of money in the name of social justice; conservatives are uncharitable because they oppose these policies. But note the sleight of hand: Government spending, according to the logic, is a form of charity. Let us be clear: Government spending is not charity. It is not voluntary sacrifice by individuals.\\" (p. 20)Brooks marshals a horde of facts to prove the point that the more politically liberal the individual, the community, the state, the country or the continent, the less likely that the individual, community, state, country or continent will be to donate to private charity in any form. Meaning, if a state voted for Bush in 2004, it generally gave more than a state that went for Kerry. The United States gives light years more to private charity than the nanny state European Union.Why?Generally speaking, it's because the general mindset is that there should be a government program to take care of that. This attitude affects volunteerism rates, monetary giving and even in-kind donations like giving blood or donating items to Goodwill. They are even more likely to give back extra change when the cashier makes a mistake.Brooks breaks it down by income levels, religious affiliation, political party affiliation and even by race. The most determining factor is political affiliation and one party is way more religious than the other one so Republicans, specifically Conservative Republicans who go to church on a regular basis are far more likely to give money, time or in-kind goods than anyone else. Religious Democrats give more than any other sort of Democrat and more than many types of Republicans. The most generous of all? Working poor Conservatives - the old Reagan Democrats. Ironically, welfare payments suppress giving. People who were formerly working poor gave less when they accepted welfare, even if their income levels were comparable.Brooks is quick to note that these are trends, not absolutes. There are religious conservatives who do not give and ultra-liberal, ultra-secularists that give plenty. But, his data does show certain trends.Why?\\"For many people, the desire to donate other people's money displaces the act of giving one's own. People who favor government income redistribution are significantly less likely to behave charitably than those who do not...For many Americans, political opinions are a substitute for personal checks; but people who value economic freedom, and this bridle against forced income redistribution, are more charitable.\\" (p.55)Brooks backs it up with 23 pages of data in an appendix and a healthy set of endnotes."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"The book's subtitle (\\"the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism\\") overstates the book's own points about giving patterns. The main point of Brook's book, based on a huge colllection of research, is that society benefits at all levels from private charity and that some mindsets produce charitable behavior (at a statistical level!) more readily than others.Religion (however you choose to measure it, and interestingly, regardless of flavor) increases the likelihood of giving to all forms of charity.Believing that caring for others is the government's job decreases generosity *regardless* of whether the government is performing that function or not.Being married and having children both increase the tendency to give even when you control for differences in income.Despite what at least one reviewer has stated, Brooks makes it clear that there are exceptions to all of these patterns. He states that so often that I have to wonder if people ever bother to actually READ the books they're reviewing.I do have some petty quibbles with the book. Brooks tries to compare U.S. and Europen taxes by just comparing income tax rates, which doesn't take goodies like the VAT into consideration. His concluding chapter, about how to increase charitable behavior, looks far too readily to the government for solutions when the whole tenor of the book is critical of its effectiveness.Still, a fascinating book, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Professor Brooks shows that America has a clear split between those who contribute to charity and those who do not.

I only wish more authors would organize their books in this highly readable form.Most dictionaries explain \\"liberal\\" using the terms: free to give, generous, giving largely and abundant. Dr. Brooks' book shows generosity does not apply to those in America we call \\"liberals\\" as much as it does to \\"conservatives.\\" Clarifying this issue alone makes this a valuable book. Too often conservatives accept the liberal slur that they do not care about the poor. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The data on personal charity shows that conservatives give more than liberals to help the poor in spite of the liberals greater wealth.Actually the greatest divide is not political; it is religious. Dr. Brooks shows that religious folk give more to secular as well as religious causes than secular folk do.I was one of those who took offense when G. W. Bush used the term \\"Compassionate Conservatism.\\" My disgust with the term came from the implication that linking compassion and conservatism was something new. As one who has studied various policy prescriptions for the poor, I knew that the conservative prescriptions were often the more compassionate and less cynically political than the liberal prescriptions. Dr. Brooks shows that the word \\"Compassionate\\" in \\"Compassionate Conservative\\" is probably redundant.In addition to correlating charity with religion and politics, Dr. Brooks also correlates charity with attitudes toward government welfare, the giver's income, his family, health, and happiness. He also discusses variations in charity across international borders, and even discusses the effect charity seems to have in increasing the giver's wealth.Only someone dedicated to a government solution for every ill could downgrade a book that has so many positive lessons for Americans.Because this book corrects some pernicious political slurs regarding charity it is very valuable. It also destroys the arguments many on the secular left have used to excuse their non-participation in individual giving. If they would only donate blood at the same rate as conservatives our nation would have a more than ample supply.Real benefits to the beneficiary, giver, and society accrue from voluntary individual charity whether in the form of money, volunteer time, or blood donations. We need to recognize who provides these benefits and not give credit to some for mere words."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"Given a fair reading, this book will be an eye-opener for some, and an encouragement to others. I hope there's no cause for cynicism or gloating. Keep in mind that this is a broad brush, \\"big picture\\" kind of book. Brooks is careful to point out that his study is not predictive of individual behavior, but measures influential factors on a large scale. Subtitled America's Charity Divide: Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters, this is fascinating and well documented study of correlations between charitable giving and things like religion, sociopolitical and economic views, family structure and work ethic. Brooks finds a very strong correlation between religion and giving; not just giving to religious charities but to secular ones as well, giving time and money to help others. Conservatives were much more charitable as a group than Liberals owing largely to a difference in philosophy on who is responsible for caring for those in need. Those who place less responsibility on government are more generous with their own time and money. The working poor tend to give a much larger percentage of their time and money for helping others than any other group. Charitable values are largely passed on by example from parents to children in intact healthy families. Brooks also draws some interesting comparisons of charitable activity in the USA and Europe. He finds that where government becomes more of a caretaker, people become less charitable and less prosperous. Brooks finds a strong correlation between charitable activity and the economic prosperity of a country, seeing trends that discourage personal giving as worrisome. Many commonly held stereotypes are contradicted in this book. Brooks was very surprised to see his own findings contradict the assumptions he had going into the study. I came away from the book feeling encouraged that there are a lot of good people in this country who ought to get to know one another better. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compasionate Conservatism Who Gives, Who Doesn't, and Why It Matters","review":"\\"Who Really Cares\\"Apparently I do...Who really cares is a look at the dynamics of the charitable nature in some Americans and what those \\"givers\\" have in common. The book begins with defining charity and what the author means when he says \\"Giving\\". The book looks not just at the financial donations given to secular and religious organizations, but the time donated as volunteers and donations like giving to the Salvation Army.The book includes statistics on who gives, who takes, and the relationship between the two. The quote from president Carter's term of \\"Two Americas\\" outlines that there are those who exemplify the best in nature charity and community and the other segment of society which is seen as \\"takers\\" that make Americans look shallow and selfish. Arthur C. Brooks gives a great deal of attention to defining what he means and how he categorizes different styles of political thinking. At first glance I was skeptical of the book fearing it would simply be a rant of political jargon and propaganda, much like an Ann Coulter book, but it was factual with several indexes and reference pages in the back of the book so you could see what Mr. Brooks used as his sources and perhaps draw your own conclusions.There is no doubt that the author has a \\"conservative\\" background with a preference favoring religious organizations. As a conservative Christian who does give, I found this book to be reassuring that I am not atypical for a Republican or conservative. In fact this book helps break the stereotype of the heartless conservative that is perpetuated in modern politics. There have been several times where my \\"liberal\\" friends have been surprised of my political beliefs because of my socially caring and light hearted nature towards people. I have been surprised that they were surprised and this book would be a good tool for any conservative trying to clarify this for his friends.The \\"Right\\" leaning nature of \\"Who Really Cares\\" should not dissuade any \\"Left\\" leaning reader. Fundamentally some of same values that make conservative givers give are the same reasons so many social liberals want the government to provide social services.There are some areas that could use some improvement, and predominantly that would be the redundant nature of his material. He repeatedly outlines the meaning of the terms and how he is using them. While this is necessary to some degree, there are times where it slows the pace of the book. Also, I may have comparable beliefs to the author but I know several religious, \\"middle-class\\", people who are very left leaning in their political beliefs who \\"give\\" as much if not more than I do. So I believe much of his generalization is good but it should be remembered that it is just that; generalization.If I were grading this book it would be an A-. I find that it has something to offer for anyone who is interested in who and why people give. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for the thought processes behind giving and find out the reason why America can be the most charitable and caring nation in the world."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"There's no way someone can get to know about objects without reading meyer's book. It's huge but worth"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"While reading the previous review, &quot;Useful, but not perfect&quot; by Matthew Whelan, I realized I had to respond. Matthew writes in his fifth paragraph, &quot;...claims about Design by Contract are overblown. Bug-free software simply does not exist (over a dozen lines, anyway.)&quot; Well, Matthew, and anyone else who believes this, you are quite mistaken. In 1990, with all due credit given to Bertrand Meyer, I designed and code-generated from an ancient CASE tool, Knowledgeware, a bug-free, mission-critical online IMS/COBOL/DB2 application. This app had not even one bug after it went into production.I bought and read the first edition of this book, OOSC, in 1989. Shortly afterwards I was tasked with implementing a small, but mission critical online IMS/COBOL/DB2 application. The lead designer was inexperienced, and given that I was tasked with construction and implementation, I realized my success was dependent on a redesign.I redesigned the system with preconditions and postconditions every step of the way. The reason we had zero bugs after implementation, is because we found and fixed them all in integration testing. The code would run along and then hit a routine where the preconditions or postconditions weren't met, and would spit out an error message stating the program, procedure, and condition that failed. Once these were all fixed, no more errors, ever.Keep in mind, this was IMS, COBOL, and DB2 in 1990!. Bertrand Meyer's book, this book in it's first edition, enabled me to build a bug-free IMS/COBOL/DB2 application that was as close to object-oriented as possible, given the languages mandated. On top of which, the whole thing was code-generated by Knowledgeware, straight from logical design to code. Without Design by Contract, I never could have succeeded. Thanks Bertrand Meyer!"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This book presents an exhaustive overview of the object technology in a style which is easy to read. Unfortunately, the author wastes a lot of time studying wrong choices: this means that you will learn a lot on things that will never be implemented and used by programmers, and less on things that have been implemented in languages such as Java or C++."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"The book begins with a bang and ends with distaste.After reading about the first hundred pages or so, I felt that I uncovered a truly remarkable book about programming. The advice it gave seemed concrete, and it had a promising appeal to make me a better programmer. Unfortunately, the next one thousand pages were not able to meet my expectations.In my opinion, there are three major problems with this book: its style, its consistency, and its goal.First, its style. The book is overflated. Meyers often spends several paragraphs describing a concept that deserves a mere sentence. A good editor could have compressed this book down to 600 pages or less. Moreover, his tone is somewhat conceited. He throws words like 'n-dimensional space', 'topology', and 'monoid' around without using them meaningfully. Is he trying to show off his knowledge?Second, the book is not consistent with itself. Meyers states many principles and chides other languages for violating them. However, he occasionally violates them himself. He justifies it via statement like, &quot;while this may appear to be a direct violation of Principle X, it actually isn't because of [some reason that usually isn't very convincing]...&quot; Sometimes I found his reasons were based on misconceptions and personal opinion rather than fact.Third, Meyers' goal for the book is disreputable. The book advertises itself as a general reference for OOP; instead, it teaches the bare basics of OOP and spends the rest of its time bashing other languages and furtively teaching Eiffel, a language he invented. I think that this is unacceptable.Is the book completely horrible? No. It does have a couple nice concepts, such as Design by Contract, Bottom-Up Approach, and his description of Abstract Data Types. However, all of the beneficial material could have been summarized in 50 pages, not 1,250. For these reasons, I recommend getting another book, unless you want to use this book for what it's really meant for: learning to program in Eiffel."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This is the book that every designer need's to be carried."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"The author is famous in OO and the book is recommended from another book,however, the programming language used in the book is no longer used in the market."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"Provides one with clear view on how to actually write good object-oriented software, as well as the limitations of some programming languages.Unfortunately it describes and introduces the Eiffel language.

But I couldn't get past the first few pages as I CAN'T figure out what the whole point of the subject is! I can appreciate the power of objects (say in a language like Python or Java) but Eiffel (and this book) takes it way too far from programming realities. Maybe this book and Eiffel will be much more suitable for those who are designing REALLY large systems (i doubt it though since if it sucks at small things then more so far large right?) where all the dense OO concepts might be more applicable but as for me, I'm willing to unload this book to whoever wants to buy it from me for half the price."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"A couple of aspects of this book might lead you *not* to read it. That would be too bad, since it contains valuable informaton. Specifically:(1) it spends a lot of time discussing particulars of the Eiffel language or the considerations leading Meyer to design Eiffel as he did. Observation: Even if you skip these parts, you could find useful information in the rest of the book, and many people may enjoy these insights into Meyer's approach.(2) the attitude is often rather dogmatic and judgmental. As one authority commented on the first edition, it &quot;tends to confuse Eiffel with universal principles.&quot; Observation: though unfortunate, this does not detract from the value of the content.Further comments:(3) If you don't know any object oriented language, the book is a natural choice, since it is very clear and does not require prior knowledge of any particular language.(4) If you know another OO language, especially C++, you may get more for your time and money by choosing another book, at least to start.

You don't have to agree with the Author right away to learn from him.Of course, not everyone can use Eiffel. But only the concepts matter, not their actual implementation. And if you think this book's leitmotiv is &quot;Look how Eiffel is the purest language that embodies all the necessary concepts&quot; (how convenient!), then recall that Eiffel indeed started as a notation and only evolved towards an implementation after the fundamental concepts were layed down. Therefore, no wonder Eiffel seems a natural fit!The audience for this book is any experienced (5 years or more) software engineer, or software architects, whith an experience in designing complex systems and making them evolve over time. Some technical background is required though, otherwise you may only see things superficially and miss the underlying gems.Remember that OO is not a static technology, so to speak. Its natural support for encapsulation and evolution is what makes it an ideal technology in today's modern software management.Read this book again!"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"When writing a treatise on computer programming one has to strike a balance between providing a book that is both useful (which usually means writing within the context of a compilable programming language), but general enough so as not to oversimplify or truncate parts of the theory because it is not represented by the chosen language. In OOSC2 Meyer does just this, by providing a sound and general introduction to object-oriented programming, while using the Eiffel language for purposes of notation and practical programming examples.Meyer has a very engaging writing style: very clear, with lots of good (and humorous : ) examples. And the Eiffel language itself seems quite simple, readable (it was obviously influenced by ADA) and brilliantly designed (think of Java, but with multiple inheritance, generics, and without the run-time inefficiency of the java virtual machine).But whether you program in Eiffel, Java, C#, or C++, OOPSC2 has alot to offer in terms of OO software design, and a good understanding of the issues behind inheritance, polymorphism, the importance of static typing, and dynamic binding.For example, I program in C++, and this book has helped me clearly understand the object-oriented features of the language, because in clearly explaining the principles, it helped me understand the intentions of the C++ language designers.May be my only complaint, at perhaps half a star, is the fact that Meyer often weighs in heavily against other languages for their shortcomings, while going easy on his own Eiffel language. For example, he failed to give an objective analysis regarding the run-time costs of garbage collection. Indeed, the chapter on garbage collection seemed more of handwaving defense of the fact that Eiffel uses this technology. A presentation of run-time empirical studies for various applications would have been much more welcomed. However I believe that the benefits of this book far outweigh the occasional partisanship shown towards Eiffel. I truely believe that Meyer favors Eiffel because he believes in it more on the basis of principle than on profit (he does own a software company that supports Eiffel development tools)."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"Some of the previous reviews have lamented the fact that the book is Eiffel oriented instead of focusing on C++ or Java (or Python, or ...). It is important to remember that Eiffel was developed to support the method, and not the other way around. Meyer didn't set out to write a book about how to do O-O using a particular implementation language (many of which had O-O tacked on), but to write a book about how to do O-O (not withstanding language limitations). Indeed, some of the ideas expressed in the book aren't even currently supported in Eiffel (and in most of those cases, in any language yet).Eiffel was developed to support the method, and the fact that it happens to also be compilable is a bonus. It also addresses some very practical concerns, such as software should be self-documenting (humans/programmers don't like to document, or it will diverge from reality over time). Javadoc comments are a similar idea.I went into this book initially as a strong java/c++ advocate, and was also dismayed that the book didn't center around these languages. But, I had my eyes opened (even though I thought they were already open at the time), and realized that java/C++ (et al.) just weren't up to the task. Design-by-contract is an idea who all by itself is worth it, and many other languages would do well to seriously consider the idea.Also, some people have complained that Meyer is very opinionated and one-sided. This may be somewhat true, however he does not ask you to take any of it on faith. He meticulously justifies everything (there's a reason the book is 1200+ pages), including frequently presenting the arguments in the other direction. You may not agree with everything, but you can't say that he ever gave &quot;because I said so&quot; as the reason. And, at least in my case, if you actually give them serious consideration, even the most adverse (to your current way of thinking) ideas/arguements start to make sense (garbage collection, for example, is one of these ideas that C++ programmers tend to be particularly against).This book is a serious challenge to the &quot;set in your ways&quot; mindset which *many* programmers/analysts suffer from, and those who can actually transend that stand to benefit greatly from reading it, *even if* they continue to use C++/java or whatever. The ideas are O-O specific, not language specific, though some are more or less easy to implement in various languages. The book contains chapters on how to apply the ideas in various languages.For those who would actually like to give Eiffel a try as well, several compilers for nearly every platform (Linux, BeOS, Windows, PalmOS target, and so on) can be obtained for free or very little cost, from several vendors and the open source community."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This is a comprehensive explanation of Object Oriented Programming principles. It is complete in breadth, thorough in depth, well-organized and well-written. It requires discipline on the part of the reader to stick with it for 1000+ pages, but it is not such a chore as it first may seem and the payoff is worth the effort. No programmer would regret this read.Other reviewers have mentioned that Meyer was unable to separate OO principles from the Eiffel language used as the book's notation. I disagree with that analysis, though perhaps he went further into describing the notation than was necessary to make the basic point in a few instances. As a reader, I was never left in confusion about which points were conceptual and which were notational.I also appreciate the fact that this book was NOT written using a more popular language. The above criticism would have been more true but less noticed if he had. A more familiar langauge would have distracted readers from the real topic. It is useful to learn about priciples that are not directly supported in C++ or Java. Such a presentation helps you more effectively apply the features of the language that you are using and the other features can often be simulated when it seems useful to do so."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This is a good book about the internal workings and design of object orientation. Chapters 8 and 9 are some of the best writings about the &quot;guts&quot; of objects available anywhere.However, Meyer's talk about the alleged superiority of OOP over procedural and RDBMS techniques did not feel quite right; but at first I could not quite put my finger on exactly why.After sharing sections and examples with some colleagues and e-groups, it seems that Meyer did indeed exaggerate or misrepresent some of the comparisons. The story on case statements, top-down design, relational &quot;joins,&quot; and others are not quite the paradigm victory that Meyer paints. Often he neglects to mention the other side of the coin with regard to the myriad tradeoffs of picking one approach over another. Such exclusions of the downsides are more reminiscent of marketing departments than of worthy academics.One prominent example is the false dichotomy given between pure top-down procedural design and OO design. Others and I have built many applications without tying routines and modules to a strict sequence. They can be as time-independent as you wish to make them. Extreme top-down indeed has its problems, but it is not the only procedural game in town. If anything, it underscores the risks of taking ANY design philosophy too far.An otherwise good book is hampered by a disappointing lopsided promotional attitude."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"There's certainly a lot of stuff in this book that every software engineer should know - including those writing in non-OO languages, many of the concepts are still applicable, just with a little more work.However, there are some irritations, which I shall focus on as everyone else has stated the good points as well as I can. This will result in this review looking incompatible with the 4-star rating I have given the book.Generally, I agree with everywhere Meyer affirms a concept. However, I find him dismissive of useful tools (notably those he hasn't thought of), often on the basis of incorrect usage or analysis - Use cases would be the prime example of this.Also, contrary to the editorial review, I did find the book lacking in demarcation between general OO concepts, and Eiffel specifics. Several points swap between the two without no attempt at signposting the transition.Finally, some of the claims about Design by Contract are overblown. Bug-free software simply does not exist (over a dozen lines, anyway). Anyone who believes they can implement a system perfectly first-time is dangerously deluded, no matter how good the method of its construction. It is exactly that mistake which caused the Ariane crash, and the claim that Design by Contract would have prevented it is false. The Ariane failure was systematic - they examined the contract for the system which failed, but failed to test it at all. In fact, the mode of failure could well be considered an assertion of contract failing. This exception was not handled due to a conscious design decision. The rocket's resulting destruction was due to belief that the software was infallible.I have found these gripes have made reading the book harder, which is a shame as there is a wealth of invaluable content."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"Unfortunately, the majority of books in computing science area suffers a lack ofprecise definition and clarity of terms and concepts. In my personal opinion, thecommercial aspects that strongly affect this area, comparing to other technologicalones, contributes to open the computing book market for authors of highly questionableexperience and a quite shalow knowledge about the matter they're treating. For example, itis not unusual to see the same author (or group of authors) writing books about Java, .NET,JSP, ASP, Perl, OO, C/C++ and so on.Bertrand Meyer's OO book is an exception in this tendency. The subjects treated are logicallydistributed and the concepts are clearly and precisely defined. Then, the reader gets anintuitive and deep understanding of OO theoretical aspects, independent of OO languagespecifics. All the concepts are perfectly prioritized and sequenced: software quality beforeOO, ADT before classes, features before functions, DBC before exception handling. Everysingle concept bases the following ones. I must say, however, that the author should be moreconcise: he writes too much to explain a single concept. He reveals his large academicliterate background inserting unnecessary large comments in the text. The book could havea quite less number of pages without any loss in learning the main concepts.I sincerely do not see any problem about the relation between the OO concepts presented andtheir practical implementation: EIFFEL language. At least, the author shows concretely thatthe concepts treated in the book are implementable. If there were not any language tocomplete and support the theoretical aspects, we could say : &quot;Ok, all the conceptsin the book are perfect and beautiful, but the closest programming language tothese concepts we can use is JAVA, for example.&quot;"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"I wanted a general text which analyzed the use of Object Oriented Programming, discussing good and bad approaches etc. and a title like &quot;Object-Oriented software Construction&quot; seemed very promising. However I am disappointed. This book is not it.Mr Meyer certainly knows a lot about object oriented programming and the book certainly covers a lot of ground with respect to object oriented programming. However one soon gets the feeling that something is not quite right; that the book is not really a general text on OOP. Mr Meyer clearly has strong biases with regard to the many choices involved in Object Oriented language implementation. There seems to be a clear path emerging and that Mr Meyer is going to shepherd you down his chosen path come what may. I eventually concluded that the book describes his journey through the maze of object oriented programming to justify his development of the Eiffel programming language.What made me come to that conclusion? For a start, the almost constant denigration of all things that he doesn't agree with. I doubt that there will ever be a \`perfect' computer programming language; one which does everything better than any other language. All languages are compromises to some extent in some areas. These compromises mean that all languages have good and bad points, and in an excellent object oriented programming book I would expect discussion to reflect this. However in this book, Mr Meyer is quite dogmatic about most such compromises and these are presented as the only possible \`reasonable' choice. He then dismisses the alternative as being less than perfect, and makes light of the difficulties with his own choice.The book is riddled with these dogmatic assertions. While the author could have written a major general text he chose not to. And that is the major problem because after a while one starts wandering whether what is written is actually a good description of OOP in general or just another biased justification. It is difficult to tell and the author certainly doesn't give any help. One needs to be a really proficient OOP programmer who knows a variety of languages to differentiate. So much so that if you could tell, you wouldn't have much use for the book in the first place.The (English) language and style the author uses clearly indicates that he has an axe to grind and of course the message comes in the last chapter. It is to \`sell' his programming language \`Eiffel'. In the end I realized that the book is really one big advertisement/justification. It reminds me of one of those advertisements for Coke. You think the film has started with all this glitzy action sequences until right at the end the character takes a long swig and you realize that he is holding that recognizable bottle and that you are still in the ads. At least in most ads a company generally makes it clear that it is trying to sell something.In summary I think that the title &quot;Object Oriented Language Construction: The road to Eiffel&quot; would be much more accurate. I certainly do not think the book is a good general reference for object oriented programming.

I also think it will go down in history as the &quot;turning point that enabled the software industry technologies to finally catch up with their intensly workable hardware counterparts&quot;. My advice to software developers endeavoring to improve their efficiency with this book is: 1) don't go past any words or symbols that you don't fully understand, 2) actually DO the exercises, 3) be patient with the sometimes verbose explanations, and 4) realize that the technology contained in this book is a goldmine and don't treat it any other way."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"A complete book about object orientation for the first time user and the advanced programmer?

I believe I met Bertrand at OOPSLA years ago.This book does have lots of nuggets in it in terms of the difference between object-oriented design (i.e. bottom up as opposed to the top-down of modular, external world simulation, command-query separation) but many of them seem to be almost throwaway lines or paragraphs. The examples, as befitting something designed for an undergraduate college course maybe do not draw out the true implications of the methodology being presented, i.e. text example for object modelling is a stack whereas more real world examples left as exercises at the end of the chapter.Additionally, there is understandably a lot of coverage of Eiffel that served to illustrate one concrete implementation of the concepts and occasionally Betrand references features missing from the language. If you won't be using Eiffel, I think some of this gets in the way of the concepts.My final observation is that much of the guidance, i.e. the dangers in finding objects from specification, really require an example to get the point across for those that haven't already failed at it on their own.In terms of a modern approach to OO that better get across the practical practice I would recommendDomain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of SoftwareandAgile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This is a very well written book about fundamentals of OOP.

As many programmers already know, 'Meyer' is the bible of OOP. The fact that many OOP books quote 'Meyer' attests it. Some people may say Meyer is old, no longer useful. But, I think Meyer is still the best book. Although many OOP languages come out, the basic concept of OOP has not changed.It is just wasting money to buy another book of OOP instead of this book. Do you want to not just know but study OOP? Must have it at first."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"In this book Bertrand Meyer did an excelllent job in explaining object oriented software design in a rigourous way. Too often authors of OO books were not formal and rigorous enough, leading to a lot of confusion in the OO world. This book gives a very formal and exact treatment of Object orienteation. As a consequence this book is a must read for every OO expert. That the book focusses on eiffel should not be seen as a drawback : you can apply most of the explained techniques in other OO languages.Also this book does not focus much on UML. However, to my opinion, this is not a drawback neither since the power of UML is strongly overhyped.Though there are some minor drawbacks in this book :-the book can be reduced to half of its size without sacrifying rigour and clearity. Some topics are not needed.-design patterns are missing in this book.-does not explain enough about unit testing. While the book gives very good explanation on design by contract, design by contract should be seen as an addition to unit testing, but it cannot replace it !!!Finally some remarks : please do not overestimate the power of software reuse : in reality it has limited usage since in order to create reusable software and reuse it, each teammember has to know quite well what the other teams are doing in order to reuse some part of their work. In reality, for big projects, this is often impractical.-Design by contract is an important software technique, but you can also use it (apart from some limitations) in Java the assert statement. Of course eiffel is probabaly the best designed programming language. But that does not make it the best choice for building complex applications!! I am convinced that Java , in combination with the techniques describbed in this book, with unit testing frameworks like Junit, with aspect oriented programming facilities, and with usage of design patterns can beat eiffel as a development environment for building mission critical applications."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"After reading the first couple of hundred pages, I felt something was not right. The notation the author used to explain his OO theories seemed like I was actually being forced to learn a computer language syntax. Before buying, I remember reading through some of the Amazon reviews that mentioned this book was an advertisement for Bertrand Meyer's Eiffel language. So I got online to find some Eiffel syntax and programming examples. Sure enough, Meyer's had me secretly learning his OO language, Eiffel!The first big clue comes in Chapter 36. Meyer's writes, \\"the language is the notation that we have devised in part C and applied throughout the book.\\" The Epilogue is the epiphany moment. It's entitled, \\"Epilogue, In Full Frankness Exposing the Language.\\" In the last paragraph he thanks the reader for \\"patiently\\" following along, unveiling that the \\"anonymous language\\" used throughout the book is actually Eiffel! He concludes, \\"welcome to the world of Eiffel.\\" BTW, this is on page 1,163!I give it 2 stars because 4 of the 36 chapters (~120 pages) are actually worth reading and have very little cruft. These chapters are included in Part B, \\"The Road To Object Orientation.\\" They cover some very key OO topics, such as modularity, reusability, decomposition, genericity, and abstract data types (ADT). I especially liked the contrast of functional and object-based decomposition in chapter 5. Meyer's argument really gives you a sense of the power of OO languages in application development environments compared to functional or structured languages, such as C or Ada.However, I bought the book believing it was a language independent study of OO methods. I made this assumption from the title, table of contents, and the book's back cover description. I feel very cheated and would not recommend this book to anybody who is looking for an in-depth read of OO analysis, design or programming. It wastes time introducing the \\"anonymous\\" Eiffel syntax, evolution, and implementation when the reader doesn't quite understand the big secret yet."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This book and the one from Meilir Page-Jones are absolutely must reads for the serious object oriented software developer.

For practical example, they are steered to the rest and works of others. This a special tag on the page about Polymorphism, which is the kind of ambigous term that begs to be forgotten. However, Meyer's lucid brevity makes the meaning stick.The feature I find most special is the pull down menu style outline quality of these pages. Abandon your highlighters with this book.

Every books author, programming languages inventor or methodologies designer gives a different definition of even the most common concepts you'll find in every book or article. Thus, the best one can do is to read as much as he can, and try to build his personal view of what OO means and brings. The literature, after all, is full of references, it's up to each of us to find the time to read them.In pursuing the objective to read the best available sources, this OOSC2 deserves a special mention. It has several qualities that put it aparts from the pool.First, it's complete. I mean, it could be your first book on OO and you would be gently but rigorously introduced to all the concepts you &quot;should&quot; (in &quot;my&quot; view) learn.Second, it teaches an OO programming language, i.e. Eiffel. And this is good both because learning a programming language will give you the concrete sensation of one important application of OO technologies, and because Eiffel has been invented by Dr. Meyer itself, so it's supposed that none can teach it better than him.Third, in addition to OO technologies you'll learn another product of Dr. Meyer's mind: Design by Contract. I know, this is finely interwined with both OO techno and Eiffel that it doesn't seems &quot;really added&quot;, but part of them. True, but you would have to buy another separate book (by Dr. Meyer itself) should you ever been interested only on it.This said, from this book you'll gain a solid introduction and very likely a thourough understanding of OO technologies and of one widely famous OO programming language. That is: a good investment, both for your wallet and your time."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","review":"This is one of the few books that really push beyond the bounds of ordinary books on software. A lot of those are just trying to explain you some well-known concepts, whether it is OO, a programming language or an IDE. This book also tries to explain te concepts of OO and programming, but it starts from ground up and explains every little thing while designing an OO-language. And if he happens to come up with a language called Eiffel (a language he designed) then it must mean that Eiffel is a pretty good language, because it is hard (if not impossible) to refute his explanation.This book really is on of the best together with Design Patterns and Effective C++.

This book focuses on the unification of these techniques into a coherent method.During unification, the techniques are often stripped of some of their scope. Only parts are used. This may at first seem somewhat limiting to the developer who likes to be master of technique, but the true mastery of any technique lies in knowing which parts of it to apply under what circumstances. The books helps you &quot;cut through the bull&quot; and get to the essence of the problem.As an example, the author not only introduces Exceptions (which are not OO specific), but also fits them neatly into the OO framework. The basic question &quot;under what circumstances do I apply this technique?&quot; is fully answered by &quot;when the contract is broken&quot;, and Exceptions are applied only in this context. Even a master of Exceptions will produce better software by sticking to this guideline.The books is a true gem, read it. It reads like a throughly developed mathematical theory, with clearly developed ideas, and relentlessly pursued goals. It builds your own understanding of the OO method, and anything you will read after this you will inescapably try to reconcile with the foundation laid by this book.

Before reading this book my favorite language was C++. After reading this book Eiffel became my favorite. This book transformed me to become an Eiffelist and pushed me to a new height of OO knowledge and practice.No other OO authors, language designers dare to touch the full potential of multiple inheritance and some downplay its role just to hide their inability to resolve the implementation issues associated with it. Eiffel uses a simple (and very elegant) feature renaming mechanism to resolve name clashes, feature sharing and replication mechanism for repeated inheritance. This book and Eiffel open up the path to utilize full potential of multiple inheritance. Thanks to Bertrand!The book also fully explains about the Design-by-Contract mechanism which safeguards your features and classes by using precondition, postcondition and invariant clauses. The Design-by-Contract mechanism is very useful and very important invention for both specification of individual features and classes, and serving as a testing and debugging aid. Thanks to Bertrand again!The other topics include: automatic memory management and garbage collection, genericity (similar to C++ template, but much better), disciplined exception handling, dynamic binding, polymorphic data structures, ... ... the list goes on.This book offers not only theoretical foundation of OO but also practical hands-on knowledge with lots of comprehensive examples.

This experience may be a metaphor regarding the book itself. This book reads as fine literature. In an age of tight budgets, fast food and discount superstores, its brilliance may in fact get in the way of the content Bertrand Meyer is communicating. While I personally appreciate the way in which it is written, some students of software engineering may find its eloquence to be a distraction.

Rather, I review it as one who admires the author based on a televised interview several years ago. In this interview he was asked about his political affiliation. He artfully dodged the question by claiming to be what he called a &quot;pragmatic rationalist&quot; someone who favored what made sense and opposed what did not. I've always remembered that and have adopted the phrase myself on many occasions.This book is dated but has withstood a test of time to a degree. Galbraith writes of how stockholders do not really control major corporations and he is correct. Power lays in the hands of the senior management, a power that is taken for granted nowadays and abused by the more unscrupulous senior managers. The argument Galbraith puts forth, that the major corporations are the apex of our economic society, is solid though it does not take into account greed brought about by the degree of power senior management enjoys. Many of Galbraith's examples are far more entertaining than his conclusions. Had he redirected his evidence into something that informed rather than confused, my review would have been more positive.There will be those who refuse to acknowledge the depth of Galbraith?s intellect, and the book is in serious need of updating, but all in all it is a worthwhile read. Galbraith once said that the real value of economics is that it keeps economists employed. There are at least a dozen other witticisms interlaced throughout this book, and for this reason alone, it deserves attention. Other than that, the non-economist will probably find it rather disinteresting and dull."},{"Title":"Small Caucasian Woman: Stories","review":"I scoffed at the title when I first saw it, but when my friend lent it to me, I couldn't separate myself from it.

The horror of world war one led the British to build a strategic air force as a means of avoiding the sorts of casualties faced in that war. It was hoped that by using air craft Germany could be made to surrender.This book is an examination of the failure of that strategic concept. In the first days of the war the British tried a daylight raid on Bremen naval yards. It was generally thought that bombers could get through in daylight due to their speed and defensive armament. This turned out to be a false assumption and a large number of the British Bombers were shot down. Further raids confirmed the vulnerability of unescorted bombers and from that time on it was decided that British Bombers would fly only at night.For some months bombers flew out at night and tried to bomb various military and industrial targets. The bombing was so inaccurate generally hitting farmland and forests that the Germans were not able to even work out what the intended targets were. The British carried out evaluations and found that only a small percentage of bombs were falling within miles of the targets.As a result a change in strategy was adopted and that was to bomb the German civilian population. The reason for that was that cities by comparison were easy to find and the use of incendiaries could lead to destructive fires which could destroy housing stock.The only problem with the strategy was that it resulted in the deaths mainly of the elderly women and children. The structure of German cities was such that the burning and bombing of cities only had a marginal effect on industrial production. (The situation was different in Japan where industry was dotted throughout cities and the fire bombing led to the collapse of industrial production in that country)The German night fighter effort was reasonably successful against the British Bombers so that the casualty rates of British air crews was very high. The book argues that in general terms the campaign was a poor use of resources and had limited effects until near the end of the war. By late 1944 the German air force was practically destroyed and allied bombers by that time had such a preponderance that they were able to destroy the transport network and to destroy production.The book is well written easy to read and a fascinating look at a topic that has been dominated by myth makers not truth seekers."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"I read this on the advice of a friend after a tour of northern Germany during which I wondered why so many of the beautiful churches had been levelled in WWII.

Written by an Englishman."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"First of all, it is easy to see how this work won the 1980 Somerset Maugham Award for Non-Fiction. I was totally riveted throughout. After reading the book in nearly one sitting, I felt exhausted and numb. The book is an indictment against the entire theory of strategic bombing in WWII and the wholesale slaughter of civilians specifically. While Max Hastings devotes much time to &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris who conducted the night-air campaign without reflection or apologies, his sharpest barbs are for those politicians (Churchill included) and senior military planners that made policy. These hid behind an unspoken but widely understood policy that wide-area terror bombing was the only avenue available to Bomber Command for most of the war but refused to discuss the subject honestly in the public arena in the hopes that they could maintain some sense of moral superiority over their enemy. Hastings also correlates Bomber Command's policy and operations with that of the USAAF, who he writes also hid behind a pretense that collateral casualties were a regrettable but unavoidable tragedy of war. Of course the hypocrisy of this position was laid bare following the continued slaughter of unprotected German cities in 1945 long after everyone knew that the bombing would make no difference to the outcome or even pace of the war, it became bombing just for bombing's sake, or in the case of Dresden, showing the Soviets what Anglo-American air power could do; slaughtering refugees fleeing from the advancing Soviet horde. In fact, the Associated Press reported in February 1945 that the Allied Air Chiefs had embarked on a terror campaign against the German civilian population, but Hastings points out that this news scoop was 3 years late (it had of course been policy soon after the British realized they could not hit specific targets at night). The most mind numbing account is late in the book in which Hastings describes in detail the bombing of Darmstadt. The Allied armies were within 100 miles of Darmstadt and the civilians were under the mistaken impression that they would be spared. In September 1944 Bomber Command made Darmstadt its next target for destruction. As Hastings makes the point, the horror is not that the attack was particularly special or difficult, it was the routine of it all that made it so terrible. The entire process reminds me of the banal evil more often associated with the murder of the Jews; being led into the concentration camps were &quot;the system&quot; would process and prepare them for organized and efficient death. Such was the case of German cities by late 1944. The Luftwaffe had nearly run out of aviation fuel and could only put up a meaningful defense on occasion. The Anglo-American armies had overrun the Luftwaffe's radar belts, so even when fuel was available, the Luftwaffe night-fighters could receive no warnings or directions. The &quot;system&quot; identified a German city for destruction, the bombers went up, everyone did their job and went home. Numbers were difficult to come by, but perhaps 10,000 died in that raid. 1 out of every 5 was a child under 16. 1.81 women for every man (at this stage of the war most men away from the war fronts were elderly). The casualties inflicted upon the citizens of Darmstadt were less than that of many larger German cities, but demonstrates that no German city regardless of size or importance was immune to terror bombing. In fact, Hastings describes how several German cities were identified for destruction not because they contributed to the German war effort, but because they could be easily destroyed, as in the case of medieval cities with a preponderance of wooden housing. Hastings describes the eventual unspoken shame that the wholesale slaughter of the German civilian population left in the minds of the British royalty and government. After the war, Churchill tried his best to distance himself from it and declined to secure a peerage for &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris (a reward given to many with lesser responsibilities). The Bomber Command aircrew were not awarded a Campaign Medal, though the Luftwaffe night-fighters and flak crews inflicted between 72,000-73,000 casualties on British Bomber Command alone. &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris himself emigrated with his family to South Africa soon after the war, shunned by those that used him to conduct their own policies. Hastings makes clear that nobody wanted to take credit for the terror bombing policies of Bomber Command after the smoke of WWII cleared. Hastings does not fault the young aircrew themselves and has nothing but admiration for them. Even so, during his research for the book, he interviews a surviving pilot who became a teacher after the war. The former Bomber Command pilot asks Hastings if others he interviewed complained of nightmares. Perhaps something for the young to think about the next time their government orders then to bomb civilians. Does a state of war really justify the killing of defenseless civilians? Does it really matter that the other side did it first (though in fact many give credit to Churchill for having a German city bombed first in the hopes of redirecting Luftwaffe focus from the RAF airfields to British cities, giving the RAF a new lease on life at the height of the Battle of Britain. This strategy proved successful). Regardless who bombed who first, can killing nearly a million German (and thousands of French) civilians be morally justified? There seems no doubt that the western Allies gave up much of the moral superiority they seem so fond of taking for granted. The biggest irony of all is a point Hastings makes again and again, would not the war have been conducted more efficiently had the resources lavishly spent on Bomber Command been used to assist the British armies and Royal Navy instead? The morale of the German civilian population and their industrial production levels never faltered throughout the day (USAAF) and night (Bomber Command) bombings, only when the German war machine ran out of manpower and fuel did Hitler's armies finally fall back and eventually become overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. It seems quite probable that the horrors unleashed on the civilian populations did little to actually win the war."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"This is an excellent book that objectively traces the history and rationale for the area Bombing campaign against Germany that would lead to the deaths of 52000 aircrew and more than half a million civilians.The book also relates the revulsion and guilt felt by many aircrew when confronted, after the war, with the results of their bombing missions.Ironically these same aircrew still idolise their Operational commander - Bomber Harris, who never set foot on an operational squadron during the War.Arguments are also related about the disagreements that Bomber Harris had with his American colleagues who wanted the Area Bombing campaign transferred to destroying synthetic oil plants and ball bearing factories. Harris wanted to continue bombing cities even when there was not much left to bomb.When first published this book was severely criticised in England, for daring to suggest that the effort put into Area Bombing could have been better spent elswhere.This is a thoroughly readable and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"Bomber Command is a masterpiece, an in depth study of strategic bombing in WWII by the RAF.

The growth in planes, both in number and capability - from the single engined Battle to the unused Avro Lincoln, the change in method to (or rather, the default acceptance of) \\"area bombing\\", the creation of the pathfinder force, the technical advances...it is all here.Some raids are discussed in detail - notably, not the Dambusters raid - and the loss of life, the flak, the nightfighters, the sheer terror of being in the air over Germany, and in some cases being on the ground being bombed are all set out. Planes, crews, the role of 'Bomber\\" Harris - all you could want is here. But where this book comes into its own is by asking the question whether it was all worth it, and giving each reader the tools to make his or her own evaluation.The economics is covered off, as is the military impact of bombing on Germany. It is incredible in one sense to read how much slack there was in the German ecomony until the last days of the war: the sacrifices that Britain made in 1940 (such as killing zoo animals) were never made in Germany until the bitter end, if at all. German women were meant to remain in the kitchen, not building planes in factories, unlike in Britain, the US, and course Russia.In asking how effective was the bombing campaign, the question is only worth asking to the extent alternative uses of the capital can be identified. Hastings does this - although he could perhaps go into more detail - but the clear example given is that by devoting the resources it did the production of heavy four-engine bombers, Britain had to resort to buying most of its tanks and all of its transport aircraft from the US.Ultimately, Hastings conclusion is that air power alone could not win WWII, without air supremacy, which was achieved in part by the day bombing of the USAAF (with and without escorting Mustangs) and the boots on the ground in Western Europe. This is hard to disagree with.The morality and effectiveness of air power in WWII is something everyone must make their own decision of, with the benefits of hindsight. What this book does is enable that decision to be informed. It's a must read if you want to learn more about WWII."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"Max Hastings' Bomber Command, written in 1979, is one of the best books available on the RAF strategic bombing campaign in the Second World War. Hastings is easily one of the best British military historians alive because unlike others, he does not shrink from controversy, insightful judgments or hard numbers. Much of this story revolves around the decisions of Bomber Command's commander in 1942-45, Air Marshall Arthur Harris, who has been a lightning rod for controversy. The author avoids some of the earlier hagiography about Harris and paints him in a convincing and human light, although this interpretation was deemed harsh by many RAF veterans when this book appeared. Like most of Hastings' books, Bomber Command is not a blow-by-blow chronological narrative of every action conducted by its protagonist, but rather, an effort to get to the crux about what Bomber Command did or did not accomplish. The author focuses on five RAF squadrons (No. 82, 10, 50, 76, 97) in particular phases of the air war and uses them to depict changes in tactics as well as variances in style at lower echelon levels. Taken together, Hastings depicts both a top-down methodology (Harris and his staff, plus Churchill's strategic directives) and a tactical perspective on how these policies were implemented at the squadron level. There are some topics that are slighted here and it would be difficult to provide a comprehensive survey in just 526 pages, but Bomber Command packs a great deal of facts and analysis into the available space. Overall, this book is one of Max Hastings' best.The author begins by outlining developments within the RAF during the Interwar period and the influence of its first commander, Hugh Trenchard, in building up a faith in bombers and night operations. British politicians also bought into the idea that bombers could be a cheap and useful deterrent. However, the author notes that the RAF failed to develop night navigation aids and spent one-fifth of its budget on buildings. RAF leaders made dangerous assumptions that fighters could not stop bombers and that their navigators could easily find targets at night. When war came, these assumptions quickly proved false. The early chapters cover the feeble bombing efforts of 1939-41, which usually failed to find their targets. The author depicts senior RAF leaders as relatively unconcerned with losses or improving the tactics or equipment employed, which somehow seems to blend with senior British leader military thinking at the onset of trench warfare in 1914-15. British aircrew on the early missions are depicted as the standard public school types, with a \`this is damn good fun' attitude, until they start dying rapidly and are replaced with a more stoic and fatalistic bunch in 1942-44. As the author notes, Bomber Command suffered casualties akin to Germany's U-Boat crews and the chances of survival until mid-1944 were poor.The author discusses why Churchill backed the strategic bomber offensive at some length, but he regards the most important reason as his desire to be viewed by the Russians as contributing to the defeat of Germany. Privately, Churchill doubted that Bomber Command could defeat Germany single-handedly as the airmen claimed, but he gave them their head. Yet by late 1941, Churchill and the RAF were finally waking up to how poorly the bomber offensive was going and opted for area bombing as the only feasible alternative. The great technical developments of 1942-44 that gradually improved British bomber accuracy are discussed, although not in great detail. The author also provides a chapter on the German side of the campaign, discussing the increasing lethality of their defenses and ability to respond to bombed cities. It is interesting to read how some British squadrons tried to introduce novel tactics such as low-level flying and defensive maneuvers which succeeded in reducing casualties, but were then ordered to stop this by obnoxious \`brass hats.'The final chapters discuss the last year of the war, with Bomber Command finally possessing the numbers and the equipment to operate effectively at night. However, the author notes that the main successes of Allied airpower - a rare admission by a British historian - were due to the American introduction of the P-51 Mustang fighter which shot the Luftwaffe out of the sky and American raids which crippled the German synthetic oil industry. The Allied liberation of France also greatly simplified Bomber Command operations in the last year. On the grand questions about the cost and contributions of British strategic bombing, the author notes that Britain devoted up to one-third of its industrial resources toward creating a strategic bomber force, which failed to deliver a knock-out blow. Yet the diversion of so much effort toward Bomber Command starved other British commands of resources (e.g. Mideast and Far East) and made Britain dependent upon the USA for key weapons such as tanks and landing craft. The author also notes that Bomber Command suffered horrendous losses, on the order of 70,000 dead, without breaking either German morale or industrial output. This book is a tough one for British audiences to swallow because it essentially suggests that much of the British war effort was wasted on a futile effort and hence, many of the losses were in vain. The author ultimately traces the fault to pig-headed airmen such as Harris, who wanted to prove the efficacy of an independent air force and refused to admit any error or miscalculation. Bomber Command has important lessons about how service politics can influence strategic decisions and how individual military leaders can warp national objectives for their own ends. The book concludes with a number of very useful appendices."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"Although this book is 31 years old the information is as valid today as it was then. It exposes many of the myths surrounding the British efforts in World War Two. Should be of interest to those who wish to learn the unvarnished truths about this war."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"This book is a very good read. For it gives very detailed accounts of how the bombing offensive by the RAF was created. It also exonerates Harris from the blame he and his \\"old lags\\" were shouldered with during and after the war. The bravery of bomber command crews in the RAF, from all nations, is brilliantly shown amongst these pages. Even though the stupidity of the politicians of the day, and some of those from the RAF's command structure is high lighted as being narrow minded and short sighted in their belief and understanding. As the stupidity of those mentioned within this book was paid for with the lives of the Bomber Command crews who were simply following the directives that were passed down by the back stabbing government of that time. These pages are filled with pride and bravery. Those who deserted what Bomber Command crews did, and told to do, from the first day of the war to the last day...... SHOULD HANG THEIR HEADS IN SHAME. Read this book folks and make your own judgemnet. Whereas Max Hastings has at least done those brave men of Bomber Command, those who never made it back and those who survived with deep hearts, some justice at least by exposing the TRUE version of what happened."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"Great book.

If I can read a book and emerge at my destination oblivious to the trip then the book was good.Written like a dull government memo, this book faithfully documents detail at the expense of writing style. The reader learns that many RAF bombing missions were spontaneous and that the paper trail for many RAF air strikes is sparse (Dresden in particular.)Opposition to area bombing in England was slight with only token objections coming from the House of Lords, the Church of England, and the Royal Navy. George Orwell's early wartime essays echo the point raised in this book that about eighty percent of the English population supported the urban area bombing of Germany.We are given a brief overview of the technology available to Bomber Command during the war with a discussion of OBOE and ground sight radar. The systematic nature of the bombing itself is not ignored with references made to the bomb mix used to optimally burn cities and create firestorms. My house was ignited by one of the small thermite sticks the English used to burn roof tops. The high school teacher who owned the house was quick enough to run to the attic in time to extinguish the flames. Missions were successful if less than five percent of the bombers crashed...losses could be recouped. This book abounds with detail.The history of the allied air offensive would not be complete without mentioning the fact that small Nazi air strikes- the Baedeker raids against England- continued well into the war. The Nazi V2 rocket attacks against England continued until March 1945 with one of the last rockets hitting a London WOOLWORTH store during a crowded Saturday morning sale killing one hundred and fifty shoppers. Moral opprobrium is not appropriate when discussing the sad history of civilian bombing during World War Two.The Germans could condemn Hitler for starting the war and not developing heavy bombers like the English, yet the outcome of the war would have probably been the same but with heavy English civilian fatalities. The actual strategic value of area bombing is in doubt as this book documents. German cities had strictly zoned industrial zones \\"industriegiebet\\" which they still have which night bombing largely missed.My daily commute ends in Hanau...briefly mentioned in the book- destroyed by Lancaster and Wellington bombers in March 1945...5000 civilians perished, mostly aged and children."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"In this era of political correctness and \\"sensitivity,\\" it may strike many as repulsive that hundreds of thousands of German civilians were the target of tons of bombs night after night from British aircraft. But the reality is that the campaign was intended to terrorize the German populaion into demanding that their leadership end the barbarous war they started. Ultimately, as Hastings notes, there was no such thing as an innocent German civilian. Each in their own way contributed or supported the slaughter and enslavement of millions by German soldiers and bureaucrats.Hasting's contribution is to strip the British effort down to its barest essentials: its beginnings as the only effort the otherwise defeated and defenseless British could muster to the excesses of the bombing in the last few months of the war when almost everythng that could be destroyed had been destroyed.Hasting has a wonderful approach, weaving general history into individual stories of the bombers, the planners, the civilians and soldiers.For everyone with an interest in accurate history, \\"Bomber Command\\" is essential reading.Jerry"},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"This is unquestionably the best general history in English.

Innocents on both sides were slaughtered."},{"Title":"Bomber Command","review":"Bomber Command is a great book if you want to know about how bad war can be, and should be read by anyone that thinks there is some glory in war. However, the conclusion drawn by Jerry Saperstein, \\"as Hastings notes, there was no such thing as an innocent German civilian\\" is not supported by the text, and is full of hate, and is obnoxious. The statement apparently relates to the rationalization of \\"strategic\\" bombing that England the USA chose as being less expensive in US/UK lives, even if more expensive in civilian lives. In fact, at the start of WWII, bombers only got 10% of all loads withing fifty miles of the target, so setting cities on fire and then bombing them made targets that the bombers could find. The rational was that people who live in cities go to work in factories that either produce weapons or produce food, or electricity; something that supports the war effort. If this means that every German was guilty of war crimes, consider these two parallels: (1) Recently Hizboallah was accused by Amnesty International of war crime for firing rockets and aiming some of them cities (Hizbollah did kill more Israeli soldiers than civilians, so they were MUCH better than the British and US in WWII), (2) in August and September (2006) Israeli troops killed 37 children under 18 in Palestinian territory (Gaza, mostly), supported my weapons made in the USA, and by a huge amount of foreign aid from the USA. If Saperstein is correct, every Israeli, every Jew, and every American is guilty of killing each of those children (one was a young boy, killed while playing his own yard. The killing was followed by a call to his parents from Israel telling them to get out of their home). If we are all guilty of shooting children, I want out. Had any number like that of Israeli children been killed, certainly Mr. Saperstein would have found all Palestinians guilty, and it would justify taking more land from them. The facts are, you are responsible only for those things that you can change, millions of Jews/Israelis want Israel to implement UN Security Council Resolution 242, and every German knew that those who stood up the Hitler were soon killed. \\"Bomber Command\\" shows, as the war in Iraq has, that a few politicians can make huge decisions without the public even being told the facts, but the public will pay the price, even when they have no control over the actions. Guilt is not something that one person (even a writer) determines, and we have rightly condemned the German army for collective punishment for shooting civilians when they could not find partisans, a lesson we all need to appreciate.Bomber Command is a great read, full of facts that will amaze you by their brutality, but any theory of common guilt was a rationalization to support collective punishment, just as Israel has recently done to Lebanon. Just as the bombing did not work in Lebanon, it did not work in Germany. Destroying people's homes does not make them stop supporting war, it leaves them with no alternative but fighting. If you are a war buff, or just want to know why Churchill put off invading Europe for so long, this is a must buy."},{"Title":"Energy and Conflict","review":"With this book i needed to read it for my junior year english project!

Although it has been 25 years since L & J's Metaphors We Live By was published, the amount of research on metaphor in other languages - especially non-Indo-European ones, has been quite small. It is refreshing, then, to see that K&ouml;vecses has taken a serious stab at dealing with the issues arising from some of the more important cross-cultural research done so far on emotion metaphor.So, why would a cognitive linguist be interested in emotions? K. attempts an explanation in the preface. Here K. takes issue with the views of neurobiologist Joseph LeDoux. LeDoux sees \\"conscious feelings\\" as being of secondary importance. Understandably perhaps, emotions for a neurobiologist are primarily about brain states and bodily responses. K., however, feels that the secondary role given to conscious feelings by LeDoux stems from his use of an \\"unsatisfactory kind of linguistics\\" that sees words as refering literally to preexisting emotional states. One of K.'s main goals is to show how Cognitive Linguistics can give a deeper insight into the relationship between emotion and emotion language. A CL approach, in emphasizing the figurative side of human language, reveals how language is used to define and, at times, create emotional experience.In this book, K. focusses on three main questions:1. How do we talk about emotions in English and other languages?2. What folk theories underly these ways of talking?3. What is the relationship between folk and scientific theories?Ch. 1 examines the role of figurative language in the conceptualization of emotion. K. asks \\"Do metaphors simply reflect a preexisting, literal reality, or do they actually create or constitute our emotional reality?\\" Why \\"boiling with anger\\", \\"be madly in love\\" etc? What exactly are \\"emotions\\"?Ch. 2 summarizes the research (much of it is his own) on English emotion concepts and identifies a limited number of source domains. Ch. 3 is concerned with whether or not these metaphorical source domains are unique to the emotions.Ch. 4 looks at the Event Structure of emotions - STATES ARE LOCATIONS, CHANGES ARE MOVEMENTS etc., while Ch. 5 applies Len Talmy's Force Dynamics to emotion.Ch. 6 contrasts emotions and relationships. The former are conceptualized in terms of a master metaphor EMOTION IS FORCE and the latter are organized around a complex systems metaphor.Ch. 7 deals with the relationship between folk and expert theories of emotion, while Ch. 8 and 9 look at universality and cultural variation. The final chapter attempts to reconcile a CL approach and a Social Constructionist approach to the meaning of emotion.I personally found the last three chapters the most interesting - since, as far as I know, there has been little published in book form on the cultural aspects of metaphor. CL can obviously learn a lot from Anthropology - indeed it has to, if it wants to strengthen its claims about the embodiment of meaning and universals. K. uses examples from Chinese based on Brian King's unpublished doctoral dissertation on Chinese Emotion Concepts (which I found online as a downloadable pdf), Catherine Lutz's published fieldword on Ifaluk and a number of other sources. The cultural dimensions in particular make this book a fascinating one for anybody interested in the issues surrounding the universality and relativity of the human conceptual system."},{"Title":"Metaphor and Emotion: Language, Culture, and Body in Human Feeling (Studies in Emotion and Social Interaction)","review":"Kovecses organizes the current thinking about metaphor and emotion well. -Metaphors that spring from the body being at the core of our emotional thought.

It is an account of six individuals who lived during the MA's; Bodo, a Frankish Peasant; Marco Polo, the famous Venetian merchant; Madame Eglentyne, prioress of Chaucer; an anonymous middle-class Parisian housewife; and two English merchants, one engaged in the wool trade and the other a clothier in Essex. The author has illustrated various aspects of social life of the era by drawing on such sources as account books, diaries, letters, records, and wills. She starts the work with a previously unpublished essay entitled &quot;The Precursors,&quot; which describes the barbarian conquest of Rome. In this, she describes the lives of three men, Ausonius, Sidonius and Fortunatus and uses them to foreshadow the life that would re-emerge in the Middle Ages.She starts by imagining a day in the life of the Peasant Bodo, in the time of Charlemagne. From her study of primarily economic documents from the Middle Ages of this time, she not only extrapolates but truly brings to life Bodo and his wife Ermentrude. From there, she goes on to the better documented life of Marco Polo, and also describes how he served as an inspiration for Columbus. Madam Eglentyne is next. Here, Power humorously details the inner workings of a gossipy nunnery and how Eglentyne would have gone about her life as an aristocratic women of God. She next details the life of a middle class Parisian housewife by studying the contents of the Menagier's Wife and validating many of it's points by citing other documents. She concludes by detailing the lives of the two Thomases; Betson and Paycocke of Coggeshall. Both are merchants and provide a chance for Power to really show off her grasp of medieval economics as well as an ability to compile disparate correspondences into a story of a life. This is a rare scholarly work that truly entertains while being read.

I particularly enjoyed the section on Bodo and Ermentrude, peasants on an estate owned by a French monastery; and the section on The Householder of Paris. Instead of showing peasant life as merely nasty, brutish, and short, the author gives 3 dimensions to Bodo as he works for himself and the monks, how he and his wife spend their respective days (note: Ermentrude did NOT merely stay home and \\"raise the children\\"), their enjoyment of festivals and fairs, their relationships with other peasants and landlords, etc. The author's summary of the Householder of Paris' treatise on marriage to his young wife was concise and entertaining.

Unfortunately, this book fails miserably in its execution.I read the first chapter, the one on Bodo. It was OK, so I thought the book had potential. The next person was Marco Polo. After pages and pages in English, and also in Latin and French too (which I do not know), describing places, people, rulers, dates, trade-routes, and exotic merchandise connected with Venice (and still no mention of Marco Polo), it became difficult to decipher what she was saying since it was all so unfamiliar to me.The author's narrative is difficult to follow, unless you are an academic scholar already well versed in the historical and literary events, people, and places she refers to in her work. The positive reviewers are most likely more learned and read than I, and could therefore follow the storyline and enjoy the book. However, for me, it became a chore to plow through the seemingly endless and unfamiliar references that form the basis of this book. I had to skip all the Latin and French parts, which are not translated into English. In the end, I gave up.

The Middle Ages have always fascinated me, and I would recommend this little book highly to anyone who wants an introduction to that time period, without having to worry about Kings and Queens and dates of battles. While those are important--of course--the author emphasizes the lives of several people at different time periods during the Medieval era.Thinking of how long the Medieval era lasted, depending on what source is followed, it could be from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance...this was not a static time period. Just like our own era there was constant change and a steady growth in science, and in rediscovering what had been lost during the worst of the \\"Dark Ages\\". This book, while short, gives the feel of the movement, the forward progression that was occuring during this era.Her chapter on Marco Polo is one of the most interesting ones; it is not quite in keeping with all the others, in that he is someone famous then and now, and his discoveries changed beliefs in his own time and after. She ends that chapter with a little known sailor, Christopher Columbus, referring to Marco Polo's books and maps while planning his voyage to India...Otherwise the majority of the five individuals profiled are average people of their time. Certainly the author could have chosen any differnt five to make similar points, but overall the book gives a good look at that era and whets the appetite for more."},{"Title":"Medieval people,","review":"I very much enjoyed this book on my MP3, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not (as I am) fluent in the subtleties of the mores, language and customs of Medieval times, as well as Latin and French.Eileen Power (the author) frequently uses terms with which the modern reader will not be familiar without explanation. For example, she speaks at length about the cloth industry, and repeatedly mentions fullers and fulling without once explaining the duties of the fuller. Wikipedia defines fulling as a step in woolen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth (particularly wool) to eliminate oils, dirt, and other impurities, and making it thicker. Few modern readers would know (without continually resorting to another reference) many of the terms frequently used which are important for following the stories told in this book. The rare definitions she does provide tend to be for terms which are not essential to the stories and are notable by their very rarity.Long sections of the book are written in Latin french (I have no idea if it is modern or Medieval french) with no translation. As someone who knows little to no french or Latin, this was quite frustrating. An occasional french phrase might be puzzled out in a similar book, but entire pages are not within the grasp of the average reader, even the average well educated (American) reader.The author dropped names from literature with which she expected the reader to be immediately familiar. She expected an immediate familiarity with each of the characters from Chaucer, and their habits and stories, as well as other literary and historical figures. I can not quote other examples as I have to admit to not being familiar enough with some of them to have remembered them, and as I tend to listen to my MP3 while driving I could not take notes for later reference.A note specific to the audio listener - the reader had one of the best voices. It was smooth and melodic, an absolute joy to the ear!Although I enjoyed this book quite a bit, I could not help but wish the author had written it for the common man, not to impress her fellow scholars. One would expect her editor to see this problem and tell her to define her terms, and to translate the foreign passages.

Residents of Venice worked in trading and shipping with Asian goods. Marco Polo spent years in China with Kubla Khan. People were well connected to the church and many lived as priests and nuns. They were all called to their vocation and the rules were so strict that many lived to defy them. The lives of husbands and wives were not usually love matches but arranged and the power of the woman was much less of a man's.

Most books do not adjust for that, and simply translate the Italian recipe, or, even worse, they Americanize it (use of vegetable shortening, or cream cheese instead of ricotta, and other horrors).

Nowhere else have I found such an array of Italian desserts presented with such simplicity. This book is a &quot;must have&quot; for any cook who would like to create an authentic cannoli or discover an array of Italian desserts. The methods presented are straight-forward and presented with a simplicity typical of Malgieri.Italian desserts are both delicious and artistic. This great contribution would have been even more significant were it better illustrated.

I am basing my evaluation of this cookbook on one recipe alone, the outrageously good crustless Sicilian Ricotta Cheesecake on pages 220-221. You can stir up this light concoction in minutes. You don't need to beat this one, unlike American cheesecakes. It is the easiest cheesecake I've ever made and qualifies for the &quot;quick and easy&quot; category of cooking. The cake is light and airy, almost like a souffle, and probably has fewer calories than the usual ones heavy laden with cream cheese. Your guests can eat this delicious cheesecake without guilt.There are literally dozens of dessert recipes here in chapters on yeast-risen pastries, fried pastries, puff pastry, cream puff pastry, plain cakes, cakes with fruit, layer cakes, biscotti, ices and frozen desserts, etc.I have tried many of Mr. Malgieri's dessert recipes from his other cookbooks and have never found one that didn't work.

This is an important book for historians of the period as well as an important piece of writing for those who love the fiction and ideas of Orwell as one can easily see their development through his experiences in Spain. The sections on the fighting in Barcelona between the Anarchists and the Communists (instead of against their true enemy, the Fascicts) as well as the subsequent suppression of the POUM are among the most riveting. He is always clear about his personal biases and he is not writing as an historian but as an observer who has been betrayed yet is still hopeful.

This is a great one to include."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I recently assisted this to my high school history class during our unit on the Spanish Civil War. It provided a wonderful avenue for discussion as a book club in class. My students read it over a 3 week period and found it very accessible and informative. Orwell does a wonderful job of explaining his first hand account of the war as well as providing a historical perspective of secondary event, such as the political situation and international intervention that he was not aware of at the time. Overall it helped to make the Spanish Civil War meaningful and engaging to the majority of my students and helped to clarify and illuminate many of the key standards that I was hoping to address."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Orwell's experience of two simultaneous wars is chronicled in the pages of this book: one by the forces of the Left against the attempt (ultimately successful) of General Francisco Franco to take over the government during the Spanish Civil War, and the other within the Left itself as, by Orwell's account, the Communists attempted in 1937 to seize both the military and the propaganda advantage. The book contains Orwell's usual fine writing and dry wit, as well as his political conviction in support of workers. Beyond the politics, however, much of the appeal of the book lies in its description of Orwell's nearly four months at the Aragon front--a short time, to be sure, but one suspects that any time spent at a battle front is long enough to allow authoritative retelling beyond the ability of the non-combatant to imagine. (And in this regard, it was a good decision to move the two Appendices to the end of the book, rather than to leave them in their original location, as their detailed discussion of the political infighting would only have disrupted the narrative.)For the short time Orwell was at the front, the enemy was really boredom, vermin, and cold. The Fascists were hardly a factor, though on the rare occasions when he was in a firefight the danger was real enough. And his time at the front was long enough, and the danger real enough, for Orwell to get shot through the throat in May 1937, leading to one of several moments of understated humor in the book. He writes that during treatment and recovery, \\"no one I met . . . failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives is the luckiest creature alive. I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.\\" What Orwell is most impressed with is the vision of equality held by--and for a time, in the militias, realized by--the Spanish fighters of the Left with whom he served. And despite the degradation in the war itself and a degree of personal disillusionment, Orwell never ceases to be impressed by the character of Spaniards, even when he sometimes throws up his arms in despair at Spain itself. When a train he was on after being wounded was rerouted from Barcelona (where Orwell's wife was, to whom he had sent a wire informing her that he was on his way) to Tarragona with no notice, Orwell writes: \\"I suppose the engine-driver had changes his mind. \`Just like Spain!' I thought. But it was very Spanish, too, that they agreed to hold up the train while I sent another wire, and more Spanish still that the wire never got there.\\" He writes elsewhere of the \\"flashes of magnanimity that you get from Spaniards in the worst of circumstances. I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few bad memories of Spaniards.\\"Orwell went to Spain to fight Fascism, but he became dismayed by the infighting among the various anti-Fascist forces. Despite their ostensible unity against the Fascists, Spain's Communists, Anarchists, and various anti-Soviet Marxists (the group Orwell joined, though as much by circumstance as by conscious choice) were not able to forge a lasting unified front. The infighting, particularly in Barcelona, and the suppression of the group to which Orwell had become attached, meant that he had to leave or face likely arrest. He reserves some of his most severe criticism not for any of the various groups in Spain, but for journalists and politicians of other countries (notably his own) who, out of fear of a truly revolutionary workers' uprising, threw the weight of their opinions and their propaganda behind the Communists, in the process overlooking the real complexity of the situation and painting at least some other members of the Left as a pro-Fascist fifth column. Orwell disputes this claim, based on his own experience and his conversations with other eyewitnesses. Whatever the truth of the various claims about who was supporting whom, however, the larger truth seems to be a reaffirmation of the adage that truth is the first casualty in war. While Orwell's account of his time in Spain leaves the reader with a very readable account of the experiences of an expatriate idealistically fighting against tyranny, his analysis of the politics of the situation leaves us with a lesson that is as true today as it was 75 years ago. \\"The only hope is to keep political controversy on a plane where exhaustive discussion is possible.\\""},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Although Orwell's first-hand account of his experience in the leftist militia during the first year of the Spanish Civil War takes place 75 years ago, well before many of us were born, his account has direct application to our world today, and even here in the United States of America. This book is not just an account of the facts that happened in 1936-1937, it is an account of very real and very painful and deadly political mistrust, even in people that are supposedly one's allies. It is about the enormous difference between truth and the intentional and malicious propaganda that people, organizations and the media create to tell \\"their\\" story (instead of the truth). It is about how people choose to disrespect each other and treat each other worse than a vicious animal, not because of what one did to potentially merit such treatment but because of who they are and what group they belong to.And it is also a story of how Orwell dealt with such a disillusionment. Lionel Trilling states in the introduction, \\"He told the truth and he told it in an exemplary way, quietly, simply, with due warning to the reader that it was only one man's truth. He used no political jargon and he made no recriminations.\\" He had plenty of reasons to be hateful and bitter and to reflect that in his writing, but he chose not to. That is what makes this book so unique and especially today. We live in a world where we are overloaded with data and information. Watching and listening to all of the advertisements of both candidates for President that have been bombarding the airwaves, especially in \\"swing\\" states like Virginia shows me how unique Orwell was in his writing. Our world is full of political jargon and recriminations. The truth? Often hidden. Often intentionally. Quite the opposite of Orwell's approach.The horrors and atrocities that happened in that Civil War are happening today in the world. Look at Syria, for example. Situations like those described in his book and like are happening elsewhere in the world often start with the loss of civil liberties. Some say that we are starting to see some of our civil liberties be eroded in this country. Read this book and see what happens when those civil liberties are attacked or taken. It's not just the fighting and shooting at each other. It is how we start to treat each other. See it in this book and think about today. And then think about how we would act in such situations. Would we act and move forward objectively without hatred and without recriminations as Orwell did? The fact that the book can lead you to think about questions like that is what makes Orwell's writing unique and very timely, even in 2012."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Orwell is unquestionably one of the most plain-spoken and honest-minded writers it has been my pleasure to encounter. Here he takes us behind the lines in a battle for the hearts and minds and bodies of Spain. We see not only what the man on the front suffers, but how political jockeying resulted in the deaths of good people, and needless suffering.I value this book not just for what it reveals about Spanish culture, about pre-WWII European politics, about the nature of the communist party elite vs. that of its members, but really, for how it reveals what it was like to be a human caught up in a massive grist mill."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"If a person went with Middle school or High School as their only door, and basis of understanding, into the amazing works of George Orwell they might wrongly believe that he only wrote two books. \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". Those are certainly the titles that get brought up most (and rightfully so because they're works of absolute genius). However, with such a limited perspective of all things Orwellian amazing works like Homage to Catalonia would unfortunately fall through the cracks.Homage to Catalonia is a first hand account of George Orwell fighting/volunteering in a Spanish militia group called the POUM, or 29th, an anti-Stalinist communist fighting force, during The Spanish Civil War. It is a beautifully written account of his personal experiences and impressions he had of both the war and his role in it. It also sheds light and context into an unfortunately (these days) obscure historical period. No doubt it's somewhat obscure to most Americans and Europeans because it was eclipsed a few years later by World War 2. I would think most Americans unless they've read some Hemingway or watched \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" would be completely unaware that Spain ever even had a Civil War recently let alone that it occurred during the time of FDR's Administration. So close historically that it's possible there might even be people alive today that experienced it. However, this is unlikely because it's 2012 and if they were alive today they'd certainly be really old now. However, I digress.\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a wonderful read and well worth the time needed to get from cover to cover. If you're interested in a work that doesn't over-glorify war or go the other route and go wild condemning it. This is your book. It is a good read that sheds light on a part of Spanish history that should never be forgotten (or perhaps worse, contoured through revisionism to be whatever some political hack wants it to be and wants it to mean). My advice is to read \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" if you want a very good read and a good history lesson to go along with it."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"find this book very realistic account of what life was really like during trench warfare in the spanish civil war and how silly war could really be, young men and sometimes more like children sent to war without having a clue of why or what they were fighting for."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This autobiographical tome brings you into the chaos of the anti fascists opposition.

Orwell, who was a reporter who decided to fight in Spain alongside the anarchists and socialists and communists, gives a realistic, unbiased account of the spanish civil war. Not only does he provide the reader with knowledge about how the war was fought, but he describes the anarchist held region of catalonia, where, in my opinion, true socialism was achieved. This book is often referred to by socialists and anarchists for its vivid desrciption of socialism in action. I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I wouldn't call it definitive, but Homage to Catalonia is a very engaging account of the Spanish Civil War. Orwell wanted an infantry man's experience, drawn to the first person accounts of WWI by such authors as Remarque. As a result, Orwell gives the reader an intimate view of the action, or rather inaction of the front line. More compelling is his description of the street fighting which broke out in Barcelona, and the split that developed in the Socialist government, making it vulnerable to attack.Orwell castigated Britain and France for not coming to the aid of the Socialist government, allowing Franco to gain the upper hand as the result of aid from Germany and Italy. Orwell also underwent a catharsis in this book, losing his respect for the Communists, as a result of Stalin's notorious policies. In the end, Orwell seemed angry at pretty much everyone for allowing Spain to fall into Fascist hands.He maintained his respect for the anarchists, particularly the ex-pats who fought for the anarchists in the civil war. But, Orwell seemed to realize it was a losing battle. The anarchists were torn among themselves as they struggled for the heart and soul of the Spanish people. Orwell never got to Madrid, unlike Borkenau and Hemingway, so his account is limited to the fighting which occurred in Catalonia."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I was surprised when I heard about this title and couldn't find it at any of my bookstores..I didn't find it until I went to Blackwell's( Book heaven) in Oxford on a trip. Orwell is one of the great writers and &quot;Homage To Catatonia&quot; needs to get more attention.The book shows Orwell gong to Spain as a journalist but than being drawn into the Republican fight against the fascists and joins the republican side. At the time the warfare is light and Orwell almost describes fighting as a joke but as time goes on the war goes to the streets and a regime of terror is released.I won't go in big detail but the main reason this book should be read is to show the not so glorious side of the republicans( the anarchists and communists often fighted on their own side) and the faults that led to Franco's winning. Last of all for Orwell's writing and to see where he got his ideas which would lead him to his later masterpieces. I will conclude this review by repeating what Timothy Garton Ash said &quot;Anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century will still have to read Orwell&quot;"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"After reading several of Orwells other books, I had come to expect a certain degree of sarcasm in his works. Homage to Catolonia does not disappoint. Orwell succeeds in giving us a brief histroy of the Spanish Civil War. He also makes it readable.In Homage, Orwell explains to us how life was like serving for the anti Franco forces in Spain. He also tells us the motivations and the reasons for the fighting. It's important to note how his skills as a journalist aide us in learning about the history of the War.Overall, HtC will please many because of its satirical view of the War and its historical significance."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell went to Barcelona in 1936 as a journalist to cover the Civil War; instead, the idea of making a stand against fascism caught him up and so he enlisted in the militia. For the next year, he served two tours at the front and witnessed the street fighting amongst the Government forces in Barcelona. Then, facing jail because the militia he joined was outlawed by the ascendant Stalinists for failing to adhere to the party line, he escaped into France and finally home to England, all while still suffering from the throat wound that had knocked him out of the fighting. 'Homage to Catalonia' is the result of his observations, written after his participation, but before the war's conclusion, when Franco's defeat still seemed possible.Much of the book describes his time spent on the front lines, along with another portion that untangles - or attempts to - the various goals of the forces fighting for the Spanish Government. Aside from these comments, though, there is another, partially voiced complaint that must have preoccupied him for years after, as he revisited it in his later works - the use of propaganda in the war. Throughout the second half of the book, it's clear that Orwell was becoming frustrated with the way the world's press had spun events of which he himself had first-hand knowledge, yet it was also evident that, as a weary participant, he felt a bit resigned to it. Still, he couldn't keep the irritation out of his recollections when he discovered that for some of the accounts, not only did the papers warp the truth into its complete opposite, but they also did not attempt to reconcile its fiction with reality. They simply printed what they wanted their worldwide audience to read. Today, I think, we would look at many of the publications Orwell refers to and intuitively understand that they were communist publications, and with the experience of the Cold War behind us, assume that those papers would automatically spin the truth. I doubt Orwell had many illusions about them either, but I do think the effectiveness of these blatant fictions surprised him some. That effectiveness was only possible because of the distances involved and the concerted effort to push a certain storyline, but it made me think of our own media, inescapably subjective regardless of intent. Like Orwell, I too have little doubt that some items are pushed in certain directions - might I also be surprised at how far and how effectively?Orwell came to Spain already opposed to fascism - leftist newsprint in England had convinced him that the conflict was a cut and dried affair of human decency against oppression. My own unexamined opinions about this particular event in history were much the same. Orwell dismantles the idea of the Spanish Civil War as an emblem of the morally pure facing off against evil, and makes it clear that despite whatever idealistic impulses many of the volunteers against Franco may have had, larger forces subverted much of that energy to their own ends. Orwell's account, in conjunction with some other recent readings, forces me to reconsider events I may have looked at as axiomatic blueprints for 'just' causes. The fact that one side was not motiveless does not negate the injustices perpetrated by the other, but it does strip away some of my own illusions (fostered by a popular historical subjectivity). It also serves as a warning to those who, perhaps longing to get behind such a clear-cut moral stand, will allow others to sway them to a course of action that is actually doubtful and unclear.Orwell himself is no objective observer - something he admits several times while urging the reader to understand that his description of events can only be a reflection of the small corner of the conflict that he witnessed. Even so, I believe it is a genuine and earnest account, with only the desire to clarify the situation in relation to his experiences. In that context, 'Homage to Catalonia' is an account of the particulars, rooted in the events it covers. And yet, without browbeating the reader, and almost as an aside, other themes inherent in Orwell's homage seem as germane to my world as it was to his. That a description written seventy-five years ago still carries an edge that fine is just good history to me."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I was surprised when I read this little known Orwell gem to find that it is in many ways superior to 1984 and Animal Farm. For one thing it is an absolutely first rate account of the Spanish Civil War which is a difficult subject to apprehend because of the massive propoganda of the party literature, as Orwell notes in the text. Some may find the more strictly political sections a bit tedious (Orwell actually warns the reader about such segments) to get through, but for those interested in the politics of the revolution they are intelligently expressed and carefully put together. But Homage to Catalonia is such an amazing and complex blend of everything Orwell; it is a deeply human and observant depiction of war and struggle, it is a political document, a scathing assesment of power and manipulation, and a satirical commentary on the follies of war. Why this over-looked classic is not mentioned in the same breath as 1984 and Animal Farm is beyond me."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I was put off Orwell at an early age by reading 1984 and Animal Farm, both of which I found terribly depressing. Thirty years later, I finally got around to reading 'Homage to Catalonia' and I wish I hadn't waited so long because it is absolutely fascinating. Orwell's account of fighting on the front line during the war is really reamrkable. It is astonishing to earn what an absolute shambles the war was, with soldiers armed with hopleessly antiquated weapons. The Republican and Nationalist front lines were so far apart that most of the time they can't even fire at each other, being too far apart to score a hit, so they are reduced to shouting propoganda at each other through megaphones. I had no idea Orwell could be funny, at times reading this book is like reading a scenario for a farcical comedy. You get a good sense of the privations and squalor of life in the front line, also, surprisingly, the cold (it had honestly never occured to me that Spain was ever cold). There is an incredibly vivivd description of how Orwell felt when he got shot in action. Away from the front, Orwell is shocked to discover that the Republicans seem to be more interested in fighting each other than the Nationalists. The Communists begin to act vindictively towards the Trotskyists and members of POUM, the organisation under whose banner Orwell had fought. He describes his horror as he sees men who had given up everything to go and fight for the Republic, treated as criminals by the Republican army. There is a very funny scene where he describes how his hotel room is searched by police looking for evidence of subversive activity. they search the room for about an hour, looking everywhere, but they never touch the bed, because his wife is lying in it, even though,as Orwell reflects, there could be a ton of Trotskyist literature under the pillow, and machine guns under the mattress. Hilarious in parts, heartbreaking in others, this is an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"What a riveting account! Orwell manages the difficult task of successfully combining the details of trench life, the description of the turmoils in Barcelona and a comprehensible analysis of the clash of several left-wing political parties during the Spanish Civil war. He even adds some deliciously humorous remarks! And the whole thing is absolutely entertaining, vivid and interesting.Really, one finishes this book and feels a deep respect for this man. It's discouraging to learn that he and so many others who had fought in the trenches had to flee the country or suffer inprisonment and even death, only due to the deep struggle for power between political forces that belonged to the same side! I was impressed by how Orwell describes the passion and idealism that prevailed during the 1930's, specially compared to the sleepy, double-standard ethics of nowadays.As a Spaniard, I admit not possesing deep knowledge about the Spanish Civil War, other than some family recollections and the usual basics. This book helped me learn about the complexities of the &quot;red&quot; side and about the everyday miseries of war.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is one of the most important books of the 20th Century. Orwell went to Spain as somewhat of a vaguely committed leftist; when he returned, he had truly found not only himself but the course of the remainder of the century. Orwell discovers that things rarely exist in black and white but in a million shades of gray; there rarely is a &quot;good side&quot; in any contest. Tyranny is tyranny whether it wears the swastika or the hammer and sickle. Another aspect of this book, for people who only know Orwell through Animal Farm and 1984, is his bravery. He was right in the thick of everything and lived to write one of the truest, most searing documents of the last 100 years. As a chronicle of war before WWII, I think it ranks with Graves's Goodbye to All That. In both books, the writer plummets to the depths of human experience and fear and surfaces with enlightenment."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Homage to Catalonia is an exceptional and facinating book that tells the story of the Spanish Revolution in the eyes of the great writer George Orwell.

Compare that to Bush, using family connections to ditch his duty.This has always been true. The self-proclaimed superpatriots always hide under the skirts of their mommies, while the steadier men fight to give them that safety.A few years ago, for my own amusement, I excerpted passages from three intellectuals - all left of center - describing their war experiences. One was by Oliver Wendell Holmes describing his wounding at Antietam (\\"in our youths, we were touched by fire\\"); another by Robert Graves (in GOODBYE TO ALL THAT) describing how he was triaged during one of the great battles of WWI as too near death to merit the effort to save him. He was left untreated for 27 hours. His description of a nurse giving him a drink of water is priceless. The last is, of course, Orwell's magnificent HOMAGE TO CATALONIA.

The conditions of our present situation in the world begs for a reading of him. I struggled over which book to pick up, going back and forth between Down and Out, Aspidistra, and Homage, but finally deciding on the latter. I wasn't disappointed. Writing in his always engaging and detailed prose, Orwell takes us on an adventure from the revolutionary fervor of Barcelona to the unexciting Aragon Front and back to a Barcelona that resembles nothing of the earlier revolutionary facade. Along the journey we learn about the horrors of party politics and propaganda through the detailed accounts of the Anarchists, Marxist-Socialists, and the Communists all bidding for power in revolutionary Spain. When the Communists finally obtain control, the Marxist-Socialists (Orwell's militia) are suppressed and forced to hide from the police. We are also taken through the interesting, but not always exciting street fighting that seemed to plague Barcelona at the time. To Orwell, revolutionary Spain was something to be admired. The seemingly classless society, the comradeship, and the fight against Fascism were attractive attributes that Orwell fell in love with. Despite being forced to flee Spain after the suppression, Orwell never lost his love for a country and its people that did so much to show him the decent side of human beings. If you are a fan of Orwell, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Everyone should read this. It's exactly the type of history governments of Western nations don't want their citizens to read. Spain was taken over by a ruthless dictator and the people joined together in a collective society and fought back. However, the governments of all other western nations funded the dictator, Franco, for fear their people would also join together, overthrow their bosses, and live collectively. The USSR chose another route, though, they tried to infiltrate the collective rebels and claim unity with them but only destroyed them from within."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I came late to George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia.This book told me more about the tragedy of the civil war than anything I have read in past years.

Bill Miller"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a candid retelling of the author's months in Barcelona and the Arag&oacute;n front during the political uprisings of 1936-1937. Orwell focuses on intimate details of his life as a member of the POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificaci&oacute;n Marxista) militia -- his decision to join based more on his desire to fight fascism than to further any political cause. This somewhat arbitrary decision would come back to haunt him later. The relatively short chronicle focuses on two things: life in the militia and an attempt to add clarity to some of the misleading propaganda of the time by comparing it to his eye-witness accounts of the turbulence.The military affair was gritty and chaotic, and Orwell repeatedly observes that Spanish inefficiencies in the ability to conduct military campaigns was something of a godsend. Poorly equipped, wallowing in filth and lacking even modest provisions, Orwell's unit forged ahead with its vague orders. He dedicates significant space to his reverance for his unit and comrades and makes a point of it to relate details of combat and life at the front to the character of the Spanish people. He also humbly points to his own misadventures as a soldier which readers will likely interpret as quite courageous and inspiring.The political side of the book reads much like the retelling of life at the front. Orwell doesn't use the homage to make a political point; he is more concerned with comparing what he saw to what was reported, often in great detail, while confessing that it still can't possibly clarify the confusion of the politics of that time and place as much as debunk some of the obviously false accounts of the crisis written from desks far removed from the area. In other words, if you're looking for an op-ed this isn't anything of the sort. It's more a foundation for his later \\"greater\\" works of fiction. One thing is clear, however, and that is that Orwell has contempt for attitudes of authoritarianism and reverance for egalitarianism. He ultimately leaves Spain more out of necessity than desire. Clearly he wished he could have done more to fight off the eventual tide of fascism that eventually prevailed.I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in Orwell's biography or the anarchist uprising in eastern Spain. It's candid and not jaded in the least. And the author is clearly struggling to tell a true story of an experience rather than express an opinion of these incredible events.One curious thing to note about this Indo-European Publishing edition: the book makes a point to credit Alfred Aghajanian as the proofreader, but it is the most poorly proof-read book I've ever read (starting with the first word of the book: \\"CHPATER\\"). Readers will have to struggle through proofreading errors on almost every page and do their own interpretation of this amateurish edition. It might be worth looking to another publishing source for the same story, which is a highly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"As a studious of the XX century world story, I had appreciated a lot this book, as an instrument to deepen and to understand the events during the Spain war in 1936- 1937, when the communists, belonging to the international brigade sent by Stalin and coordinated by Togliatti, exterminated the spanish anarchists."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"1984 and Animal Farm are Orwell's best remembered indictments of Communist tyranny, but this is his best book.

He wrote it in 1938 (I think so; the introduction didn't bother to mention when it was actually written as its author was obviously not a historian), only months after his experience. The reader is put the exciting situation of Europe before World War II. The fact he was writing about contemporary subjects makes it all the more interesting, because he did not have the advantage of knowing what was going to happen next making his opinions of what should be done more valid.I started reading the book thinking it was going to be about Orwell's disillusionment with Stalinist Russia. If he ever did admire the USSR, he does not admit to it. He does however admit to only joining the POUM because that was the first group he found, though I do not believe he would have ever joined what he referred to as a right-wing Socialist group (though he was tempted at one point, as it was the only way to get to Madrid). It is certain he was disillusioned by several other things. The degree to which USSR-backed groups were not revolutionary, but only wished to perpetuate the \\"bourgeoisie democracy\\" I think did surprise them. He thought that this antirevolutionary policy may have been detrimental to anti-Franco cause, because, for example, it meant the Moors of Morocco could not be effectively allied with. This policy was similar to the USSR insisting the Chinese Communists allied with the moderates long after this made sense, though there they had the excuse that unindustrialized China was not ready for a revolution. One thing Orwell was certainly disillusioned about was journalism, due to the coverage of the Spanish Civil War and its disparity with what he was witnessing. On both sides he found simplifications and outright lies.Orwell obviously cannot be fully objective about the topic. However, he is a journalist and does try. Orwell sums up this possibly downfall fairly well in saying \\"... beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.\\" His politics can be described as Marxist. He thought that a revolution was the only way to help the proletariat; it could not happen within the constraints of democracy. Outside of some the political commentary, the book is in fact a primary document and in this respect it is good to read regardless of his subjectivity, as his opinions are valuable in their own right.I traveled to Spain a few years ago and found I agreed with his reflections on Spanish culture. He pointed out from time to time things in \\"typical Spanish fashion.\\" Orwell noted how laid-back the Spanish are, the word incompetent could almost be used. For instance, it was often a hassle to pay the bill at a restaurant. It is like they did not want our money. I had attributed this as a reaction to Fascism, though it apparently predated it. In one of his few optimistic statements, he predicted Fascism would not be as bad as in Italy and Germany because of the inefficiency of the Spanish culture; they would just not be able to pull it off. From the little I know of the following decades, this was more or less bore out.Homage to Catalonia remains an excellent read to anyone interested into this facet of the Spanish Civil War or Stalinist foreign policy in general. It gives a first person account of the soldier's view of the war; I think a fairly average one. Most accounts of war seem to be by people who take down their story because something unique happened to them. Orwell was probably planning to write a book regardless. So Orwell complains much more about boredom then he does carnage, as he was stationed where both he and the Fascists did not have enough firepower to go on the offensive."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"It's a bit embarassing at times to admit to being a fan of Orwell. One fears that upon telling a fellow reader this that they will assume you have read 1984 a dozen times and think Animal Farm is profound. But it's books like Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Down and Out in Paris and London which have made me a huge Orwell fan. Homage to Catalonia is high up on that list also.I did enjoy Orwell's thoughts on the politics of the war. But what stood out most for me was the human account of the fighting. Very few books have had had anecdotes which were so evocative and continue to stand out in my mind months after reading. The buttered toast story was priceless, as was Orwell's account of his unwillingness to shoot a man trying to get his pants on.I'm not sure if anyone would agree, but I find some parallels between Orwell's books and John Steinbeck's: the same deceivingly simplistic style, coupled with incisive comments and a genuine compassion for people.

My review doesnt do the book justice buy it or check it out from the library youll be thankful you did."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"There is Lionel Trilling's introduction written in 1952. Standing alone the introduction is historic and of consequence. It appears in the Beacon Press edition of the work. At any rate, Trilling finds that the moral tone of Orwell's book is uniquely simple and true. Orwell was a virtuous man. He had an old fashioned temperament. Orwell's experience of being declasse , of being down and out after service in Burma, had significant implications for his writing. Orwell thought the intelligentsia refused to consider the conditional nature of life. Orwell could never believe that intellectual life would be a political idyll.When Orwell went to Spain he went to write newspaper articles but joined a militia almost immediately. In Barcelona revolutionary posters were everywhere. In the P.O.U.M. militia the shortage of rifles was desperate. Therefore, there was no weapon training, just marching, drills. Orwell described the smells of war. Rifles were finally received three miles from the front line. Orwell noted that in trench warfare five things were important, firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy. Orwell said he actually saw very little fighting. He was in hand to hand combat once, and he reported once was too much.There was equality in the militias. Military failure could not be attributed to the system of equality. Failure resulted from the newness, the lack of material, the lack of training, and the age of the recruits. He found that revolutionary discipline depended on political consciousness, an understanding of why orders must be obeyed. (What Orwell described is termed the learning curve in other kinds of discourse.) The militias held the line and there were few desertions. There was a lack of firewood. Warfare had made the bare mountainous region even more bare of vegetation. The English and Spanish always got on well together. When more Englishmen arrived, Orwell was shifted over to that group. They were now somewhat closer to the enemy. Aragon peasants treated their mules well but their donkeys abominably. In late February 1937 they left Monte Oscuro and were sent with all of the P.O.U.M. troops in the sector to make a part of the army besieging Huesca. Until late March nothing happened.Initially Orwell ignored the political side of the war. Spain seemed to be suffering from a plague of initials and the matter was confusing. Orwell thought all of the government forces were Socialists, anti-fascists. In the beginning Franco's real opponent was not so much the government as the trade unions. A revolution had started in Spain but its progress and significance varied by region. By October-November 1936 there was a swing to the Right. Power passed from the Anarchists to the Communists. The Communist leadership sought to suppress the revolution because it was believed to be premature. Only Mexico and Russia came to the assistance of the government and only Russia was big enough to dictate terms.The Communist Party moved first against the P.O.U.M. and then against the Anarchists. The war was essentially a triangular struggle. The P.O.U.M. was a dissident Communist party. The unions were not necessarily Anarchists in the pure sense and yet they were tinged with the philosophy and made up a huge portion of the forces opposing Franco. They aimed at worker control and not parliamentary democracy. They had uncompromising hostility to the bourgeoisie and the Church.At the time Orwell preferred the Communists because they had a definite policy. Press censorship was mainly under Communist control. One of the worst aspects of war is war propaganda. The Communists and the P.O.U.M. came to write more bitterly against each other than against the fascists. Orwell was isolated among the most revolutionary section of the working class. On paper the Communist case was a good one. Orwell drew back at their actual behavior. Communists seemed to be not working to postpone the revolution but to make sure it never happened at all.In spring the peasants plowed the fields. The landowners had left. Orwell never did learn if the land had been collectivized or if the arrangements were informal. The farming implements were antiquated. Orwell was surprised that no one crossed himself, even as a gesture. To the people of Catalonia and Aragon the Church was evidently a racket. When he went on leave, he had been on the line for one hundred fifteen days and felt that it was the most useless period of his life. The time did form a kind of interregnum. The prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. The Spanish militias, while they lasted, were sort of a microcosm of a classless society.Barcelona had changed in the three months and there was general indifference to war. It was no longer fashionable to be in the militia. Enlistments had sunk. The Popular Army was replacing the militias in theory, but in fact it was still training in the rear. Now there was open contrast of wealth and poverty. Middle class people no longer wore worker clothing.A civil disturbance broke out in Barcelona as the government and Communist forces sought to defeat the Anarchists and the P.O.U.M. It was all very confusing to Orwell. There developed a food shortage. The Popular Army as a body stayed away from the fray. The Barcelona fighting had given the Valencia government the excuse to assume fuller control of Catalonia.Three days after the fighting in Barcelona ended Orwell's group returned to the front. On routine duty he felt himself being the center of an explosion. He was taken to Barbastro and then to Lerida. Eight or nine days after being wounded his wound was finally examined at Tarragona. Sinister rumors of all kinds flew around Barcelona. It was hard to convey the atmosphere he claimed because in England political intolerance was not taken for granted.At this point Orwell hoped to just get out of Spain and return to England. He had been certified medically unfit, but he needed to obtain a discharge. He had to repeat the circuit of field hospitals and intermediate stations in order to have his papers signed. Returning to the hotel in Barcelona he discovered the P.O.U.M. had been declared an illegal organization and that he might be subject to arrest. Andres Nin was taken and killed. The manner of leaving the country makes exciting reading. The experience in Spain clearly foreshadowed ANIMAL FARM and 1984."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is just a great book.

This is not only an expertly told account of the real as well as the political nature of what went on (at least from the Loyalist side) during critical points of the Spanish Civil War, but it also serves as a treasure chest full of information beneficial to any persons interested in resisting the forces of fascism (corporate capitalism and its enforcer, the police state) which grip us daily in a tighter and tighter strangle hold in the modern world.

The truth is, as always more elusive, and less obvious. Orwell was a socialist,which in the land of the free and the brave is always tarred with the same brush as soviet communist{of course}. Orwell grew up in a society of severe class distinction{more pronounced than in America},and despised class distinction. So, like many left leaning folks in the 1930's he went offto Spain to fight in the great conflict between right and left. What began as a coup by Fascists led by Franco turned into 3 years of savage butchery{on ALL sides} that eventually led to 50 yeARS OF FASCIST RULE.Orwell spares no one{even himself,true to form} in this account.The little descriptive moments that enliven this sad account{the sign in a barcelona resturant,please do not insult us by tipping}, the description of various kinds of body lice as lies lies, wet and cold in the trenches are perfect Orwell moments. Of course, Orwell was wounded, and later,incredibly,labeled a memeber of a por-fascist element and had to literally run fo his life.Along with Simone Weil{who had similar expierences,being saved from death by her own awkwardness, and equally disillusioned} and from the royalist side, the great French novelist Geroge Bernanos{he was revolted by the conduct of &quot;religiois&quot; people, and moved to South America} Orwell set the record straight on this war. Often thought of as a macarbe tone poem for WWII, this war had all of the elements of its won unique horrors.{The bombing of civilian populations,the mutilations of so many clerics,children being forced at gunpoint into conscription from both sides}Homage to Catalonia is , I think Orwell's greatest achievment.It destroys myths on both sides,as Orwell tries to find {in himself] the elusivethird way{between capitalism and communsim}.

Orwell exposes how the petty impulses of humanity undermined the leftist coalition of communists and anarchists, leading to internecine struggles which brought ideological cousins to take the blood of one another, something that history shows to have led to the defeat of the Spanish resistance to fascism and the rise of Franco's state. It is a lesson that should be learned by today's leftists who neurotically mimic the same stupidity, pitting Trotskyists against Stalinists, and Communists against Anarchists. Historically, the greatest enemy of the far left has been the far left itself. Perhaps if more leftists read this book, they would resist these petty impulses?Orwell's book is clearly written and conveys with clarity the images of war and human folly. It is a moving story of personal sacrifice and disappointment. It proved to be as prophetic about the future of Europe as 1984 proved to be prophetic about our own time.

His tale is fascinating, and even the political discussions read as smoothly as his novels."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Homage to Catalonia, written by George Orwell, is one of the most important documents of its kind. It is about a period of time Orwell spent fighting in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. While there, he was almost fatally wounded by taking a bullet to the throat. This event, while quite painful, did little to dampen his voice. He was told he would never talk again, but little by little, he regained his ability to speak. The doctors said he was quite lucky to have survived his wound. Orwell couldn't help but thinking that if he had been truly lucky, he would not have been shot at all. Orwell prefaced his description of his ordeal stating, \\"The whole experience of being hit by a bullet is very interesting and I think it is worth describing in detail.\\"The Spanish Civil War was one of the most decisive events of the 20th century. While the memory of this event fades into the background, reading this book brings it vividly back to life. One is transported in time immediately back to the trenches of the battlefields with their stench of human waste and long periods of boredom and sudden periods of danger and to the turbulent streets of Barcelona where rival factions fought each other for control of the Telephone Exchange Building. The importance of such a record would be difficult to overstate.As one reads the record of the events taking place in Spain, taken from Orwell's direct experience, one cannot escape noticing the similarity to events taking place in America today in the 21st century. As Lionel Trilling indicated in his excellent introduction to the book, Homage to Catalonia is a testimony to the nature of modern political life. He observes that politics is a relatively new thing in the world, and we do not yet know very much about it. That is hard to understand nowadays, given the 24 hour news cycle and the complete immersion of politics on the cable news television stations. Ideas play a large role in politics and have great power. These ideas are directly connected to another kind of power that is described in the book: the power of force.In 1937, Orwell went to Spain to observe the civil war and to write about it. When he arrived in Barcelona, he got so caught up in the revolutionary furor that he decided to stay and fight. He joined the militia as private. The militia unit he joined by chance was a unit known as POUM (Party of Marxist Unification). The Spanish Civil war was a fight in defense of democracy against the Fascist enemy led by its chief proponent, Generalissimo Franco.There were many rival factions taking up the fight against the Fascists: POUM, communists, Trotskyites, and anarchists. We see some of these same echoes today in the Occupy Wall Street Movement. There are many and various factions protesting the inequality of the 1% of the wealthiest Americans versus the 99% of the rest. These inequalities have brought great unrest to our country along with high unemployment, economic hardship, and social injustice. The militaristic mien of the jackbooted SWAT Teams breaking up the demonstrators in Oakland, Boston, and New York are reminiscent of Franco's fascist brigades.When Orwell first arrived in Barcelona, outward appearances revealed it to be a town where the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Nobody said, \\"Senor\\" or \\"Don\\" anymore, but rather, \\"comrade.\\" Practically everyone wore rough working class clothes. Orwell recognized it immediately as situation worth fighting for. It was a worker's state where the entire bourgeoisie had either left, been killed, or came over to the worker's side. There was no unemployment and the cost of living was extremely low. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In barber shops (all barbers were anarchists) there were notices that barbers were no longer slaves. Orwell said, \\"A fat man eating quail while children are begging is a disgusting sight. But you are less likely to see it when you are within sight of guns.\\"Orwell was quickly sent to the front to fight in the trenches. In trench warfare, according to him, five things are of paramount importance: firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy, in that order. The real preoccupation with both armies was trying to keep warm. Firewood was the only thing that really mattered. The trenches were more than 500 yards apart and in those circumstances no one gets hit except by accident. He describes a particular experience that eerily presages passages from 1984: \\"In the barn where we waited the place was alive with rats. They came swarming out of the ground on every side. If there is anything I hate more than another, it is a rat running over me in the darkness.\\" This particular horror is to found behind the doors of room 101.In another scene, Orwell described a maneuver where he and his fellow soldiers were to attack a fascist position at night. The ground was muddy and wet and he was sodden from head to foot and was weighted down with a heavy rifle and bayonet and 150 cartridges. The patrol was successful in overrunning the enemy redoubt and had the fascists on the run. Suddenly the command to retire came. As Orwell and his men left the parapet and headed back across the 200 yards to their own parapet the fascists reappeared and began to attack the patrol. He had thought earlier that he could not run being as laden down as he was, but, \\"I learned you can always run when you think you have 50 armed men after you.\\"Barcelona is a town with a long history of street fighting. While on leave in Barcelona after serving three and one half months at the front, the last thing Orwell wanted was to be mixed up in some meaningless street fight. To be marching up the street behind red flags inscribed with elevating slogans, and then be bumped off from an upper window by some total stranger with a sub-machine gun- that was not his idea of a useful way to die.When Orwell saw an actual flesh and blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, he did not have to ask himself which side he was on. Completely innocent people were being arrested owing to police bungling. He reached the point that every time a door banged he reached for his pistol.Foreign journalists in Spain were hopelessly at the mercy of the Ministry of Propaganda, though one would think that the very name of this ministry would be a sufficient warning. Watching a fat Russian agent explaining that a particular event was an anarchist plot was the first time Orwell, according to his account, had seen a person whose profession was telling lies, unless of course, one counts journalists. One is reminded again of today's Fox News which studies have shown its viewers to be the most uniformed. Its entertainers, posing as newscasters, have a way of stating their biased opinions as fact.The fighting began on July 18, 1936. Most anti-fascists in Europe felt a \\"thrill\\" of hope. Here at last was democracy standing up to Fascism. For years, the so called democratic countries had been surrendering to Fascism: The Japanese, Hitler, and Mussolini. When Franco tried to overthrow the center left government in Spain, the Spanish people rose up against him. Franco was not really comparable to Hitler or Mussolini. His rising was a military mutiny backed by the aristocracy and the Church. It was an attempt not so much to install fascism but to restore feudalism. The Spanish working class resisted by revolt. Land was seized by the peasants and factories were seized by trade unions. Churches were destroyed and priests were driven out or killed. In certain areas of revolt as many as three thousand people died on the streets in a single day. Men and women armed with sticks of dynamite rushed across open squares and stormed stone buildings held by soldiers with machine guns. Anarchists and socialists were the backbone of the movement. The entire issue had been reduced to Fascism versus democracy.The war, in which Orwell claims to have played so ineffectual a part, left him with memories that were mostly evil, and yet he did not wish that he had missed it. The whole experience left him with not less, but more belief in the decency of human beings."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager. Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class revolutions after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted that the political class consciousness of the Spanish proletariat was higher than that of the Russian proletariat in 1917. George Orwell's book gives some eyewitness insights into the causes of that defeat from the perspective of a political rank and file militant who fought in the trenches in a Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) militia unit during the key year 1937. Leon Trotsky in his polemical article \`The Lessons of Spain-Last Warning', collected in The Spanish Revolution, 1931-39 (reviewed elsewhere in this space), his definitive assessment of the Spanish situation in the wake of the defeat of the Barcelona uprising in May 1937, while asserting that the POUM was the most honest revolutionary party in Spain, stated that in the final analysis the approaching defeat of the revolution could be laid to the policies of the POUM. Orwell's book parallels that argument on the ground in Spain although he certainly was not a follower of Trotsky's.Let us be clear here- we are not talking about the Orwell who later lost his political moorings and decided that the road to human progress passed through the nefarious intelligence agencies of British imperialism. Unfortunately, many militants have traveled that road. Nor are we talking about the later author of Animal Farm and 1984 who warmed the hearts of Western Cold Warriors. We are talking about the militant George Orwell who fought as a volunteer against fascism in Spain in 1937 when it counted. That Orwell has something to say to militants. We need to listen to him if we are to make sense of the disaster in Spain.While Homage to Catalonia is, in part, a journal of Orwell's personal experiences as a militiaman under the stress of war that part is less useful to militants today. The parts that are important are the political chapters. One should discount Orwell's self-proclaimed blas&eacute; attitude toward politics. Here is an intensely political man. Orwell draws two important conclusions from his experiences. First, the war against Franco could not be won without a simultaneous extension of the revolution to the creation of a workers state. The workers and peasants of Spain could not be persuaded to and would not and fight to the finish merely for \`democracy'. This premise runs counter to the objective policies pursued by almost all the pro-Republican parties. Orwell describes very vividly the negative changes that occurred in working class morale in Barcelona, the Petrograd of Spain, during his stay.The second conclusion Orwell draws is that the role of the Spanish Communist Party and its sponsor, the Soviet Union was not just momentarily anti-revolutionary in the interests of defeating Franco but counterrevolutionary. The Soviet Union had no interest in creating a second workers state. In the final analysis, despite providing weapons, the Soviet Union was more interested in finding allies among the European imperialist than in revolution. In long-range hindsight that seems clear but at the time it was far from obvious to militants on the ground, especially the militants of the Spanish Communist party who got caught up in the Stalinist security apparatus. Of course, this extreme shift to the right dovetailed with the interests of the liberal Republicans. However, in the end they all had to flee.This writer notes that at the time many European militants, like Victor Serge, and organizations , like the Independent Labor party in England, covered for the erroneous policies of the POUM based on their position as the most coherent, organized and militant ostensibly revolutionary organization in Spain. That support was at the time the subject of intense debate on the extreme left. Fair enough. What does not make sense is that since 1991 or so under the impact of the so-called \`death of communism' a virtual cottage industry has developed, centered on the British journal Revolutionary History, seeking today to justify the positions of the POUM. Jesus, can't these people learn something after all this time.And what was the POUM. That party, partially created by cadre formerly associated with Trotsky in the Spanish Left Opposition, failed on virtually every count. They made every mistake in the revolutionary book. Those conscious mistakes from its inception included, but were not limited to, the creation of an unprincipled bloc between the former Left Oppositionists and the former Right Oppositionists (Bukharinites) of Juan Maurin to form the POUM in 1935; political support to the Popular Front including entry into the government coalition by its leader, Andreas Nin; creation of its own small trade union federation instead of entry in the massive anarchist led-CNT to fight for the perspective of a workers state; a willful failure to seriously expand the organization outside of Catalonia; creation of its own militia units and other institutions reflecting a hands-off attitude toward political struggle with other parties; and, fatally, an at best equivocal role in the Barcelona uprising of 1937. In short, at best, the POUM pursued left social democratic policies in a situation that required Bolshevik policies. Read 1937 Orwell for other insights into the POUM."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Like many students, I've of course read the seemingly standard 1984 and Animal Farm (the former I found much more intriguing) and for a while was virtually unaware of much of the remaining Orwell catalogue. However, I've just finished \\"Homage..,\\" and had previously read \\"Down and Out,\\" and, while I still cannot so easily say that either wholly trump 1984, I can affirm that they do however offer much insight into the world of Orwell that is largely responsible for 1984 to have even been conceived, especially \\"Homage...\\" To some effect, it is a matter of preference as far as being able to tolerate the somewhat lesser degree of 'flow' that is inherent in Orwell's non-fiction which may shy some people away from delving into his lesser known works. Nonetheless; highly introspective, very personal, and often very reader-conscious, Orwell's \\"Homage...\\" really digs deep into the heart of his experience in fighting the Spanish War and, if the reader is somewhat politically-inclined, Orwell offers several chapters devoted to exploring the politics and issues surrounding the war. I deeply enjoyed the book and I feel most fans of 1984 who are curious in the field of politics would appreciate this piece as a primer into the world of Orwell's non-fiction."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The 1930's were an age of idealistic despair and the events of the Spanish civil war provide some of the most extreme examples. Given the circumstances of the Spanish republic, a military revolt was inevitable and when the civil war began, many idealistic men, such as Orwell, with left political leanings went to Spain for the chance to fight fascism. To them, it was finally an opportunity to militarily confront what they considered to be the greatest threat to civilization. However, the many political organizations in loose alliance against the forces under Franco were often more interested in destroying their rivals than fighting Franco. This lead to despair among those who fought on the front lines, only to be harassed, imprisoned and even shot based only on their political affiliation.In this book, Orwell gives an excellent account of the despair and frustrations that arose as he experienced the political infighting. Upon his arrival in Spain to cover the war, he joined the P.O.U.M. militia, a communist organization unaffiliated with the Communist Party controlled by Stalin's henchmen. After months on the front line, he was severely wounded in the neck, only barely escaping death. However, after being sent back to recover, he found himself on the run, as the P.O.U.M. members were being hunted down. He was fortunate to be able to escape to France, avoiding the fate of imprisonment and death that befell so many of his comrades.Orwell also tries to explain many of the political groups fighting in Spain, chapter five is devoted to a description of the major forces aligned against Franco. He also takes many of the newspapers and their journalists to task for their incompetent and unethical reporting of the political infighting. In my opinion, this is the best description of the Spanish civil war from the aspect of the people who left their homes to go and fight against fascism. Orwell captures the absurdity of the whole thing, and the despair of people who were willing to die for a cause that was made hopeless by people with differing political agendas."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Orwell's very satisfying account of his days as a Trotskyist dogface offers much insight into the Spanish Civil War. The heart of politics is crossed with the everday life as a volunteer soldier in someone else's war. Orwell, the committed socialist, finds much disillusionment in Stalinist Communism and explains its danger quite thoroughy. The Spanish Civil-War was a seminal act in the course of the 20th Century. A must read for any political officiando."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Every time that I read something by Orwell I am struck by what a magnificent writer he is, and by what an honest and generous man he must have been. Everything that Orwell wrote is worth reading, and this book might well be his best.Orwell is a master of expository prose. His writing is very richly descriptive and yet stark, simple, and lucid. For instance, he writes of his first exposure to battle in Spain: &quot;We were near the front line now, near enough to smell the characteristic smell of war - in my experience a smell of excrement and decaying food.&quot;Orwell was the best kind of socialist: a generous man genuinely concerned about equality and about ending the exploitation of the poor. And unlike most other left-wing intellectuals of his time, he was not content to write pamphlets from the confort of peace and affluence, nor did he ever allow his politics to blind him to the reality of how the ideals of socialism were betrayed by the ambition and pettiness of many of those who put it into practice."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"After re-reading Catalonia, some 20 years after my first encounter, I am disappointed. I do not think that this is Orwell's best work. It has many of his strengths, mainly the elegant, efficient and straightforward prose that he developed so impressively, but there are some flaws. Main flaw in my view is the fact that the main political theme has become dead and irrelevant. Stalin died some decades ago, the Soviet Empire collapsed, we don't need to dig in the little details of their abominable strategies any longer. Of course we can't blame Orwell for the fact that his concerns are not ours any more. But it shows that the book was not timeless in the sense of surviving its immediate subject, as his other non-fiction did.Second main weakness of the book: the narration of the Barcelona street fighting and the attempts at understanding them are rather boring.On the strong side: the tales from the Aragon front are much more interesting. Orwell saw less fighting than he was keen to experience, but he describes the trench routine with the same liveliness that he brought to Wigan coalmines and Paris restaurants previously.He did see enough fighting to get dangerously injured. People said to him that few men survive a shot through the neck, so he was lucky. He thinks he would have been luckier if he had not been shot at all.Orwell published the book a few months after his adventure, and before the Spanish Civil War was over. Surprisingly the book was a commercial failure then, and equally surprisingly it has later been named as one of the best non-fiction books of the century.Why was it ignored in the early time? Possibly because he told the world things that the world didn't want to know. He busted the myth that there was a confrontation of the good and the bad in Spain, that democracy fought fashism. Orwell shows us that there were at least 3 camps, not 2. The most vicious fighting that he experienced was among the 'good guys'. The government side was influenced strongly by the communist party who had secured the support from Russia. Since no other country provided weapons to the government side, that secured a lot of mileage.Orwell was a hopeless romantic, who loved the feeling of working class rule that he got when he first arrived in Barcelona. That must be the reason for the otherwise incomprehensible book title. That basically socialist attitude must also have put quite a few potential readers off at the time of publication.Orwell later saw the few months in Spain as his political training period. It put him off communism and Stalin for good, but confirmed his socialist attitude, which however never found a political home in a party, though he did support Labor in his remaining years, from the outside."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The best way that I can think of to describe George Orwell is a skeptical and responsible idealist, obsessed with the nature of, uses and abuses of power. Generally unacknowledged about Orwell was the fact that he was a committed socialist and a man who believed that human beings were capable of creating a society where a brotherhood of man based on social justice could exist.In 1936 he went to Spain and saw in Catalonia, and more specifically Barcelona, and felt that he was witness to a society that existed on that basis-in his own words, he \\"recognized it as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\" Over the next several months, while he fought for the Spanish republic side by side with workers in the militia of the radical POUM, he saw it destroyed and libeled by the republic he came to defend and, more specifically, the Spanish Communist Party and its lackeys throughout the world. His story is exactly what the title proclaims it to be: homage to the men and women who had fought, very literally for freedom and social justice, and the society that existed on those principles that he saw destroyed. Like any good journalist as well, he wants to set the record straight about a very misunderstood state of affairs.Part soldiering memoir, with what seems to be the obligatory British emphasis on the surreality and physical deprivation of the trenches, and part recitation of the little known suppression of anarchists and radical socialists in the midst of the general war against Franco, Orwell is able to show the spirit that animated the thousands of foreign volunteers that went to fight for the republic, and how they were all betrayed. The nature of the betrayal was made even worse by the fact that it was committed in a libelous fashion that did not allow most to even know that it had occurred. Orwell did not go to Spain looking to expose anyone on the republican side of the war as a villain, but by the time he left in July of 1937, he knew with a good amount of certainty that the Soviet Union was as great an enemy of democracy as any fascist could be-a very foreign idea in left-wing thought at the time.Through the cataloging of his own experiences in Barcelona during the suppression of the POUM and anarchists in early 1937 and comparing them with the accounts of left-wing and Communist newspapers from in and outside of Great Britain, Orwell concluded that a massive campaign of disinformation concerning the suppression of anti-Communist radicals in Catalonia. Disturbing enough was the fact that it was happening and that Communists were lying about it. Orwell knew that the Communist Party press had a tendency to lie, but what was much more disturbing was how the more mainstream liberal and left opinion makers were accepting hook, line and sinker the stories of the perfidy of anti-Communists that were coming exclusively from Communists and their allies. He saw an inexcusable mixture of gullibility and laziness animating the reportage of the war there.The disinformation that he records was terrible enough, but this was not where the true horror and betrayal laid. Hundreds of defenders of the republic, including foreigners that Orwell knew personally had sacrificed much to fight there, were being thrown in jail and the government of Spain was utterly powerless to stop it. Orwell shows something of a Communist state within a state that operated outside the power of the government. He concludes that it was because the Spanish republic had to depend on the Soviet government for its military support. This lamentable situation is the fault not of the republican government, men of goodwill and honestly mostly, but by the fact that no countries other than the Soviet Union, and to a small degree Mexico, were helping the republic in the fight for its life. The confrontation against Franco's fascism was being undermined because the powers that were running the war were declaring the most militant of the antifascists to be de facto traitors. If there were ever an abuse of power, coupled with a colossal abuse of the truth, the suppression of the POUM and its allies was it.As an historical document, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a necessary to any understanding of the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War. The villainous and parasitical treatment of the Spanish Republic by the Soviet Union that has recently come to light was dimly perceived decades by Orwell decades before the documentation proving Soviet perfidy came out of Russian archives. It is also necessary reading to gain a deeper understanding of Orwell's masterwork \\"1984.\\" If there any wonder as to how he could so vividly imagine a totalitarian society without ever having lived in one, it becomes clear that he had some help from the utterly preposterous situation he found himself in during the suppression of the POUM and anarchists in Catalonia. Finally, the level of honesty and sincerity with which he tells his story is total and completely without pretension and propaganda. Orwell was loyal to truth and basic goodness-values that are still in short supply today."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"In the essay that prefaces this publication of *Homage to Catalonia*, Lionel Trilling declares that George Orwell was \\"not a genius [...] but a figure,\\" in other words, an individual who presided over certain historical ideas and attitudes and was able to express these conceptions in a simplistic, general way, seeking and finding the truth of the matter and subsequently scribing it without undue embellishment, overt bias or brain-taxing philosophical meta-quandary - making difficult issues palpable for mass comprehension. I cannot say I fully agree with this hypotheses, though it certainly does make for an interesting read after completing Orwell's account of the Spanish Civil War - introductions, it seems, should always be read _last_ in order to avoid spoiling the interior text - for in my definition, \`genius' is one who is able to perceive, in some fasion, the patterns and cycles generally unseen by the common multitudes, even (especially) if focused on a particular path; more importantly, genius is how this perception is then channeled and reflected to the world at large, and in that regard, Orwell's ability to penetrate the pompous falsehoods and intentional ambiguities of political discourse, via hard truths and internalized experiences, especially given the chaotic era in which *Homage to Catalonia* was written: to pierce through and then pen a novel such as this, simple but oh so telling, \`easy' but incredibly effective - this certainly takes a particular type of genius. All of Orwell's novels share this sort of rolled-up-sleeves ethic. Trilling may find *Animal Farm* to be over-rated (as do I, with reservations), but as a metaphor it is one of the greatest of the first half of the 20th century - easily the most influential and public-schooled - and certainly the product of a genius perception internalized and painstakingly realized.Of course, I have the hindsight benefit of half a century, whereas Trilling wrote his essay a mere two years after Orwell's death... such is the advantage of time! Orwell makes note of this as well, concluding that his theories would either stand or fall when re-examined from afar. Time has tested his experiences, indeed, and the breadth of clarity and caustic recognition is just as pertinent now, at the beginning of the 21st century, as it was in the late 1930's.When the Spanish Revolution broke out in 1936, the country was torn between the utopia-seeking leftist radicals/anarchists and the old-form power structure still fighting for control, allied with the notorious Generalissimo Franco and his Fascist-funded army. Although Orwell initially traveled to Barcelona as a journalist, he was so impressed with the fact that the Spanish were fighting Fascism - something incredibly rare in that pre-WW period of European history - that he hung up his press-cap and picked up a rifle, impelled by what he called \\"common decency\\" to navely join one of the many leftist factions without a hard inquiry into the political realities of the conflict. Luckily he did not put down his journalist's pen: after the fallout, Orwell scribed his experiences in concise, articulate form, remarkably free of the prevalent propaganda shrouding the fiasco...and that is why this book has lasted, while the forked tongues and tabulations of that period have all \`withered on the vine,' so to speak.*Homage to Catalonia* describes two experiences of violence: the outer violence, being Orwell's wry, almost nostalgic reflections of serving in the trenches for some five months in 1937 - coping with starvation, winter cold, boredom and the occasional pot-shot from the opposing side; and the inner violence, being his eventual disillusionment of Communism as a political ideology. The first violence is, naturally, the most entertaining to read, with its adventures and unexpected conflicts, its hardships and absurdities all lovingly infused with Orwell's dry wit, set in stone via his very-English style, full of humility, human awareness and healthy skepticism. The second violence is more complicated, convoluted (due to the political particulars), and both harrowing and illuminating in detail. Already a committed Socialist, Orwell was stunned and gratified to discover how, under extreme duress and remarkable isolation, his militia-sect of revolutionaries achieved, for a short time, a truly \\"utopian\\" society, Marx's theory made true: and how this was betrayed and irrevocably shattered by opposing forces, namely, the rest of the world. Revolution was not in the interests of anyone outside of Spain, as it threatened vested interests and stability; even Stalinist Russia, so-called bastion of the left, sabotaged its red brethren with shoddy munitions and double-dealing. After defending Spain from Fascism for month after bloody month, Orwell returned to Barcelona to find he and his fellows demonized by journalists, called \\"traitors\\" and \\"pro-Fascists,\\" transformed in the public eye from men fighting for \`common decency' to pawns maneuvered by power-brokers, via their propagandist lap-dogs, into a stalemate position. This internal fracas climaxed with pitch battle in the streets of Barcelona; after the smoke cleared (physically, at least), all members of the radical sect, be they native or foreign, were rounded up and jailed as insurgents. Forced to flee the country in disguise, Orwell left behind the ruins of a once-potential anarchistic prosperity, but his memories of that brief, classless equality among men, amidst the bullets and bombs of confused carnage, linger tellingly in the text.*Homage to Catalonia* warns us to take all information with a grain of salt, to look behind the curtain and view the puppeteer jerking the strings of those talking-head mouths - a message most important in this complex, (mis)information-glutted era. The book also serves as a vital element in Orwell's oeuvre: *Homage* can be seen as a continuation of the Socialist ideals espoused in *Down and Out in Paris and London*, and the framework experience that inspired the allegory of *Animal Farm*.Highly recommended for enthusiasts of both history and literature."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I recently purchased this edition of Homage to Catalonia to replace an old copy that had been ruined. Homage to Catalonia is an excellent book (I am not going to comment on the content as others have done so). I highly recommend purchasing it, just not this edition. Overall it is one of the worst jobs of proofing that I have ever encountered. There is not a page that goes by where one does not encounter a typo of some kind. The random period (or lack of one) and the miss-use of punctuation are annoying.

(Ernest Hemingway's novel, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is another.) The Spanish Civil War was an intensely ideological conflict between Right and Left and adherents of both sides told outrageous lies in pursuit of victory. Orwell was of the Left but he still saw the war clearly and wrote about what he saw without adornment.In \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" Orwell tells the story of his seven months as a volunteer soldier with the Loyalists fighting against the Fascists in 1936-1937. The first half of the book is about his life as a common soldier on the front lines near Barcelona. It is unvarnished and unheroic and often amusing. In the second half of the book he describes the chaotic events in Barcelona when the Loyalist factions, especially the Anarchists and Communists, fought pitched battles against each either and pretty much ignored their common enemy, the Fascists of General Franco. Orwell himself ended up fleeing Spain to avoid being arrested by the people he had come to Spain to help.Orwell makes clear that his sympathies are with the Anarchists who favor the creation of an equalitarian worker's government. He was appalled by the evil and incompetence he saw and his experience in Spain probably contributed greatly to his later cautionary novels \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm.\\" If you want to learn about the Spanish Civil War, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the first book to read.

No one can study the Spanish Civil War without encountering it. On that basis, it's a five-star book; all primary sources should get five stars. As a reading experience, it's not without weaknesses, which the earlier review by H. Schneider examines cogently. I refer you to that review.Today's newspapers (7-11-08) carried extended obituaries for David Smith, who died in Berkeley, CA, at age 95. Mr. Smith was one of the only 30-some veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the volunteer contingent of Americans who joined the republican cause in Spain to stop fascism before World War II. The defeat of the republican forces, due at least partly to their own turmoils as described by Orwell, allowed the dictator Franco to suppress the 20th Century in Spain until his welcome death in 1975. David Smith was wounded in Spain in 1938. He returned to America, settled in New York, and married Sophie Kaplan, a marriage that lasted 59 years. Smith worked as a machinist, a union organizer, and for 18 years as a public school biology teacher in New Rochelle, where he campaigned for school integration.David Smith and his wife were active Communist Party members in the 1940s and 1950s, but left the party in disillusionment in the early 1960s. He was one of the victims of blacklisting in the McCarthy era. He retired to Vermont in 1977, and then to California two decades later. During his long retirement, Smith was a dedicated campaigner for peace, a familiar personage at anti-war demonstrations, and an active raiser of relief funds for Central American countries hit by civil strife.I knew David Smith reasonably well. He was a man of sincerity and integrity; I doubt that he ever did anything in his life that failed to meet his standards of conscientious humanity. He meant to do well, and he did what he believed was right. His support for the welfare of working people and for oppressed people everywhere was unwavering. He had no lust for power or fame. Like several other grass-root American Communists I've known, he was above all a decent guy. That he was naive about Stalinist Russia is clear; that he wasn't always right about his positions seems clear also, but who is? But to portray such a person as a menace to free society, an unscrupulous plotter, a pawn in the game of Kremlin masterminds is libel and foolishness, and a self-deception honorable people in America cannot afford."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Most books on the Spanish Civil War are either huge weightily 700 page plus tomes or tiny, abridged paperback books that can fit in your pocket. But they've never helped me understand the events of the war. Why? Because the big books are done by authors trying to explain EVERYTHING. How the tactics were effected by the industry which was effected by the politics which was effected by the war and so on. An ocean of information that a reader can drown in.Or the books are slim summaries, like time lines with all the details snipped away. The chain of cause and effect becomes a pile of broken rings, seeming to have no connection with each other, jumping in leaps and bounds, and the history becomes chaos.But Orwell's account is just the right size, showing us a sliver of the whole history through the eyes of one man, but a man who happens to be in the right place at the right time. He is there to see the height of the revolution in Barcelona and is also there when that worker's paradise is sabotaged. He is able to explain the reason for all the infighting, describing the horrors of trench warfare and the confusion of Barcelona uprising in May 1937. He is the first author to clearly explain to me HOW the CNT and the FAI fit together and WHY the Communists seemed to change their position every week. He makes sense!And the sad part it was published before the end of the war, so while pointing out many of the problems on the Republic's side, there was still a shadow of hope. Of course the Fascists won the war.While reading the book you can see his own views change, you can see him go from an armchair socialist who hung around with the poor for a year to a hard, experienced man who learned to trust nobody and believe in nothing he could not touch. The rats, the bad food, the piles of waste, the human suffering, the daily lies, the unclean pannikins, the partisan posters, the lack of tabacco and the ruthless police.

However, recently much to my pleasure I have started to discover some of Orwell lesser well known, but equally brilliant works.Homage to Catalonia is the story of Orwell's time serving in the republican (government) forces in the Spanish civil war. Homage is part memoir, part adventure tale, part history and part dissection of the politics which finally destroyed the republican cause. Orwell originally went to Spain to serve as a correspondent but shortly after arrival joined to the Socialist P.O.U.M militia, a decision which was made largely at random but which was to bring Orwell into conflict with the mainline communist supported government, and which finally forced Orwell to flee Spain after the P.O.U.M's suppression. Orwell's description of warfare, including the chaos of the actual fighting, the difference in experience between senior command and the soldiers on the ground, the period of extended boredom where more mundane concerns such as staying warm, obtaining cigarettes and the constant battle against lice are some of the finest that I have read. Also of note is Orwell's description of the sensation of being shot, which captures the fear of eminent death, but also a detachment which allowed him to lucidly record the experience.Finally if you are interested in the origins of 1984, Homage is important in that it shows how the political infighting within the republican side, including the pogroms which where conducted against the smaller non communist militia's and use of blatant falsehoods to discredit the cause of the socialist and anarchist militia's in the eyes of the world at large, served to shape Orwell's future political thinking and his distrust of totalitarian governments."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"If you want to learn about: the spanish civil war, anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, fascist spain, stalinism/communist party, or Orwell's politics, this book is for you.

Not only does he provide the reader with knowledge about how the war was fought, but he describes the anarchist held region of catalonia, where, in my opinion, true socialism was achieved.

A committed socialist, Orwell was right in the thick of the action fighting on the side of the doomed Republic.The book is at its best when it gives Orwell's first-hand account of life as a soldier, but is less compelling when he attempts to explain the complicated Republican politics, rivally, and in-fighting of the time.Orwell's socialist politics also seem rather naive these days, given what has happened in the intervening 70 years.Interesting for its personal insights, but read Anthony Beevor's great book for a comprehensive history of the Spanish Civil War."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"My girlfriend and I are going to spend about a little over a week in Catalonia. I've been reading several books to get a better understanding of the people of Catalonia. I consider this book 'good'. I've enjoyed many of Orwell's books and this one has added to my growing understanding of the region however I would not look to it as a soul source of information.It's written in first person (as i'm sure you're aware) and it was very enjoyable easy read."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"this book had an profound impact on my political views. already being tilted towards anarchism and anarchosyndicalism after having read ursula k leguin's &quot;the dispossessed&quot; and the works of kropotkin, bakunin and so on, homage to catalonia was one of the reasons that made me cross the border to the political field where i can proudly call myself an anarchist.orwell tells the tale of his days of fighting with the POUM and the CNT-FAI against both &quot;the brown fascists&quot; and &quot;the red fascists&quot; and makes this book powerful enough to earn a 5 star from me."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I have not read any of Orwell's books, besides Homage To Catalonia.

Well, check this book out."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Whatever you think of Orwell and his two most famous works, 1984 and Animal Farm can be set aside when reading &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. The book's most valuable asset is that it lends credibility to Orwell's rather strong political views that are so eloquently expressed in his other works. It is one thing to rail against Communism or Totalitarianism, it's another thing entirely to pick up a gun and do something about it at great risk to life and limb. The book in and of itself is not a great book. It is a description of a rather banal civil war that at times is pathetic, comical, and as with any war, ultimately sad when taken at face value. That it is a non-fiction account of the author's participation at Catalonia sets it aside from Orwell's other work. It has made a few top 100 lists, however, I struggled to find a justification for such a lofty ranking. If you are a fan of Orwell, Huxley, etc or are a fan of European history then this book will appeal. Absent such a range of interests, the (potential) reader is probably better off searching elsewhere for an engrossing novel. Ultimately, I enjoyed this book to the extent that it allows for a much deeper perspective on Orwell and his philosphies."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell (Eric Blair) shows how someone can be an idealist but, at the same time, is able to keep all his observation and reasoning capacity.At this moment, the Government in Spain is trying -in the best Ministry of Truth orwellian tradition- to re-write the recent history. It should be interesting having this book in spanish for many people lacking the most elemental knowledge about their own history.It should have been interesting too having the opinion of Orwell himself about his own experience when he wrote \\"1984\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\". That should have been better than the amount of letters with dubious relation with the object of the book.In summary, four stars because something is missing in the book and something should not have to be there."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, tells about his participation in the Spanish Civil War in the 1930's. He fought for one of the Marxist political parties against Franco.Orwell did a good job of portraying the futility of war, and the universal cold, dirt and boredom of the ordinary soldiers. He included a good description of what it felt like to get a bullet through the throat, which he richly deserved for meddling in someone else's affairs and trying to inflict a similar experience on others.Orwell also demonstrated the near-universal deceit by the press, especially the Spanish Communist and left-wing press. The distorted Communist-directed story received widespread acceptance, with only one newspaper in England being recognized as anywhere near objective.Although a dedicated and wounded leftist, Orwell barely made it out of Spain one step ahead of the secret police-after his wing of Marxism had been declared an illegal organization in a Communist power play.Orwell believed that General Franco would revive an \\"anachronistic feudalism.\\" Instead, under General Franco Spain experienced a spectacular revival, as described in the December, 1998 National Geographic magazine, in an article about Barcelona:\\" A mixture of common sense and refreshing lunacy has turned this Spanish city into an economic powerhouse and international showcase-a model for a peaceful and prosperous Europe.\\""},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"It's hard to tell what sort of novel this is, but don't let this hinder you from reading this because it has the potential to be an autobiography.

It's very interesting to read it now while following the misinformation being presented daily about the debt crisis occurring in Europe. Orwell's perspective on human behaviour and his morality helps keep the narrative going, but I couldn't finish the book in one sitting. If you like Animal Farm and 1984, his recollections help put into perspective how he got the inspiration for his fiction."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I reread this book after decades of having first picked it up and I think that I got a little more of it than at first because since that time I learned more of Stalinism from reading Solshenitzin and Robert Conquest (and if you haven't read those books, do so!).A lot of rubbish has been written about the Spanish Civil War, almost all of it by leftists who have caricatured it: that it was a noble struggle of the Spanish people who tried to throw off the yokes of oppression and establish a decent life, but their idealism was stifled by Fascism, Mussolini, Hitler and the reactionary Catholic Church, yada, yada, yada. The other side, though it is seldom heard, is likewise a caricature.Homage to Catalonia shows that it was a highly complex, fluctuating, maelstrom. Written in the first person from someone who repeatedly---and refreshingly---warns the reader that his perspective was limited, and possibly biased, Orwell served as a volunteer in the Republican side on the Aragon/Catalonia front in the static, filthy, trenches (he did so, motivated by the leftist propaganda in England). At that time, each of the political parties, all of them leftists, had their own militia and he ended up in the POUM militia; it was being deliberately starved of arms by the Stalinists who were preparing to exterminate all of the members. Orwell ended up being shot at the front and on returning to the home front, he quickly learned that the Stalinists had began to portray the POUM as a Fascist entity, and/or a Trotskyite entity and thousands of arrests were being made and the POUM headquarters occupied; many of his friends and his comrade in arms who had been fighting the Fascists were arrested and shot as being Fascists. Ultimately, he escaped, thanks to the help of the British consul.Once in Britain, he was incensed at the printed lies that the leftist press put out explaining the pogrom of the POUM. He deals at length on this and this alone is worth reading when you think about our modern main stream media (which repeatedly claims to be impartial and professional).Throughout, Orwell has an affinity for the Spanish people, although he predicts that no matter how the civil war ends, it will turn out to be a disaster for the people. His sympathies are strictly on the side of the working class.Incidentally, there was a very strong Anarchist movement within Spain which likewise had its own flag and militia and which Orwell credits with having saved the Republic in the beginning of the struggle. It was responsible for the destruction of the churches and the massacre of priests (Spain was one of three countries with a very strong Anarchist presence, the others being pre-Soviet Russia and pre-Fascist Italy). I wish that he had dwelt a little more on them."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Here is Orwell's love letter to socialism and the story of his experiences fighting the fascists in Spain. Well written and never dull, he tells us the whole story, as he experienced it.In the early days of the revolution, we catch a glimpse of the new world being built by the Socialists and the Anarchists. Later, we see the murderous workings of Stalin, the enemy of the people and witness the seed being planted that will grow to be Animal Farm and 1984.This book encourages us that a new world is possible and warns us, as so many others do, about how narrow and straight a path we must walk in revolutionary times."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Well written, interesting, and from a historical perspective you rarely see (Spanish Civil War). I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Orwell, or good writing."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is wonderful writing, pure and simple. Orwell was a master of language and this book is no exception. He spent part of 1936 and all of 1937 fighting for P.O.U.M., one of the communist factions in the Spanish Civil War. This is his personal account of the events of that time. He spent most of the time on the relatively quiet Aragon front. Orwell and his outfit lacked adequate food, clothes and weaponry - as did the Franco troops on the other side. Late in 1937, he was injured by a stray bullet through the neck.Orwell was an idealist. For him, communism meant empowerment of the working class. He desired a true democracy and opposed facism and capitalism. But, he also opposed the Soviet model of communism, which he saw as just another way to oppress the working class. Ultimately, he left Spain disillusioned by the politics of war and the compromises made by the communists. He was dismayed by the incessant battles between the various communist factions.Orwell tells many wonderful stories of his experiences in Spain. He gives an unvarnished view of a poor-man's war. The Spanish fighters - on both sides - were poorly trained, ill-equipped and generally lacking a will to fight. On the Franco side, most of the Spanish soldiers had been conscripted. On the communist side, the Spanish were just happy to have a paying job. Orwell's outstanding writing effortlessly combines many tales from the front with his political observations."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Having now gone through Homage to Catalonia, I don't see how one can properly appreciate 1984 without having also read this book. This account of Orwell's time fighting in the Spanish civil war in 1936-1937, written immediately after the event, contains two threads. One is about Orwell's time at the front, presented in his typically effective matter-of-fact manner. The second concerns the internecine struggles of the revolution in Barcelona, pitting anarchists, republicans, socialists, and communists against one another in the 'events of May' and in the purges that followed - purges of which Orwell almost became a physical victim. As the introduction by Julian Symons notes, Orwell would remain a man of the left. But after the communist party destroyed the POUM, whose militia Orwell had joined, he could no longer believe in communism as a system. As the party and the republican government that was under their control imprisoned and shot the 'Troskyist' POUM members, vilifying them as Fascist spies, so did Orwell's journey begin towards Animal Farm and 1984. This is the watershed that must be read to understand the end point.Incidentally, Antony Beevor (The Spanish Civil War) confirms what Orwell wrote of the communist campaign of lies against the POUM. This was worth checking, since Orwell himself writes that he is not a neutral observer, and the foreign press wrote things up quite differently at the time, gobbling up the party's blatant defamations. Also of note is the oddly-chosen title, since Orwell ignores the role of Catalonian independentism, which historians tend to make more of as a political factor. But this was, as pierces through the page, the age of world-sweeping ideologies. To be read both for its pulsing action and for its insight into Orwell's ideological transformation."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"As noted by other reviewer, Orwell did, in some cases, exaggerate or fictionalize portions of his journalistic writings and therefore it is difficult to categorize this book as the definitive book on the Spanish Civil War. It is essentially accurate, with fictionalized accounts used by Orwell to enhance the dogma (which some call \\"truths\\" that he is wishing to portray. (ASIN:0871404109 George Orwell: Diaries). The book is a FANTASTIC read told from the disenchanted view of a man who once idealized communism and then found it just as corrupt as the other political movements and classes that he despised. It is an excellent depiction of the grand ideals with which many men -- not just Englishmen, but also including leftist Americans -- volunteered for the war, only to be disillusioned when facing the realities of a civil war. The essential feelings of disenchantment and the realities of the experience for many are compelling and more than worth the reading."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"An interesting account of the Spanish civil war. The writers voice here makes Orwell's influence on Christopher Hitchens very obvious. Hitchens' commentary on various things sounds a lot less original after going through this book. Orwell is a great journalist, he really drew me into something I knew next to nothing about.This book has it all: humor, detailed accounts, summaries, introspection, and practical application. Also remarkable is Orwell's ending where he humbly and wisely cautions the reader not to jump to conclusions too quickly based on what he said, encouraging them to consider the impact of his biases, oversights, and ignorance. Even though he was a socialist and I'm not, if I had to get a dead author to cover a major world event on the ground level, Orwell would be high on the list."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I haven't read Orwell since I was made to run the gamut of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' in high school, and I'm glad I picked him up again. Orwell manages to make the Spanish civil war (a topic I don't know anything about other than that it was called the Spanish civil war) both fairly comprehensible and at the same time deeply personal. His memories of slogging through trenches covered in filth, scrounging for firewood and in general being bored out of his mind, offers a sobering, sincere look at the life of a solider. He has that droll English wit which allows him to walk a fine line between humorously belittling the messy world of Spanish socialist warfare (and his own mud-soaked involvement in it) and at the same time manages to show why the conflict was so genuinely important as europe started to tilt towards fascism and destruction. This book makes me want to go out and read everything else he ever wrote."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"A very good book, one I couldn't put down. The discussions later in the book about the various leftist orgs were a tad dry, but overall the book was a fascinating read. As the previous reviewers have written excellent descriptions of the war and Orwell's experiences, I'll skip further discussions about that part. What was most interesting to me was the gradual disillusionment Orwell felt towards the communists. But what was distressing is the failure of Orwell to realize that any experiment in socialism, including the Spanish anarchist/marxist movement, would eventually end up with a totalitarian system. Once you tell people, like the anarchists did, that they can have no private property and whatever they produce is exactly equal to some other person's labor, you have the start of a totalitarian state. This inability to recognize the inherent evil of all forms of socialism is still prevalent among many intellectuals. Apparently Orwell never lost his belief in the future of some kind of socialism even if he detested the soviet style. It would be interesting to know if there were any major intellectuals of that time who openly sympathized with Franco. I've never heard of any, but there must be some. There has a lot of discussion as to whether it would have been better for the Republicans to win or if the eventual Franco dictatorship was the best outcome. My own view is: a pox on both their houses. However, to pick the best of two very bad choices, I'll favor the Franco dictatorship which gave way to a liberal democracy after Franco's death. If the communists had won, we don't know how long that horrible type of government would have lasted in Spain."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"NPR aired an interview with Christopher Hitchens (not sure of date) where he discussed the writings of George Orwell. I think most people were expecting maybe a short discourse on Orwells most famous work '1984' but Hitchens instead gave props to 'Homage To Catalonia'. And after reading this 'one mans viewpoint' on the Spanish Civil War I find myself in agreement with Hitchens that this book is underrated and unfortunately overshadowed by '1984'. Although It originally did not sell well in England and even today is still rather obscure, the book should be standard reading in Highschool and College; especially in Political Science classes.Orwells non-fiction 'Homage to Catalonia' should be a standard text for war reporting to any aspiring journalist. In a modest, sometimes witty, and almost modern travel blogger style, Orwell lays out his experience as a foreign soldier fighting with the P.O.U.M against the Franco Fascists and then later his further involvement with the internal political battles between the Communists and Anarchists in Barcelona. The following passage on pages 130-131 is a good example of Orwells style and the strength of this book,\\"I used to sit on the roof marveling at the folly of it all. From the little windows in the observatory you could see for miles around- vista after vista of tall slender buildings, glass domes and fantastic curly roofs with brilliant green and copper tiles; over to eastward the glittering pale blue sea - the first glimpse of the sea that I had coming to Spain. And the whole huge town of a million people(Barcelona) was locked in a sort of violent inertia, a nightmare of noise without movement. The sunlit streets were quite empty. Nothing was happening except the streaming of bullets from barricades and sand bagged windows. Not a vehicle was stirring in the streets; here and there along the Ramblas the trams stood motionless where their drivers had jumped out of them when the fighting started. And all the while the devilish noise, echoing from thousands of stone buildings, went on and on, like a tropical rainstorm. Crack, crack, rattle-rattle, roar - sometimes it died away to a few shots, sometimes it quickened to a deafening fusillade, but it never stopped while daylight lasted, and punctually next dawn it started again.\\"Much of the book is written like the above quoted passage. Orwells clear and descriptive observations make for great reading without the need for the more modern exaggerated styles of writing that try to make every moment a life and death situation as if war is something 24/7 and 365 days a year. Orwell understands that people are human. And even the enemy must sleep, eat, and defecate at some point. The book is without flaw but you might find the constant political party references and alphabet soup of acronyms overwhelming if you don't take notes. P.O.U.M, P.S.U.C., C.N.T., and F.A.I. are just some of the abbreviated party names you will need to remember especially for Chapter 11 when Orwell attempts to sort out for the reader exactly what happened during the fighting in Spain.This edition had a good introduction by Lionel Trilling which I recommend reading after the book as a supplement to further understanding Orwell and the politics of the Spanish Civil War."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Few paintings have been quite so evocative of the horror of war, particularly of the \\"civil\\" variety, than Salvador Dali's oddly titled \\"Soft Construction in Boiled Beans,\\" but with the apt parenthetical remark \\"(Premonitions of the Spanish Civil War.)\\" I referenced this painting in my review of Hugh Thomas' classic history, straightforwardly entitledThe Spanish Civil War: Revised Edition (Modern Library Paperbacks). Orwell's account is poles apart from Thomas' work, which is a scholarly one completed two decades after the war. Orwell's is \\"uptight and personal,\\" his own experiences as an English volunteer fighting on the Republican side, and was written before the war was finished. There are numerous versions extant; mine is a Harvest/HBJ book with an introduction by Lionel Trilling which is so worthwhile I believe it worth the extra effort to find a copy. I first read this book around three decades ago, and must have been in some sort of fog. I thought it was good at the time, but on the re-read, found it far more impressive and memorable.In Trilling's undated introduction, he mentions a graduate student visiting him, and saying, of Orwell: \\"He was a virtuous man.\\" As Trilling says, it was an old-fashioned expression, which he expands upon... \\"...the virtue of not being a genius, of confronting the world with nothing more than one's simple, direct, undeceived intelligence, and a respect for the powers one does have, and the work one undertakes to do\\" ... \\"He tells us that we can understand our political and social life merely by looking around us, he frees us from the need for the inside dope.\\" \\"It is hard to find personalities in the contemporary world who are analogous to Orwell. We have to look for men who have considerable intellectual power but who are not happy in the institutionalized life of intellectuality...\\" Trilling goes on to say that unfortunately, when the book was first published, it sold poorly, was remaindered, and was not even published at all in America.So, the virtuous man of action, with a political conscious, saw the rise of Fascism in the \`30's, its various victories, and the inaction of the democracies in the face of this threat, and decided to do more than whine and complain at the local coffee house or pub. He arrived in Spain in the winter of \`36-'37. A lover of Spain, he wryly notes that he managed to see only a small section of the northwest corner, Catalonia, with Barcelona as its capital. He received his \\"training\\" at the Lenin Barracks, which, like so much military training, does nothing to prepare you for the actual conditions of war. Among other matters, there was no weapon training... due to shortages, all the weapons were at the front! (Though Orwell does not explicitly say this, the shortage was due to the arms embargo that France and England had imposed on the Republicans... not wanting to get involved, and all that... while Germany and Italy supplied Franco with bountiful arms. The Soviet Union did supply the Republicans... on a selective basis, and Orwell does describe that).Orwell is sent to the front, in short order. For almost four months, four winter months, there was virtually no fighting, so one of the chief occupations was finding firewood to stay warm, and trying to keep the lice off you. He was, somewhat accidentally, assigned to a P.O.U.M unit (Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista). It was an \\"Anarchist\\" unit. Orwell provides some wonderfully lucid descriptions of the various political factions, principally the Anarchists and the Communists. The Anarchists wanted to promote the revolution, and the destruction of the existing bourgeois class order; the Communists wanted to preserve it! Yes, it seems counterintuitive now, and that is one of the beauties of Orwell's explanation. After four months at the front, Orwell has earned some leave, and returns to Barcelona, in time to witness, and even participate in the street fighting between the POUM units and the Communist-led ones. Orwell painstakingly struggles to provide an objective account of events, and then contrasts it with the outlandish versions that were \\"spun\\" in various newspapers, to conform with preconceived ideas.Orwell returned to the front in May, and was shortly thereafter shot by a sniper through the throat. He provides an almost detached, clinical description of this event, and then went on to describe the rather pathetic state of medical care of the time. He was very lucky to survive such an injury... a millimeter difference in trajectory could have been fatal. Typical of Orwell, he says that he would have been luckier still, if he had not been hit at all.As a veteran of the Vietnam war, there was another aspect of Orwell's account that really resonated. From a distance, non-participants see the war as a jumbled whole. For the participants, it really mattered - a lot - WHERE you were, and WHEN you were there. The conditions in Barcelona changed, sometimes quite significantly, from month to month. When Orwell arrived in early January, the workers were in charge, and looking too bourgeois was dangerous; when Orwell left, he was literally running from the law, due to the fact that he had been in an anarchist unit, the P.O.U.M.The fate of his former commander, the Belgian, Georges Kopp, who had so loyally fought with the P.O.U.M had to be formative for the character of the loyal horse, in Orwell's later work,Animal Farm: Centennial Edition. With the strong internecine strive, and the manpower devoted to arresting the \\"other side,\\" is it any wonder that the Republicans lost the war? 5-stars plus for Orwell's rationale account of one of man's most irrational activities."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a 20th Century classic. It captures a snapshot of the mindset of the Left at a particular point in time when the world seemed poised between a Fascist future and a Communist future, and although ultimately, even for Orwell, it was hard to tell the difference in practice between the two, the allure of Marxism never dimmed.Orwell's autobiographical story opens with his decision to abandon the neutrality of the journalistic sidelines and enter into a struggle that his class and cohort considered to be a titanic and defining moment of history. Orwell makes the leap by joining the militia of the P.O.U.M (\\"POUM\\") in Barcelona in December of 1936 not long after the Nationalist's coup had been suppressed by a coalition of leftist militias. POUM was the militia fielded by a Marxist-but-not-Communist political party/worker's movement. In the Barcelona of 1936, all of the leftist political movements, including the anarchists and the Communists had their own militias. POUM and the Anarchists of was to the \\"left\\" of the Communists among the parties supporting the Spanish Republic.Orwell is enchanted by the Barcelona of December, 1936, which he fancies to be the one place on Earth where the working class is in control. He is charmed by the fact that everyone is wearing working class clothes and the traditional religious based greetings have been replaced by sturdy revolutionary slogans.Orwell is soon on his way to the \\"front,\\" which turns out to be a short stretch of trenches near Zaragoza. From that point, Orwell's account describes the mundane reality of static warfare, with long stretches of inactivity broken by the rare activity of desultory conflict. These accounts are fascinating in describing the unromantic nature of military action generally and of the period between the World Wars, particularly. Orwell's active involvement in front line warfare ended in early 1937 when he was struck in the throat by a bullet, which threatened to leave him mute for the rest of his life, although he did recover. Orwell was then subjected to the coarse ministrations of the Spanish medical service and returned to Barcelona in time for the suppression of the POUM by the Communists.Orwell has two sections of his book where he describes the internecine conflict between the leftist parties. Orwell is frankly apologetic for these sections, which he describes as being distasteful and undoubtedly not of great interest to his reader. In this he is entirely wrong because they make up the most interesting and insightful parts of his book. Orwell describes the influence of the Russian NKVD over the Republic, and explains the Communist parties' crackdown on the leftist elements of the left as being to serve the interest of Russia, which did not want France distracted by a radical Spain at its back when Russia was interested in seeing a strong France focused on Germany. Orwell then describes the crackdown by the Communists and Republic that resulted in the rounding up of POUM officers and soldiers and their internment in Communist irregular jails. Orwell found himself having to sleep in the streets to avoid arrest and internment, a fate that many international volunteers found themselves in and from which they never emerged.One of the most chilling things about these sections is Orwell's seeming acceptance of these actions by the Communists. Orwell clearly thinks that the liquidation of the POUM was a waste of effort and cruel, but he doesn't seem outraged by it in the same way that he feels outraged by the Fascists who were doing nothing essentially different. It is as if right thinking Leftists understood that totalitarianism was inevitable and so long as it had a \\"worker's\\" flavor, it was acceptable on some level. Orwell seems to have been more outraged by the Communist's reactionary policy that favored the bourgeoisie than by the fact that the Communists were totalitarian thugs. Obviously, Orwell's Catalonian experience eventually made him distrustful of Communists and condemnatory of the totalitarian mindset, as can be seen in his later works.Orwell's descriptions of Spain and his off-hand description of the anti-Catholicism of the Leftist is also interesting. Orwell constantly belittles the Spanish for their \\"manana\\" attitude and their disorganization. He also notes how every Catholic church he sees in Republican territory has been burned, vandalized and/or turned into a latrine. This last observation seems to leave him with no concerns for the civil rights of Catholics, but, rather, it seems that his latent British prejudice against Catholicism and Spain combine to make the desecration of churches appear almost appropriate.Orwell's description of his military service at times seems to be a clich&eacute; from either World War II military movies showing Brits keeping a \\"stiff upper lip\\" or Monty Python. He describes ducking from a bullet in his first action and the experience of being shot in such a way that he seems amazed that he was human - imagine ducking from a bullet! How unBritish! This effect was heightened by the audiobook version I was listening to, where the narrator's voice seemed perfect to play the \\"British twit\\" role in a Monty Python skit. The reading, however, was clear and interesting.\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a fascinating window into a slice of the Spanish Civil War and the mindset of people on the Left prior to the World War II."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],E={key:0},W={key:1};function B(s,a,n,c,r,i){const u=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const O=d(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-626ca976"]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/52.md","filePath":"people/52.md"}'),q={name:"people/52.md"},M=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(O)]))}});export{z as __pageData,M as default};
