If you are gonna buy this book, it is the best thing you are going to do. This book is the greatest of all the criminal and courtroom books i have ever read. This book is the perfect example of the ingenuity and imagination of its author, Erle Stanley Gardner. It is due to books like this, that he is listed in the Guiness Book Of World Records as the highest selling author of all times. I personally give this book, the highest rating possible."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"The Case of the Silent PartnerMildreth Faulkner owns a small flower shop. Her competitor, Harry Peavis, bought up a few shares in her small corporation. Now he wants to buy up control. Mildreth calls Perry Mason's office for an appointment, then visits her invalid sister Carlotta and her husband Bob. Chapter 2 explains how this nightclub with a PRIVATE door runs a racket. The witness, Esther Dilmeyer, is poisoned by candy but is found in time. Mildreth suspects Bob has given up Carlotta's shares in the corporation. There is another roller-coaster ride of a story where events pop-up as a surprise twist. Complications arise from page to page, chapter to chapter, yet the storyline stays simple to follow.In Chapter 5 Mason visits the nightclub owner's cabin, only to find the police and newspaper reporters covering his murder. Lynk was dead quite a while (the coagulation of blood and rigor mortis). Now the question is who did it from the list of suspects, or an as yet unknown person. Chapter 6 tells how a suspect could refuse to answer questions based on constitutional rights. Lieutenant Tragg plays with Mildreth like a cat with a mouse, and gets her admission (Mason represents her sister Carlotta). Mason points out that husbands and wives are more likely to kill each other than a stranger (Chapter 9). Chapter 13 explains why a claimant in a court of equity must have clean hands; illegal means, entrapment, fraud, or oppression disqualify a suit. Mason learns of facts that lead to the questioning of a witness, and the truth comes out to free his client. Mildreth recovers the missing stock and keeps her business. This all takes place in two fast-paced days. One item dates this novel: a woman wearing \\"light woolen stockings\\" (Chapter 3)."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"a client calls for a will and a howling dog . the next day he runs away with his neighbors wife leaving behind the CORPSE of her husband and perry mason in a very embarrising position.or did he? must read . on of the best gardners book."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"Well plotted, and a VERY unexpected end. a must read"},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"Fans of Gardner's Perry Mason stories will quickly recognize that this was one of the first in the long and delightful series of stories featuring the dynamic attorney. There are also references to the economic depression that had enveloped the United States and the world, further serving to date the story in the minds of the knowledgeable reader.At this point the development of the Mason, Street and Drake characters is still in the early stages; Mason has a rough and hard edge and the two primary adversaries, police Lieutenant Tragg and District Attorney Hamilton Burger have yet to appear. Mason is very bold in working along and beyond the border of ethical and legal boundaries, a point that he acknowledges to both Street and Drake. The relationship between Mason and Street is one of affection, yet Street open criticizes Mason's tactics, something that is rarely repeated.The story itself is a modification of the episode of Sherlock Holmes where the key point is what the dog did not do. In this case, the dog supposedly howls but then later does not. This is a key point in the story and like so many others, when it is revealed the conclusion is obvious. Modern readers will be appalled at the racial slurs regarding the Chinese cook as well as the hints of his primitive mental capacity. The best way to deal with these things is to appreciate how far our society has progressed in this area and read on."},{"Title":"The Case of the Howling Dog (Perry Mason Mystery, Pocket Book 116)","review":"First published in 1934, The Case of the Howling Dog was the fourth entry in Erle Stanley Gardner's long-running series featuring Perry Mason.At this point, Gardner was still in the process of establishing the formula that he would adhere to once the series hit its stride. Lieutenant Tragg, the intelligent and sympathetic homicide detective, and Hamilton Burger, the D.A. who would become Mason's principal adversary had not yet been introduced. The police department is still represented by the oafish Sergeant Holcomb, who wouldn't recognize a clue if it bit him in the backside. The D.A.'s office is represented by an assistant D.A., Claude Drumm who immediately falls into every trap that Mason so cleverly baits for him.Della Street, the faithful and adoring secretary, Paul Drake, the reliable detective, and Perry Mason himself are still evolving into the characters they would ultimately become. Mason is a bit rougher around the edges than the suave attorney that most crime fiction readers would recognize, and at this stage of the game he's much more willing to severely bend, if not actually break the law in the interest of serving what he sees as the greater good.As is often the case in this series, the plot becomes almost hopelessly convoluted: A man comes to see Mason about his neighbor's howling dog and about writing a will. Complications ensue.Suffice it to say that there will be a murder. Inevitably, Mason's client will be the prime suspect, and inevitably the case against the client will appear to be open and shut. As always, the D. A.'s office will be salivating at the chance to finally beat Mason after suffering so many ignominious defeats at his hands. And of course, as always Perry will pull the rabbit out of the hat and save the day at the very end.Obviously, this story is a bit dated and is clearly a product of its times, but it's still a fun read and an opportunity to see Perry Mason and these other characters in their formative stages."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"i don't usually like these types of books but just knowing about other people's stories kinda helped. :)"},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"I just saw you on ABC.

This book's banal assertions come from authors who have been pampered and seem to have faced little adversity in their lives.Finding your dream- it's true that there are too many choices available now. But there's another reality, it's called 'outsourcing'. The rise of educated former 3rd world countries with wages at least 1/2 of ours means that there will be less high paying jobs. And nowhere is it mentioned that the 'glamour' jobs require paying higher dues.

I always thought that I would be in a totally different position by 28 than I am now. I never expected to hit some road blocks and to encounter the difficulties that I encountered. To address my concerns, I was just browsing around Amazon typing different phrases related to emerging adulthood and this book popped up. I searched through the table of contents and realized that this book was perfect for me because it showed me that there are other people out there who are in my situation and are asking the same questions about life in your twenty's that I was.This book is a collection of stories from 20 and 30 somethings about different aspects of their \\"Quarterlife-Crisis.\\" The book is not meant to give you an action plan to address your specific crisis. The purpose of the book, I think, is to show you that you are not alone in your concerns. By reading all the different stories you will feel comfortable in knowing that there are other people who are going through the same things you are going through and that you can succeed just like they did. This book will relieve a lot of anxiety and motivate you.This is more of a motivational book than a self-help book. I always thought that I was a total loser for not being more successful than some other people my age. I am now motivated more than ever to make my life better and achieve my dreams because this book has helped me to see that your best days are really ahead of you; you just have to take the first step and make the appropriate changes in your life. You can't predict your life but you can do many things to make it the life that you want.Like I said, I'm only 28 so I can't talk about how life in my 30's is going to be. My biggest concern before reading this book was that I felt like I didn't do as much or accomplish as much as I should have in my 20's both socially and academically and that this would somehow scar me for the rest of my life. I can honestly say that after reading this book, I think I am worrying too much about things that very well might end up being trivial by the time I am 35. I'm focusing on changing the things I can and focusing less on the things I cannot.The book itself is very easy to read and the language-style is very easy to understand for 20-30 somethings. The book is broken down into five different sections with a total of 25 chapters. Each chapter contains about five individual stories that are each about two pages in length. The reading is engaging and the book is definitely a page-turner till the end. Honestly every question addressed in this book applied to me and I think that will be the same for most people. There were only one or two entries that I could not relate to. As an added bonus, the section on relationships really is like its own little dating guide. It also answered some questions which I thought I was the only one asking. It helped me to see that everybody goes through ups and downs in relationships and finding new relationships. It reinforced the idea that you don't have to compare your life to every other person your age and that there is no deadline for getting married.Overall, I really liked this book and I am going to keep it on my bookshelf. The author has another book titled \\"Quarterlife Crisis\\" and I was told that you did not need to read that title to appreciate this book. If you are in your 20's or 30's and you are not happy with where your life is right now or you have some doubts or concerns about getting older, this book is for you and you will benefit from it.I'll give it five stars."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"Haven't I heard this stuff before? \\"Conquering Your QLC\\" is pretty much just a repackaging of \\"The Quarterlife Crisis.\\" \\"The QLC\\" is a great book, but if you already have a copy, don't bother buying \\"Conquering.\\"I think what is really needed is something that helps twentysomethings get to solutions - not something that points out the problems that were already the subject of another book.How can I get a refund for \\"Conquering Your QLC?\\""},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"As far as the content and the language in the book is concerned, there's nothing extraordinary about it. Its basically a scrapbook from a bunch of 20-30 somethings who have been thro' the quarter life crisis.Having said that, I found this book extraordinary, because right from the first chapter, I could totally relate to the stories. The way the chapters were compiled, I found that by the time I finished a chapter, I would ask myself lot of questions. The chapters were short enough to be interesting but long enough to be beneficial. Each chapter inspired me to think about my own experiences on the topic, and how I handled them. Whichever way I handled them, the chapters make clear that its okay since many other people have been thro' the exact same thing. It also made me understand why I made certain choices in life and which of those choices have led me into a 'not so ideal situation'. This is very helpful because, I can be sure that I don't make the same choices again in life.I also want to mention that this book is not for everybody. If you can't relate to it, then it wouldn't be much useful or interesting. I would highly recommend sampling a chapter. I found myself skipping through some of the chapters, which just weren't relevant to me.

It's not easy being in your 20s. When you leave school, especially college, you have this ideal that your life is going to just work itself out. You'll land a great job, meet the person of your dreams, and buy the home you've always wanted. Needless to say, it gets you down when you're still single, can't afford living on your own, and your job isn't what you thought it would be.Many of the chapter titles had the same questions and statements that I've pondered. These are the chapters that meant the most to me:- What if I don't know what I want?- When do I let go of my dream?- Why am I having trouble meeting people?- How important are sparks?- How do I weight doing something I love versus making money?- What if I feel like I'm \\"stuck\\"?- How do I stop comparing myself to other people?- How do I stop feeling so overwhelmed?However, I didn't find this book very helpful beyond the \\"I'm not alone\\" factor. Sure these are questions I've asked and it's nice to read that other people are going through the same thing. But there's very little in the way of advice for dealing with these concerns. The best advice came from the contributors (make lists, imagine this scenario, ask yourself these questions, etc.). Robbins seemed to summarize the contributors' advice in the chapter conclusions in a hopes to claim credit for the idea."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"What a fantastic book!

I am in my Quarterlife Crisis now. I identify directly with several of the mentors. I read the book in 2 days, and I'm so happy I did.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"The ambition of the book is great. I think the questions posed in the book are pertinent and worth answering for a generation that is facing an entirely new landscape without pre-built tools for dealing with it. She starts out strong with her statement of purpose, but with each new chapter you feel a little bit more disappointed as they continually fall short of being useful.The book has a lot of feelings in it. There are stories from many \\"mentors\\" who have endured tragic or hectic circumstances and much of what they have to say revolves around how they *felt* at the time and how they *feel* now. Some of it is, of course, practical, like \\"I went to see a therapist\\" which could actually be practical advice for many people in similar situations, but most of it is really very abstract and touchy-feely.The attempt by the author and the mentors to deliver difficult solutions for difficult problems is surely a Herculean task and I am appreciative for that much, but I don't feel that I would derive any real value from the book were I having a quarterlife crisis. I suppose that's a large bias that I should flag: I don't feel plagued by any of the questions posed in the book, so it may simply be a case of not falling in the target audience.I don't think that's exactly it though, but rather more due to my ruthlessly logical nature. I appreciate the emotion involved with traumatic events, but, first, most of the events described in the book don't strike me as traumatic per se, but rather just frustrating. Second, I am loath to accept advice such as \\"just believe in yourself and eventually your dreams will come true\\". That advice was dispensed more than once in the book and seemed to be compatible with the book's overarching theme. I like concrete advice.The truth is that there is absolutely no guarantee that you'll accomplish any of your dreams. The phrase \\"get rich or die trying\\" has more truth in it than this entire book when it comes to accomplishing real success.That said, anyone who feels emotionally overwhelmed by something like a quarterlife crisis might find solace (comforting though possibly useless) in this book."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"After reading other reviews of this book, I decided to check it out for myself. Either they read a different book than me or they didn't read it all.While Ms. Robbins' writing form is adequate this book provides very little insight. Some of the personal stories she re-tells are interesting reads but there is never any real connection given or application made to give assistance within one's own life.Flat-out, this book does not make you think.As a compilation of stories, I'd give it three stars but for it's claim to provide help with this stage of our lives, one star is the only fair designation."},{"Title":"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book)","review":"\\"Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice From Twentysomethings WhoHave Been There and Survived.\\" Was great!

Story/crisis problem evaluation and boom way to counqer.It's a fast and fluid read too. Who has time to poll 100 people and analyze and got work on a method of conquering the problem. Great to see that a lot of really smart people out there having the same stupid problems as me and no just because people tell you SUCESSFUL smart people have some of the same problems and questions as you won't believe it till you read some of this fascinating but totally realistic case studies! * Also you things improve for people then go bad again Yin Yang up down but then they tell you how they deal with it in their narrative or you get the answer in the conquer portion of the book. There are also some excellent tips that you get fast. So if you don't have time to read huge volumes or go to a shrink or a discussion group because hey a lot of people can't do that. Read this I think this book and it's self improvement technique are going to be a new way kind of like the reality TV of self help but sophisticated. The realism and real stories are dramatic not boring but not made up or phony either. In fact you feel a lot emotions relating to all these people- YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK AND HOW THEY CONQUER AND SURVIVE!!There are parts of the book that get you down because it's reality which can be scary. However in the end things seem to work out for people in the case studies you get empowered. No need for Dr. Phil. You look at the case studies your self. You se countless issues and problems then points of view then points of view on how to conquer them. People find realistic fulfillment realist problems real answers for you to draw ideas on ho to as the author says \\"conquer\\". Stories are of interesting people like you the reader and there are so many people that reader will have to fit with several types. I felt sorry for the artsy types who were struggling.

Like a mid-life crisis, a quarterlife crisis occurs when you don't know what you want to do with your life, and amazingly, our generation seems to be experiencing this angst pretty early in life.My own conclusions from this book are very simple: we have failed again and again to give the best and brightest individuals in this country incentives to pursue what they really care about, and to take audacious risks. The result is a period of paralyzing uncertainty following the undergraduate years, which for some leads to the decision to attend graduate school, which can often just plunge them into even more immobilizing student loan debt (without ever really solving the core problem of self-realization).Ms. Robbins presents amazing stories of twentysomethings struggling with this existential anxiety, and relays the sensible advice that every school should be teaching its students: take risks, and don't be afraid to fail, because failure on one endeavor is perhaps the very best education for the next.

The treatment of nearfield acoustic holography was scattered all over the scientific literature about acoustics.

The author immediately gives the acoustic wave equation and Euler's equation in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), respectively, followed by a derivation of the latter. Other books more instructively derive Euler's equation first and then give the constitutive relation (-dp/dt = k*div(v), were p is the pressure, k the fluid compressibility, v the velocity field, and div() the divergence operator), whence the wave equation can be simply derived.Further on, in Section (2.5), in the expression for the time-averaged acoustic intensity, the author does not state the assumption that Eq. (2.16) holds for harmonic fields (cf. Jacobsen, [...]), instead hand waving that \\"the one-half results results from the time average process\\". Further, the symbols p(omega) and v(omega) in this equation actually represent the complex amplitudes of the harmonic pressure and velocity fields, and not their Fourier transforms as the notation suggests.In short, parts of chapter 2 are imprecise to the verge of being erroneous."},{"Title":"Monet (Famous Artists)","review":"These books are excellent for elementary students.

I ate it for lunch on a flight from Paris to New York, 2 days before the destruction of the World Trade Towers, amazed now at how relevant it was and how necessary it is now to evaluate our history of religious aggression in a forum ostensibly without bias, collusion or any undercurrent of abhorrence directed towards either camp. Brutton achieves this. A Captain's Mandate leaves room for discussion. It's one man's story. It's also the story we all have to consider. Philip Brutton's voice is clear and original. Read up on your WWII era history first though. This book is not for neophytes."},{"Title":"A Captain's Mandate: Palestine, 1946-48","review":"Challenged to read this book again. I did. I think this book gets very close to racism of the worst type. Certainly Jews and their religion are painted in a very bad light.The captain certainly seemed to have had a pretty interesting life in the region as he goes from one sight seeing trip to another. Little is said of his working actual tasks.Comments are frequently quoted with no factual evidence to back them up for example Jews were driven out of Egypt because of the actions of the Zionist. If so, why were Greeks also driven out at the same time!Zionist are described as bad people, Arabs generally as okay (obviously our commander missed the fun earlier when the Arabs were the main terrorist in the region) and the British were knowing, stupid and caring.When the British hang a man for resisting, that is okay when someone else hangs a British soldier, in retaliation, that is terrible and a crime. The truth is that all sides killed people.The reality is that the British in the period discussed by this captain were long past their use by date. The empire was almost over. They were trying to keep the empire alive in an area populated by people that did not want them. Instead of just saying, we fought for the empire, we get these rather silly arguments that the British were right as the UN solution was wrong because it was undemocratic. If so, what were the British there at all because the local did not vote them in? If Britain was so concerned about democracy why not do something about it long before they left!At the end, he shows how important it was for the average British soldier to walked out of a mess with no regrets except that there reputation should not be damaged."},{"Title":"Sweet Fierce Fires","review":"It was sexist, unbelieveble, melodramatic and totally unromantic at the beginning.

The pens covered are the crow quill and the technical pen.There are many step by step examples which are easy to follow along. The instructions are concise and well explained. There are the usual lessons on hatching but they are short. The book's method of teaching is by getting to the drawing demonstrations quickly, getting you to practice the techniques learned instantly.A good variety of tips and techniques are discussed, and that encourages experimentation.

Many techniques and exercises for building up skill are laid out and integrated into useful units that can be worked on in series or independently. However, the art style of Borgman is more like 1960's/1970's pamphlet and encyclopedia art. The pen work is loose and imprecise and the pencil work is quite sloppy.I ordered this book because I wanted to learn to be a technical and precise illustrator, but the sloppiness and outdated art style contained in this book do not help me much.I will have to send it back."},{"Title":"The Arthurian Book of Days: The Greatest Legend in the World Retold Throughout the Year","review":"A beautifully and classically illustrated book that interlaces the fragments of the Arthurian saga.

No.5 charts the dark side of the battles, primarily concerned with Count Dooku and Quinlan Vos. Deep, rich artwork, and some great writing from STAR WARS regular John Ostrander. A great read and essential for fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Light and Dark (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Vol. 4)","review":"Another great Clone Wars graphic novel. Only this time, it's starring Quinlan Vos. Lot's of Clone Wars action, but this book is good for other reasons besides the plot. I may have forgotten to mention in my other reviews of TPB's, so I'll say it here. EXCELLENT ART! Nice explosions, battles, and the characters all look like their movie counterparts. That goes for every Clone Wars graphic novel. All I can say now about the Clone Wars series is that it keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"Light and Dark (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Vol. 4)","review":"This volume collects the last two issues of the Jedi subseries, Aayla Secura and Dooku, alone with Republic 54 & 63. Most center on the character of Quinlan Vos, Aayla's former master.The art of the comic is excellent, just what I would have expected from Duursema. Ostrander's story is good, but unfortunately suffers a bit from having the Aayla story thrust into the middle of what primarily focuses on Vos.Granted, one of the reasons for Aayla's mission to Deveron relates to Vos's story, but only tangetally. I guess I would have rather seen it packaged in with one of the other collections.Perhaps the best surprise of the volume is the reappearance of Jedi-killing bounty hunter Aurra Sing. We finally see that she did recover from her encounter with A'Sharad Hett, and is just as deadly as ever.As I said, it's probably one of the better Clone Wars graphic novels, but the inclusion of Aayla's story detracts a bit from the overall plot of Vos's apparent treason."},{"Title":"Light and Dark (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Vol. 4)","review":"Loved the story, loved the added depth to many of the characters. But the art-work was forumalic and though well executed, really nothing special."},{"Title":"Light and Dark (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Vol. 4)","review":"This collection starts off with the Republic issue 54 in which Agen Kolar is sent to bring back Quinlan Vos despite Vos trying to go undercover. It continues with the one-shot Jedi - Aayla Secura, in which Quinlan Vos is trying to be a double-agent for the Republic and infiltrate Dooku's ranks all while Aayla Secura and some other Jedi lead an undercover operation to find a pirate base. However, this pits Aayla against the evil Aurra Sing in lightsaber combat! The book continues with Jedi - Dooku in which Quinlan Vos is still making an attempt to deceive Count Dooku and gain his trust by infiltrating his ranks and become a lieutenant. This draws Vos closer and closer to the dark side until even those who know of Vos's plan feel he's finally become what he's trying to be disguised as. The final inclusion is Republic issue 63 in which Dooku gains Vos's trust and sends him to kill a Senator in a test. However, how far will Quinlan go to not blow his cover?This book jumps around a bit with issue numbers but goes with one continuous story. Vos is obviously treading along the path of the Dark Side and it's hard to tell if he's faking it for his cover or really embracing it. I think it's a little bit of both.It's nice to see more of Dooku and the way he conducts himself to the Jedi and the art and writing are very well done. This is a fantastic series and my favorite of the Star Wars ones so far. Here's to volume 5!!"},{"Title":"Light and Dark (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Vol. 4)","review":"Interesting view of Count Dooku in this book. Part of a series and as previously recommended, get all of them and then you will see how far Dooku really has fallen to the dark side.

This was a great read. The fact that it focused on characters besides the main ones we met in Episodes 1, 2 & 3 was satisfying for those of us who hunger for more Star Wars insight.

In the second part the memoirs of Rev. John Steele he tells the story of the Yosemite-Mono Lake Paiutes who's territory was forever changed after miners flooded the town of Columbia California around the 1850s during the California Gold Rush. The town of Columbia was located in Tuolumne County in the Sierra foothills. Steele describes in great detail the traditions of the Yosemite Paiute Indian people in the Tuolumne area. Their customs, their dances, their system of justice before Kroeber, Merriam and others went there decades later. By then the Paiutes had been pushed out and they were replaced by Indians who were brought in from the valley floor to work in the mines for goldminers. Paiutes still traveled between Tuolumne, Yosemite and Hetch Hetchy and Mono Lake. They were the Indians of the high Sierra Nevadas. In fact Chief Tenaya was himself a Paiute born at Mono Lake and his band was made up of mainly Mono Paiutes. To read this, people should also get Lafayette Bunnell's \\"Discovery of the Yosemites 1851, and the war that led to that event\\". One of two people who met Chief Tenaya and wrote about him. That he was the founder of the Paiute Colony of Ahwahnee and the leader of the famed Ahwahneechee Indians also called the Yosemites by the Miwoks."},{"Title":"Echoes of the Past About California and In Camp and Cabin","review":"Edited by Milo Milton Quaife, secretary and editor of the Burton Historical Collection. This volume contains the recitals of the experiences of two migrants from the Middle West to California, John Bidwell and John Steele.

While Steele's is a realistic and typical portrait of the common run of miners' experiences and affords an excellent picture of the hazards and thrills, the joys and disappointments."},{"Title":"The hour of the gate","review":"Beyond doubt the best of Foster's Spellsinger Series. It brings together some of the most memorable characters you could hope to meet in any Science fiction or fantasy novel and mixes them all together in a story that takes your breath away.Magic and mayhem,fire-breathing marxist dragons and a voyage into the very mouth of hell itself lead you gently (!) toward a finaly that culminates with an almighty war.Journey along with Jon-Tom, Mudge, Talea and others as they are forced to take a journey from which they may not return!Despite being part of the Spellsinger series, this novel could quite possibly be a book unto it own. Enough action and adventure to fill any palatte, this is one book you MUST read."},{"Title":"The hour of the gate","review":"This isn't so much the second Spellsinger book as the second half of the first one -- it starts minutes after the first book ends, and presents the second half of the quest.While Spellsinger was about the experience of ordinary life in the Wizards' World, Hour of the Gate shows us the extraordinary -- having crossed the Warmlands on their quest to prevent the Plated Folk from conquering the world, the heroes now set off through legendary lands in search of allies in the coming war. What they find is by turns awe-inspiring and terrifying, and Foster shows a great talent for minimal descriptions that evoke strong images.As before, we're primarily seeing Clothahump's mighty deeds through Jon-Tom's eyes, and as such there isn't much actual spellsinging. Nevertheless, this book strongly captures the power and majesty that fantasy worlds can have.As I noted in my review of Spellsinger, though, this is the last time that Foster takes his world seriously. As the series progresses, it shifts from being dark fantasy with a light touch to, by the end, the level of a knock-knock joke. If you're a completist who must read every book in a series, you may not want to get started on this one -- it's too depressing seeing where it goes."},{"Title":"The hour of the gate","review":"The duology of the first two books in the Spellsinger series, &quot;Spellsinger&quot; and &quot;Hour of the Gate&quot;, by far eclipses the rest of the series. This book, with its stirring love stories, fantastic sights, wonderful characters, and epochal war, deserves to be counted as one of the classics of science fiction. And how many books count as their main characters a Brooklyn bat and a talking otter"},{"Title":"The hour of the gate","review":"\\"The Hour of the Gate\\" is the second volume in the Spellsinger adventure about Jon-Tom, summoned to another world to help fight a growing threat to the lives of all sentient animals and possibly his own world.Back cover of book:Invasion of the Plated Folk!The elders of Polastrindu watched in horror as Clothahump, wizard and turtle, spun visions of the coming invasion. Finally the Plated Folk had a magic potent enough to penetrate Zaryt's Teeth and the warmlands, igniting a devastating war between the species. The wizard and his earthly helper, Jonathan Thomas Meriweather, grad student and rock guitarist, must undertake the voyage into enemy territory in search of allies against the evil hordes from beyond.So Jon-Tom, Clothahump, Mudge the Otter, flame-haired Talea and their motley crew set sail on a suicide mission down the treacherous river that winds through the subterranean lair of Massawrath, Mother of Nightmares, across Helldrink through a tunnel of cold flame to the center of the earth. It is a perilous journey few have attempted, and none have ever survived.Now the peace-loving student must become a soldier and crusader, fighting with sword and song. For strumming his otherworldly duar, he is the maker of magic, his music conjuring configurations, transforming Jon Meriweather into theSpellsingerEnd back cover of book.Since the story picks up where the prior volume ended, combining the two would be welcome. The earthly education in an alien landscape fashions a fun fantasy hero of Jon-Tom. The battles and descriptions aren't deep but friendly for younger readers with some of the creatures encountered as rather creative. The characters aren't limited to unaccented English but have a range including Australian and Brooklyn, New York. Understanding a written accent can be more difficult than hearing it and the rare vulgar word (not beyond a modern schoolyard) should be noted.As a fan of the classical, rock, and heavy metal music genres, I find the magic Jon-Tom creates with his duar exciting since I believe a well-constructed song can affect people with its intensity and power in a primal aspect.Thank you."},{"Title":"The hour of the gate","review":"Having delivered there message of impending doom to the mammals of the world, now Jon-tom and his friends seek out the help of the weavers. along the way Jon-tom begins to learn about his new found talent of spellsinging, making magic through music.

He moves from one event to another smoothly without getting too carried away by the minutia (like the later books of the Wheel of Time series did).

Needless to say, this is expensive and inconvenient. I also like to use passages from the book in my teaching. There are two phrases from Dickens novels that are included in the &quot;Popular Follies of Great Cities&quot; chapter, and I like to point these out to my students. The first is &quot;Walker!&quot; which is the reply of the boy on the street to Scrooge's request that he buy the big goose in the butcher's window; the second is &quot;Who are you?&quot; which is used by Bentley Drummle to sneer at Pip in GREAT EXPECTATIONS. I used to use a hard to read photocopy from Mackay's book, but now I can select portions for class use and run them through my printer. I can even offer entire chapters (even, occasionally, the entire book on disk) to students who express more interest in learning about the remarkable &quot;madness of crowds.&quot; I cannot say enough to thank whomever is responsible for this marvelous innovation!

I guess as Betsy got older she lost a lot of her appeal for me. While I cherish the ones when they were in their elementary years. I found this one a real bore. It took me a week to get through it and that was forcing myself.The character Betsy for me was kind of silly. I could not relate to her. I understand she took the trip to get over losing Joe but she could never really stop thinking about him.Ms. Lovelace did a very good job of descibing the countries which a love to read about. One thing I can say is that this book made me want to go visit Venice.Most fans of the series would love this but to me I guess I was not really in the mood.I rate this a 2/5.FCC Disclaimer: I borrowed this from my local library.

Tacy and the crowd, let alone the Ray family, make no physical appearance, and Betsy suffers a bit as a character without the familiar suppporting cast.

I read all the Betsy-Tacy books, and though I definitely felt the absence of Tacy and the Crowd in this book, it was interesting to watch Betsy's development and growth during her year abroad. Her independence and spunk even away from home are amazing to behold, yet at times she gets homesick just as anyone would, so her experiences are not unrealistic. I think this book shows a very important time of growth in Betsy's life.

And when I went on a gondola ride, Betsy and her Marco were in the gondola that floated by on the other side of the Grand Canal.

The series has at least one book that anyone of any age can relate to. 10-year-olds will love &quot;Over the big Hill,&quot; high-schoolers will love the books about when Betsy was attending Deep Valley High, etc. And it doesn't end there! Even if you're not the age that Betsy was in one of the books, you can still love all of them! Maud has a way of capturing real feelings and expiriences--even bad ones--and turning them into works of art. The &quot;Betsy-Tacy&quot; series really is a work of art, even if it was painted with a pen, not a paint brush."},{"Title":"Betsy and the Great World (Betsy-Tacy Ser.)","review":"In &quot;Betsy and the Great World&quot; Betsy sets sail to Europe. At first she is terribly homesick, but she soon makes some friends (did you ever see Betsy without friends?!) and settles down to writing stories. Some readers miss the Crowd in this book. I did, too, but Betsy certainly hasn't changed just bacuase she isn't in her usual setting of Deep Valley. She's still Betsy, down to the last hair on her head that is NOT curly!"},{"Title":"Betsy and the Great World (Betsy-Tacy Ser.)","review":"I was brought up on Betsy-Tacy, but just recently read the last two books in the series. This book is great at describing the feelings and evolution of a girl becoming independent. The beginning and ending are both excellent, with the detailed description of her experience in college providing a good bridge from the high school books. I love her romance with Joe, the recurring appearance of the famous writer, Ms. Whitaker, and the depiction of England at the very start of the war."},{"Title":"Betsy and the Great World (Betsy-Tacy Ser.)","review":"This is the eighth book in the Betsy-Tacy series, which follows Betsy Ray from kindergarten to marriage at the turn of the 20th century. Betsy, now in her early twenties with two years of college behind her, finally realizes her dream of traveling through Europe. The story unfolds in four main acts/settings: the voyage across the Atlantic, study and friendship in Munich, romance in Venice, and the inauguration of war in London. Artfully and intimately told, the story is also rich with cultural details that I appreciate more now than I did reading this book as a child: Betsy's excitement about gaining weight, her careful circumspection with regard to proper ladylike behavior, her sweet and chaste romances - all of this combined with a zest for life and an indefatigably adventuresome spirit."},{"Title":"Betsy and the Great World (Betsy-Tacy Ser.)","review":"I was a bit disappointed when I opened this book up, and read the first sentence. I didn't think it was right of Mrs. Lovelace to just skip college, to think we missed it! So, I had to imagine college and Bob, and the relationship between Betsy and Joe.Not only do you miss out on what happens in college, but it's somewhat odd to be going from high-school Betsy, to grown woman. I kept on wondering why there wasn't at least one book made about Betsy going to college.Although I said this, I would still suggest reading this book, it's a great book, and Betsy doesn't change too much. But through the whole book I felt weird. It didn't matter how many friends and 'crowds' Betsy made, or how many admirers she gained. The original crowd just wasn't there.But don't worry, Betsy is still pretty much the same, she makes friends, and there is quite a bit of romance in the book."},{"Title":"Wind and windspinners: A 'nuts and bolts' approach to wind/electric systems","review":"Probably the reason this book is unavailable is because, at the time of it's authoring, 1974, the back to the land movement was just beginning. Refugies of the sixties' battle with the establishment over the Vietnam War, and cival rights, were just beginning to flee to a simpler, hopefully better life in the country. Every idea in this book was intended for people already living on the land (thus the 'nuts and bolts approach' subtitle). The book is total How To, since an exhaustive search by Hackleman could find only two manufacturers of &quot;Windspinners,&quot; in France. The big money of the day was being invested, and still is, in the ridiculously, by comparison, inefficient propeller designs."},{"Title":"Les etes perdus: Roman (French Edition)","review":"Comme &agrave; son accoutm&eacute;e, Jean P&eacute;l&eacute;gri nous livre-l&agrave; un roman touchant, &eacute;blouissant, sans toutefois donner dans le sentimentalisme de mauvais got.Jean P&eacute;l&eacute;gri, qui s'est &eacute;teint le 24 septembre 2003, nous quitte avec ce remarquable texte.

Now I remember nothing about it, but I've wanted to read another Hersey novel every since. Written in 1944 about the Allied occupation of a coastal Italian town, the Pulitzer winner A Bell for Adano is surprisingly funny at times. Obviously Hersey is making a patriotic point and a plug for democracy with his American hero Major Victor Joppolo, whose fairness and good will contrast sharply with the corruption of the former Nazi regime. His real nemesis, though, is General Marvin--the type of bad-tempered American whose behavior Joppolo is continually having to apologize for. Joppolo has his hands full as he tries to fulfill basic needs like food and water, but he also wants to restore morale. One of his big tasks in this latter regard is to find a replacement for the town's bell, which was confiscated by the Nazis to be melted down into ammunition. Quirky Italian characters abound, from the head fisherman who refuses to set foot in a government office, to the town crier, who likes to put his own spin on proclamations. I haven't had this much fun reading about the military since I read Joseph Heller's Catch-22, which was a much more challenging read. Unlike Revolutionary Road, I think that this book has held up well over time."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This book is wonderful in its clear language and soft touch. You will instantly feel a part of the town and its inhabitants. The book tells the story of a small town in Italy occupied by the Americans at the end of WW2. It relates how the occupied village interacts with its human, caring &quot;occupier&quot;, an American army officer. Much like Corelli's Mandolin by Louis de Bernieres, this book puts a massive event in world history into focus. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This is John Hersey's wonderful \\"feel good\\" novel set in Italy during WW II. Major Victor Joppolo has been assigned senior civil affairs officer of the allied occupied town of Adano. Joppolo, an Italian-American, is a good man who only wants to do what is best for the town. He befriends the town's citizens, determines their needs, and tries to accommodate them. In addition to the major concern of getting the people fed, he learns that the town once had a bell that was rung every quarter-hour until Mussolini had it removed to be melted down for ammunition. Joppolo goes on a mission to get the bell back or replaced somehow.Of course there must be a black hat countering Joppolo's every good move, and that person is General Marvin, the dictatorial, self-important, and ultimately destructive Commander-in-Chief - obviously based on Gen. George Patton. Joppolo is willing to bend and even subvert orders to accomplish what he perceives his task to be: to bring order, decency, and democracy to the war-torn and defeated town. He succeeds marvelously, despite Marvin's interference, and receives the praises of all the Italian civilians he deals with (sometimes this is overdone just a wee bit). Hersey's Italian characters are warm and very human; especially good are the proud fisherman Tomasino and Joppolo's interpreter Giuseppe. Hersey based his novel on a short article he'd written for LIFE magazine, which told of a visit he'd made to the American military governor at Licata, Italy, in 1943. The book is entertaining and life-affirming - interesting for a war novel."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"another 5 star vote for a great book.

Thanks for your support..."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"In early 1944, the United States of America was completely engaged in World War II. Although national confidence and resolve were high that America would win the war, there were still many months of hard, costly fighting ahead. Most Americans supported the war effort, and considered the conflict to be justified, although the desire that it be over was virtually universal. Nonetheless, some Americans may have questioned why the U.S. was even involved in what to them seemed to be a \\"European\\" war, or a war in Asian theaters which many people had never even heard of.John Hersey was a war correspondent. Released in February, 1944, his work, \\"A Bell for Adano,\\" was a fictional creation based on his own experiences and observations during the war. In it, he tells in a simple, often humorous manner the story of U.S. Army Major Victor Joppolo, the son of immigrants, who is assigned the task of governing a small Italian town during its American occupation. In doing so, Hersey portrays everything America -- and Americans -- were fighting for in the war: to make the world a better place through democracy. Early in the book, in an address to the towns officials, Joppolo tries to explain to them that it is their job to serve the community, not master it. \\"What makes a man master of another man?\\" he asks. \\"It is that he pays him for his work. Who pays the men in the government? The people do, for they pay the taxes . . . \\"In telling the story of Joppolo and the town of Adano, Hersey gives the reader a glimpse into the characters and personalities of typical American servicemen. Some are admirable, such as the Navy's Lieutenant Livingston. Some are honest but flawed, such as the military police commander, Captain Purvis. Some are difficult to embrace, such as General Marvin. One of the strengths of this work is that Hersey did not put make-up over their warts and flaws, but allows the reader to see their shortcomings. It is one of the more subtle aspects of the moral that the American system of democracy works despite the Americans themselves.As the United States now moves well into the 21st Century, it is more than worth a gaze back to 1944, to use that glimpse to try and determine if we are still on a course our grand-parents and great-grand-parents would approve. This, for me, is the true contemporary value of the 1945 Pulitzer winner, and why it is still a worthwhile and relevant read nearly 75 years after its release.\\"A Bell for Adano\\" is a delightful and quick read that will linger in your thoughts long after you have closed the back cover. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This Pulitzer Prize-winning tale recounts the experiences of Major Victor Joppolo, an Italian-American officer put in charge of administering the American-occupied village of Adano, Italy in the final days of WWII. Joppolo's ostensible mission is to rebuild the village's infrastructure in the wake of the war and the toll exacted by decades of facist rule. However, Joppolo understands that he has been charged with a less tangible but even more important duty: to demonstrate the advantages of American governance, justice, and empathy and win over the hearts/minds of the townspeople. To this end, he devotes himself to locating a replacement for a beloved and deeply-mourned town bell looted by the facists. I admit I quickly fell in love with Hersey's beguiling characters, his courtly prose, and his gentle but penetrating eye for irony.It is easy - perhaps too easy - to label the author's depiction of characters in the novel as stereotypical, and his depiction of Joppolo's attitude towards the citizens of Adano as condescending and paternalistic. At least part of the problem is that the charm of Hersey's prose tends to mask the extent to which his characters embody both virtue and vice. Joppolo's aide-de-camp cleverly humiliates a former facist official up to no good, but his intentions towards the women in the town are unabashedly crude. General Martin delights in liberating Italy from wicked facists, but thinks nothing of brutally slaughtering a donkey belonging to a peasant, simply because he has the temerity to get in his way. Even the actions of Joppolo are depicted as a recognizably human balance between idealism (believing in the superiority of the \\"American Way\\") and vanity (wanting to win the love/admiration of the townspeople), loyalty (to his country) and disloyalty (to his wife).In short, I believe that perceived anachronisms in this tale may accurately represent actual anachronisms that existed at this fascinating moment in U.S. history. It was a time when average villagers in small rural European towns genuinely were unsophisticated, when America genuinely did feel a paternalistic responsibility towards the rest of the world; a time when Americans embraced cultural stereotypes as a way of celebrating their country's diversity, and when American servicemen saw nothing hypocritical in idealizing their wives while simultaneously seeking the physical solace of foreign damsels. Hersey's gift is helping us to see how these anachronisms have shaped (and continue to shape) the way the world has come to view Americans, and the way we have come to view ourselves."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"At first I was thinking, this is Pulitzer prize winning novel? Please.But on second thought, A Bell for Adano has a lot of wonderful qualities.Thematically the novel is very rich and unapologetically honest. It deals with the theme of authority, and the consequences of going against authority. Even though the Americans have arrived to Adano after the fall of Mussolini to try to usher in democracy, the reader discovers quickly that, in some instances, the Americans with their democracy are sometimes no better than Mussolini and his Fascism. In many instances, some of the American and British characters are insensitive to Italian culture, and make no effort to even understand the people and their way of life. The indifference and bureaucracy displayed by Mussolini's government is also infuriatingly rampant among the American Army and Navy occupying Adano.Many of the scenes were so endearing I had make myself slow down to enjoy them all the more. They were artfully done. Using quick and sharp dialogue, Hersey managed to capture the nuances of everyday life in this Italian town.But when I finished, I was sort of thinking, this is it? This novel is basically about a man, Major Jappolo, who runs the small Sicilian town of Adano during WWII. His long-term goal is to get the town a new bell. Other than that, he helps these people recover their life after years of a miserable existence under the rule of Mussolini. That's all great ... but there didn't seem to be much of a STORY.The character development of the protagonist felt a little thin to me. His character was the same throughout the novel. Not a major problem, but had their been some growth on the part of his character, the novel could have been richer.So, while A Bell for Adano had many great qualities, when you put it all together it still left me rather lukewarm."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This a truly outstanding story. It can be enjoyed on many levels. Most obviously, it is wonderfully refreshing in showing American soldiers at their jobs -- winning a war and improving the lives of their former adversaries. It is also a poignantly understated love story. It is also a humorous and brilliant study in how organizations work, including the countless ways that underlings attempt to undermine \\"orders\\" from the top. It is also a true-to-life tale about the many ways an American occupation of a foreign country can go disastrously wrong, though in Adano disaster is narrowly averted over and again. The writing style is beautiful and spare.Adult themes are treated with good taste. This treatment makes them all the more powerful in the story.Not so long ago, Adano was a common fixture on school reading lists. The general lack of comments from students here on Amazon confirms my impression that schools are not teaching Adano much these days. That's a shame. Adano is a vastly better work than the politically correct tripe that so many schools dish out (a very partial list: My Brother Sam is Dead; Farewell to Manzanar; The House on Mango Street; The Bomb; The Slave Dancer). If you are home schooling, note that Adano won the Pulitzer Prize and is a proper substitute for almost any book that appears on current \\"recommended\\" lists."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"Have heard this title for years and finally decided to read it.

I encourage everyone to read this book because it Truely is a great book."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"Decades ago, a high school classmate raved about A Bell for Adano, but for some reason I never got around to reading this novel until recently. It is not only a heart-warming story, but a realistic portrayal of the best of America's soldiers not only in fighting during World War II, but also in carefully rebuilding nations. This well-crafted novel also offers a civics lesson, so desperately needed today, about the wonder of democracy and ethical leadership, especially to the people of the small Italian village of Adano, who have suffered so long under a totalitarian regime. Hersey takes readers on a bittersweet, yet hopeful journey as his humble hero struggles against the entrenched corruption of the former fascist regime and the incompetence of his own military bureaucracy to convince the people of Adano that in a democratic society they may decide their own destiny. Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading the finest American literature."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This book has been on my mind a lot since I read it.

I wish things could have gone differently for Major Joccolo. He certainly deserved better. On the other hand, he takes everything well, even his final punishment. A must read."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"Back in high school, I made a vow to myself that I would eventually read all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels. A Bell for Adano was one of the first that I read. Now, a few years later, I have read around 30 of those novels, and while many have been wonderful, few have matched the experience of reading A Bell for Adano, and I continue to return to it.The splendid novel is set during World War II, though it isn't really a war novel. The novel is about how very different people can, and should treat one another, especially when in a difficult situation. A Bell for Adano primarily concerns Major Joppolo. He is an American officer placed in charge of the city of Adano after the invasion. Joppolo is a wonderful, though flawed man. He's always practical but remains sentimental. He sets out to make the lives of the people of Adano the best he possibly can. He does so by not treating them as the enemy but as People. The &quot;bell&quot; of Adano refers his attempt to restore an historic bell to the city that it had lost during the war.I can never do justice to my favorite novels when I review them, and this is one of them. I can't say enough good about it. The characterizations are strong and the interactions between the characters are touching and thought-provoking. Joppolo's relationship to the city's people is truly remarkable. It makes one think about America's relationship with foreign countries. The story is heart-tugging and humorous. There are few novels written this century that can touch a reader as much as this one does, and this one can make you think a little, too. A Bell for Adano certainly deserved its prize, and it definitely deserves to not be forgotten."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"John Hersey would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize and become a prominent star in the pantheon of twentieth century writers. This book was written during World War II and was a best-seller when released in 1944. And it still resonates today. In short, it is the story of an American officer given civil responsibility for overseeing the coastal Italian town of Adano following its liberation by American forces.How Major Victor Joppolo goes about this task is interesting as are the variety of Italians-former fascists and anti-fascists alike--he meets and, eventually, wins over. More gripping, though, is the character of Jappolo himself who, in many ways, Hersey repressents as Everyman--or at least EveryAmercicanman. He is practical, yet sentimental. He wants to do good, but also wants to be loved. He has a strong sense of loyalty, yet hungers after an Italian woman despite loving his wife back home. He admires the Italians, but shapes them in our American mold. He is--in modern psychobabble--conflicted; imperfect, yet very admirable.The title refers to the city's most prominent--it has dozens of them--bell which for seven hundred years called the people to work, to eat, to love, to church, to life. It was shipped away by the retreating Germans to be made into bullets at some northern foundry. Its lack leaves a gaping wound in the civic fabric. Joppolo, of course, gets the town a replacement bell. How he does it fills you with pride. His first hearing of its strong voice can break your heart. This is a worthwhile book both as a story and as a still provocative look at the American character."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"My head read this book and said: &quot;If only Iraq were this easy. The Americans invade Sicily in World War II and Major Joppolo is put in charge of the small town of Adano. Despite the grisly casualties in the taking of the town, the whole place falls instantly in love with the American major. And what about those ethnic stereotypes? The Sicilians all seem like goodhearted but slightly retarded children, an impression reinforced by their comical dialogue, both when they speak English (&quot;Okay, a boss, you're a not a kid Giuseppe&quot;) and in literal translation, when they speak their native language (so &quot;Viva il Signor Capitano!&quot; becomes &quot;Live the Mr. Captain!&quot;). Sicilians who were there during the war say it was not this way at all: the Americans installed members of the mafia as mayors to keep the Sicilians under control.&quot;My heart, who also read the book, replied: &quot;You just don't understand. This is a beautiful tale about how a single individual can make a difference. Two vastly different worlds collide, but the result is pure magic because Major Joppolo throws the rule book away and reaches out to the town with his heart, inventing novel solutions to problems, trying to get a replacement for the bell that the Germans stole, and, above all, connecting with the people. The humor is marvelous: The scene in which the priest holds an interminable church service waiting for the major, who promised to attend but who has lost track of the time, will guarantee at least one chuckle. And Hersey choreographed the poignant scene when the Italian prisoners of war come home to their women as pure ballet.&quot;In the end my heart prevailed when my head remembered that Aristotle said that the purpose of drama was not to represent reality, but to effect &quot;a catharsis of pity and fear.&quot; This book will do more than that: it will make you smile, and it will make you feel a little better about the human race."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"As another reader has said, I also am making my way through Pulitzer winners. I'd intended to save this one until the end, because for some reason I was under the (much mistaken) impression that it was going to be boring. Boy, shows you first impressions aren't always right! This is a heartwarming and yet bittersweet story - you wish there were more people out there like the Major and less people like the General, and the types they represent. I read the novel in about three hours; it's that compelling and ultimately enriching. I'm glad I didn't wait!"},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"A Bell For Adano is heart-warming story set in an otherwise horrific period of history.Illustrating the charm of an American soldier and the filling of the voids in a war-ravaged Italian town, Hersey makes you smile and beg for more.

This is a well constructed book that has great characters and great imagery but also manages to keep the story moving along. While i am sure my enjoyment was enhanced because i read it while in Italy, I would have enjoyed reading this anywhere. It is a great portrait of small town Italy and of people.It is also interesting in this story of the US liberation of Italy, that it was written in the mid-1940s and has a thinly-veiled very negative portrayl of General Patton."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"I read this back in High School in the sixties. I recently saw the movie and remarked how I did not remember much of anything about it, so I got the book and read it. It is an easy read and quite entertaining. The movie is excellent but the book is outstanding. It is charming, warm and real. It demonstrates that in this world we have bureaucrats and politicians out for themselves (like Gen. Marvin.) We have people who want to do better but cannot because they are jaded(Borth, Purvis). And fortunately we have some Jopollos who are kind and caring. Too bad there are not many of them in leadership. They are lacking even in the church but there are notable exceptions. I recommend this to anyone looking to read soemthing inspirational to life them out of the doldrums. I had read Hiroshima and that seems to get more attention than this work. This is a thoroughly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"I loved this book. I will admit that I'm a fan of the 1940s, both movies and books. However, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel transcends all that -- it's simply a fine story. Even though the theme is World War II, this is not a story of battle. Instead, it's about a compassionate major and his attempts to bring humanity to a war-torn town in Italy. The books is funny, charming and moving. It's a quick read and a worthwhile one. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"I read this book because I was reading all of the Pulitzer Prize winning novels.

Keep this in mind, but keep some tissues nearby."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"I read this as an assignment from our San Francisco Mechanics Institute Book Club. Hersey worked for Sinclair Lewis and his mentor's style is obvious. It is done in the same rather superficial narrative style.as Lewis' works. Admittedly, I like a novel with psychological, spiritual and symbolic aspects. A Bell for Adano does have the the overly obvious symbolism of the connection to our Liberty Bell. Basically this is a propaganda piece for W.W.II. It did have over 20 printings in a short period of time which brings to mind the expression that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American and, in this case, also British people. Despite its triteness and thin literary veneer it is an easy read suitable for an airplane ride and a 9th grade English class."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"This book was o.k. for a book report or panel discussion.

This is a fun, slight book which gives a few unique insights into Italy, the war and the U.S. Army. I kind of wished it was more hard hitting but the author was writing in the 40s a more innocent, less critical time."},{"Title":"A bell for Adano","review":"It's 1943, just after the invasion of Sicily by the American army. Major Joppolo is assigned to be the administrative head of the newly-captured town of Adano. He has to face crisis after crisis and deal with all sorts of people--both Italian and American--in order to get things running again. He falls in love with a local girl and incurs the enmity of an arrogant American general. To gather the town's spirit, so much damaged by the war, he tries to get a bell to replace the one melted down by the Fascists. A BELL FOR ADANO is basically a series of vignettes centered around this story, not a tale of personality transformation. The good guys remain good, but bad guys will be bad.Hersey presents his story in a very nave style, similar to Saroyan at the same period. It was a morale-boosting effort, self-praising by Americans to tell themselves \\"this is what we stand for, this is what we are fighting for\\". It was a moment in history when Americans believed they had something very special to offer the world. The American way, democratic and hardworking, is contrasted to whatever existed in Sicily before. Even if there's army-navy rivalry, if there are bad apples among the Americans, the newly-arrived victors mean well. The American characters are rough and smooth, good and bad, but nothing is very philosophical or psychologically deep. The characters are all pretty thin. Some parts seemed very sappy to me with their \\"sweet\\" Italian characters, most of whom came from some stockbook of stereotypes.Fifteen years after Hersey wrote this novel (which was a great success at the time), \\"The Ugly American\\" tried to show a similar thing---that we have a lot to offer the world, but we are our own worst enemies. After another half century---how many invasions more ?--- today we are perhaps a bit wiser, a little more cynical. The American occupation of Sicily is an interesting bit of world history, but our approach to the period has changed over 65 years, and it would be hard to convince most contemporary readers that we are so benign. That's why I would say that this is a book that has not stood the test of time very well. It may have made Americans proud in those days of world war, but I think three stars are more than sufficient today."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"Well I'm coming off of reading her other book &quot;The Passion&quot; which I thoroughly enjoyed (see my review)and I just bought her other books under the name of &quot;Rebecca Flanders&quot; I really like this author's style. I chose to take a break from the Werewolf topic because I just finished &quot;Circus of the Damned&quot; by Laurell K. Hamilton and it dealt a lot with Were-people and this was a welcome diversion.This book started out so engaging it got me from the first chapter and kept me. The whole premise is that there are 3 gifted students at the House of Ra, when these 3 students combine their magical energy their power is unmatched, however something happens early on and they do not complete the training they needed. Consequently their magic is flawed.... but they don't realize that, their young and think they are invicible.This book has Magicians that are immortal, Dark Magic that goes wrong, Incest, Betrayal and all of this spans from the time during Pharoah to the present day. I recommend this book for a break from the norm it's great storytelling, if you like books with twist, you should enjoy this one. In my opinion the end was not as satisfying as the rest of the book but I guess she maybe left it that way to do a sequel.Respectfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"At the dawn of history, the House of Ra stands, training students in true science, magic, and every art. Three students stand head and shoulders above the others--Akan, Han, and Nefar--the woman both men love. Together they can work magic more powerful than any known, yet their use of magic is not unlimited and subject to great risk for themselves and those around them. The three agree to use their powers to build a paradise on earth, yet delivering on their promises is more difficult than their power would make it appear.Author Donna Boyd has created an intriguing fantasy that spans all of recorded history. The three alchemists transform history, yet always reach for more than they can safely achieve. Unfortunately, THE ALCHEMIST is weakened by the narrative device that Boyd has chosen--a retrospective first person narrative that somehow distances the reader from the characters. Although THE ALCHEMIST is a tale of overpowering emotions, great good and evil, sibling rivalry that extends through the centuries, and even contains an intriguing twist at the end, the story-telling is strangely flat.THE ALCHEMIST is an interesting book, certainly worth the read. It is also instructive for writers to see both how to create a compelling plot and setting, and how this fine concept can be brought up short of full fruition."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"I picked up this book thinking it was the well known Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, after reading it and enjoying it intensely. I saw Paulo Coelho's Alchemist and read his, needless to say, it was quite disappointing in comparison. Donna Boyd has an incredible imagination and captivating way of writing. I really enjoyed her book and was amazed that everyone has read Paulo Coelho's meager book and not hers. It is an excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"This was the first book I read by Donna Boyd. I really enjoyed it. It was one of those stories that stuck with me long after I read it. The story was original and kept me guessing. Just finished Ramses the Damned, by Anne Rice, and found The Alchemist to have some similarities. I enjoyed the Alchemist more though; not as neat of an ending as Ramses. After reading The Alchemist, I followed up w/ The Passion and The Promise, Boyd's take on werewolves. Didn't think I'd enjoy those as much, but I did. All her stories got me quickly involved and kept my interest throughout. It was like watching a movie and I couldn't wait to find out the ending. I look forward to any sequels of Ms. Boyd's."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"While visiting Central Park West psychiatrist Dr. Anne Kramer, Randolph Sontime makes incredible claims. He informs her that he is the assassin that used magic to kill someone in Geneva while he gave a speech to five hundred people in New York. He also alleges that he has lived since the dawning of civilization in Egypt using various names like Rasputin and Merlin. Randolph further explains that he is tired and desires the ultimate end so must tell his story to someone choosing her because he will be her latest \\"trophy\\", but actually keeps a secret from her that ties the duo together.He starts at the beginning as Han a child prodigy in Ancient Egypt studying alchemy along with two other brilliant students, Akan and Nefar. The trio shares a talent so superior to their peers and most of their teachers. They begin to go way beyond that of their schooling looking into the dark forbidden side of magic until Akan and Han also compete for the love of Nefar. Each of them loses sight of the philosophical balance that underscores their science.THE ALCHEMIST is a deep magical tale in which the charismatic Randolph charms the audience with his narrative from the beginning to the end. The novel reads quickly and fans will do so in one sitting. The story line belongs to the male lead character even though Anne acts as a strong counterpoint and anchor. Donna Boyd writes a triumphant tale that entertains readers who will want more from this magical author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"...but most of all, rhythmic. Indeed, this is one of the most hypnotic works I have read to date. The author's poetic quality is breathtaking. Though the actual story could easily be told in fewer pages, the richness of the work would be lost without such attention to detail. There is an uninterrupted eloquence to this work that makes reading it a truly magical experience."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Alchemist\\", I really did. I read it on a long plane ride and found it easy to get into, fast-paced most of the time, and engrossing. However, it's not without flaws. For one, the dialogue is a little bland. There are no quirks or patterns of speech that set the characters apart--Everyone sounds the same and that sort of bothers me. Secondly, Boyd's descriptions are detailed and rich, but it gets to be a bit much at times, especially when she's explaining how her characters feel. She'll go on and on about something and I'll lose my focus. That's just a style preference, though. I like authors to get to the point. Thirdly, I found some of the violent bits needlessly grotesque and descriptively over-the-top but again, it's more of a personal preference.\\"The Alchemist\\" has a few slow moments but it picks right back up. Normally, I read historical fiction and I gave this a try because I figured I'd learn a little about Ancient Egypt and Venice. I didn't really because the setting isn't as important as the characters who populate it but I was not disappointed by this novel at all. I guess it would be a \\"fantasy\\" novel because of the strong presence of sorcery, but not a stereotypical one. It was an agreeable departure from the usual Philippa Gregory, Anya Seton, Diana Gabaldon, and Jean Plaidy books I tend to opt for."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book. The story is, as the title suggests, magical. This is the only Donna Boyd book that I've read but I am excited to read her many others.The story is captivating and really excites the mind. You'll be reading one page while anticipating the following page. The imagery is well described, though can be a bit too overdescriptive. The dialogue isn't drowning and boring. Characters are given life and you can feel their obsession as though it were your own. There is good pacing between chapters, which makes for an easy read and keeps it from boring you to death.My only gripe but probably my favorite aspect of the story is that at certain points the story can get predictable. I like this because I'll be enthralled at one part and then I'll get excited and try to guess how \\"this\\" connects with \\"that\\".All in all, this is a very good book and I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy tales!"},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"I enjoyed The Alchemist, but I felt that it could have been a much better book if the second half had been as exciting and gripping as the first half.The book starts in Ancient Egypt and ends in the present day, wending its way through history. Well over half the book is set in ancient Egypt. This portion of the book is exciting and unpredictable. It tells the tale of three young magicians and what happens when they combine their powers. There were several times when the twists and turns in the plot took me by complete surprize.The second half sees the three separateds into various combinations of two and one. This part of the book is much less imaginative. I found some of things to be a bit predicatable, while in other places I just found the outcome slightly disappointing.This is a good book, but the second half didn't live up to the promise of the first half."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"A charismatic man enters a therapist's office in New York City after having committed one of the most hi-vis murders in history. But he claims he is not of our modern era, instead he is an immortal, born into ancient Egypt and going by the name \\"Han\\". He proceeds to tell the therapist the story of his long life, and indeed, this is the vast majority of the novel. Han was a student of the House of Ra, where the secrets of magic and science, alchemy and engineering are learned. Along with his two best friends and co-students, Akan (a boy) and Nefar (a girl), they discover that the power than can jointly wield has unsurpassed potential. They discover the secrets of immortality and though they know they have the power to be gods, they desire to use their power to bring about a better world.The plot was filled with intrigue and open-ended possibilities. I had no clue as to how it would turn out; I just knew I wanted to know what happened next. That for me is the mark of a great read. Ms Boyd used a style in her story telling which is very picturesque, almost poetic even, that was very refreshing. That sort of thing has turned me off before, but this time it was absolutely the right way to go. It made Han's story even more believable because it was like this man really had lived through several centuries, really had been near the seat of power in different cultures, etc. Han has a \\"voice\\" here like few other novels I've read. If there is one thing I wished for in this book it would be for more of the historical eras to be fleshed out. Instead of skipping 2,000 years, I would have loved to read about Han's adventures during that time...but then I suppose the real story would have gotten lost in the sheer size of such a novel (or series).Anyway, this book was a very pleasant surprise; take it from a guy who reads at least 100 books per year, many of them fantasy and historical novels, this one's a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"This story of Ancient Egypt and dark magic could have been more enjoyable if it had been written slightly differently. The Alchemist contains a great concept that was written well, but not in a style I particularity like. The wording is heavy on the description and that seems to prevent the storyline from gathering any steam. This book spans from Ancient Egypt to present day in just 240 pages, so the great ideas presented in the book aren't expanded on much. The book is short, but by no means an easy read.I've very much enjoyed some of Donna Boyd's other books, but The Alchemist doesn't come close. The book just isn't that memorable. If you're interested in Egyptology, immortal beings or magic, you can find a decent story in The Alchemist, but nothing truly fantastic."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"While the story was overall entertaining, the way it was told was a bit too wordy for our liking. At times Boyd went on and on about minute details that really were not necessary for the story to go on. Sometimes her descriptions took away from something that was exciting/interesting in the book; sometimes we were reading just to get to the next part of what happened in the story and often found ourselves skipping over sections of detail just to get to those parts. The best way to describe this book is a little story wrapped up in superfluous detail about wall hangings and pictures and smells. I think the story would have made for a great short story, but not the 200 some pages Boyd makes it into."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"While the idea is a good one, Boyd's history is shaky and her story painfully predictable. If she had fleshed out the story to include the colour of the various periods in history it might be more interesting, but as it stands, it is pretty shallow. The characters and their exploits are cliche and seemed to be taken from any one of Anne Rice's Vampire books. I was disappointed in the lack of richness and detail. This one man's redemption just isn't that interesting."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"I also was a HUGE fan of The Promise and The Passion. I had never read 2 books more engrossing and hypnotic as those books. With The Alchemist, Ms. Boyd loses a lot of the steam she had going with her first two novels. This book was boring. I kept telling myself to keep reading because I was such a fan of her Devoncroix werewolf novels that I just was expecting greatness, but it never came in this book. The descriptives are WAY too long and at some points you feel like you are almost drunk or high from the drawn out, pointless detailings. I found myself &quot;reading&quot;, or basically just looking at words but not taking them in for almost half of this short book. The story was predictable. I knew the therapist was connected by blood from the very start. I just hope Donna Boyd comes back with her powerful, epic Devoncroix Dynasty series! This book was a huge let down. I'm sorry Donna Boyd...I loved your werewolf books, but this was just not a good one."},{"Title":"The Alchemist","review":"After reading the Passion and the Promist(two excellent books), this book dissapointed me. It was slow and I never had any emotional ties to the charectors."},{"Title":"Marx Brothers Encyclopedia","review":"This was a wonderful book, I liked it so much I even read it. First of all it is wonderfully organized. The A-Z system works very well. Second it has alot of interesting infomation andd little known facts. Anyone who wants to know about (or knows about!) the Marx Brothers will love this book!"},{"Title":"Marx Brothers Encyclopedia","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book. It has good reviews of each of the brothers' films (together and solo) as well as behind the scenes information about the films. In addition there are interesting items such as shelfed projects, live shows, wigs, etc. It does suffer from not having biographies of the individual Marxes (although there are multiple informative biographies of supporting players). Also some type of summary table of contents would have been helpful; something that would have grouped the types of entries such as biographies, references to costumes, etc.I received this &amp; the Three Stooges Encyclopedia at the same time. The Marxes encyclopedia is the way it SHOULD be done."},{"Title":"Marx Brothers Encyclopedia","review":"A well-crafted collection of photos, facts and tall tales about the comedy team. One of the top books ever on the subject, this volume suffers only in a few areas: 1) It is in encyclopedic A-Z order, but there is no index, per se. 2) It does offer dozens of photos, some very rare, of all stages of the careers of each, but does not have a specific bio on each individual brother. 3) It suffers somewhat from the editorial bias of the author, who includes subject headings you may not really care about, such as &quot;shoes.&quot; (?) Other than those minuses, though, it is a really great book, filled with lots of interesting facts and memories. It is like having a Marx Brothers convention in a book!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"IN THE SHADOW OF MAN, first published in 1971, remains one of the most extraordinary observations of chimpanzee behavior in the wild. Goodall begins with the story of how she arrived in Africa and her first days there, but wisely switches the attention from herself to the endangered chimpanzees she studies. She not only recognizes individuals but learns their distinctive personalities, describing in compelling detail the smallest of moments that illuminate who these great animals are. Unlike most scientists of the time, Goodall documents emotions and complex political behavior, the social hierarchy and parenting abilities, the aggression and the bonds formed between chimps that can only be described as friendships. In eloquent prose, Goodall tells the stories of these chimps - most notably that of Flo and her family - and will forever change the way you view chimpanzees.The book contains several black and white photographs of the chimps, a real treat after getting to &quot;know&quot; these chimps in writing.If you have any interest at all in primates or in animals generally, this is a must-have book."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Like another reviewer, I'm an anthropology student and I had to read this book for a class I'm taking. Never has a book, meant for education, made me both laugh and cry out loud. It was simply wonderful. You will learn a lot about chimpanzees, and I promiss you will never watch them in the zoo, in the same way, again. Even if you are not looking to learn about chimpanzee developement and behavior, the book is excellent on a purely entertainment level. Even though this book is was a required reading, I was so impressed that I'm going out to buy her other books... just out of interest."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"The pleasure that Ms. Goodall had placed and received in sharing her life with chimpanzees is conveyed effortlessly in this book and touches you quite easily. I started reading this book not being to sure about what I was doing, since to know about the habits of these primates is not exactly among my list of favorite topics. So I just started browsing and before I knew it, sixty or eighty pages had gone by as well as my possibilities of getting up early in the morning.The author will guide your through the complex social structures in which chimpanzees live to the very detailed and amazing details of their everyday life. For example that they would eat gladly a human baby if given the chance. But more important she makes you care for their lives not as a consequence of a higher scientific purpose, but simply because the more that we relate to nature the more we are embraced in its blessings."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I read this book a long time ago and have looked into it many times since. It's an entertaining read that teaches us not just about chimpanzees but also about human nature and behavior. If you pay attention to this book, you'll be a better person for it!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Reading this book has changed my life. I better know now who I am and why I am. The chimpanzee in the wild is a remarkable mirror."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Jane Goodall is a unique undividual whose work should be studied by those who think that the animal rights people don't have a clue. Her efforts at gaining the trust of chimpanzee's in their natural habitat have spauned a host of up-and-comers who will continue to carry her work to the next level.Goodall distinguished herself by sitting in the bush on a daily basis until the local chimpanzee tribal members came close enough to make physical contact with her. That an English woman scientist would journey to Tanzania to engage in this type of research is unusual and certainly puts her at \\"the top of her class\\".She follows the lives and behavior patterns of her subjects until her research sounds like a Michener novel with its generational emphasis and timelines of family heritage. Within this effort she follows each subsequent offspring through each of their successive cycles from birth and death.What is fascinating is how she describes personality differences, the kind that come from hard-coded genetic diffences, the same as we find in human individuals. The mating behavior sounds like something out of \\"Cosmopolitan\\". The squabbles and fighting behavior could be that of any large Homo Sapien family. While Chimp's aren't on the same intellectual level as humans they certainly come closer than any other species. Jane Goodall deserves every accolade she gets for bringing us a lens through which to observe another geneological line of a species that has developed from our common ancestors.Her work suggests that we should rethink our medical research toward more humane treatment of these animals whose behavior is too similar to ours to ignore. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Few people remember that Jane Goodall was the first person to document without a doubt that chimpanzees use tools and display many complex behaviors that betray significant cognitive abilities. This book details her amazing work and may inspire girls to enter scientific careers."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"If you have some time this summer, let Jane Goodall motivate you with her enlightening stories of chimpanzees. The book will make readers aware of the fascinating similarities between man and chimp. Dr. Goodall portrays her stay in Africa vividly, and is truly inspirational. &quot;In the Shadow of Man&quot; is a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Jane Goodall is such an ambassador for chimpanzees and all other life on this planet. Her hard work, insights, and drive are to be admired! This book is her beginning and a must read for everyone. She is a truly amazing woman!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"This book is truly insightful, as is all books by Dr Goodall. But what is truly great about this book is the insight into human society and how it may have been formed.This book needs to be read by mothers-to-be because it will truly give you insight as to what may truly be the right and wrong ways to raise a child. The chimpanzees that Dr Goodall studies reveal mothering practices that can be seen in human society. However, the truly great thing about this is that it also shows how the baby chimpanzees grew up and which ones where more likely to survive and what their personalities are like as adults.This book is also great for those who are of scientific mind and want to know more about behavior and its evolution.Overall this book is a must read for EVERYONE!!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Excellent book and some amazing insights into the simularities between chimps and humans. All the pictures are a great bonus."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Jane Goodall does an excellent job in describing how she started her career as a zoologist and humanitarian worker. She gives excellent descriptions of how chimpanzees interact as family members, how they feel like people do - and what people can learn from them. Her book makes us readers aware of how close animals can come to how human beings feel and act, and that man is by no means far superior to animals. It also gives us an incentive to appreciate animals and to respect them. Obviously, Jane Goodall observes and then accurately narrates. Even in the shadow of man, animals develop healthy, and man needs to respect that."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I first heard of the book from my psych.textbook , and since I am very interested in human and animal behavior, I bought the book right away. I loved it from the first page and was very sad when I finished it. I felt like I am leaving the Gombe stream and the chimpanzees. I didn't wait long to buy the Through the window and other Jane Goodall's books. The way she writes is amazing, easy to read and keeps the reader unable to not fall in love with these wonderfull creatures. The book is an amazing report of chimpanzee behavior, their life and every aspect of their life. If you are only little bit interested in chimpanzees, this book will make you love them."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"This book succeeds both as a story of Jane Goodall's career and as a portait of the life of the chimpanzees she studies. She captures moments when the animals' \\"human\\" behavior gave me chills. A fascinating read."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Kinship with Animals: Updated EditionIn the Shadow Of Man is the story of Jane Goodall's first foray into the African jungle in search of the elusive Chimpanzee. It had been her lifelong dream to go to Africa and live like Tarzan, learning to understand the behavior of the animals there. She fearlessly set out to Africa as a very young woman, then just as fearlessly headed into the jungle by herself. This was unheard of and would still require a huge amount of courage. Her mother joined her there and Jane began tirelessly searching for the chimps. Finally she found them and won their confidence. Her observations and hard work led to some of the greatest discoveries ever made about animals, including the discovery that they made and used tools. Before that, man was considered to be the only tooluser. Jane Goodall set the scientific world on its ear. She is an amazing role model to all people, but especially to young girls who have a dream that seems beyond accomplishment. She was my role model as a child and has served me well in that capacity! I recommend this book to people of all ages. It has continued to inspire me throughout my life, since childhood. I read it every couple of years. The stories are just breathtaking and the book is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Jane Goodall's first popular book, and worth every penny. It does not become outdated with time -- it becomes more interesting. Follow this work with her \\"Reason for Hope\\" and you will be blown away by the spiritual journey Goodall has taken over the decades."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I loved it! It really made the chimpanzees feel like human characters. I wish I could go live at the research center!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I had to read this book as a book report in science (yes, SCIENCE!). We just finished learning about evolution and the teacher thought that this was a good book to read. I borrowed the book in the library and the cover, a picture of Jane following two chimps, looked unappealing and boring. The first two chapters were bad, but that's just my opinion. The rest of the book gets better, and you learn the names of the different chimpanzees and even get to know them better. This book has opened my eyes to the world of chimpanzees and has showed me that you really can't judge a book by it's cover."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"An undoubtedly interesting, worth reading book. Not very well structured though. Too much emphasis and interposition of personal experiences and emotions. I would prefer more information on the habitat and the local people. The book failed to project the anthropological aspect the title promises. Photograph quality should definitely be improved in next edition."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"The book In the Shadow of Man I found in the begginig to kind of boring. Just because the book was kind of slow moving at first. It talked a little bit about her childhood, and how she got to Africa. I didn't find it very exciting then. I wanted to get right to the action. Then in the middle of the book it got really exciting, because Jane Goodall talks about how she finally got to have some real interactions with the chimps, instead of them always running away from her, and keeping a safe distance. Also how she would feed them bannanas, and she gets married and things like that. So the rest of the book from the middle on I found prettie interesting and exciting. And if you like animals and are ok with a boring beggining to a book, but an exciting middle and finish, then I would reccomend this book to you. I liked it a little bit, but it wasn't my favorite book, but that's just me. Check it out for yourself, and see what you think!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"A really fine volume. Jane Goodall describes her study of chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania. She and her team has studied these animals over a long period of time. This covers the social behavior of the chimpanzees in the earlier years of the study.The story occurs at several levels. One, simply, is the interaction of individuals with their own personalities--Flo, David, Goliath, Faben, Merlin, Passion, and so on. Another level is the group/society. What is the structure of the society studies?The book covers the life cycle of chimpanzees in this environment-- from infant on. It explores relations with other species. It looks at the variety of behaviors that characterize chimpanzee society--reproduction, feeding, hierarchy, predation, and so on. The book also addresses the challenges facing chimpanzees as humans encroach further.In the end, a riveting book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"This book tells you what Jane Gooddall went through to learn about the animals she loved. It is NOT the scientific account of that research, you can find that elsewhere. It's a fascinating story. I found myself caught up in the lives of the different chimps, wondering what Flo, David, Flint and Fifi were going to do next.As a student of biology I feel it really narrows in on what it is like to be a field biologist--fascination!"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"This book takes you back to when Jane Goodall first started studying the chimpanzees at Gombe. She describes the early struggles to start the research and her experiences trying to get close enough to them to be able to observe their behavior and get to know them.The most fascinating part of reading this book is when she describes how the chimpanzees will gesture towards one another and those gestures are familiar to us as humans since we do something either similar or exactly the same. It makes the reader wonder if those gestures come from our distant common ancestor with the chimpanzees.In this day of modern conveniences, it is reassuring to be reminded how a young woman (and her mother at first) ventured out into a strange country to study an animal that people knew very little about, but that we are closely related to. It is thanks to her efforts that we have learned so much about them.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the early years of Dr. Goodall's work along with anyone who wants a close-up look at how chimpanzee society matches our own. I plan on reading the next book soon to find out what else has happened during her study."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I read this book for a class I took - a class in Anthropology. It created in me a new form of respect for our not so distant cousins - the chimpanzees. Jane Goodall is an amazing woman who in my eyes defied tradition - having gone into this study without a real education in it, she put her heart and her soul into the study of Chimpanzees in the Gombe. It in fact became her life. Her love for nature is evident throughout this book - she even nicknamed her son 'Grub' - I believe he has another name, but with all due respect I like the name 'Grub' a lot. This book shows how after watching the chimpanzees, Goodall learned how to be a mother. The similarities between these cousins of ours and us is truely amazing. For me this shed new light on the theory of evolution, and even some that didn't believe in evolution began to question it after they read Goodal's book. I quite enjoyed reading 'In the Shadow of Man' and intend on reading more of her works."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I think that the first few chapters are crucial to her story. If it had started in the Gombe Reserve and just been a straight account of her observations, frankly, I would have stopped 40 pages into it. I don't think she lingers too long on this.Shortly after, she begins to introduce the reader to the chimps as individuals. Even though the book is filled with her telling us about the chimps, she does also show us things she's learned by vividly describing an instance or action. I liked that she doesn't hide the fact that she has opinions (from the reader.) Even though I do not share many of her opinions, I found her to be an honest writer."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Not as well-written as Birute Galdikas's REFLECTIONS OF EDEN which describe studies of orangutans in Borneo, IN THE SHADOW OF MAN is none the less a fascinating book which chronicles the early work of a remarkable woman."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Jane Goodall wrote the book on contemporary ethology (the study of animals in the native habitats), literally, but not everyone will enjoy it. It is full of anecdotes from Goodall's life in Africa during the first few decades of the ethology experiment that shocked the scientific community with its informality and enthralled the world with its endearing stories. The reader becomes entranced in the saga of Jane's pitfalls and triumphs, and later is deeply affected by the chimpanzee society and its eerie parallels to that of man. But the reader of which I speak is interested in science, in animal behavior, in the story of a young girl jeered by those who never thought she could make it, in the story of a young girl who almost believed them, in the story of a woman who never did, and whose life, and that of man's closest relative, as well as the world scientific community and the environment as a whole, were changed forever. And, fascinating as the human story is, one must be able to dig the animal story as well, and all the way through the book, which is not long to one who does. Conclusion? Excellent in every respect, but if biology class turned you cold from the start, you might not make it through all 304 pages. Otherwise, get the book -- you'll be in for a treat."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"\\"In the shadow of man\\" reads like a recently published book, not published in 1971. The argumnets are strong that it is hard for dispute theory of evolution and our intimate relation to other animals. This book, and others, made me quit my religious beliefs that my parents instilled in me long time ago. I hope other people whill enjoy the book the same way I did."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"A Christmas gift for my grandson who has recently discovered Jane Goodall.

And by the author I assume that it is great from inside as well."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I first read the biography of Jane Goodall, written by Dale Peterson. It was very thorough and followed Jane through almost every day of her life to the time of writing. I realized after reading the Biography that I wanted to read her first book she produced on her own on her study of the Chimpansie and its relationship the human man. I purchased the book from Amazon. It was in perfect condition and the reading of the book was everything and more that I expected. I will continue to read her works and to probably order them from Amazon. R Bernie J"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I am a mother of 9 children, and this book really depicts the mother/child connection in the chimpanzee world! I never imagined the similarities between humans and chimpanzees! This book is not just for people who study animals, Jane Goodall is a story teller, and she has you seeing each chimp as an individual who faces challenges and uncertainties in the wild."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"After reading this book, you realise that just about every cultural depiction of a chimpanzee is ludicrously false. Jane Goodall brings across her understanding of these wonderful creatures as not people, nor base animals, but as what they really are. The passion and understanding comes across very strongly and you begin to feel attached to the various chimpanzee families she follows.Jane Goodall makes some very accurate and insightful comparisons between chimpanzees and humans, but is always careful to describe the logical process by which she came to them and points out that further knowledge may prove them false. She is extremely modest in saying that her musings are only speculation when they are revealing of both species and how close we really are.At first, when she describes her initial trip to study the chimpanzees and the various hinderances she experienced with authorities, I felt uninterested. \\"I want to get to the apes,\\" I thought. As the book progresses, very quickly you realise that this slow start is perfectly necessary to understand her slow and gradual contact with the chimpanzees. You are not told boring textbook-style facts about the creatures, but rather told what she observed, from slow beginnings to an almost unstoppable torrent, so that you are able to understand with much more clarity what they are really like and just how perfectly correct the conclusions made about them are. Instead of being told \\"chimps use sticks to eat termites with,\\" true but fairly boring, you are given a first-person account of Jane Goodall's amazement at seeing the chimpanzees catch termites and are able to come to the same understandings and wonder that she no doubt did.Apart from being packed full of fantastic information, it is the way that this information is disseminated that makes this book indispensible. You almost feel like you are really there. You experience the highs and the lows. The initial desperation that is slowly replaced by the gradual and ecstatic contact.Absolutely marvellous. A must-read for anyone with even the slightest interests in apes or chimpanzees. Indeed, in order to be able to understand anything, we need to have a reference point to compare it to. By reading this book about chimpanzees, a lot of human nature is much clearer. Inspirational, enthralling, and magnificent."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Almost everyone has heard of Jane Goodall and her work with the chimpanzees. However, the stories of the chimpanzees themselves, and what made Jane fall in love with them in the first place, is something not everyone is familiar with. In the Shadow of Man is a book about those stories, and about the early years, which would become many years, of Jane Goodall's study, research, and fascination with human's closest living relatives.Not only is this book informational and descriptive about the complex lives of chimpanzees, but it also reads like an entertaining tale as you follow the lives of the different chimps Jane Goodall comes to know and love. You learn the stories of Flo, the old chimp mother, and her family; you grow to love one of Jane's favorite chimps, David Greybeard; and you feel the pain Jane Goodall felt when nature takes its course in the chimpanzee world.Not only are the chimps the center of the book, but readers also get a glimpse into the personal life of Jane Goodall herself. You follow her on her beginning adventures when she first steps into the Gombe forest, and continue on her journey through research, marriage, and the birth of her own son. Throughout the book, it feels as if Jane is actually speaking to you, the reader, and it is this aspect of In the Shadow of Man that sparks you to keep reading.Filled with adventure, surprise, facts, and detailed accounts of the behaviors and lives of wild chimpanzees, this book is for animal-lovers, scientists, and avid readers alike. Whether you are familiar with Jane Goodall or not, In the Shadow of Man is a highly recommended read, and one that is worth your time and money.To read more of my reviews, please visit my blog at: [...]"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"We know so much about chimpanzee behavior now, it's hard to remember that in the 1950s we knew almost nothing. Louis Leakey identified one of his young assistants at Olduvai Gorge, Jane Goodall, as a promising scientist. With some advice but no training, he sent her off to Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania.Goodall successful observations have taught us much about chimps, and about primates in general. She earned her Ph.D despite not having engaged in any undergraduate studies, established the Gombe Stream Research Center, and became a leading scientist. Goodall documented chimps making and using tools, eating and sharing meat, and developing complex social relationships. All were novel observations violating the preconceptions of her predecessors. Goodall also gave the chimps names, fed them bananas to keep them nearby, and interacted with them in various ways - practices that attracted controversy. Her photographer (and later husband), Hugo van Lawick, helped introduce Goodall and the Gombe chimps to readers of National Geographic.In this book, Goodall tells the stories of her chimps. Though there are some small pieces of her personal story included, the focus remains on the chimps. She organizes the first half of the book chronologically around her study, and the second half analytically around chimpanzee infancy, youth, adulthood, and so on. She does not engage the sometimes-negative reaction that her work engendered, often because this young woman's observations forced \\"expert\\" men in the field to rethink long-held beliefs.The book is an engaging read, though it probably has more detail than a general reader wants or needs. It's also inspiring to see careful, patient observation yield big scientific payoffs."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"I read Jane Goodall's In the Shadow of Man (Houghton Mifflin 1971) years ago as research for a paleo-historic novel I was writing. I needed background on the great apes so I could show them acting appropriately in their primeval setting tens of thousands of years ago. While I did get a marvelous treatise from this book on their wild environ, I also got my first introduction to the concept that they are almost-human, maybe even human cousins.But I digress. Back to Jane Goodall.This is the memoir that began her career, that relays her start in the field of anthropology, how she conducted her early studies and the price she paid personally and professionally for her perseverance. She had no formal background in primatology or fieldwork when she began this study. She entered Tanzania with an open mind, a patient attitude and an interest in exploring the adventures of chimpanzees in the wild. From there, she invented everything else that would allow her to investigate these fascinating primates. In the book, she shares every step with readers--how she followed the chimps until they finally accepted her presence without fleeing, how she learned to identify each animal and in that way track their lives, how she learned to understand their verbal and body language, how she learned to be a better mother by watching Flo's parenting skills.At the time she wrote this book, chimpanzees were not considered human--still aren't. Goodall approached her fieldwork expecting to see them fail the tests of human-ness, things like using tools, caring for their families, working as a group, planning their actions. Each hurdle she put in front of them, they lept across, until her work destroyed all the rules about what made you and I human. She did for chimpanzees what Dian Fosse did for the gorillas and Birute Galdikas did for orangutans: she humanized them.By the time I finished this book, I realized that chimpanzees have a good and fulfilling life. They have adapted their lives to suit their environment. They lack man's wanderlust, restricting themselves to smaller and smaller parts of Africa every year, but by Jane Goodall's account, they enjoy their lives.Can we say as much for ourselves?"},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"Live the life of adventure and discovery through the eyes of Jane Goodall. Her love of nature, animals and beauty is so evident throughout this book and you'll sit fascinated with the antics, personalities and life and existance of Jane and chimps alike. Jane has given them all names and you'll forget at times they are animals and not human. Her daring and bravery, as a young and adventurous girl, are awe-inspiring, creating the wishful desire to have spent time in her shoes. Dropped in the middle of the jungle with no formal college training in animal behavior, she was to observe the Chimps with a view uncluttered by \\"facts\\". The first challenge was to gain the trust of the chimpanzees so that she could get close enough to live amongst them. With only a tent for protection, the book is the result of her years of keeping journals while living in the jungle and learning how to fit into the society of the chimps. It's beautiful, funny and sad; but most of all amazing."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"My wife is slowly navigating this book as it is a slower paced read. Awesome story, though."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Man","review":"In her own words, Jane Goodall writes of her landmark studies of wild chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania. Starting out in 1960, Goodall, a student of legendary anthropologist Louis Leakey, set out for Tanzania to set up the first long-term research study on chimpanzees in the wild.Overcoming political strife, harsh living conditions, lacks of funding, and the initial mistrust of the animals themselves, Goodall's work grew into a remarkable long-term scientific achievement. Goodall went on to devote more than forty years of work to the study of what many believe is mankind's closest evolutionary relative.This book covers her early years, setting up the camp, establishing a rapport with the animals, and learning about chimpanzee society and behavior. She describes her own experiences as well as the experiences of several chimps that she had the experience of following closely as they lived and grew in the Gombe Stream Reservation.Goodall names the animals, and relates story after story of their personalities and their conflicts. She uncovers the dominance hierarchy of chimp society, and traces the changing leadership of the community. Goodall was the first to observe tool-making behavior in Chimpanzees, and she relates the excitement of that early discovery.In spite of her obvious affection for the animals she is studying, Goodall does not hold back when it comes to describing the brutality of some aspects of chimpanzee biology and society. She observed first-hand the devastating results of a polio epidemic on the local chimps, and she doesn't shrink from dealing with issues of aggression, neglect, and bullying that she oberved.She candidly discusses her own mistakes as well, pondering on the compromises that she made early on to get close to the animals while raising the possibility that she could be altering their behavior by her use of feeding stations and close direct interaction.Goodall's writing style is vivid, intense, and loaded with little details that bring the reader right into her world alongside the chimpanzees. She captures good scientific observations without losing her talent for storytelling, and draws readers into the lives of the chimpanzees whose lives she follows.The book is supplemented by four sections of photographs by Goodall's husband and fellow researcher Hugo van Lawick, and it also includes an appendix with illustrations of chimpanzee facial expressions and behaviors. Stephen Jay Gould writes an excellent introduction to this edition, focusing on the importance of Goodall's work and on the importance of observational technique in the sciences.This is a true classic of scientific writing, and a must-read for anyone interested in the study of animal societies in the wild."},{"Title":"Old Catholic Missal and Ritual","review":"\`The Old Catholic Missal and Ritual' is a primary text for worship developed by one of the earliest figures in Old Catholicism in the English-speaking world, Archbishop Arnold Harris Mathew. Mathew had a quite colourful history, recounted by many as well as by his own autobiography, candidly entitled \`Episcopal Odyssey'. Whether Mathew was more sinned against than sinner in his travels through Christendom is a debate better engaged elsewhere; suffice it to say that many Old Catholic jurisdictions trace their lines back to him directly or indirectly, and his work toward establishing standards, including the standards of worship contained in the \`Old Catholic Missal and Ritual', remains a primary cornerstone of Old Catholic history.A missal is a guidebook or instruction book for leading and participating in worship. Catholics, Anglicans and other high-liturgical traditions have missals; it is a more formal text than the BCP or other such primary liturgical sources. During the medieval period, liturgical worship books included the Sacramentary, used by the celebrant of a service; the antiphonale missarum, for use during mass; the lectionary, a set of readings from scripture for the service; and the missal, which was a fusion of the earlier three.The \`Westminster Dictionary of Worship' states, regarding Old Catholic worship:\`The liturgy is meant to be celebrated in a clear and pure form, bringing the Christological element, in particular, to the fore. Thus the Old Catholic churches play a lively part in the liturgical renewal that is taking place in both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches.'Mathew's development is very traditional, particularly by today's standard. It was developed at a time of increasing mistrust between Anglicans and Roman Catholics, which is part of the difficulty with Anglican acceptance of Mathew or the churches derived from his bishopric consecrations. This edition is more in the manner of reprint than update, to make the historic text available to the various Old Catholic jurisdictions in the English-speaking world. Minor editing has been done, but for the most part this edition preserves the 1909 text of Mathew intact.The first pages contain the calendar, with saints and feast/fast days, major and minor distinguished, and instructions for fast and abstinence days. The chart of abbreviations shows the history of the liturgy -- there is still an Emp. abbreviation for the Emperor. Various directions follow, including directions on how to use the calendar, how to hear mass, creeds and prayers, and instructions taken from St. Francis de Sales of what to expect in and from the mass.The missal proper then begins, first the primary service of the Christian worship, the ordinary of the mass. Many of the elements here are familiar, if in somewhat less elaborate and somewhat different order, to most Christians of any denomination. The ordinary of the mass includes communion for the sick, vespers, and solemn benediction, things that are generally extra or supplemental to the ordinary of most denominations today.Following this are the propers -- the texts, collects and other liturgical pieces that fit with each particular week. These are arranged according to the liturgical calendar, beginning with Advent. The propers also include the texts for the commons of saints, votive masses, propers of particular saints, and occasional prayers for topics, events and special intentions.Then follow the more occasional offices -- burial of the dead, baptism, confirmation, marriage, confession, extreme unction, and ordination. The instructions and rituals for confession, to take an example, are quite developed -- there is an examination of conscience that begins with prayer and self-directed questions that place the penitent in relation to God, neighbour, and himself or herself. There are prayers for an act of contrition, thanksgivings for after confession, aspirations and absolutions.Ordination also contains more traditional forms -- rather than just the three-fold ordained clergy of deacon, priest and bishop, clerical orders take on the more elaborate forms of major and minor orders, including orders of doorkeepers, lectors, exorcists, acolyths, and subdeacons in addition to the three major orders. The instructions for conferring orders not only include liturgical direction, but also the development of clergy instruction, character, and other considerations not often followed today.\`The Minor Orders shall be given to such only as understand Latin at least, observing the appointed intervals between each Order, unless the Bishop shall deem it more expedient to act otherwise; that so they may be the more accurately taught how great is the obligation of this their state in life, and may be exercised in each office, according to the appointment of the Bishop.'Many Old Catholics leapfrog from layperson to bishop in one giant step; there is much wisdom to be gained by holding an interval between appointments.Of course, some regulations seem strange to us today:\`Such as are not born in lawful wedlock may not be promoted to the Major Orders without an Episcopal dispensation; neither shall insane persons, slaves, man-slayers, such as are irregular, disfigured by some bodily defect, or maimed, take Orders.'The language contained in the 1909 Mathew missal is, as one would expect, fairly traditional. It reads in many places like the 1928 Book of Common Prayer. This will appeal to certain people, but may be off-putting to those who seek a more modern and accessible language for their worship.This book is a bit difficult to use for regular devotional practice. Photocopying the relevant pages or using the text in the printing of liturgical bulletins would be advisable, as a 652-page book is hard to hold, particularly when the pages are not thin.Bishop Elijah, through the Dry Bones Press, has done a great service to the Old Catholic community by making this volume available. It will be of interest to liturgical scholars of many denominations, and a crucial volume for the library of any Old or Independent Catholic to have another anchor to the history of the movement."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Anyone familiar with the author's other books on man and his fateful connection to the natural environment owe it to themselves to read this seminal offering first published over a decade ago when the phenomenon of global warming was a hotly argued and angrily debated issue. The publication of this new 10th anniversary edition arrives in a world in which most of the author's frightful prognostications regarding the negative consequences of the hotly-debated \\"Greenhouse Effect\\" issue of a decade ago have been proven to be accurate and true. If anything, McKibben's warnings were, in retrospect, conservative. For example, five of the ten warmest years on record have been in the last decade. Thus, \\"The End Of Nature &quot; must be regarded as an intriguing book that comprehensively covers a critically important phenomenon; the massive intrusion of man, technology, and civilization into the natural order of the world's ecosystems to the point that we have ripped them asunder. While the Bushes and Gores fiddle away in their Washington offices, the forces of man are still engaged in such a maddening and suicidal plundering of the world's biological treasure house.The author's basic thesis, now well validated by over a decade of dramatically documented data regarding the globe's climate changes, is that though our massive intrusion into the delicate balance of gases, fluids, and temperature gradients so important in determining the world's weather patterns, we have altered and fragmented the earth's natural balance in an order of magnitude so large and so overwhelming that it has now permanently negated nature's capacity to operate autonomously, independently, and naturally. We have in essence replaced natural forces with our own efforts, and have now become the single most important and decisive element in climatic calculus that determines the weather.As a result, it is no longer possible to pretend that nature is something that just happens out there, and that we are merely subject to its forces and its whims. Instead, the author argues, it is human actions and human interference that now fatefully orients and influences the forces determining the weather. Yet, we live in a culture so embedded in patterns of denial about the effects of scientific and technological intrusion into the natural world that we seem to now regard the natural wilderness as mere grist for amusement parks. We seem so disconnected to nature or to its delicate balancing acts that we have no regard for the consequence of our continuing intrusions into its innermost workings. We seem to have forgotten our dependence on the elements of the natural world in order to survive, and consequently do not comprehend the disastrous consequences our massively ignorance, interference, and corruption of the natural world around us will likely bring.Instead, we worry about our stocks and mutual funds, ignoring the facts that the world's potable water is disappearing as the world's population increases geometrically. We worry about our property values and our next promotions, never recognizing the degree to which our materialistic culture and our over-consumptive way of life is condemning us and the rest of the world to oblivion. So we fiddle as Rome burns. In any event, this is a terrific book, one that anyone interested in where we stand and where we are heading both culturally and globally needs to read. This, along with other books such as Lew Ayre's \\"God's Last Offer\\" and David Suzuki's \\"The Sacred Balance\\", can give the interested reader a better idea of what kinds of possibilities await us in the new millennium. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Warning. If you truly believe that ignorance is bliss, stop now and do not buy this book. If however, you care at all about the planet, and/or you care for your children and the world they will inherit, you must read this book. This is the most frightening and depressing book I have ever read and in some ways I wish I had never read it. I spent the week after reading it in a deep funk and the camping trip I took the next weekend was tainted by the my new awareness of the wilderness that we have as a civilization already destroyed. The cause of enviromentalism has never seemed so desperate and hopeless to me, but now that McKibben has opened my eyes to the steep slope towards oblivion that we are on , it seems criminal not to try to stop our fall, at least for my childrens sakes. This book should be required reading for all candidates for public office and high school graduation. In the decade since its publication much of the environmental degradation predicted has already occured, some like the melting of the Antartic ice sheet and accelerating destruction of the ozone layer at the fastest predicted rate. I would be very interested to read an update detailing exactly how far this has deteriorated in the last decade. Something must be done! But what? We are living blissfully in ignorance while the very oceans, the atmosphere that protects us and the earth that sustains us are being destroyed at a rate that probably even with total cooperative world effort and prioritization, we could not stop.We're talking about mere decades here! But in the present political and social climate in the U.S.,can anyone imagine our environment becoming the national priority? So, I'm left with, What can I do. I guess that other than urging this book on all my friends,( one of whom a conservative who after borrowing it for the weekend chastised me, &quot; Thanks for ruining my weekend and my trip to Mt. Rainier!&quot;), this review is a meager start for me. Maybe a start for you is to READ THIS BOOK! If not, our civilizations epitaph, written on a scorched and sterile Venusion planet may read, &quot;They had a last desperate chance, but they decided to stick their head in the sand.&quot;"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"If I could recommend only one book to family, friends and neighbors about the gathering environmental darkness, this would without question be it. The End of Nature, now about ten years old, was generally dismissed by the intelligensia, (notably Christopher Lasch of Harper's), who described it as a &quot;tear-stained&quot; work of &quot;rural piety&quot;, not incidentally missing the point entirely. This is not a garden-variety work of environmental apocalypticism, though McKibben does allow that the odds in favor of just such an ecological and social collapse are pretty good. The &quot;successful&quot; alternative future he describes is equally, if not more horrible.If, by dint of technology and sheer ingenuity, we manage to avoid the consequences of the ongoing overshoot, what then? Imagine, if you can, a world in which we, our pets (and pests) and a carefully selected handful of bioengineered plants and animals live on, and in which almost everything else dies. Without wilderness, without even a semblance of connection to our origins, we probably could continue some form of human civilization. The question, however, is why, as individuals, we would want to.The groundwork for this sort of dessicated world is already well-laid, given our very American demands for paved roads and air conditioning everywhere we go, along with our ceaseless demands for more stuff - and make that bigger and cheaper, too. McKibben does harbor some optimism that we can choose to take a more difficult path. I only wish I could share that optimism. Read and remember this important book!"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Bill McKibbon's The End of Nature was first published in 1989. Had I read the book then, my reaction would have been diluted. Instead, after finishing the book in July of 2000, I am stunned by the accuracy of his analysis -- especially regarding the inescapable ramifications of human-induced environmental changes and the path being followed by designers and marketers of genetic engineering. Books that complement Bill's well-expressed thesis include Mander &amp; Goldsmith's &quot;The Case Against the Global Economy&quot; and Winona Laduke's &quot;All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life&quot; and Jeremy Rifkin's &quot;Entropy&quot;."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"The reissuing of Bill McKibben's groundbreaking book on global warming is pause for thought. Wouldn't it be nice if we could point back 10 years and identify this book as representative of a turning point in human evolution - one where we finally came to terms with our manipulation of natural processes? It is clear that we continue to plunder our environment with increasing improvidence, and that global warming has continued unabated. So hard is it to reach consensus on how to tackle the issue, that at the next Earth Summit (Johannesburg 2002) it has been proposed that global warming be left off the agenda entirely, lest the discussion deteriorate as it did in Rio.At the same time this book sounded the death knell for what is sometimes called \\"hard\\" ecology: that nature should be left alone entirely and that the fight should be to reinstate it in its most pristine form. Sadly, this book forcefully made the point that this is now impossible, because the very fundamentals of nature have been affected by our interventions. The only cause for optimism (and I think this is McKibben's point) is to support conservation on these new terms, using a softer ecological approach. Unfortunately, this theoretical regrouping is unlikely to prove fruitful (witness George W. Bush's reneging on his CO2 emissions campaign promises).Depressing, salutary and a testimony to our embarrassing myopia. Anyone with any optimism left after this might decide to expend it on the highly recommendable \\"Song of the Dodo\\" by David Quammen."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"McKibben, a masterful writer, takes on the issue of global warming--a phenomenon that, since his time of writing (1989), has been confirmed by all scientists not bought and paid for by industrial interests. The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1980, with 1998 being the hottest ever. McKibben explores what ramifications this changed global climate will have on various aspects of our environment and society, from rising sea levels to thawing of the tundra to superhurricanes to unpredictable rainfall to agricultural disaster to rampant disease. McKibben also examines a few other human-caused ecological disasters, such as ozone depletion and acid rain, and he warns of bioengineering's potential for colossal damage. Most importantly, he looks at our anthropocentric hubris and &quot;deviant&quot; way of living, and, in measured, non-hysterical tone, calls for us to &quot;bow down&quot; before God and adopt the &quot;humble&quot; way of living a deep ecology! (what Duane Elgin would call &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; and what E.F. Schumacher called &quot;Buddhist economics&quot;). Finally, McKibben explores the theological and philosophical implications of our meddling with God-created Nature, a meddling which has produced a new &quot;nature,&quot; unpredictable, unreliable, and out of control. Though there are current works that give more up to date figures on environmental destruction (check out the websites for the UN Env. Programme; the Union of Concerned Scientists; Wildlife Institute; Natural Resources Defense Council, etc.), McKibben's work is still &quot;must reading.&quot;"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"The good news: \\"The End of Nature\\" was a truly prophetic book when it was published in 1989. Eloquent and well-intentioned, it was one of the first books aimed at a general audience to discuss global warming and deep ecology. It may have even influenced public opinion, if not public policy.The bad news: \\"The End of Nature\\" is meandering, journalistic, and full of 20-year old science. Even worse, it's main Big Idea doesn't seem true. McKibben believed that man's ability to change the climate would eventually make it impossible for anyone to see nature as quasi-sacred and independent of human meddling. In reality, man's respect for nature will surely increase, not diminish, as the earth warms up. Coastlines will disappear, hurricanes will slam into cities, and summers will sizzle. Whatever else global warming will do, it will humble mankind.The bottomline: \\"The End of Nature\\" has earned a place in the canon of environmental literature alongside classics like \\"Silent Spring.\\" Every environmental library should have a copy of it. However, there's no compelling reason why general readers in 2007 should devote much time to it."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"This book has already received the highest accolade the reading public can grant: it has become part of the way we think. Since the publication of THE END OF NATURE we have all accepted McKibben's premise. Mankind is so powerful that no natural process on the planet now operates beyond the range of human influence. A pleasure to read, it is a great pleasure to see a tenth anniversary edition that will make this fascinating book available to new readers."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"I read this book shortly after it was published in 1988, but even then most of its environmental issues - rapid climate change, DDT, acid rain, etc. - were already familiar concerns to me. There were 'sketchy' bits in McKibben's science then, which were pounced on almost immediately, and there have been enormous accumulations, veritable moraines of data and argumentation, in the twenty years since, but McKibben was more prescient than not about climate change. He has earned the right to say \\"I told you so,\\" and he exercises that right in his prefatory update to the current edition. Anyone now stubbornly denying the reality of anthropogenic climate change is either a fool or a tool, or both, and certainly an enemy of his own grandchildren's welfare on the planet Earth.However, many readers and reviewers seem to have utterly overlooked McKibben's largest thesis, of the radical change that has occurred in the situation of humanity, and to have focused only on his warnings of potential catastrophe. What McKibben was saying, in declaring the \\"end\\" of nature, was that humanity's impact on the environment - the whole planet, that is, as the environment of our global species - has become the critical determinant of change. In other words, the concept \\"nature\\" has lost its meaning as something larger than humanity, through which we move and which we struggle to subdue and exploit. We have done it. We have subdued, exploited, and recklessly polluted land, sea, and air, to the point that our activities mark and modify every part of the whole. Thus, according to McKibben, it has become urgent for us to reassess our situation, to redress the balances as wisely as possible, to acknowledge and accept the responsibilities our domination of the planet imposes on us for our own well-being.I find myself re-reading parts of this book, with the new preface, because my teenage son has brought it in his gear on a kayak expedition in the Sea of Cortez. It's homework for him, assigned by a teacher during his 'senior spring', and he feels a need to discuss it. And here we sit, on a pebbly beach just above the intertidal on the Isla del Carmen, currently a Mexican National Park with strict ecological protections and as dehumanized and inhospitable-to-humans as any place in North America. Our kayak permit requires us to carry a toilet aboard, a canister in which we dutifully seal our faeces to be carried 'home' with us to Loreto. There are dolphins feeding in the cove in front of us, with pelicans and frigate birds squalling overhead. One might suppose that this is still \\"nature\\", still plausibly a wilderness, and yet the island of Carmen used to be one of the world's most fully-exploited salt mines, and a ghost town that once housed 300 families is just over the ridge from where we camp. More startlingly, there are scraps of plastic everywhere, both above and below the tide; you can't walk 100 feet without finding a bit of human detritus. One day we thought of doing a beach clean-up, but we found that we would have overloaded our kayaks without making a dent in the plastic waste. This is the state of the whole planet! There's plastic trash enough on the littoral of every lake, sea, and ocean to coat the state of Texas and make an intergalactic frisbee of it! Aesthetics aside, the Sea of Cortez is now a farm, on which the animals are counted, managed, cared for, protected from the \\"foxes and weasels\\" who happen to be the all-too-hungry humans who live on the mainland and who still imagine that the resources of \\"nature\\" are unlimited. The Island of Carmen is also a farm, with an introduced population of bighorn sheep; for a mere $5000 American, a none-two-hungry human from the mainland can buy the right to shoot a \\"wild\\" bighorn for a trophy.In effect, our romantic love of Nature has become no more than nostalgia, a longing to escape into a past when we were only individuals surrounded by a grandeur greater than ourselves. McKibben throbs with that nostalgia, but he can't avoid the realization that there's no return to nature as we previously understood it. It's too late already. Nostalgia isn't enough.The End of Nature, according to McKibben, is also implicitly the End of Irresponsibility. We are responsible for our impact on our shared planet, whether that impact is intended or inadvertent. Americans, having the biggest impact both individually and collectively, are currently the most irresponsible. Only by accepting social and political responsibility will we be able to keep this place livable. \\"Nature\\" won't take care of us."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"The science and explanation of the greenhouse effect/global warming has matured since the original publishing of this book in 1990, but give McKibben credit for raising awareness of an issue years before the herd. \`Little good it has done, however. Suggesting that one might consider altering the American lifestyle 1 inch (e.g. by using tankless on-demand water heaters) as a little \\"insurance\\" against the possibility global warming actually being true places you on about the same plane as a card-carrying member of the Communist Party.But I digress. Mckibben's argument her is deceptively simple:1. Nature is that part of the earth independent of humans.2. Human activity has altered global atmosphere and weather patterns, thereby influencing all of the earth (and will likely continue to do so).3. Since no part of the earth remains independent of human influence, ther is no more Nature.There are two key areas of this argument: McKibben's definition of Nature and the existence of global warming. The latter idea still promotes considerable disagreement, although it is fair to say that very few climatologists unconnected with the fossil fuel industry reject the idea entirely. Don't rely on this book as a reliable source for the latest global warming information; do some independent research using more recent materials.The Nature definition is more interesting. McKibben's definition obviously recognizes a separation between humankind and the rest of the earth. Many thinkers (both old and new) reject this separation on a variety of grounds. Ishmael author Daniel Quinn, for example, continuously ridicules the distinction, arguing that there is no meaningful difference between a woman sitting in a multiplex theater in a large city and the same woman sitting in the middle of the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana. In both places, Quinn argues, the woman \\"is in the middle of nature.\\" McKibben has a couple of responses to this line of reasoning. First, although perhaps true as a matter of logic (because humans are part of nature) and something to ponder deeply over vodka or in an environmental lit class, few of us take it very seriously. Most of us-and rightly so-feel very different in the middle of a theater compared to the middle of a forest. Mere cultural or psychological construct? Perhaps. But does that make it less real? Ahhhh....a question for the metaphysicians in the audience. McKibben continues that the essence of Nature is independence-absence of human control. This could get a little dicey in that some might read \\"control\\" as suggesting \\"intent,\\" and no one suggests we are intending to alter our atmosphere by accelerating the greenhouse affect. Perhaps \\"absence of human influence\\" is still a better definition. Some might quibble that there's a big difference between a lichen living a day longer because of a 2 degree increase in temperature and an offshore oil-rig belching crude into the water, but McKibben's thesis is a thought-provoking one...and that's precisely the point.Tragic, depressing...all the adjectives of the other reviewers are true enough here. I can't say I'm glad I read this book, but that is my response much of the time I encounter new knowledge these days (particularly in the environmental sphere). Again I come face-to-face with the classic philosophical conundrum: is it better to live and die happy and ignorant or know the Truth (or at least be headed in that direction) and live and die miserable. As a young(er) pup I always answered unequivocally the former...these days I'm not so sure. Decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"&quot;The End of Nature&quot; is a calm, wonderfully readable book about both the scientific aspects of global warming and the effects it will have on human societies. The title refers to McKibben's realization that all the rules about hundred year floods and so forth no longer maintain. Norms derived from past records can no longer predict what is to come, because human industrial activity has changed the whole nature of the playing field."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"It's been a while since I read this book, and it has been one that has always stuck out in my mind as being one of the better environmental books that I've read. One thing that the author touches upon is the relevance of time; things take time to happen, sometimes a painfully long time, and this is often difficult for humans to understand. Nature has progressed at its own pace from the beginning; at times its course has been checked, but in the end Nature has rebounded and rebalanced itself. For much of this process, humans have been a part of it; possessing only &quot;primitive&quot; technologies they were obligated to rely on Nature; but over the course of the last few millennia, the human race has manage to evolve to a point where we can dominate and control Nature to our own benefit. This of course has had an adverse effect on Nature, and during the 20th century we began to experience the consequences of this state of things. But in many cases, the change has been subtle, and as a result there has been a bitter debate raging as to whether the concerns of the envirnmentalists are in fact legitimate. Naysayers will argue that things really haven't changed all that much, that when one looks at the evidence that is presented, it doesn't look like much is happening at all. They do so because they have the inherent human trait of seeing things from their own perspective, and fail to see how we are subtly having a negative impact on the environment; the end, or whatever you want to call it, may not come in the year so-and-so in our lifetime, but it will invariably come if we continue on as we are."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Bill McKibben's beautifully written and cogently reasoned analysis of how humans are damaging the world we share with all other life is must-reading. He shares with readers a respect for Nature---truly wild, untouched Nature---that is personal, emotional, reverential, and spiritual. That respect is contagious. We need to hear voices like his. His book strengthens our will to take the difficult but essential steps to slow global warming. He urges us to be good stewards of the earth."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Although written in 1989, the information about global climate change is even more relevant today because so many of the predictions have come tragically true, or were underestimations. This book is must reading for anyone who wants to be informed about the impacts of global warming and for any local, regional, or national public office holder or decision maker. There are still solutions but we are now twenty years behind."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"This would've been a five-star review if this book were about 10-12 years newer than it is. In some ways, McKibben's extended essay on global warming has aged very well. His central thesis that nature is ended (not destroyed but removed of majesty or even neutered) by the overwhelming pressures of human industrial society and human overpopulation is as relevant now as it ever was, the truth of this argument more evident every day. And global warming, the central thread of his argument, is even more pressing today, even though we in the United States are doing even less about it. Though some of his worst fears have yet to come true, the reality of global climate change is bad enough, as underscored by the recent report on rapid climate change in arctic regions.In other ways, though, the book seems dated. A lot of what McKibben writes about is uncertain. \\"It could be that in 50-100 years...\\" or \\"our models are very uncertain but...\\" and so on. The last 15 years have seen a lot of research in this area and a a great deal of refinement of our climate models, such that we know have a much more certain picture of the realities of climate change. This is real. It is happening, and it's happening quickly. Unfortunately, the greater uncertainty in our understanding of this at the time McKibben was writing undercuts his message somewhat, that we must learn to curb our desires and live more humbly if we wish to avoid the worst consequences of global warming. Were his argument bolstered by more modern research, I think he would have a much easier time outlining some real steps we as a society could take to deal with global warming.Still, the issues McKibben raises and the ideas he presents for how we can deal with them are as pressing now as they were in 1989, perhaps even more so. Anyone who is at all concerned about global warming, the environment, or even just living beyond the next 30 years or so would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"If you haven't stumbled into Bill McKibben's work, do. He is very good at asking questions and clearly explicating his search for answers. THE END OF NATURE explores the unavoidable truth that the wild only exists at the whim of humankind these days. Whether we micromanage a game park, use a wetland as a water filter, or call an area \\"wilderness\\" and more or less keep our hands off, everything everywhere is impacted by our activities. A thoughtful and not unhopeful book, this one will make you see \\"nature\\" differently."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Just finished this excellent book: The End of Nature, by Bill McKibben: This is a pivotal book for the layman in understanding environmentalism for the reason that it highlights a crucial detail about our survival: Nature as a system of biology independent of man's influence no longer exists. Through well-argued reasoning and by giving clear examples, McKibben shows how man's footprints on nature have been so intrusive on the workings of Nature as to render it a system quite different from the one our ancestors knew only a short time ago. Beyond being a item of sentiment, which it is because the Earth can no longer be viewed as a guiding, completely objective force independent of us, the end of Nature means that we have irrationally intruded on the very system that sustains us without have known how it works. We have changed the climate, destroyed crucial habitats for animals and planets we may need to survive, and so pullulated the air and water that from any point on Earth we can wish to test we can find chemicals only we have created. We have no idea how drastically these changes will play out in the future, or whether we can survive them. But, it should be clear to everyone, especially the ordinary citizen, the degree to which we have altered Nature. Any fondly held belief that our ancestors might have held about Nature's ability to recover from catastrophes (including our presence) must now be seen as an illusion--for now we are on our own. We have a tiger by the tail: We have taken over the very controls of this planet without having learned a fraction of the process that took three billion years to come about. Our survival depends on us understanding our environment and that has been severely compromised by what we have done to a deeply complex process we are only beginning to appreciate."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"As relavent today as it was in 1989 and when combined with Deep Economy gives you something to ponder."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"Well-written and informative. Genuinely moving. Perhaps the Best Book on Ecology, the Environmental Movement and Global Warming since Silent Spring"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"The book is a bit old, and I didn't always agree with all of McKibbin's philosophies; but 90% of the book's contents, I did agree with (can't argue with unmanipulated facts and statistics), as well as with his ideas and suggestions. The book was quite disconcerting, but TRUTH must be faced, ugly or not. I want to look up some of the 'predictions', which by now must be being fulfilled, or disproved, but I haven't the time, and I actually dread the confirmation, too. I am using this book for reference. It is/will be a big, \\"I told you so,\\" to those who adhere to the old method of \\"ignore it and maybe it will go away,\\" when presented with mounting evidence of our very serious environmental circumstance.

It was in excellent condition and the read is enlightening in a frightening way - a must read for those who are concerned with the effects of global warming/climate change."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"This version is a reprint of McKibben's 1989 book, with a new introduction. The dates are a bit jarring because he regularly refers to \\"President Bush\\"- - meaning the first one, though this reprint appeared during the presidency of the second one. Much of the book takes the unseasonably hot, dry year of 1988 as its point of reference, but that reference has not really aged well.This was one of the first books to warn the general public about climate change. It began as an essay in _The New Yorker_, which McKibben later expanded. Unfortunately, it tends to read this way still, with a lot of filler and repetition instead of a nice tight argument.McKibben really has three different ideas of the \\"end of nature,\\" which he doesn't distinguish. The first is the notion that humans have developed the entire world to our use, leaving only scattered \\"wilderness\\" areas. Environmentalists fight to save these but they are already so constrained by humans around them that they are no longer really \\"nature.\\" Second is the notion that human climate change means that temperature, precipitation, and everything else is affected by human activity and is therefore metaphysically not \\"natural,\\" losing meaning thereby. I'm not convinced that this is how people experience rain. The third \\"end of nature\\" is McKibben's prediction that humans will use genetic engineering to try to escape the consequences of destroying the planet, so that we will have genetically-engineered fauna and flora even in whatever wild places remain. This is the genesis of his more recent book, \\"Enough,\\" which I preferred to this one.Mixing these three ideas together willy-nilly doesn't really work, and I wish McKibben had seen more clearly that he was talking about several different things. These three ideas also differ in terms of philosophical meaning as well as the political and economic forces pressing us to end nature.Yet, behind the entire book is the forceful insistence that there are too many humans, using too many resources, unable to slow down even if we wanted to. That is surely right, and this book makes the depressing point well. The twenty years that have passed since the first edition only confirm that McKibben's main theme retains is force."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"While thought provoking, McKibben would have served his readers better by some judicious self-editing. His ideas get lost in examples and counter examples. Transitions between chapters are weak, as though he made a book of several, seperate essays."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"This book makes the case that our relationship to Nature has fundamentally changed, arguing that since human influence extends to every part of Earth's biosphere WE are now the primary motive force of Evolution and Earth's Destiny"},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"McKibben has carefully revamped an older version of a previous book, and it is obvious.The End of Nature would have been insightful a decade or two ago but I found nothing overtly inspiring or new here.Any interested readers should seek more recent books.

It is a diatribe against human progress from the lofty height of a US environmentalist, secure in his own affluence and wealth, but hateful of anyone who dissents from his creed. So he is opposed to DDT, despite the fact that it helped clear malaria from many countries of the world (including his own) and especially now, to GM technology, which holds the hope of dragging millions of people from starvation and poverty. McKibben sees carbon dioxide as an evil gas helping to throttle the planet and cause runaway global warming, but despite the dire predictions of the IPCC, the world remains intact and, indeed, thriving. Coal, oil and gas are helping two nations in particular to bring prosperity to their peoples, through electricity generation. Does he really resent their march out of poverty? And where is the \\"end to nature\\"? The plant and animal kingdoms are thriving, and attempts by Greenpeace to show the opposite are wrong. Such charities point to the apparent demise of the Polar Bear, but the species is actually growing as far as one can tell The Inuit are the best witnesses to this fact). Environmentalists like McKibben should descend from the lofty pedestals and discuss their problems with ordinary men and women, who see no such disaster awaiting them. Their cause is even now being deserted by their high priests, such as James Lovelock of Gaia fame, who now admits \\"he was wrong\\" about global warming (the earth is currently in a cooling phase). Avoid this book for its fanaticism."},{"Title":"The End of Nature","review":"For better reading, try Paul Hawken's &quot;Ecology of Commerce,&quot; which provides ideas and methods for creating a better world.End of Nature is filled with errors, and although it uses apparently scientific data, the author is not concerned with accuracy or precision. In discussing his use of scientific information, and the response to the first edition of End of Nature, he states, \\"The science, however, was only one part of the original book - and not its most important.\\" (p.xix) From here on out, the book is whines and compaints, nothing more.For an example of incorrect data, take this gaffe \\"Trees and forest still cover about 40 percent of the land on the earth, but this area has shrunk by about a third since preagricultural times, and that shrinkage, it goes without saying, is accelerating.\\" (p14 End of Nature). This claim is not only misleading, but false.First of all, we have no concrete measurements for how much forest there may have been in preagricultural times. Secondly, the argument doesn't account for the growth of other perfectly valid and helpful environments, such as grasslands, that sometimes exude more oxygen than forests. But here's the biggest problem. Regarding forests, in the last century in the U.S. despite a fivefold increase in population, the percentage of land space covered by forests has remained constant - about one-third of the total land space. World forestland has also held steady over the last fifty years. That's right, steady.At the same time world food yield per acre has DOUBLED since 1950, while world food prices fell by HALF from 1965 to 1990. We have been becoming more efficient farmers, better environmentalists who provide more and better food to the world, using less land, and at cheaper prices. In America, less farmers now produce more food and more efficiently. We feed three times as many people with one third the number of farmers on one-third less farmland than in 1900. With less than a fifth of the world's population, American ingenuity and resourcefulness now produces almost a quarter of the world's foodMcKibben does not even provide a bibliography for his claims.

Ouspensky's &quot;In search of the miraculous&quot; is a fragmented commentary on Esoteric studies. In his three volumes, Mouravieff comprehensively covers the esoteric aspects of Christianity, making the Bible read in a very different light. He systematically explains Jesus's teachings, the purpose of human beings in the grand scheme of the universe ( as conscious food for the Earth's baby) and the subject of free will. This second volume requires the reader to have read the first volume, and this second volume deals more with the practical side of evolving oneself."},{"Title":"Gnosis: The Mesoteric Cycle (Book 2)","review":"A good overview of a running thread throughout esoteric/gnostic doctrines. It has a christian gloss that I can do without but that is expected with anything \\"Gnostic\\". The essential thing in the entire series of gnosis books is the two types of humanity. Moravieff deems the types of humans as Adamic and pre-Adamic. Some misguided bigots will take that to mean one ethnic group or race is \\"superior\\" others but it's not about that. It's about conscience and the ability to be fully human by developing conscience and being. It is an easy read too. It covers a lot of similar ground as Gurdjeiff but made less complex. All three volumes are essential reading."},{"Title":"Gnosis: The Mesoteric Cycle (Book 2)","review":"Boris Mouravieff has done seekers of Truth an invaluable service with his formulation and documentation in clear, scientific terms of an ancient tradition of self-knowledge suspected to date back to at least the time of the mythical figure of \\"Jesus Christ\\". Those who are familiar with the \\"Fourth Way\\" system of G.I. Gurdjieff should note that the two are essentially the same tradition, however Mouravieff provides considerable Biblical and Apocryphal referencing to propose that the system is at root an \\"inner\\" or \\"esoteric\\" form of Christianity.While I do not agree with Mouravieff's overly-Christian presentation (Gurdjieff himself mentioned that the Tradition was pre-Egyptian), the attention to detail and thoroughness Mouravieff has displayed in writing the series has to be commended. If Ouspensky considered his Fourth Way magnum opus, \\"Fragments of an Unknown Teaching\\", then Mouravieff's \\"Gnosis\\" series can be considered to be a more integrated version of the Tradition. It is unlikely however that even Mouravieff knew the full picture, and has presented us with what he has been able to find.This second book, \\"The Mesoteric Cycle\\", builds on the foundations provided in the first book (\\"The Exoteric Cycle\\"). The first volume is essential reading, as Mouravieff assumes a degree of knowledge as he goes into specific aspects and concepts in more detail.As in the first volume, the book is divided into 3 main sections: Man, The Universe, & The Way. The first section in this volume - \\"Man\\" - focuses on man's place and role on Earth and in society. There is more analysis of biblical scripture and historical context, highlighting the mistakes of man as he has fumbled through the ages, as well as drawing the reader's attention closer to the issues of Birth, Death, and Re-Birth that lie at the heart of many spiritual paths.The second section looks further at the nature of the Universe and the purpose of mankind in the overall scheme. There is some focus on sexuality and procreation and the goals they are intended to serve, as well as the octaves and \\"grades\\" of energy and elements, eg. the \\"Hydrogens\\". Readers familiar with Fourth Way material may have some advantage here in comprehending the concepts Mouravieff puts forward. Mouravieff also begins to expound on heredity, the nature of racial types and \\"enlightened government\\". Unfortunately this is where the ideas of Mouravieff, the man, start to become intermixed with the spiritual tradition he documents.The third section (\\"The Way\\") I found to be the most useful of the three in this volume, as it delves more into psychology, personality types and the various strengths and weaknesses of each as regards esoteric work. It is very interesting to me to think that this tradition (if authentic) contains an allegorical knowledge of personality disorders that modern psychology is just starting to come to grips with - such as psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. There are also descriptions in more detail of the processes involved in the stages of integrating the personality (forming what Jung called an \\"Individuality\\"), and pitfalls to be wary of. Again, the overlap with the Fourth Way in this area is considerable.While Mouravieff has been accused of plagiarism of Fourth Way material (notably by William Patrick Patterson), there are concepts here that I found unique to Mouravieff. His discussions of the nature of \\"polar opposites\\" and their complementary actions in spiritual progress, and how this relates to a tradition of \\"Courtly Love\\" (Knights, troubadours etc) are fascinating reading. This is an area he goes into in more depth than the first volume. The Yin-Yang symbol (minus the dots) as representative of the \\"Real I\\" of a polar couple (although each with separate Personalities) was something I found particularly interesting, and perhaps hinting at a central-Asian origin to this tradition that may have also spawned other, more well-known, Oriental ones. Laura Knight-Jadczyk's \\"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive\\" provides some interesting historical evidence for a type of \\"trans-Siberian shamanism\\" being an ancient root of these Traditions.While Mouravieff's analytic style and fairly straightforward approach is one that appeals to me, his interjecting of his social and political commentary, along with some fairly naive 'elitist' ideals, do not. His references to a \\"new spiritual elite\\" and \\"world government\\" (paraphrasing), sound suspiciously like a theocracy (even if a benevolent one). Anyone who has has read Andrew Lobaczewski's excellent book \\"Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)\\" will understand the risks inherent with placing government in the hands of any elite. The reader is thus advised to keep a critical eye open for when Mouravieff's politics start to creep into the writing.As a system of self-work and study, it is fairly straightforward and lacking in much of the \\"occult\\" symbolism and mumbo-jumbo that one tends to find in other mystical or hermetic traditions. Mouravieff appeals to the scientist, rather than the mystic, in the reader, and I give him due credit for taking this approach. The development of reason is lauded in these writings as a means to progress, rather than being considered a \\"distraction\\" to the goals of only \\"thinking positive\\" or meditative navel-gazing (as one tends to find in the spectrum of New Age philosophies and systems).Overall, this book is highly recommended to all spiritual seekers and especially those interested in the Fourth Way, Gnostic or esoteric Christian traditions."},{"Title":"Gnosis: The Mesoteric Cycle (Book 2)","review":"This book is part of 3 books with the title Gnosis, that deals with the fourth way teachings. For those unfamiliar with Gurdjieff and the fourth way I would recommend reading Ouspensky first and in particular \\"In search of the Miraculous\\".Mouravieff brings many of the same teachings up as in the above mentioned book by Ouspensky, but he adds his own insights to certain topics and adds new concepts such as the idea of polar beings. There is a Christian flavour throughout the book with many quotes from the New Testamente. This would have to be taken with a grain of salt, especially after having read Burton Mack's excellent bookThe Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins, where he raises serious and valid questions to the historicalness of the New Testament.For any student of the 4'th way I would recommend reading this series of books, but be prepared that it takes more stamina to read as it to me has a more theoretical flavour than Ouspensky's book mentioned above."},{"Title":"Gnosis: The Mesoteric Cycle (Book 2)","review":"This is a difficult book to \\"get into\\", just as reviewing it will most assuredly be tricky. Who is going to read amazon reviews for The Mesoteric Cycle, anyways? If you've already finished The Exoteric Cycle and found that valuable, then I assume one will eventually get to Book 2. Will my words or the words of any Mesoteric Cycle reviewer make a difference? Perhaps these critiques are for those, like myself, who have just finished the second volume and need to either spout off or take in some feedback about what we've read. I don't know, but here are my thoughts, in any case.I find Mouravieff to be frustrating, revelatory, and then, unfortunately, back to frustrating. He seems to *know* but have some difficulty explaining things fully or with the passion needed to implant certain seeds into his audience. Just when he seems to be confusing the subject or talking about something seemingly unrelated, Mouravieff comes out with a real gem of wisdom. Irritatingly, instead of polishing this jewel so that every brilliant facet is understood, he decides to cast it aside in favor of a new spot to dig. By the way, not so with Maurice Nicoll - read his commentaries asap.For the record, I didn't have any problem with his own ideas. I believe Mouravieff's intuition serves him well regarding a spiritual elite and \\"new world order\\". In fact, I wish his intuition would come out more often. Maybe then he could reconcile the traditional Christian paradigm with those Gnostic beliefs which hold God (at least a third of Him) to be inherently evil... or, at least, hostile to humanity.Invisible combat, constatation, polar opposites, courtly love, the 2nd threshold, 4 steps on the staircase, energy from SOL - 12, etc. Occasionally, this tradition is exhausting. If, at the end of the day, Mouravieff's system is nothing more than putting B Influences above A Influences, then why such a long, in-depth trilogy; especially when his personalized (not vague generalizations) accounts of putting B Influences first are so few and far between?!?I am grateful for the many figures included in The Mesoteric Cycle. While I didn't find them all useful, there were a few that clarified Mouravieff's point. In fact, I would have liked to see more.Also, the Cult of Cthulhu forum is hosting an ongoing study group thread for all three volumes. Feel free to visit the CoC discussion boards.As for The Esoteric Cycle... yes, I'll be reading that shortly.

The author modestly states that it provides basic information to the student of Gnosticism. The Mesoteric Cycle, which is the subject of this book, \\"seeks to communicate the elements of a general culture to the student and to teach a method,\\" he says. He explains about the work the student needs to do on himself in order to wake up the sleeping emotional functions. He says there is no free ride in esoteric work, that you gain in proportion to what you put forth as far as working to gain a balanced development of the whole person. The goal is to be able to transcend this third density that we are living in and move up to the fourth density which vibrates at a higher level. His teachings include some of the pitfalls along The Way, more specifically about some of the denizens of the astral plane who try to lead the aspirant astray.Besides giving information on Gnosticism, the book, which was written in 1961, seems to be a prophecy of what is going to happen to this world unless a miracle happens and we get some world leaders who are not only emotionally mature but superior beings. Considering what kinds of leaders we have in our White House and in Congress right now, the kinds of leaders in Iran, North Korea, China, Russia and virtually every country on the planet, it looks like the world is being led by a bunch of five-year-olds with machine guns that have had their triggers filed, only they are not machine guns but nuclear weapons capable of destroying all life, our very existence.Other information provided in the book includes: The difference between man, plants and animals, that the moon is actually an unborn planet that will leave the earth's orbit when it actually is born.The author makes other statements that some people might find hard to take, including that \\"the intellectual hypertrophy of the governing classes has occurred at the expense of their emotional functions and in certain cases their motor functions as well because man works harder and harder to better the conditions of life without caring about life itself.\\" Also, he says that man has continued for millenniums to be ruled by fear, hunger, and sex, the three principle drives of the General Law which seeks to keep everyone in his place at a low common denominator.\\"The cruelty of wars and revolutions during the 20th century demonstrates that man has made little progress morally through the centuries, and that one could argue in favor of regression on that plane.\\" He states that even plants and animals are ahead of us when it comes to developing the finer energies needed to complete the creation. He says, \\"Most people are vain and self-satisfied servants of the General Law which tends to obstruct moral evolution. The General Law makes man skeptical of miracles, those signs from higher planes, and makes him hate those who try to awaken him. The overtraining of the intellectual center aggravates the critical sense which at the same time facilitates his access to knowledge while limiting his ability to understand.\\" In other words, spiritual and emotional growth is lacking.\\"You can have knowledge and still be asleep, but understanding awakens you and leads you to a desire for liberation. The gap between man's moral weakness and his strength in the technical domain is striking. He marks time on the moral plane but leaps ahead in the techno field.

But in defense of Dr. Frankenstein - he was attempting to advance science and did not know that his experiment would produce the abominable creature that resulted. When the U.S. government clandestinely - with junior partners Briton and Italy and bit players, France, Germany, and Japan - provided Saddam Hussein with sophisticated military high tech weapons and biological and chemical warfare items it was well aware of what a despicable tyrant he was.\\"Spider's Web\\" exposes a deplorable sub rosa world that was created in order to supply Saddam Hussein armaments during the Iran-Iraq war. Presidents Reagan and Bush pursued policies in direct contravention of existing law and of their own public statements.It was no secret that Saddam was a despicable character, who--among innumerable criminal acts--was not averse to murdering his own people--the Kurds, with poison gas.War had erupted between Iran and the Iraq, two countries both considered enemies of the US. Iran having overthrown the Shah and in the process humiliated the U.S. was judged to be the greater evil. Accordingly-while contending that it was neutral-the U.S. tilted to Iraq and Saddam. William Casey, head of the CIA at the time, was the strongest proponent of assistance to Saddam. He did not just tilt but in the vernacular \\"gave away the store\\".In Europe, Margaret Thatcher was a strong advocate for strengthening Iraq, as was the Italian government. Other governments, namely France, Germany and Japan, did not want to miss out on good commercial possibilities and joined in. Some also sold to the Iranians. All except the U.S. and England dropped out when Iraq did not pay its bills.Many in the White House and in the State, Treasury, Defense, Commerce, and Agriculture Departments were shocked and firmly opposed to this policy. But in both the Reagan and Bush administrations a green light for Saddam's purchases permitted him to create a formidable high-tech military machine. Sales of almost any items were permitted including components for atomic, biological, and chemical weapons. There were even instances where the CIA would purchase Russian equipment in the Eastern European black market to service his existing Russian equipment!All of these activities were in direct violation of existing laws and regulations relating to the transfer of military equipment. Various subterfuges were developed such as sales to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. These countries then transferred what they received to Iraq. To pay for this equipment Iraq obtained loans guaranteed by the federal government. What was unique about the loans is that they were arranged by the Agriculture Department. Iraq was buying American food, then reselling it at a profit, and using the proceeds to purchase armaments.Numerous ordinary individuals who happened to be in the right place at the right time (or perhaps in the wrong place at the right time) were drawn into the periphery of this nefarious operation. A salesman who spoke Arabic and worked for a supplier; a trucker who hauled British supplies to Europe and the Middle East; a banker at an Atlanta bank that processed all the loans. Each profited from the arrangements but all eventually grew wary of the operation and eventually suffered for their involvement.President Bush and James Baker were actively pushing their pro-Iraq policy, in the summer of 1989, when these undercover operations began to unravel. Two employees at the Atlanta bank reported some of the suspicious activities that had occurred there prompting the U.S. attorney in Atlanta to investigate.When Saddam invaded Kuwait the policy was suddenly reversed. Saddam became \\"Hitler\\"; and the White House now embarked upon a cover up-but too late-the clandestine operations were leaking out.Henry Gonzalez, head of the House Banking Committee, pressed for public hearings. The Justice Department objected-the Atlanta investigation would be jeopardized-sensitive national security concerns. The Commerce Department's top export official was fired when he appeared before the committee and told the truth.An independent counsel friendly to the administration was hired whose findings provided a whitewash of the affair. But loose ends still remained. The government tried to resolve the Atlanta case by making the bank manager the fall guy for the entire operation. So many peculiarities had occurred in the pretrial and Congressional hearings that Judge Marvin Shoob in an extraordinary ruling blasted the government's handling of the case.The book provides ample notes of sources to support the statements. In addition there are three appendices of actual relevant documents.What conclusions can we draw. Two presidents knowingly violated their oath of office. They defied critically important laws dealing with the national defense of the country. They armed, with the most sophisticated weapons, a rogue state, a potential enemy, a country that did in fact become an enemy and has been embargoed in order to remove those armaments.It is unfortunate that a scandal of such monumental proportions did not get proper news coverage. The cover up was not 100 per cent effective. But the news media which continually exploits an O. J., a Princess Diana, or an Elian story for days on end on the front page or as the lead item on television and radio gives this major scandal scant coverage.O where o where has our news media gone, o where o where can it be!"},{"Title":"Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq","review":"This is a very important book which uncovers and describes in meticulous and uncompromising detail how the Republican administration, together with William Casey's CIA, secretly armed Saddam Hussein with atomic, chemical and nerve agents breaking domestic and international law and then lying about these clandestine activities to the American people.Spider's Web is an outstanding book and one which George Bush Sr might want to read to his \\"Fortunate Son\\" at bedtime. This just might help the current President gain a clearer understanding and deeper perspective of the historical and illegal trading relationship which created Saddam's huge war machine at a time when he was George Shultz and George Bush Sr's close friend in the Middle East.Why does the American Mainstream Media fail to hold US politicians to account on their past illegal dealings with foreign dictators which Washington helped to create? Maybe they lack information, confidence or courage? Or maybe some American journalists just don't care what's done in America's name by the White House? But the buck for Saddam's creation and arming stops in Washington D.C. ...and at a desk in the Oval Office which was once chaired by Ronald Regan and George Bush Sr.Read this book."},{"Title":"Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq","review":"Quite simply, this is the book to read to begin your research on how the US policy towards Iraq has brought about so much conflict, strife and confusion.As offered with plain and clear irrefutable evidence, including copies of actual government memos, this book shows how many US politicians (many of them Republicans in the current Bush administration!) assisted Saddam up until his invasion of Kuwait in 1990.This was no mere minor fling. The US government was in bed with Saddam and the Ba'ath Party since the very beginning when they (the party) overthrew the nationalist government with assistance of the CIA. At the time our government provided hit lists to the Ba'athists. One of the hit-men who received those lists was none other than Saddam Hussein. And it off it went . . .After this book I highly recommend Said Aburish's \\"Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge\\" which exposes further Saddam's brutalities and the complicity of the US government and how they helped him rise to power and stay there.From there readers should check out \\"George Bush's War\\" by Jean Edward Smith which shows, again with factual concrete evidence, how the US once again coddled Saddam right up until 24 hours after the invasion of Kuwait and then did a massive switcheroo and altered US foreign policy by _finally_ opposing Saddam and his brutal regime.Add it all up, beginning with this book, and you have a much clearer picture as to why many people across the globe, especially Arabs and Muslims, are skeptical of US motivations in Iraq today."},{"Title":"Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq","review":"This book, published in 1993, details Reagan's and Bush's (41) involvement in supplying Iraq with technology, funding, and weapons of mass destruction. Duplicity and illegal tactics were used to support the regime of Saddam Hussein nearly up to the day he invaded Kuwait, at which point the Thatcher and Bush administrations realized their horrific mistakes, for which they refused to take responsibility.One of the reviewers on Amazon.com described the book as a fabrication. This charge is not credible, as Friedman has extensively supported his assertions with information collected from FOIA inquiries and the media. Selected excerpts of his detailed source material (memos, transcripts, original sources) are reproduced in appendices.Friedman states:\\"There is plenty of evidence, however, that in the first half of the 1980s the White House illegally armed Iraq and that in he latter period, running up through 1990, the tilt veered so far out of control, and so beyond reason, that it led to the willful abuse of taxpayer-funded programs and, after Operation Desert Storm, to efforts to hide the truth about U.S. policies toward Baghdad.The author states this was not a conspiracy, neither in the US, nor Britain, nor Italy (who were each involved - Italy through the BCCI - Bank of Commerce and Credit - International) - but the outcome was indefensible and illegal, and the history has been obfuscated. This is a story of deceit and \\"manipulation of the truth at the highest levels of government.\\"Perhaps if more people read this history, the public would not be so trustful of their elected and appointed government servants, and there would be more advocates for full and open government communication. It is vital for any democracy to be supported by well informed voting public. The author makes the point that the public must not abdicate its responsibility to understand the foreign policy issues and activities of its government. He states with prescience: \\"If so telling a chapter of twentieth-century history is swept under the rug- ... Policy-makers, the public, and all those who believed in honesty in government will be the real victims.\\""},{"Title":"Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq","review":"Many nations nourished Iraq as a faithful proxy against Iran in the 1980s.

It's timely antidote to similar policy that used B-52s to deliver democracy to Iraq in 2003.Worthy kindred studies are Gary Sick's \`All Fall Down' (the Shah in Iran), Coll's \`Ghost Wars' (jihadists in Afghanistan), and Johnson's \`Blowback.'"},{"Title":"Spider's Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq","review":"This is a very well done and well documented text.

This time it's Stephen on his own ground, thumping the combined Yankee-French Intelligence Network and saving his loved ones in high dramatic style.

Once you start it is hard to put down. Great read.Fortune of War"},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"_The Fortune of War_, O'Brian's 6th book in the series, has the Royal Navy in active service against the United States Navy in the War of 1812. Never one to disappoint, O'Brian has the USS Constitution square off against British ships-of-the-line, with Aubrey and Maturin as by-standers and passengers. In the course of the battle, both are captured and taken to Boston, such are the fortunes of war. While waiting to be exchanged, Maturin's past catches up with him, in Mme. Villiers, Mrs. Wogan, Herepath (from _Desolation Island_) and French intelligence officer Dubreuil (who tortured and maimed Maturin in _HMS Suprise_). In fact, much of the novel revolves around Maturin's past and the dangerous position he finds himself in as a prisoner with so many threats about.I am finding, as I read through O'Brian's work, that there is always at least one instance or event that particularly stands out in his storytelling. In _The Fortune of War_ it is his fluency with early 19th American politics, the unpopularity of the war with the Federalists in Massachusetts, the social (and political) differences between Democratic-Republicans and Federalists and the econcomic (and political) differences between New England and the Piedmont. O'Brian writes, \\"Well, sir, for my part I came from Boston, and I am a Federalist; that is to say I look upon the Union as the soveriegn power. I may not like Mr. Madison, nor Mr. Madison's war - indeed, I deplore it; I deplore this connection with the French, with their Emperor Napoleon to say nothing of the alienation of our English friends - but I see him as the President of the whole nation, and I concede his right to declare it. ... Most of the other officers, however, are Republicans, and they cry up the soveriegn rights of the individual states. Nearly all of them come from the South.\\" For an Englishman to have so firm and nuanced an understanding of the minutae of American politics at this time and to express them so honestly and clearly amazed me. Given O'Brian's attention to detail in matters nautical, perhaps I should not have been suprized, but I was nonetheless.The political intrigue that is the primary plot of the story is bookended with brief (but vivid and typically bloody) battles on the high seas written only as O'Brian can. I have mentioned this in several other reviews on this series (and doubtless I will continue to do so) that everything fans claim about this series is true - it is fantastic and almost compulsive reading once you get started. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"I'm really impressed by this book. Not only because it's an excellent read, but because it's the 6th in a series. After being hurt by the utterly financial motives of wringing franchises dry in many a fantasy series (Feist, Jordan et. al.), I'm very wary of anything much beyond a trilogy. So often what could have been a decent book or two becomes increasingly lame carbons of itself.Not so here.As well as the usual flawless atmosphere and engaging characters, all of a sudden this book slides into a spy thriller! An excellent, page-turning spy-thriller. I love that O'Brian has given himself the room - in terms of characters, setting, and timeline - to roam freely between and around historical minutia, high-seas adventure, social commentary, humour (both broad (e.g. Maturin's hilarious cricket triumph) and subtle, philosophy, friendship, war, peace, anthropology, intrigue, domesticity, romance and natural history - to name just a few. Sure this may mean readers may prefer some books over others, but it also means O'Brian can more effectively avoid formula.I wonder whether there's a pattern emerging in my appreciation of this series: I relish a book; I approach the next book with high expectations and am mildly disappointed; I approach the next one with lower expectations and relish it etc. Or is it my mood that is changing, not the quality of the books? I fully intend to test this theory by going back to the start once I've worked my way through all twenty (twenty!) of them. Just at the moment I'm relishing that I've got so much to look forward to."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"For the first five novels in Patrick O'Brian's hallowed Aubrey-Maturin series, Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey was the swashbuckling hero and Dr. Stephen Maturin was the mysterious sidekick. Thanks to O'Brian's wonderful prose, this balance worked exceedingly well.And yet, there was always a sense that there was more to the surgeon-spy Maturin than O'Brian was letting on . . . that he was more than a sidekick, but a serious player in his own right. Of course, this was slightly undercut with Maturin's hilarious inability to master even the most rudimentary elements of the seafaring life, but you still knew that Maturin had a courageous, dashing heart to go with his naturalist's brain.In \\"The Fortune of War,\\" Maturin shoves his way to the fore and Captain Aubrey is more or less sidelined with a grevious wound to his sword arm. The War of 1812 has broken out, and the British navy experiences some shocking defeats at the hands of the heretofore contemptible American navy. Eventually, Aubrey and Maturin find themselves going broadside-to-broadside with the Americans, but perhaps since Aubrey is not in command of his vessel (Aubrey and Maturin being saved from certain death after their ship sinks in a fiery accident), Aubrey is forced to watch his ship strike its colors.Maturin and Aubrey are brought to Boston as prisoners of war, and while Aubrey convalesces, Maturin dives pell-mell back into his life as a spy. Boston is a city of intrigues, and Maturin's history as a spy plays havoc with his attempts to free himself, Aubrey, and the lovely Diane Villiers. Maturin gets to demonstrate that he's got a bit of super secret agent in him, and many readers will be shocked at the violent means Maturin often uses to achieve his ends. He's a far cry from the non-violent physician he is often assumed to be!Perhaps spending more time on land than any book in the series so far, \\"The Fortune of War\\" still offers thrills and escapades galore. For fans of this series, this novel is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"This one has it all! Romantic tension, exploding ships, climactic battle scenes, and (my favorite) ingrigue! The characters, are at their most Jack-and-Stephenesque. O'Brian manages to fit more meaning and emotion into a single simple sentence than any author since Austen and he manages to fit more events into this book than many of his others. Anyone who has gotten this far in the series doesn't need me to urge them to read this one, but I couldn't help but sing its praises."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"This is the sixth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian.In the first (Master & Commander) I was exposed to a new language and the nautical terms were a bit of a mystery, but now after reading the first six books I am addicted to O'Brian's \\"voice\\", style and masterful story telling. I finished this book while on vacation and the ending left me eager to pick up the next one in the series; alas, I had to wait for my return to \\"civililization\\" to find #7.

My only problem: whom should I root for, our British heroes or my American countrymen?O'Brian has managed to inject his characters into several real historical battles without allowing them to have any influence on the outcome. If the main characters don't have an influence on the outcome, what's to keep a gal reading? A lot, it turns out. Subterfuge, espionage, romance, danger, and exploration of \\"the human condition\\" made this a page-turner for me.

If you liked the others, you should enjoy this one too."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"This is the sixth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series, and focusses on the War of 1812 - although less than a third of the way through the series, we are now getting quite late in the Napoleonic Wars. The story continues the same voyage from 'Desolation Island', and the events and characters of that book are significant. So it's advisable to read that prior to this, even if you don't read all of the five prequels.Two naval battles and a desperate longboat voyage are featured, but the heart of the story is Aubrey and Maturin as POWs in Boston, where Maturin's past spying activities are coming back to haunt him. This part of the story is done very well.The principal complaint is one that applies to all the books in this series, so at least readers will be used to it by now. The books are loaded with contemporary naval terms and slang which O'Brian never stops to explain, leaving the reader to spend almost as much time at sea as the heroes.The series is generally strong on historical authenticity, but an earlier revewer complains that this volume is an exception. I suspect that is so; from my own knowledge of the War of 1812, the close Franco-American alliance which is portrayed in this book, while it would have made political sense, never really existed. Such errors are unfortunate in an author who normally avoids them, but they didn't spoil the story for me."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"\\"Fortune of War\\" is the sixth installment in Patrick O'Brian's monumental 20-volume 19th-century maritime series. It is full of energy, as Captain Jack Aubrey and best friend Stephen Maturin limp into port in HMS Leopard, after their adventures from the previous book. Aubrey learns that he is to be given a fine new ship, but must take a transport to Britain to meet her. He never makes it. He suffers shipwreck, two burnings, and two of the epic sea battles that O'Brian depicts so keenly that a reader is torn between reading them apace and pausing to catch some breath. The War of 1812 with the United States has begun and the American frigate USS Constitution is building what will become an enduring historical legacy. In Boston, Maturin meets Diana Villiers, his long-time love, and confronts shadows from his past of espionage.Once again, O'Brian has combed the historical records and offered up an engaging blend of fiction and fact. These ships did exist, the spirit of 1812 Boston is faithful and evocative. Odd as it sounds, Aubrey and Maturin have evolved in something of a Kirk-and-Spock team. Aubrey is all action, sometimes a bit shallow, but always gregarious and outgoing. Maturin is stoic, deep and introspective, and always pulling strings that others can not even see but that often reach across seas and years in their reach. They are a well-matched team, they make us smile. This is a good book."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"Amazing.The above reviewer dissatisfied with this book misses the (whole) point I fear, else he is small-minded.I confess I don't read for historical accuracy, but enjoyment.This author has it all; psychology, character development, action/suspense, technics, logic, you name it.

So, listening to a reading version is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I recommend that youy stay away from any read by Simon Vance. He is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it, and offers stuffy readings that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"The sixth book kept me on edge and wanting more.

Earlier books in the series, in particular DESOLATION ISLAND, had had Americans figure into the story line, but this is the first in which the young American nation features prominently. The cause for this is the War of 1812, and now the focus of battle turns from the French and Spanish to the United States.Maturin plays an especially strong part in the plot of THE FORTUNE OF WAR. Although the Aubrey -Maturin novels are historical nautical fiction, largely renowned for their accurate depiction of the early eighteenth-century Royal Navy, some of the novels may also be seen as part of the espionage genre, with Maturin serving as a spy on behalf of the British crown. In previous stories, for instance, Maturin suffered torture under the French for his espionage; in another instance, one closely tied to the plot of this story, he tricks the French into killing off a number of their intelligence assets. In THE FORTUNE OF WAR, Maturin's past catches up with him, and he is forced to take action of a sort that belies his reputation as a physician and gentle naturalist.This novel is in some ways much stronger than the fifth volume, DESOLATION ISLAND, which, though having a strong finish, at times appeared to lose the wind in its sails. THE FORTUNE OF WAR makes it clear that O'Brian's ideas and storytelling remain strong and vibrant in this series; with so many volumes yet ahead, this is indeed reassuring.As usual, O'Brian's research is thorough, yet the historical details don't overwhelm the story. The pace is fairly brisk, with only some stalling--perhaps appropriately so--in Boston. This is fortunately not caused so much by the reappearance of Diana Villiers, Stephen Maturin's great love of his life. (She is as welcome to this reader of O'Brian's stories as is Jack's wife, Sophie.) The wimpy minor character Michael Herapath, the son of a wealthy American trader, also reemerges. But I find him somewhat interesting for his passionate interest in Chinese poetry; this accurately reflects the growing interest in the nineteenth century in the literature of China, and is an example of the interesting ways O'Brian treats the reader with tastings of such historical esoterica.THE FORTUNE OF WAR describes a couple of naval engagements. The one that features at the end of this novel is as good (if not better) as any rendered by Patrick O'Brian in any of the volumes up to this one. In it, O'Brian captures the technical details of the fighting while also conveying very effectively the horror of the moment (actually, fifteen minutes). It is crackerjack writing, vivid and spellbinding."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"I bought all twenty of the hardbacks, and spent a few weeks ignoring everything else in my life.

Offered command of the Royal Navy's fastest, most heavily armored, frigate, Jack Aubrey races home with his old friend Stephen Maturin across the Pacific aboard a small vessel which sinks off the coast of Patagonia. Rescued by HMS Java, they are captured by the Americans when Java surrenders to US Navy frigate USS Constitution after a brief duel between both ships. Soon they find themselves in the United States, reunited with Diana Villiers, Stephen's old flame, and involved in some espionage on the streets of Boston. Stephen's past as a British secret agent working against Napoleon will soon haunt him. Eventually they will witness one of the bloodiest engagements between the British and American navies; one of several notable single ship duels fought during the opening months of the war."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"This is the poorest of O'Brian's books in the series. He was an author who prided himself on historical accuracy, but he misses the mark in this book about Aubrey and Maturin captured in Boston. First, Aubrey is severely wounded when HMS Java is captured by the USS Constitution. Unable to travel (!?) from central America to Britain on a prisoner of war cartel, he instead is brought to Boston (1500 miles) along with faithful Stephen Maturin. Once there, his captors allow them to find refuge in a private hospital on Beacon Hill. Not to give away the plot, Aubrey claims that he has not been parolled and therefore he and Matirin can slip away and rejoin the Royal Navy, then blockading Boston. Bosh! Any captive must be parolled in order to avoid being kept under close arrest. This would never have happened in &quot;real life.&quot; For Aubrey and Maturin to live in a private hospital, both would have been parolled: had to give their word (their honor) that because they were not watched or guarded that they would not run away. Not only do they eventually run away, but Maturin, armed and dangerous, fights French agents in Boston's streets. Second, O'Brian's Boston exists only in his mind, not in any historical reality. O'Brian possibly constructed Boston based upon maps, but had little understanding of the city in 1813. The geography is vague (and often cloaked in dense fog.) He mentions how a character could drive from Boston to Salem and back in 2-3 hours in a carriage. Salem is 20 miles north of the unbridged Charles River estuary; it might take 2-3 hours today to drive a roundtrip (given the traffic on the interstate and surface roads), but such a trip in 1813 would have been a fantasy. O'Brian's Boston never existed. Third, O'Brian constructs an elaborate French owned hotel (somewhere along Washington Street) to play out his duel between Stephen Maturin and the evil French secret service agents. These agents have the run of Boston and even wound a boy while trying to shoot Maturin. The Americans let the French have their way. In reality, Boston was a Federalist stronghold and therefore any French agents would have had to work out of sight. Napoleon's France was not an ally of the United States. The U.S. fought an undeclared naval war against the French during John Adams' administration to break the mutual defence treaty that this country had made with King Louis XVI in 1778. That French agents could work openly in the United States in 1813 is O'Brian's invention. Fourth, Stephen Maturin wants to marry the tiresome Diane Villiers because she has become a naturalized American citizen and this would be the easiest way for her to become a British subject again (and also accomplish what Maturin has wanted since book two.) O'Brian should know that Britain never recognized any of its subjects becoming naturalized citizens of any other country. This was the whole issue of British impressment of American sailors: born British, always British. There is no need for Maturin to marry Villiers to remake her a British subject: in the eyes of British law she never ceased being British.All in all, this book was not up to the standard that I have expected in O'Brian's novels. The depth of his research shows through the entire twenty books, but is demonstrated less here than in the other 19. The gaffs were big enough to ruin the plot for me."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"The pace of THE FORTUNE OF WAR, sixth book in the Aubrey-Maturin series of sea-faring novels by Richard Russ (the real name of \\"Patrick O'Brian\\"), moves smartly along from cover to cover. The action aboard His British Majesty's frigates is guaranteed to hold the reader's interest, and the novel provides a fast and gripping experience, vicarious though it be, for the reader.Of course, as with the other nineteen complete novels and the unfinished twentieth book of this series, it definitely behooves the reader to begin with the first (MASTER AND COMMANDER) and proceed through the books in the story line's chronological sequence. While the descriptions of naval warfare are thoroughly gripping regardless of the story line's chronology, each book contains references to characters that are far more meaningful if one has read the preceding volumes.Also as in every other Russ/O'Brian novel that I have finished thus far, this one is not without a few stylistic weaknesses, which, although not numerous, are annoying and pretty well ensure that Russ/O'Brian is by no means the \\"five-star author\\" that less demanding readers have rated him. This one also contains a strange and spurious etymology for a common American expression that, were it to be spread today via the Internet, would merit the label of \\"urban legend.\\" While there is never any question that Russ/O'Brian is a writer of fiction, this particular explanation is so superficially believable that it is decidedly in danger of being spread as accurate:Maturin, captured by the American navy, ponders an American's expression that \\"hominy grits cut no ice with him.\\" This is an unidiomatic use of the phase to start with, but that problem pales into insignificance in light of the explanation from another American speaker, who explains that it derives from Iroquois \\"katno aiss' vizmi\\" meaning \\"I am unimpressed.\\" This is, in a word, balderdash. The so-called Iroquois is bogus, and numerous sources (try a simple Google search) thoroughly debunk that explanation of the origin of the phrase \\"cuts no ice.\\" Now, it may be that Russ/O'Brian is attempting to interject some levity into his text at this point and never intended for any reader to take the \\"explanation\\" at face value. This becomes more apparent if one reads the supposed Iroquois words aloud. If indeed the author is writing this tongue-in-cheek, then it seems to be an inappropriate place in the story in which to interject humor and will likely be misinterpreted by most readers. Russ/O'Brian had best avoid slapstick as a genre.The other stylistic shortcoming is one that we see again and again in the books of this series, the author's total disregard for transitioning between scenes. At one point, we see two characters, Maturin and young Herapath, approaching the Asclepia hospital in which Aubrey is recuperating, when they behold the elder Herapath leaving the building. Maturin speaks to his companion, saying, \\"Should you not relieve him of his burden...? Enlightened self-interest, no less than filial piety, demands such a course. Good day to you now, and I thank you for your company.\\"\\"Jack,\\" he said, \\"how do you do?\\"Somehow, instantaneously after speaking to Herapath, Maturin has been transported from the approach to the hospital into Aubrey's room inside the building. No time has elapsed, and no distance has been traversed. Even the transporter aboard the Starship Enterprise takes longer to move a character from one location to another!Such instantaneous teleportation pops up again a hundred pages or so further on when Captain Broke speaks from the deck of his ship: \\"Pass the word for Dr. Maturin\\" and, in the very next sentence, addresses the man he has just sent for: \\"Dr. Maturin, how good of you to come.\\" As written, the words even appear in the very same quotation, as though there were no more than a pause for the single period between the two sentences. The time it took for word to be conveyed to Maturin and for him to ascend to the deck has simply vanished without a trace.As I have opined in reviews of other novels in this series, Russ/O'Brian may be considered a \\"good\\" writer for he does generate a captivating story line and is generally entertaining and attention-holding. However, his repeated stylistic weaknesses and gaffes surely preclude him from being considered \\"great\\" by any but the most superficial readers. Yet, because he does create a captivating historical fiction, I have little problem recommending his series to readers who enjoy the genre--just don't accept his analysis of American idiom at face value!"},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"A year ago I read &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and was impressed. A month ago I read &quot;Post Captain&quot; and was hooked. Now I've read eleven of the installments of what has to be one of the great novels of the century.&quot;The Fortune of War&quot; is an epic, moving installment that works on many levels. Although a Yankee, I can't help but feel for Jack and the Brits as they try to salvage some honor from the War of 1812, a rather dishonorable war for all concerned. Who could fail to be moved by the image of the Constitution holding its fire rather than destroy the helpless Java? Or Captain Lawrence tipping his hat to Jack from the deck of the Chesapeake, only to be killed immediately afterward (O'Brian doesn't mention that it was Lawrence who said &quot;Don't give up the Ship&quot;). The battle scenes are thrilling but tinged with regret.In order to fit Jack and Stephen into actual historical events O'Brian has to put them into the background, and we share their anguish as one British ship after another falls victim to the tiny but tough American navy. Remember, this is during the Napoleonic wars, and the Americans were effectively allied with the Hitler of that day.This book was apparently written with Homer in mind. Jack and Stephen are unwilling participants in historical events, when all they really want to do is to go home, Jack to a new command (so he can come back and whip the Americans) and Stephen to deliver an important message to Sir Joseph. In between battles, shipwreck, near starvation, and certain execution, O'Brian finds time to consider timeless notions of duty, honor, loyalty and freedom."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"The Aubrey/Maturin series seems to get even better with each installment. The Fortune of War begins with Lucky Jack bringing his ship into port after the events of Desolation Island and reaches a thunderous conclusion with historical battle between the Chesapeake and the Shannon. In between O'Brian provides the reader with naval disasters, naval battles, cloak and dagger, tense escapes and even a cricket game! All this is set against the backdrop of the opening months of the War of 1812. The reader lives through unexpected reverses at sea and unanticipated successes on land in what is a tragic and senseless war.In The Fortune of War Aubrey and Maturin spend much of their time in the United States where Louisa Wogan and Diana Villiers of early books reside. The reader gets an excellent feel for the period and place. Interestingly, in what appears to be a nod to modern readers, O'Brian cites the low taxes in the USA. Also, many modern readers might be surprised to read how unpopular \\"Mr. Madison's War\\" was at the time. Ironically what was a nasty, vicious war on the Canada/US border was a gentleman's war at sea. Officers were paroled and free to roam the streets in an enemy city. Ships' captains could write courteous letters to enemy captains inviting them out to engage in bloody naval conflicts. Perhaps the greatest irony was that the two societies with the freest men were engaging in a wasteful conflict while a tyrant was running roughshod over Europe.Perhaps the most interesting perspectives for the naval buff are O'Brian's explanations of initial American successes at sea and their affect on British morale. According to O'Brian American frigates (the largest class they had available) outgunned their RN counterparts. Furthermore, many of their officers and men had learned their gunnery skills on RN ships. However, the RN was also the victim of some its own policies and past successes. The restrictions on the use of gunpowder in practice left Captains without independent means the opportunity to maintain crews with a high level of fighting efficiency. Furthermore, the systems of privilege and patronage had put a number of excellent captains on shore and poor or mediocre captains at the helms of fighting ships. Nelson's successes were also a problem. His approach to attacking French and Spanish ships was inadequate for better trained American crews. For the RN, which had a magnificent track record for decades culminating with Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, the few relatively insignificant tactical losses to the Americans were devastating to morale. Aubrey's reaction demonstrates this thoroughly. The fact that ships like the Constitution were severely damaged and out of action for long periods after victories did not satisfy. Nor did the victories on land in Canada.The Fortune of War features some of the best action sequences that O'Brian put on paper. In particular, the historical battle sequences are riveting. The reader also gets to see the good Dr. Maturin as a man of action. Somewhat surprisingly the gentle doctor can be quite ruthless when the need arises. Rescued from torture by Jack Aubrey earlier in the series, it is now Maturin who plays the role of rescuer.O'Brian has succeeded in providing his most action packed novel to date without sacrificing any of the use of language and insight into human nature that have been constants in the series. This is the best entry to date in what may be the greatest historical series written."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"This is the sixth in the excellent series about a British Navy Captain and his friend the British Intelligence Agent but it is a little different from the previous novels. Steven Maturin the spy is definitely at center stage while Captain Aubrey mostly waits in the wings.This book is therefore, by and large, a spy novel. After being captured with his friend by the U.S. Navy during the War of 1812, Maturin enveavours to keep the Americans from discovering that he is anything but a simple surgeon and naturalist. To make his life even more complicated, his lost love is also living in America and he struggles with his feelings toward her even as ruthless French agents seek him through the twisted streets of Boston.But Captain Aubrey isn't entirely neglected. The English and American Navy are locked in a series of frigate battles and Aubrey and Maturin manage to be in the middle of two of them.O'Brien upholds the outstanding reputation this series has garnered with another fine contribution."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"The previous volume ended with the orchestrated escape of Mrs. Wogan and Michael Herapath from Desolation Island in an American whaler, and the reader knew that &quot;the horrible old LEOPARD&quot; was about to forge on, too, having managed to replace her destroyed rudder. This volume begins in late 1812, with the LEOPARD limping into harbor in the East Indies, with only a sentence or two given to the fate of Gov. William Bligh in Australia -- which didn't strike me as quite fair. The historical Bligh is a very interesting personality. However. The LEOPARD is good now only as a transport, and Jack Aubrey has been told of a nice frigate awaiting his command on his return to England, so he and Dr. Maturin and their followers take homebound passage with an old acquaintance of Jack's. It's a lovely voyage as far as the mid-Atlantic, but then events catch up with them, and they find themselves in a small boat struggling to reach the coast of Brazil. They're rescued by the JAVA -- which is then taken by the CONSTITUTION, the third British frigate to fall to the small U.S. Navy in a very short time. Very depressing for our heroes, but O'Brian doesn't hesitate to laud the abilities of the American seamen and commanders. Maturin and the wounded Jack end up as prisoners of war in Boston, where Stephen Maturin's intelligence activities against Napoleonic France come back to haunt him, and where he joins up again with Diana Villiers, Herapath (father and son), and Louisa Wogan. The focus is more on Maturin in this book than in most of the others (so far), and he shows himself to be quite cold-blooded when necessary in pursuit of his covert objectives. Escape from Boston becomes necessary when it becomes obvious that no exchange is contemplated for them, and they make their way to the SHANNON, which is maintaining the blockade of Boston Harbor, and which sends in a gentlemanly challenge to the CHESAPEAKE to come out and fight -- all of which is historically accurate, though strange to modern notions of warfare. And that brief but epic engagement is where this volume ends, with an obvious segue into the next. The earlier volumes were generally self-contained narratives, with a period of unremarked time passing between them, but the present novels cover too great a series of events to be dealt with properly in a single volume. And the greater the impact they have on history, the more Jack tends to recede into a secondary position -- which is only fair, since O'Brian didn't want to perturb the historical record too greatly. I enjoyed this volume in the series rather more than the last one, perhaps because I'm more knowledgeable than most about the early National period in the U.S. and the War of 1812 in particular. O'Brian does an excellent, balanced job of describing the local political situation in New England, and his powers of characterization are as strong as ever."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"An excellent book, though no less could be expected from O'Brian. I took a considerable amount of time off between Desolation Island and this book so the characters and the nautical terms were a little unfamiliar to me. After the first twenty pages or so the characters, terms and myself came together like three old friends laughing and remembering our past adventures.O'Brian re-introduces characters from his previous books (Diana Villiers, Michael Herapath and Louisa Wogan) which I found tiresome from his previous works. In this book, however, O'Brian uses these three characters to great effect. To see my old friend Stephen Maturin become the ruthless spy I always wanted him to be was exhilirating.This is an excellent book and should be read by anyone who professes a liking for sea stories or historical fiction. Any bibliophile who is aimlessly scanning these reviews and has not read this series should start as soon as possible. Any O'Brian fan who wants to know if this tale is as good as the others in the Aubrey-Maturin series, let not your heart be troubled, it is excellent."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"If you have read the first five in this series you won't need any encouragement from me for you to read this one too, but this book is just so fantastic that I just have to share my opinion. Like the other novels in this series, it is extremely well written and full of very witty dialogue. It is also full of action and suspense both on land and sea. As a matter of fact, I think the action on land, involving Stephen Maturin's activities as a spy, are even more suspenseful than the sea battles, which are also very well done. O'Brian balances his two main characters very well in this book, Aubrey dominating the action at sea and Stephen dominating the action on land. O'Brian also gets the reader involved in his characters' personal lives. For example, Diana returns to the scene in this book, and Stephen wrestles with his conflicting feelings towards her. The two sea battles depicted in this book were real historical battles and O'Brian does a great job making them come to life. Even though I knew who was going to win both battles, they still seemed very exciting and I was still in suspense as to what was going to happen to the fictional characters during these battles. Being an American, it bothers me just a little that the Americans are the bad guys in this book, but O'Brian is very fair in that he never depicts Britain's enemies, whether Spanish, French or Americans, as being particularly evil. They are simply the enemy. In fact, both Aubrey and Maturin like Americans in general. Anyway, novels simply don't get more entertaining than this."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"\\"The Fortune of War\\" continues where \\"Desolation Island\\" left the readers hanging in Patrick O'Brian's previous novel. But rather than being rescued and safe, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are taken out of the frying pan and put in the fire. Whether it is an exploding ship heading home, the pummeling broadsides of the USS Constitution, or the clutches of the fledgling American intelligence network; Patrick O'Brian gives his famous and beloved protagonists almost more than they can handle.Aubrey and Maturin spend the majority of this novel as prisoners of war in Boston, while the War of 1812 continues a series of great victories for the newly founded American Navy. Aubrey, severely wounded, is more of an auxiliary character in this novel, and Stephen Maturin comes fully into the foreground as the main protagonist attempting to save his friends. Diana Villiers also returns to the series, and Maturin must deal with his feelings for her in addition to the American agent with whom she is currently associating. The great intelligence coup Maturin achieved in the previous novel has returned to haunt him, as his powerful enemies close in on all sides. . .This novel is great spy adventure set in Boston, and contains two very well written historical engagements with America's new fleet of frigates- the USS Constitution and the Chesapeake. As a patriotic American, it was a challenging read, as my two favorite literary characters would have been my adversaries if I had been their contemporaries. However, O'Brian writes this story with a well balanced eye to this conflict of interests between the British and American people. Additionally, I have to give a shout out to the USS Constitution, as I am a member of its honorific namesake in the modern American Army- the 1st Armored Division \\"Old Ironsides\\", and have spent some great times in her city of origin, & where she can be seen today: Boston. The one drawback of this story is that it has a substantive portion of the adventure on land. Granted, it is still a great story and very well written, but the magic of journeying across the wild and untamed ocean is not present.While not the best of the Aubrey/Maturin series; I am always eager for more action at sea, \\"The Fortune of War\\" is very readable and enjoyable. It is also essential to read in order as the second installment of the first miniseries within O'Brian's larger story arc. Make sure you start with \\"Desolation Island\\" first."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"For anyone who loves to listen the O'brian's novels read with eloquence and great vocal characterization, go for Patrick O'Tull's version. Seriously, he is much better than Simon's insipid performance."},{"Title":"Fortune of War, The","review":"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to to the book is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I warn you to stay away from any of the versions read by Simon Vance. His are tedious, monotonous readings, in which he is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it. Rather, he gives us wooden characters that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"The Warsaw ghetto memoirs of Janusz Korczak [i.e. Henryk Goldszmit] / translated from the Polish, with an introd. and notes by E.P. Kulawiec","review":"Owing to the fact that Korczak cared for children, it is not surprising that much of his diary is devoted to this subject. He mentions such challenges as child-care tips, discipline, and attempting to heal sick children. He also noted the pains of ageing that he experienced.Korczak makes many interesting comments on various subjects. He often discusses what kind of God he believes in. He also writes: \\"The world doesn't know about a number of great Poles.\\" (p. 8). Korczak mentions Jewish virtues such as cleverness and hard work (p. 102), but also comments: \\"Jews are cocky and that is why they are scorned. I believe that this will change and maybe even soon.\\" (p. 106).Unlike other diarists, Korczak devoted little direct attention to German Nazi actions in the Warsaw Ghetto. The consequences, however, were obvious: \\"A dead boy is lying on the sidewalk. Nearby three boys are fixing something with some rope. At a certain moment they glanced at the body and moved away a few steps, not interrupting their game\\" (p. 43). Korczak, an obvious intellectual, invited others to discussions in his flat about such topics as Napoleon, Leonardo da Vinci, freedom, destiny and free will, etc. (pp. 77-78). These Jewish behaviors shed light on comparable Polish ones. Holocaust materials have commonly featured the Poles engaged in normal activities (riding a carousel, attending Easter Mass, etc.) while the ghetto was burning--all insinuating the cold indifference of Poles to Jewish suffering. They were no such thing. We see that both Poles and Jews simply attempted to live lives as close to normal as possible in the face of all the horrors surrounding them.In the introduction, Kulawiec elaborates on Polish efforts to save Janusz Korczak: \\"When it already became transparent that the days of the orphanage were numbered, friends from the outside proposed concrete plans for his escape. In one such final effort, forged papers were brought, a hide-out in the country prepared, and a safe route mapped out for him. As in all previous offers of help, Korczak declined even this last gesture inasmuch as it was not possible to include all the children in the plans.\\" (p. xi)."},{"Title":"Natural Obsessions : Striving to Unlock the Deepest Secrets of the Cancer Cell","review":"In my senior year of college, we were assigned Natural Obsessions for the relevance to oncology as a science. I had expected, as with all other undergraduate literature, to find only academic value in the book and approached it as such. But what unfolded instead was a journey through the strange and passionate world of research. It is what made me want to become an oncologist.The nature of the story is of the many races during the 1980s to identify the genes causative of cancer. The narrative largely follows one lab, that of Robert Weinberg at MIT, and details their many setbacks and their even more groundbreaking victories. The author takes an active part, effectively becoming absorbed into the research and drawing the readers with her.What the book offers, then, is a daily tread through the lives of basic researchers: not filled with sterile labs and stuffy professors, but with the drama, intrigue, and bittersweet triumphs normally found only in fiction. As there are no outright heroes or villains (except perhaps cancer itself), the moral ambiguity of each of the subplots makes the struggles more human. There is as much backstabbing, cut-throat competitiveness, and outright selfishness in the research world shown here as in any other professional field. But there is also collaboration, celebration, and respect. Anyone who thinks basic science is boring should be convinced otherwise.The other side of the story is, indeed, academic in nature, though interwoven seamlessly with the stories. Despite the heavy scientific concepts throughout the book, Natalie Angier -- a non-scientistist herself -- has taken great pains to evince the most convoluted theories in a light, colorful language. Not all of it will be clear immediately, but the essence of the book doesn't require total familiarity with the technicalities. It is the humanity of the researchers that drives this book, not the research itself.For undergraduates unsure of thier career choices, I can recommend no better book than Natural Obsessions for deciding if scientific research is for them. For some, like one of my friends who chose med school over grad school, the themes of competitiveness and failure can be disheartening. For others, like myself, it can open up a new perspective on science, one that can be exciting as well as rewarding if you have a passion for it."},{"Title":"Natural Obsessions : Striving to Unlock the Deepest Secrets of the Cancer Cell","review":"I have revisited this title recently as I strive to get IT professionals to \\"cross the chasm\\" to understand not only biology, but the culture and values of biologists and research in order to better do bioinformatics. I have never found a book that does this as well as Natural Obsessions, although I have a built-in bias - I was an undergraduate at MIT and a denizen of the Sharp lab on the fifth floor of the Cancer Center, next to the Weinberg lab, just shortly before Natalie arrived to experience life in the Weinberg group. I had the privilege of knowing most of the MIT people in the book, especially Mike Gilman, all of whom have gone on to distinguished research careers. Natalie's description of these folks is largely highly accurate, although it was hard on them after publication of the book in the 80's.I highly recommend this book, not just for its lucid description of molecular oncology for laypeople, but for anyone who wants to know what it's like to be a biologist doing cutting-edge research - without investing 6, 7, or more years of their lives to earn a Ph.D. I wish Natalie would do a sequel - it would also be interesting to see \\"life in the lab\\" not just from the grad student and postdoc perspective, but from these same folks, who are now largely tenured faculty or VPs in biotech.John Greene, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Natural Obsessions : Striving to Unlock the Deepest Secrets of the Cancer Cell","review":"I found this book a few weeks ago only by serendipity.

Yet I would like once more to emphasize te great humanity that pervades this outstanding book. Sometimes it's really moving. I could simply not stop reading it, so enthralling it was. Moreover I would like to suggest to dr. Natalie Angier to think of an updated version with a brief synopsis of the major discoveries of the last decade and also a short dictionary of the most important terms which could be very useful for non biologist readers like me.

And this book is way better than I expected. I do not know whether the author has scientific training background, but reading the book is like talking with a scientist in the specific basal cancer research field for a long time, but not from a reporter. The author's vivid writing illustrate the far from straight knowledge discovery process. It's full of ups and downs of the so many well characterized established scientists, eager postdocs, and fresh Ph.D. students.It's a heavy and fantastic reading experience for me, even it was published first about 25 years ago. You need to have some background information in cancer search to fullly absorb the rich information in this book, but I think everyone will learn something from it.

As an active member of the relationship rescue squad (I was divorced in '03 and remarried in '04), I can truly say this is the best couple's self-help book I've seen - and I've seen dozens.Using a blend of Zen and Behavior Modification, Lewis asks couples to create a \\"relationship vision,\\" a picture or movie of how we want to see ourselves together. Having such a vision to refer to helps us identify when we're off track and provides a model to hold ourselves accountable to. He stresses the need to keep the relationship a priority by setting aside time and reinforcing positive behaviors, and asks readers to list daily, weekly, monthly and yearly activities to continue or start doing together. Such lists are found throughout the book, but they are simple to understand and easily completed, unlike the more complicated workbook-style exercises found in similar books.Accomplishing these simple but gratifying tasks helps battle the number one relationship killer: lack of communication. Even MEN should respond to this logical, step-by-step approach! In plain-spoken style, Lewis explains the characteristics of dependence, independence, and interdependence (test question: which is better?) and gives sample interactions to illustrate ways to create and reinforce the latter. He explains the importance of achieving emotional awareness and clarifies how rules in a relationship are choices that need to be made and negotiated. Communication + understanding = problem solving for positive change. All of us want to feel appreciated, valued and accepted, and this book is the perfect tool for bringing that to our relationships."},{"Title":"Making Right Turns in Your Relationship: How Couples Work Together to Create Change, Enhance Intimacy & Strengthen Communication","review":"In any relationship both partners will have to make choices and be responsible for their actions. Sometimes they will be the right choice and sometimes they will not. When you make a bad choice, or wrong turn, you cause the relationship to experience tension, frustration, and disappointment that you should not have to endure. Making the right turn allows you to avoid these problems and experience more satisfaction in the relationship. While nobody is perfect and so there will always be times when we make a wrong turn, it is possible to learn to identify them early and make the right choices more and more often. This is the goal of this book, to teach the reader how to identify and make those right turns.The author starts by examining the characteristics of both a healthy and unhealthy relationship. From there he moves to understanding and respecting your relationship, creating a vision for where you want your relationship to be, and making it a priority in your life to move in that direction. By the time he gets the reader to this point the author starts asking the reader to consider their answers to various questions to help gain direction for their relationship. For example he asks, \\"What behaviors do you want to stop doing on a daily basis?\\", \\"What behaviors would you like to start implementing daily?\\", \\"Identify several positive characteristics or behaviors of your partner.\\"Other areas the author looks at include the rules and boundaries we live by, how to communicate better, better problem solving skills, creating change, and creating an action plan. If you want to take an active role in improving your relationship this book will help you understand how. There are other books on rescuing or improving a relationship but very few of them go as far as Myron Lewis has done in preparing insightful questions to help the reader decide what is important, what needs to change, and how to achieve that change. Making Right Turns in Your Relationship is highly recommended for anyone who truly wants to work through a plan with their partner to actively create change in their relationship and manage that change to create the best possible relationship."},{"Title":"Making Right Turns in Your Relationship: How Couples Work Together to Create Change, Enhance Intimacy & Strengthen Communication","review":"This book is highly reccommended for anyone who wants to get the best they can out of their relationship with a significant other. Which would included most people. I beleive that while you are working on developing a healthy relationship with your spouse,etc. You may use some of these thoughts and techniques to help strengthen other relationship with friends, family and even strangers. While it is based on the relationship of the significant other, some techiques of listening to others and understanding yourself will benefit your communications skills. We don't get an education on relationship and communication skills in school, and unless you had great examples of parents (which doesn't seem common enough) you can learn these skills now. Enjoy this book and good luck with your relationships. Maria BLackmer-Michigan"},{"Title":"New American Blues: A Journey Through Poverty to Democracy","review":"Go ahead. Say it out loud: &quot;Poverty,&quot; &quot;Poor,&quot; &quot;The Poor.&quot; Most of us feel at least uncomfortable if not repulsed when saying and thinking about these words. We push poverty away, deny its existence, avoid it and its implications. Not Earl Shorris. He plunges right in with his book &quot;New American Blues,&quot; and takes us to places and through thoughts and situations that many of us would never choose to visit. Shorris, with insight like sharp knife, cuts to the quick and calls the question, what happens when people are acted upon? What happens when people are not at liberty to choose their response? Or on an even deeper level, what happens when people do not know that the liberty to choose their response is an option?Poverty in America, the blemish on the model's perfect skin, the scarred lip framing the endless smile, the Achilles heel of the &quot;land of milk and honey,&quot; the ugly duckling shunted aside by the American myth, is what we meet as we travel with Shorris through America's underbelly. Shorris takes the bold step into &quot;the surround&quot; as he calls it, the enclosure, into the pen, into the hopeless, isolated entrapment of the poor in America and asks how this poverty came to be and why it persists. Perhaps a question worth asking in the wealthiest nation on the planet?Through his many examples of the dialogue of hopelessness and entrapment in the surround he brings the dark, perpetual stuckness of poverty in America into the light. For readers with the courage to look, it becomes crystal clear to just what extent the alienation and atomization of the citizens of the USA continue to drive a stake between the American ideals of equality, truth and justice for all -- and the cold bruising reality that is out there hiding (just barely) in the shadows.Shorris highlights the critical importance of supporting the individual in developing the ability to reflect, to develop the capability not simply to fall into the patterns of knee-jerk reaction, but to become conscious of the surround. Through interaction &quot;in the polis,&quot; by becoming involved in our community, with the people around us, the outer dialogue can be changed and a new dialogue can be internalized. It is critical to note that for those whose lives are within the surround of poverty he posits no mind space between stimulus and response, no dialogue allowing for alternatives. Perhaps the experience of Viktor Frankl is illustrative in this regard. I quote from Stephen Covey: &quot;One, day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called &quot;the last of the human freedoms&quot; -- the freedom his Nazi captors could not take away. They could control his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement. His basic identity was intact. He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him. Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response.&quot; Shorris shows that the multigenerational poor in America, the land of the free, are neither aware of nor able to activate this power. The poor abdicate their option to decide for themselves, and the structure in which they live reinforces that abdication.However, there is a thread of hope in the tapestry Shorris weaves for the reader as he poignantly reminds us that the clutches of the surround can be broken. Each individual must transform from unconsciously apolitical to consciously political awareness. As the forces of our consumer society press us toward alienation, we must turn the tide and engage. Though we live in the mass, perhaps the most profound solutions do lie within the individual, and can be activated through participation and integration. If that is so, what are we doing with the precious individuals in our land?"},{"Title":"New American Blues: A Journey Through Poverty to Democracy","review":"This book is about confronting poverty, about empowering the poor to take control of their lives, and is thus a major sociological document (though adoption of its agenda would put a small army of social fix-it people out of work). Just as important, though, it is a book about education, one that validates once again the irreplaceable treasure of a liberal education. The American educational establishment is in thrall to vocationalism, particularly, to preparation for corporate life (see &quot;What Business Wants from Higher Education&quot;). Aristotle warned us about this narrowly utilitarian view of mental culture, calling it the education of a slave. Taking to heart Robert Hutchins' aphorism (&quot;The best education for the best is the best education for all&quot;), Shorris took his idealism to the inner city and put a group of social cast-offs in touch with their powers--their intelligence, their sensitivity, their decency. Most went on to study successfully in college. We can't clone Mr. Shorris once, much less the thousands of times necessary to staff all the classrooms where someone like him is needed, but we can urge teachers and administrators to read his book. His book is a blessed antidote to the mountains of New Age educational tracts touting panaceas like cyber instruction, collaborative learning, education &quot;tailored to the individual learning styles of each student,&quot; and other approaches that stress method at the expense of content."},{"Title":"New American Blues: A Journey Through Poverty to Democracy","review":"If you care about the future of this country, read this book"},{"Title":"Think on these things","review":"I have read this book numerous times.

This novel is extremely rich in detail about Glen Canyon's history - long before The Dam, as well as about the construction of the dam itself. And in the mix is a first-rate thriller of a novel with inspiring characters, suspense, and a wholly-satisfying ending. I can only hope and pray the author is a prophet!"},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"If you've ever experienced the pain of not being able to travel somewhere you desperately wanted to go, then &quot;Glen Canyon&quot; is for you. Steven Hannon has crafted a work that would make James Michener a fan. By drawing on his own life experience and education, he is able to draw us into the lives of three friends who once traveled through the magnificent Glen Canyon, an experience which changed their lives. They devise a plan to restore the canyon to the state Nature intended, and are confronted with problems of varying degrees along their route. The real beauty of this book is that, in Michenerian style, it educates the reader as to how the unlikely folly of Glen Canyon Dam became reality, how easily different forces could undue it, and some amazingly technical science that would be a spoiler to explain. Also, this book is a must for anyone who has ever spent time on the water under sail."},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"I bought the book the day it showed up at the store. Fantastically well researched on the technical side. (nearly a Clancy novel in it's technical detail) The novelist is obviously still new at his craft as some of the writing seems a bit strained, but the story and plot are exceptionally well thought out as well as supported by all the technical detail. I not only will read it again, I've already passed it on to several friends with a strong recommendation to read it. Glen Canyon deserves to be brought back to life and Lake Foul drained... hopefully by non-nuclear means... Read it."},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"It's many pages seemed imposing, but once I got started I was hooked. The inundation of Glen Canyon was a tragedy, but the Colorado River waits. And I await the return of Glen Canyon."},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"The first 200 pages of this 632 page book was so detailed that I wanted to just get on with it. The last 400 I could hardly take a breath or put it down. I know the country pretty well but someone unacquainted with Canyon Country needs the introduction to get a sense of what is here. Accurate science and geography, a very mature way of removing what Ed Abby could have only raved about, GLEN CANYON DAM! I have met the author (it is one of our llamas on the back cover) and I didn't realize how talented he is. Recommendation: Read the book, See the canyon."},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"Glen Canyon by Steven Hannon is an intricately woven novel surrounding the conviction that the free flow of the Colorado River should be restored through exquisite Glen Canyon, which now languishes under Powell Reservoir behind the Glen Canyon Dam. The narrative's detail reflects exhaustive research concerning the building and structural integrity of the Dam. Keeping with his ideology of environmental concern, the book is printed on 100% recycled fiber, acid and chlorine free. This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"You will love this book. Having spent many a summer on Lake Powell, I've often wondered what lies below the waterline. During the recent years of drought, we have gotten a glimpse of what it all must have looked like in a pristine condition.The image the author paints of the destruction of that abomination called Laughlin is worth the price of admission!Read a book written by someone who obviously has a passion for the area. Well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Glen Canyon","review":"I was given this big thick book for christmas; my wife knows I'm a longtime fan of Edward Abbey and the Monkey Wrench Gang, and a longtime lamenter of the paradise lost of Glen Canyon. Well, this book is just splendid. So rich in details about the canyon and the dam. And then the action and suspense of the story! Man, I could not put this big fat heavy book down! Right up to the end I was in doubt about the outcome. Nerve-wracking! And indeed the outcome is as hoped-for, completely satisfying. A &quot;happy ending&quot; without being sentimental. This book is so impressive in its scope and breadth; it must have taken the author many years to research and write. I can't wait to go down to Utah to see that damn dam. After reading this book I feel like Glen Canyon and the dam are, well, a part of me. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to every fan of Ed Abbey. Ed himself, I am sure, would have loved it.

But the book is a classic and promises many hours of enjoyable cooking & eating."},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus and the participation of the Jews in the Spanish and Portuguese discoveries","review":"A 19th century historical work that has been recovered. Evidently this is a dated study on the role of Jews from Spain and Portugal in the discoveries made in America, and more specifically on the connection with Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n (his authentic Spanish name).It is still an interesting read if you want to see the story from a different view than our modern eye: it was still being considered whether the natives of America were (or not) descendants of the 10 tribes of Israel!It seems to me a little chaotic in its composition, like a potential book of 500 pages had been summarized into a little more than a hundred. I mean: date, locations and names flow unrestrained thru the pages.Incongruencies also abound, maybe as a result of not clarifying the background of the story. For instance, when you would think that no more Jews would be found in possession of any reaches, and that the ones left (who survived) would be destitute, more of them appear in the scene as if nothing had happened to their brethren before. I read the book expecting to find more info on the Jewish origin of Col&oacute;n's family (as it has now been established), but nothing is said about it. There is an interesting comment by the author in page 80 about the words that Col&oacute;n puts in his journal concerning the expulsion of the Jews from Spain: \\"without a word of disapprobation (...) his apathetic words are indicative of his fanaticism. This trait he did not, however, import from Italy, which at that time was a preeminently republican and commercial country\\", says Keyserling. This is another instance where a historian captures the incongruity of considering Col&oacute;n an Italian, however in this case unconsciously. But indeed his alleged nationality has never been satisfactorily proved, only assumed. In this respect there is a more logical version for his geographic origin, this being situated in Galicia, the northwest of Spain. This more logical, as well as documented, possibility was proved by J. M. Mosqueira Manso already in the first half of the 20th century (see \\"La cuna gallega de Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n\\")."},{"Title":"Split Ends","review":"Wow!

You feel for her....and love her. Very readable."},{"Title":"Split Ends","review":"I'm sorry to say, I bought this book because of all the great reviews posted here and I feel cheated. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I had to force myself to keep turning pages since I always feel a sense of obligation to complete a book. The writing is amateur at best with an attempt at snappy dialog that miserably fails. The characters are flat and difficult to see. And the sex scenes, to me, weren't at all sexy. Throughout the book, we're put inside the head of the neurotic narrator, Ellen, reading all her thoughts in italic. But it's the worst when she's having sex. Like the act itself, I consider something sexy when it takes me away from all that. There was simply no turning back from my sense of distaste when she discovered the size of her lover's assests and went on and on. It was like reading porn. Bad porn.I think the last page sums it up the entire experience of reading this book. The author writes: \\"The End, Thank God.\\" That's exactly how I felt. Clearly an accomplished journalist, I think she tested the waters with fiction by publishing this book and sadly, it's not her strongest suit. Perhaps the future will hold better material and I'll keep my eye out for it."},{"Title":"Split Ends","review":"I LOVED IT! A real page-turner. I connected in so many ways. I'm familiar with the expressions AND the fantasies. They don't go away even at 70! I loved the narrative and the chapters where Ellen and Drew reconnect. WHO WOULDN'T?!

In a most unique voice, the author allows us to get inside the mind and emotions of Ellen Gold - a crazy, fun-loving 50-year-old who is trying to find her way after being betrayed by her husband. Ellen is deep, wacky and full of off-color observations about life, rebirth and love. I recommend this book for both sexes! It's a great, spicy read."},{"Title":"The demand for child care and child care costs: Should we ignore families with non-working mothers? (Working paper)","review":"Many of the poems in Janet Shepperson's first collection take a sometimes satirical, sometimes serious look at the changing ways in which women see themselves, their world and their relationship with men - from the light-hearted assertion of independence in \\"Dancing on Ice, to the exhaustion and bewilderment of \\"Female nude\\".The backdrop of Northern Ireland gives undercurrents of ambiguity, anxiety and sorrow to much of the work - a sorrow that finds an echo in the poems dealing with miscarriage and childlessness. The settings move from the urban landscapes of the poets home in Ballynafeight, Belfast, to the rocky and often bleak landscapes of Donegal - landscapes which themselves become symbolic of fear, loss and ultimately of survival.About the AuthorJanet Shepperson was born in Edinburgh in 1954. She took a degree in English at Aberdeen University where she won the Calder Verse Prize. She has lived in Belfast since 1977, and has been a creative writing tutor with adult students and in the Maze prison. Her poetry and short stories have been published in journals and anthologies notably The Blackstaff Book of Short Stories (volumes 1 and 2), and Trio 5, also Blackstaff. She has been short-listed twice for a Sunday Tribune/Hennessy Award. She has published two chapbooks of poetry, A Ring with a Black Stone and Madonna of the Spaces, both with Lapwing, belfast. This is her first full collection."},{"Title":"Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry","review":"This book provides an introduction to powder diffraction theory as well as a comprehensive list of everything involved with the actual diffractometer. This is not just a theory book nor a technical manual. It describes clearly all the factors involved in the production of x-rays, the workings of motors and detectors to the reasons for using divergence slits as well as the principles of phase identification and quantitative analysis. It is a great book for someone who will be using a diffractometer for the first time and will be doing the work themselves. This is not a crystallography text. It is more a handbook of practical applied powder diffraction.

I went through the fire academy and spent the past few years using IFSTA Essentials to study with. I found the Firefighter's Handbook to be much more entertaining and enlightening.

Read and understand the title before buying this book.This review refers to the previous edition to this one.I found the text ordered well, with most examples clearly explained. There were some minor bugs in the code which a beginning java programmer would struggle with.After finishing the book, and running the examples, and working through several of the exercises, I found that I understand OOP much better, and of course understand java better too.I've noted several people who don't know java syntax are frustrated by the book, as they are expecting to learn java from it, and are never reaching the point where they will learn OOP or java from the book.In conclusion, don't buy the book to learn java, buy it only if you need to learn OOP and are having difficulty doing so."},{"Title":"Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java","review":"Though Mr Budd's language is a little abstract but he has presented the ideas to understand Object Oriented Concepts very good. This book is not for starters rather persons having little knowledge of object orientation can benefit from it a lot. I think this book is not a basic rather intermediate level book for understanding object oriented programming. Overall this is a good book and must be kept for reference purposes."},{"Title":"Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java","review":"Don't buy this book if you're a beginning programmer or need to learn the syntax. I suggest learning that from the web.Budd has a way of explaining OOP that made it much clearer now even after hearing it explained at least a dozen times to me. The examples are solid and not silly."},{"Title":"Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java","review":"Some content such as collections are not really comprehensive and some code even not work well. And this book is so basic book and the example code is not represented the knowledge. Avoid this book if you really want to improve your java ability."},{"Title":"Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java","review":"If you bought this book hoping to learn Java, prepare yourself for a convoluted mass of unrelated code and disorganized presentation of Java concepts. A language as horrible as Java requires quite a bit more background and basics on the tricks and traps of the language than this book provides, especially for those of us gifted enough to have learned C or C++ first. My advice for those wanting to learn Java is to get Sams Teach Yourself Java in 21 days; it is so much more thorough and complete, especially with important topics such as the AWT and Java event model.Considering the OOP side of it, the book was actually quite complete and thorough--assuming you are well grounded in the basic concepts of object-oriented programming first. Like too many OOP books, it is wordy, far too abstract, and chock full of all the annoying buzzwords and lingo that characterize the paradigm. If you are making the transition from structured programming to object-oriented, C++ is almost certainly better than Java, for Java forces you to program OOP. A C to C++ transition book is likely just what the doctor ordered. UOOP is not.And how would I know all this? My object-oriented programming class used this book."},{"Title":"Mad Strikes Back Book 2 (Mad Reader)","review":"You have to hold this book sideways to read it so there you already look a bit Mad to begin with.In the 1950s America was a very conservative place so when Mad hit the newsstands of anytown USA it was like the cultural equivelant of an A-bomb going off. Mad parodied anything that moved and was freshest and most vital in the beginning of its run.The parodies remain a fresh today as they did then with hundreds of small sight gags that will take more than one rereading to find."},{"Title":"Mad Strikes Back Book 2 (Mad Reader)","review":"Funny stuff from the early days of Mad.

This book is my equal-favorite, alongside his Dynamic Pawn Play in Chess.The charm of this book is that the author uses such a wonderful blend of examples. Original classic games are mixed in with both modern examples, and with little-known (but instructive) games from different eras. Marovic is well-known as an experienced trainer. His considered selection of past games where certain positional themes were invented or made famous is a chess education in itself.The very experienced player who has already studied the classics may find familiar examples. But for the great majority of competitive players, a dose of Marovic will be just what is needed for all-round strategic benefit. Fine quality examples and fine quality writing."},{"Title":"Secrets of Positional Chess","review":"I have to admit, I stink at positional chess. This is a great book because it helps explain positional chess ideas to the non-master player. The author gives many useful examples. I have hundreds of books on chess, but if I had to choose only 10, this would be one of them. Want to make a jump in rating points? Want to go from B to A player? This is a book that can really help. Also check out his other books about pawns. Gambit books rule!!!!!"},{"Title":"Secrets of Positional Chess","review":"I picked this book at a recent Malaysian local PCMM open in Kuala Lumpur. I was interested in the title having read \\"Excelling in Positional Chess\\" by Aagard.The chapters started with analysing chess space: Strong Weak Squares, then continuing to Files / Diagonals, 1st and 2nd ranks and outposts. The other chapters discusses specifically on the strenghts/weaknesses of each piece: King, Queen, Rook, and Minor Pieces.I admired his excellent analysis as he is able to illustrate the pivotal square(s) being subtly fought for, and the possible variations. Remember these are GrandMaster vs GrandMaster games and not Amateur vs Master. For those still stuck between 1500-1900, I believe this would be good book to rub off \\"grandmaster\\" techniques on your play.However if you are still being caught with opening traps, and knight forks; you are probably under 1500; you should look at other beginner books.Malaysian Chess tournaments - watch out for me this year !!"},{"Title":"Secrets of Positional Chess","review":"I purchased my copy from Chesscafe.com years ago and then as now it's a GOOD buy for an introduction to the motifs of positional chess play. It has two major parts: Sthrength and Weakness in Space, broken down into five subsections and Chess pieces: Strength and weaknesses, broken into four subsections. Each section is given numerous games and comments to highlight the themes involved. It gives the reader a starting point to LOOKING for these themes in their personal games and over time, gain improvemnt and mastery. Hey, it's all about learning and growing in the game! Best wishes....."},{"Title":"Secrets of Positional Chess","review":"The book is written in a good style, not too complex, clearly mentioned goals and rules for the all readers, but there are quite a lot of typos in the book and too many examples are incorrect.

The sections which deal with static and genetic phenomenology are worth the price of purchase alone. Welton's introduction does a fine job of setting up the terrain, as well as discussing the aforementioned debates in the literature. (Although I don't find any real basis in another reviewer's claims about the &quot;homo-eroticism&quot; implicit in Husserl's texts.) Especially given the price of the Kluwer editions of Husserl's works, one simply can't go wrong with this book. For those interested in phenomenology, or 20th Century philosophy in general, Welton's book is indeed essential."},{"Title":"The Essential Husserl: Basic Writings in Transcendental Phenomenology (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"Husserl published two long books, The Logical Invesigatnons and Ideas Pertaining to the Pure Phenomenology. He wrote very much more than he published, leaving shelves of unfinished manuscripts. He also gave some fairly complete public lectures. Relative to the volume of his total output, only fragments of his work are tranlated into English and these aren't always representative of Husserl's best ideas or affordable for the student. Examples: as far as I know, Thing and Space has no English translation and Husserl would agree that the price of Cartesian Mediations is absurd. It's nice to have this reasonably priced and representative selection of Husserl texts. They start near the beginning of Husserl's published work (around 1900 if I remember rightly) and take us through about 40 years of his phenomenological labors."},{"Title":"The Essential Husserl: Basic Writings in Transcendental Phenomenology (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"This work is better appreciated after one has gained some introduction to HUsserl.

What is especially remarkable is that it contains 'essential writing' that has been for many years suppressed. It is a little known fact that late in his career Husserl moved from the consideration of the transcendental ego to a pheneomenology of that ego's 'bodified' being. Institutional powers-that-be were wary of disclosing this 'turn' due to the blatant homo-eroticism present in Husserl's analysis. Welton has risked alienating himself from the academic community, and should be praised for his courage and commitment to unearthing the truth, whatever that might be. Moreover, included in this collection is a fine introduction by Welton which introduces the reader to the political infighting which surrounded the publication of this text and nearly tore the community of Husserl scholars asunder. A daring, timely introduction to Husserl's work. I recommend this book unreservedly."},{"Title":"The Essential Husserl: Basic Writings in Transcendental Phenomenology (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"Though a difficult text to read, it offers a great overview of husserl's phenomenology. should be combined w/ heideggers time and being"},{"Title":"the mother market [ formerly the mummy market]","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase.

We've heard actor Michael J. Fox talk publicly about his life with PD, and like Fox, Edey provides a service to those who read his words.

I think I purchased one copy of each of his works, and have been making my way through them all, (sometimes jumping back and forth), and Intentions is really a wonderful collection of some of his very witty, and very cutting stories. My favorite was 'The Decay of Lying' which is a subject I noticed Wilde writes about in many of his works, like in Dorian Gray.For some reason, this book is missed but many, and I myself just found it by accident, so do yourself a favor and read it! This is a charming and delightful edition!And if you want to read about lying in Dorian Gray:The Picture of Dorian Gray"},{"Title":"Intentions","review":"It has been said that Intentions may be the most important of Oscar Wilde's critical works. Included in it are four essays: \\"The Decay of Lying,\\" \\"Pen, Pencil and Poison,\\" \\"The Critic as Artist,\\" and \\"The Truth of Masks.\\"\\"The Decay of Lying\\" -- from 1889 -- is an essay couched as a dialogue that Wilde once called it a \\"trumpet against the gate of dullness.\\" The substance revolves around Wilde's Aestheticism, and he argues (through one character and another) that Art is superior to Nature. . . .\\"Pen, Pencil and Poison\\" -- from 1889 -- is a biographical essay on the notorious writer, murderer, and forger Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, who used the pen name \\"Janus Weathercock,\\" and here Wilde puts forward the notion that that Wainewright's criminality reveals the soul of a true artist.In \\"The Critic as Artist,\\" -- 1890 -- The Wilde's contends that critics must reach beyond the creative work that he considers.\\"The Truth of Masks\\" (1885) is an argumentative response to an article of Edward George Bulwer-Lytton's which put forward the notion that Shakespeare had little interest in the costumes that his characters wore.Brilliant and (as always) so well put, Wilde is a joy to read - food for the mind and soul. This is a nice well put together edition - all Wilde lovers well want."},{"Title":"Intentions","review":"First, this is a lovely edition and well worth the money, and it arrived right on time, actually faster than I expected.Second, the book.Not just a wit, Wilde was an intellectual power house. You don't have to agree with him on everything, just enjoy his ability to make his own argument. In \\"Pen, Pencil and Poison\\", read how Wilde playfully argues the question, 'is a criminal an artist?' Fascinating!Superior book, lots of wit and it will stretch your mind."},{"Title":"Intentions","review":"During a timid spring day inside a small library somewhere in Nottinghamshire, there is an ongoing debate about the philosophical meaning of Art.Cyril is a cultured man a lover of art it seems that he lives inside a painting , he usually describe in detail what there is around him entranced by the beautiful of the nature.Vivian on the contrary is a girl of essence; her vision of the world is characterized by cause and effect, everything is well organized, by the mother nature.Her philosophy is those of a world in decadence where every behavior is dictated by our selfishness rather than appreciation of things.In the first pages of this short story, there is an interesting debate in telling that nature and visual art are two different and incompatible entities, in the sense that a paintings is nothing else that the perception of the artist.A painting is nothing else the visual preferences of the artist that does not represent the image or better the intrinsic message of the observer.Vivian is writing an interesting article \\"The Decay of Lying\\" for a prestigious and intellectual magazine.Her personal consideration of the visual art has not a positive valence, because according to her thought a painting is nothing else that a personal projection of a particular detail, chose by the artist, without considering its complex context.This does not happen regarding the novels as a tool for analyzing people under different and variegate point of views, with a risk of nullify supported by her phrase;\\"The more one analyses people, the more all reasons for analysis disappear\\"The essence of this phrase is the description of a complex and interconnected world, where everything must be defined in detail like a surgeon.In my opinion for her the art is a sort of metaphor of the modern world that is going to in the wrong direction, for instance the art under the metaphysical prospective is a sort of Darwinism where the main risk is for the next generations which will be based on the art to judge their present.The main reason is that the \\"Art never express anything but itself\\" in brief the art will influence the realism giving a negative social model, the art does not represent what the artists see but they depict the ideology of the commitment.CheersItalo"},{"Title":"Intentions","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

There is overlap, of course, but the pair worked quite well as a tandem. In fact, the students gave me a lot of positive feedback on the books. We focused on the Web Design book and used the HTML book primarily as a reference.Web Design is a very straightforward presentation of design fundamentals. It was refreshing to find in the book so many bits of design advice that I have pedaled. Moreover, the writing is lively and concise.The publisher makes available a CD-ROM that contains PowerPoint lectures, a test bank, and an instructor's manual. I can't comment on the test bank -- I seldom use them -- but I found the lectures to be useful as starting points for my own in-class presentations.The book would be improved by more depth in topics such as navigation, information architecture, and usability.

But be warned, a lot of work is needed to prepare the dishes. Most of his recipes require that you prepare an additional sauce or prep-kit (like his bean kit that can be used for soups or BBQ sauce), so you have to read the recipes very carefully. If you do spend the time, you will be greatly rewarded.Norman's dishes are all generally rich and spicy. His themes are Caribbean and South American, with Asian and European (primarily French and Spanish) influences. He uses a lot of Habanero (VERY hot), red onion, assorted tubers, and plantains, he is clearly very influenced by creole cooking (he is based in Florida afterall).Starters: He has a great &quot;starter&quot; section with drinks (his delicious &quot;Hot Lolita&quot; is a tequila drink with honey and hot peppers) and accompanying nibblers (Norm's &quot;Not and Nasty Nuts&quot;, peanuts baked and spiced); a great way to kick off a dinner party. His guacamole with fried plantain chips are great for picnics. He also has an eggplant with goat cheese that is simply excellent.Soups: Very very rich, but oh so good. He has a plantain chicken soup that is to die for. Again, so rich it's good in small portions for a dinner party. He also has a gazpacho that is completely unlike any you've tasted, and a &quot;conch&quot; soup that he says his &quot;patrons would riot if I took it off the menu&quot;. I believe him.Salads and Main dishes: Tea Spiced Pan Seared Tuna and Spinach Salad has become one of my favorite quick meals (great citrus dressing). Juicy steaks (venison and traditional beef), lobster dishes, chicken (creole in nature), and others, his main dishes are a little eclectic, but generally excellent.You'll also find side dishes (lots of peruvian potato and boniate sides), sauces, and prep kits in the back which I've enjoyed. I made BBQ oysters with his BBQ sauce and they we're superb. He has desserts, bit I personally haven't gone there yet...If you are into the effort (for intermediate to advanced cooks) and like or want to get into (spicy) fusion then you should buy this book.

There are some fairly simple bread recipes in this book that I want to try; and I can testify that the Key Lime Cheesecake with a Toasted Nut Crust (page 258) is as good a cheesecake recipe as I have ever seen. I believe the secret is that the eggs are separated. The cake is as light as a souffle when done. I have baked it three times now, and my friends cannot get enough of it. (This recipe alone makes the book worth owning.) Directions are minimal, however, so you're on your own. (For example, you are never told to grease the springform pan. Neither are you given any indication as to how the cake will look when done.)What this book does provide, however, is insight into what a meal would be like at Norman's Restaurant.

The story Erdrich tells is one of family and tradition (and an old stove). The story is told simply and well, and it is peppered with Native American legend and tradition. For this reason, I wonder if the book would not be better suited to Native children more than non-Native children. I have read Erdrich's novels, so I have a passing familiarity with terms like \\"Windigo\\", but I'm not sure most non-Native children would and this might confuse them.While I am a fan of Erdrich's other work (including the young adult novel: The Birchbark House), this isn't a book that I would be excited to read to my children (when I have some). It isn't quite as accessible or has a simplistic enough feel to it. Maybe I'm not giving children enough credit, but I would recommend something like Alison McGhee's \\"Countdown to Kindergarten\\" over this one. Instead of this, you might want to give Erdrich's first children's book, \\"Grandmother's Pigeon\\", a try.

But it embodied a mind-set that went far beyond clothes: i.e., there was One Right Way to succeed in business, and, if you didn't have the correct behaviors and attitudes, you might as well kiss your career hopes goodbye. Although business dress and workplace behavior have both become more casual in recent years, there's still a prevailing belief that, to reach the highest echelons of a corporation, you must be hard-nosed and ruthless.I found Wolaner's book refreshing because of her candor: her analysis of her mistakes is especially enlightening because it's easy to understand why she made them (and how we could easily fall into the same trap). I wholeheartedly agree with her that \\"business is personal,\\" and that gratitude and respect will not only make the workplace more humane but ultimately contribute to the success of your business. But to me her most important point is this: you succeed in business not by blindly imitating a model of the Perfect Executive, but by being your authentic self. When she or other CEOs made a decision based on a need to \\"look tough\\" or avoid loss of face, it backfired; when the decision was based on what \\"felt right\\" to the person making it, it turned out much better."},{"Title":"Naked in the Boardroom: A CEO Bares Her Secrets So You Can Transform Your Career","review":"This is a good read.

You will succeed because of, not in spite of, your personal traits. The trick is to make your aptitude and flair work for you in a style that is uniquely yours.

This is a skill that can be honed, and this book - and taking on the challenges presented to you - will show you how to do that. Page viii\\"The personal approach in the book is somewhat unsettling when she gets into the parts where the men she meets look to take advantage of her as a woman. The perspective is insightful. She approached a situation as a simple meeting and yet there were already opportunities for it to be something other than the simpleness of her perspective. Hindsight is usually 20/20 but the outside observer I think would have raised red flags earlier than she acknowledges. Other than that, the situations are handled appropriately. I wonder how some of the men she writes of would have written of the same event?\\"Naked Truth #4 --- Terrible things can happen to a women in business; the victims let it ruin their careers, the victors move on.\\"Moving on is a good thing. Good or bad, recognize the learning experience and go forward. Dwelling in the past, especially on the glory of a past accomplishment is as hindering to an individual as continuing to dwell on a wrong done. The chip on the shoulder is far more obvious to those around.\\"... early jobs helped me develop an important skill: finding satisfaction in achievements I could measure myself, and not to rely on praise from my boss. Page 25\\"She has been a life long learner. She appears to be a good observer of people.\\"Think about it: If progression up the career ladder is tied to achievement, the law of averages means that your bosses in your early jobs will be the least skilled ones you will encounter. You will need to measure your own performance and create your own report card. This is a skill worth developing, because if your boss later in your career is like I am, she will ask you to do a self-evaluation rather than give you one out of the blue. (It's less work for her.) So early on, learn to figure out the measures of success, and hold yourself to them. Page 27\\"The key aspect of success in life is where you start. If you can look at yourself in the mirror, know and accept who you are, and be able to execute within that arena, Robin says this in several ways during this book.\\"Become your own toughest critic, but don't share the self-criticism. Page 27\\"Definitely good advice. People think that are being helpful and honest when they share their faults. On the one hand, they are. On the other hand, it can easily be spun to be a negative. Don't put yourself down. Acknowledge needing to learn but done reveal the specifics.\\"Learning happens in every job but you have to pay attention. Page 34\\"Attention is so critical to life and business. By paying attention to what is happening you should be able to recognize what is an opportunity, a door opening especially for you to take, or a dead end where you need to sit back and evaluate the situation before proceeding.I can picture Robin sitting in a hotel lobby, settled in one of the comfy chairs, legs crossed and talking through the chapters in this book. She would punctuate some of the stories with laughter, some with sternness, some stories even with some brief bitterness, but always with a drive forward. A willingness and eagerness to do something different and successful. While she apparently was sitting on the sidelines to work on this book and raise her daughter, I can not see her sitting on the sidelines for long. She needs to be back in the business world.For good business advice in an easy read, I heartily recommend Naked in the Boardroom by Robin Wolaner."},{"Title":"Naked in the Boardroom: A CEO Bares Her Secrets So You Can Transform Your Career","review":"Started in 1987, Parenting Magazine was the brainchild of Robin Wolaner. Wolaner, the former publisher of Mother Jones Magazine and a former executive vice president of CNET, created Parenting magazine from the ground up.Built around her firsthand experience, she offers a perspective on the role of the female CEO \\"from within the ranks\\". This was so much more than a general commentary on being a successful woman. \\"Naked in the Boardroom\\" is an illustration of the positive power of words when used correctly. I received a quality education in the art of boardroom politics, saving me many hours if not years of unnecessary career mistakes and blunders.'I didn't have any money,' said Robin Wolaner. 'I thought, Who would invest in me? I don't even have an M.B.A.' I had never heard the term venture capital. My husband said, 'So what that you don't have any money?.'~Beating Time Warner at Its Own Game By Deirde Carmody"},{"Title":"Naked in the Boardroom: A CEO Bares Her Secrets So You Can Transform Your Career","review":"Robin Wolaner wholeheartedly believes that her willingness to show emotion, sensitivity and, yes, even vulnerability, in the workplace is the reason she succeeded in business. Her refreshing, candid book is more of a memoir than a business text or a step-by-step guide. In it she reveals business lessons through the lens of her own experiences. Her purpose is to help women utilize their unique strengths, follow their intuition and sharpen their decision-making skills. The practical tips at the end of each chapter simplify this process for the reader. Although Wolaner makes every effort to be as emotionally \\"naked\\" on the pages as she tried to be in the boardroom, she does now and then slip into a self-congratulatory or even slightly self-justifying tone, but she brings lots more to the table than that. getAbstract suggests that her frank, autobiographical business book is the perfect read for women who want to learn by example.

The feeling is real; the change in circumstances may not be.\\"\\"She spends at least as much time on her failures as her successes and draws lessons from all her experiences.I got the feeling that at first this book was aimed at businesswomen, and then was recast as a general business book. Probably a book positioning move, and the book doesn''t suffer from it. That said, there are some lessons that apply specifically to women, for example \\"\\"Naked Truth #45: Women are damned as aggressive if we negotiate for more pay, and damnably underpaid if we don't.

The fundamental difference between this and the free, 3.5-updated Dark Sun info recently published in Dragon and Dungeon is minimal. The fluff factor is higher than I expected and since I haven't gotten into Epic play or Psionics, those additions weren't of much value to me.That said, it's a very 'pretty' book with high-quality artwork supporting some interesting prestige classes, spells and feats. I didn't feel cheated so much as somewhat let down. :-\\\\"},{"Title":"Player's Guide to Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Accessory)","review":"This books basic premise is that&quot;This collection of Faernian lore and arcana allows you to create and equip an endless array of characters braced for the challenges they'll encounter...Player's Guide to Faern provides a v.3.5 update to the Forgotten Realms setting&quot;In other words, it's the one stop shop for character creation in a 3.5 Forgotten Realms game. In this it fails almost completely.There are a few highlight1. The regional feat system has been enhanced with new and interesting feats added to it.2. Initiate Feats are a nice addition, and really help differentiate between clerics. Though having only a half dozen gods represented and no rules for making new initiate feats seems a bit limiting.3. The Faerun cosmology is well explained. Though I don't see this as being totally appropriate for a book that is supposed to be for &quot;creat[ing] and equip[ing]&quot; characters.These highlights are completely overshadowed by the book's faults.1. There are rampant editing mistakes. Spells that don't exist are referenced, pictures are mislabled, there are numerous errors from where they copy/pasted out of 3.0 books, and many other editing mistakes call into question the validity of every rule presented.2. The book claims that all you need are the core books and campaign setting. This just isn't true. Outside of the core rule books 11 other sourcebooks are referenced. Several of the new prestidge classes that are not playable without extra source books.3. Spells got updated for 3.5, which essentially means that they nerfed a lot and took all the restrictions off others. What they didn't do was cover enough of the spells. There are spells that were included where the only change was to add them to another classes spell list. As they give a comprehesive spell list, they could have saved that space for fixing spells they neglect to fix.Had this book been a comprehensive collection of character creation information, with updates of everything to 3.5 that weighted in at 400+ pages and a cost of $60+ I would likely be raving about it. Instead you can chalk one up to the WotC merchandising machine for getting me to spend $32 that would have been better spent on an actual source book."},{"Title":"Player's Guide to Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Accessory)","review":"Player's Guide to Faerun is a very good FR supplement, but it lacks any information on the facts that happened (are going to happen depending on the year your campaign is going on) after the Year of The Rouge Dragons.

Out of 191 pages, I will be using these 20 some odd pages.Additionally, Wizards has failed to understand their own customers... Each new book excitedly proclaims how many new FEATS, PRESTIGE CLASSES and SPELLS that the book contains. At this point, with Dragon, d20 OGL products and WotC material, there are a mind-boggling number of each of these, with only minor and typically insignificant differences between many. While I like choices as much as the next RPG player, the novelty of splicing different class abilities together and calling them a prestige class has become tired.What we're looking for, if I may be so bold to speak for my fellow gamers, is new contextual material. The &quot;Campaign Journal&quot; section of this book was billed as 'Current Events', but rather than breaking new ground, or exposing new information, it merely regurgitates the plotlines of recent FR novels.So if you're one of the slavishly devoted purchasers of WotC products, a by-product of the previously quality material that the company *had* been putting out for years...Stop.You're encouraging them (with your hard-earned dollars) to publish respun garbage under the guise of NEW and IMPROVED.Let's band together and vote with our dollars. Support the d20 labels putting out quality literature for discerning gamers (Malhavoc Press), not the tripe that's rolling out of what seems to be the nadir of WotC products."},{"Title":"Player's Guide to Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Accessory)","review":"I was really looking forward to this book for a long time. When I first got it in the mail, it was a bit of a disappointment. I guess this was because I was comparing this to other FR releases like The Silver Marches, The Unapproachable East, Underdark, Lords of Darkness, etc., books whose quality were top notch (for WotC books) and had a good amount of fluff (for my taste). I started liking the PGtF when I started planning for a new campaign because it lessened the time for character creation significantly because I didn't have to look through multiple books for feats and stuff. The 3.5 revisions weren't too bad overall. My only real gripe now is the fact that the book had tons of typos. I had not seen any in the earlier FR campaign supplements."},{"Title":"Player's Guide to Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Accessory)","review":"And I was so excited about this too. The Forgotten Realms books are generally pretty good, the FR campaign setting, monsters of faerun, magic of faerun, races of faerun, all solid books.

They refused to reprint the write-ups for the PC races (WHY?!) so you still need the campaign setting book. They refused to reprint any spells from magic of faerun or the campaign setting. The prestige classes they did re-do they either changed virtually nothing, completely botched, or attached an arbitrary region-specific name to (shadow thief of amn? what the hell? what's wrong with guild thief?the regional feats are now only available at 1st level, and exactly who is eligible for what has been obscured beyond all recognition.to top it off, the ONLY reason i was super-psyched about this was the purported inclusion of the fire-knives assassin which was removed for space. SPACE? this book has little to nothing of worth in it. there are two things that are sort of interesting in this book: a section noting various psionic organizations. for a psy-freak like me its enough information to stoke my curiosity, but its still very little. and the other is the Yathrinshee prestige class. which by the way is very cool, and ridiculously overpowered.please people, dont waste your money.if you REALLY want one i'll sell you mine cheap."},{"Title":"Player's Guide to Faerun (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Accessory)","review":"Friends, heed my warning. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOAD OF WORTHLESS JUNK! This book was in no way shape or form worth the money. There are plenty of things wrong with it, but I'm going to stick to the ones that come immediately to mind...1. Who edited this thing?!!! The first sight that met my eyes upon opening the book was the glaring caption typo for the dwarves. Gold dwarf and gray dwarf are obviously switched. Way to go Wizards *gives sarcastic thumbs-up*.2. Is it just me, or is all of the truly \\"new\\" content in this book completely worthless. Yeah sure, some of the epic spells sound cool, but honestly, when are you actually going to use them. And speaking of epic matters, could someone please design epic levels for a prestige class that don't simply read \\"bonus feat bonus feat bonus feat...\\" Christ people. It's a bloody prestige class, at least put SOME effort into making it unique. And why is there no illustration for the spellfire hierophant?!! You'd think that the one prestige class with any appeal to it would have a rendering, but oh wait, that would require some imagination and we must remember that Wizards seems to have misplaced theirs.3. Along the lines of artwork, it looks like a two-year-old drew some of these pictures. This is no where close to the art from the FRCS book, and the redone prestige classes look like cartoonish parodies of themselves, in the art as well as in their content (The new Incantatrix is LAAAAAAME by the way).4. Wizards flat-out lied about what would be in this book. In the art gallery they had pictures of the updated monsters from monsters of faerun. So I'm thinking \\"Great, I'll get all of the monsters that really matter from mof, and not have to buy the old book.\\" Right? WRONG AGAIN! Not a single page in this steaming pile of monkey dung has any of those monsters in it.I could keep going for a few hours on this, but I've already wasted enough time on this review.

As a DM myself, I see the book's usefulness increasing exponentially as my players advance in level: they are about to wander the planes to confront the infernal servants of some of the most evil deities of the Faerunian pantheon, and this book gives me exactly what I need to create the right atmosphere, depending on where the players are heading next (complete with godly realms rules on local gravity, magic use, etc.)Buy it if you're a gamer.

Burne Hogarth basically takes all of Bridgman's ideas and tries to improve on them. Critics still debate the effectiveness of Hogarth vs. Bridgman- but I believe Hogarth's work, in this particular case, has far exceeded that of Bridgman. Which book to get? The price of Bridgman's book is very attractive- But is it effective? Maybe. I think it depends on how you use it. In conjunction with photographs, Bridgman's book *can* be effective. Still, I have to admit: Bridgman's drawings here are not exactly clear. It takes a real concerted effort to figure out exactly what he's trying to teach. Also worth considering is that the best parts of this book were eventually included in what is now called Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing from Life. If you're trying to decide between his Complete Guide and this, I recommend the Complete Guide by far.P.S.

The drawings are almost incomprehensible line drawings that give no clear picture of exactly what's going on in the various kinds of folds.2. There's a lack of useful photographs.3. The poor printing quality doesn't help.4. The text gives no &quot;laws&quot; of folds (such as: The fabric will always bend this way if it hangs that way, etc).In a bookstore in Italy recently I saw a book by Hogarth on the same subject. Though it was in Italian, the drawings showed much more clearly exactly what's going on with clothing in various positions and movements. With text in English, I can only imagine it will be far more helpful to me than this Bridgman book.I'm just happy the Bridgman book was inexpensive."},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"I read both Burne Hogarth's Dynamic Drappery and Bridgman's one and I like this one better.First, I like Bridgman's drawing style better. It's looser and more simple. I can see the rhythm of folds better.Second, the size is handy. A thin book that covers the basic in a good price.My little recommendation: Go for it if you are looking for a more fine-art-way of drawing, as others has already sugguested in their review."},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"This book offers some basics as to types of fabric folds and falls that one would encounter in trying to draw a draped figure. While the writing is lucid though incomplete, this book suffers from a serious flaw of terrible prints of drawings of such folds which do little to elucidate the writing in a substantial manner. More illustrations would have been helpful, as would have been covering close focus photographs of the draped figure as painted by some of the masters excelling in the same. It would not be possible to master or even come close to mastering the aspect of drawing fabric folds on the basis of this book"},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"As I was reading this book I kept thinking this must be a reprint of something written in the 1950s. The writing style had that cumbersome approach of much older 'how to' books. In fact the book is a reprint of another book called &quot;The Seven Laws of Folds&quot;, and I suspect it was orignally a book meant for sculptors. The examples are charcoal(?) drawings. Most of well known statues. The descriptions really don't seem to apply to drawing at all. I tried looking through the eyes of a would-be sculptor while I read. Only then did the book seem useful.Unfortunately, I have another complaint. The example sketches are, well, terrible. Many of them I could not make out. There are photographs in the book as well that are so badly reprinted I really have no idea what they're sposed to be.There needs to be a better book to help people draw 'the draped figure.' This one really doesn't help."},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"Unfortunately this book is a poor representation of the original, a hardcover that was printed in 1942 and has better representations of the drawings.If you are an artist or art student, it's worth it (even if more expensive), to find the older, 1942 hardcover version for the finely detailed drawings that are shown clearly and full sized.Save your money by not buying this cheap paperback....! :)"},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"Sometimes I wonder if I had not worked as a professional illustrator for fifty years, if i could luxuriate in the self-described expertise of those who make pictures occasionally and with no time constraints. This contains everything the SERIOUS artist needs to know...the basic anatomy of folds in fabric.Done in Bridgman's powerful and abbreviated style that cuts to the chase, this will be difficult for those who judge a drawing on how much it resembles a photograph, this will not be of any use...nor will a photographic rendering.In the studio, we had built what came to be known as \\"The Wall of Pain,\\" because drawing from it always results in showing what you still have yet to learn. Here's a link to the picture [...]This is based on Bridgman's observations of the way cloth forms folds in nature and also upon the way the classical Greeks had codified the study of drapery. If the reader is among that small number of brush and pencil owners who aspires to make art a profession, Bridgman's book forms a cornerstone."},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"Bridgeman is an indispensable teacher of human anatomy (even though he worked in the early 20th century), but this isn't the best book out there. The drawings are too loose and sketchy to see clearly what he is describing. He goes through the seven typs of folds all right, but they need to be illustrated more three dimensionally. I'd choose this over Hogarth's book, though, because Bridgeman's written descriptions are to the point, and at least the drawings aren't overdone. And it's [inexpensive]. The world cries out for the definitive book on drapery: one that is concise, accurate, and with good drawings. I saw one once on a guy's desk in an animation studio, it looked like it was written in the '50s, but I can't remember the name; it had superbly elegant drawings and lean, no-nonsense explanations of the 7 folds. I made some copies, but not of the title. Oh well, Bridgeman will have to do."},{"Title":"Drawing the Draped Figure (Dover Anatomy for Artists)","review":"I never dreamed there were so many different types of folds!

Maybe it was just me..."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is political farce with a vengeance. The back jacket on the paperback says this book is not a political book in any imagined sense of that term and that's essentially true. The author's position on the old South African regime is pretty clear from the word \\"go\\" but it never dampens the fun.The book is so over the top that its characters come off as cardboard cutouts of a caricature--yet, somehow, Sharpe still finds a way to imbue them with enough connective personality that we are drawn into the farce willingly. The book is extremely funny--I laughed out loud at least twenty times. It is a rather crude undertaking--but then again, so was the old South Africa, and this books achieves the unique aspect of being extremely sexually explicit while never actually rendering an actual sex scene--not for want of trying on the \\"heroines\\" part.All in all a lot of fun is the crudity and explicitness don't put you off. If that's the case, seek humor elsewhere.I enjoyed it enough that I have ordered another couple of Sharpe's books to see if they are as good. I have high hopes on that score."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"If you're ever in the mood for a hugely over-the-top farce about apartheid-era South Africa, well, this is the book for you. Sharpe spent a decade there before being deported as a subversive, and after reading this unrestrained comic pummeling of the RSA, one can only wonder why it took the authorities so long to give him the boot. Indeed authority is target number one in this fast-paced story set in the small city of Piemburg. It all starts when an elderly semi-aristocratic Englishwoman calls the police to report that she's shot her Zulu cook. Refusing police Kommandant van Heerden's best attempts to cover up the matter, she reveals that the cook was also her lover, which so appalls him that he immediately declares a state of emergency and mobilizes the entire police force. And so begins a massive comedy of errors, in which a \\"Kaffir-Killer\\" Konstabel Els plays a large role, as does the slimy Luitenant Veerkamp, and matters take a turn for the utterly bizarre, as rubber fetishes, bondage, a drunken bishop, porno films, cross dressing, and penile novocain injections are all introduced to the plot. As one might surmise from such a litany, the plot spins ever more wildly out of control until events come to a head at--appropriately enough--the insane asylum. All the antics are intermittently funny, and it's somewhat refreshing to see the horrors of apartheid treated with rather less than the usual gravitas. Worth a read if you've got a special interest in South Africa or a soft spot for broad farce, otherwise not all that noteworthy"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is the first of Tom Sharpe's two novels set in South Africa. This is a very funny book. It is very perverse and zany fun.The book begins with the murder of a black house wroker by a member of a prominent English family in the city of Piemburg. Enter the police. There is Kommandant van Heerden, who wants nothing more than to be English, Konstabel Els, who is renowned as a killer of blacks, and Luitenant Veerkramp, who is one of the slimiest and wiliest characters in the Piemburg police force. A routine police investigation turns into an armed confrontation between the unwitting members of the Piemburg police force, while van Heerden is unwillingly seduced by the murderer he is investigating. These are just a few of the hijinks that ensue as the police's irrational actions keep making the situation worse.This book is excellent because Sharpe is able to expose the irrationality of apartheid and the actions of the authorities to keep this practice going. After reading this book, there is little wonder in my mind why Sharpe was expelled from South Africa in the '70s."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is Tom Sharpe's first venture into print way back in the seventies after being deported from South Africa. A perusal of the contents will answer the question why succinctly! A paen to middle class prejudices and yearnings everywhere, which when coupled to a prediliction for bizarre episodic violence triggered by equally bizarre human behavior will leave your sides splitting! This started the whole Sharpe thing which afficiondo's will tell you is utterly irresistable and addictive, while leaving one wondering as to the workings of Sharpe's mind! These English &quot;Public&quot; schoolboys!"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Possibly the funniest book in the English language. I must have for any dedicated humor collector!"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This decidedly intemperate dark jewel has been criticized for, among other things, being short on a coherent logical plot. Fair enough. And saturated with unsympathetic characters. Point taken. So what? If you can find a better written rant of absurd, politically incorrect, howlingly hilarious black (as in motif, not ethnic) humor by all means set Riotous Assembly aside and go with your more entertaining discovery, and be so kind as to post its name here so that we may all partake.Compared to Riotous Assembly, Mel Brooks' best sounds like a grim Savonarola tract."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"THE FUNNIEST BOOK ON EARTH!!A roaring romp of a book. Brilliant satire at it's best.Certainly a must read for lovers of dark humour. Tom sharp also outpaces himself in 'Indicent exposure', 'Blot on a landscape' and 'Wilt'.A master of exuberant satire that evidently is not content with providing a rib-cracking read, but also exposes a darker side of humanity we should not forget- the evil of racism and discrimination."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Non stop crazy Boer antics in S.Africa , difficult to put it down. I heartily recomend it to all and everyone."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"It's rare that I read an entire novel at one stretch, but this novel gripped me from start to finish. It's a mix of gentle farce (a la Jeeves) and not-so-gentle black comedy. Warning: there's a lot of blood and gore."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"I first found a Tom Sharpe book in Heathrow while traveling years ago. This was before the internet and before Amazon and when you had to find a book in a bookstore to buy it. So every time I went to England after that I explored bookstores looking for more of his books. I kept hoping I would find another and frequently I did.This book is satire and black humor and so well written you will find it very very hard to put it down and do something else. And you will be so very lucky to be able to go on the internet and find the other fabulous books this author has written that you can buy. You won't have to wait and wait as I did.Men and women will enjoy this. Teens might but much of the satire might not be understandable for them and they might not understand it as well."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Haven't had a book make me laugh for a long time. To envision the happenings was a delite. Well done Tom Sharpe. A great read. Very funny."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Every now and then my life gets so jumbled, or my hormones rise or fall and depression sets in, and I just need a rousing good laugh. That's when I pick up this book. It has never failed to at least amuse or, more often, to induce a tears-in-my-eyes unrestrained laughing fit. While this can be disconcerting to co-workers in nearby cubicles, it nevertheless works wonders for my sour moods.Totally loony in a restrained British (or in this case, South African) manner, this tale of apartheid, fetishism, gender role swapping, gigantic firearms and novocaine in the mythical South African town of Piemburg is quite simply a hoot.That it works better than Prozac as a mood leveler (Fair warning-- I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on Amazon!) is a wonderful bonus."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"A friend in Britain and I sent each other some favorite books. Since David hadn't read much SF/F, I sent him Jonathan Carroll's Bones of the Moon and James P. Blaylock's The Last Coin. In turn, he sent me some British humor: Tom Sharpe and Clive James. James' books were quite interesting--a well-written autobiography with some sly touches that never quite had me belly-laughing, but kept me reading. Sharpe, on the other hand, I fell into with a gusto. From page one of Riotous Assembly, my hands were doing double-duty turning pages and trying to keep my sides from splitting.Imagine the writer you would get if you mixed P.G. Wodehouse and Hunter Thompson, and then placed them in South Africa; that's Tom Sharpe. He indeed manages to combine the wit and language skills, as well as the awkward situations of Wodehouse with the sharpened pen of satire and low opinion of humans from Thompson, and his target is South Africa and the police forces there (I believe that he was jailed there for awhile, and ultimately deported).Upon finishing Riotous Assembly, I rushed to see if I could find any more by this Sharpe fellow. Luckily, Vintage has brought him across the sea for our enjoyment. Indecent Exposure is the sequel to Riotous Assembly and just as funny; perhaps even funnier, given the satire of the Dornford Yates club (a group of Englishmen who adore the veddy British writer Dornford Yates who is clearly an analog for Wodehouse) within the larger South African satire. I also read Wilt, in which he drops some of the satirical and plays the perverted Wodehouse more. Wilt is okay, but I would suggest you try the South African novels first. If you're like me, you'll have to read Wilt or any of his other novels then--just because you can't get enough of this amazing fellow."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"In many respects, apartheid South Africa provides a great setting for farces and satirical novels. Tom Sharpe ably exploits the possibilities in this tale involving an interracial affair, a bishop who ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and a murder investigation by irredeemably dumb and racist Afrikaner policemen.Parts of Riotous assembly are very funny and Sharpe maintains the hectic pace of the narrative throughout. But in the end, I was disappointed with this book. My dissatisfaction had nothing to do with being an Afrikaner or with an aversion to dark humour. Carl Hiaasen is one of my favourite authors, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie version of Sharpe's Wilt. My problem was with the characters, who seemed to have no personalities whatsoever beyond the stereotypes they represent. To truly enjoy a book (even a farce), I have to develop an interest in or establish some kind of rapport with the characters, and in the case of Riotous assembly this never happened."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"with the other reviewers on this one! This is a great book. First of his books I've read, but as soon as I finished, I had to seek out more of his writing. A cunning wit, a barbed tongue and a brilliant mind.

D*mned if the English don't really do certain things better."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Riotous assembly and its sequel (Indecent exposure) are in my opinion two of the funniest books I have ever read.

But Laura doesn't really fit in with the other moms. Everyone else is richer, thinner, snobbier than she is and she's always left feeling vaguely less-than. She's managed to make a few friends and is volunteering to be one of the coordinators of the school fundraising auction, but the drama starts when one of four students kills the class hamster. Which student? No one knows, but accusations start flying and whatever the answer is, it has the potential to ruin the child's academic career.Laura and the other mothers turn on each other, gossiping, backstabbing, breaking and entering, in order to determine which child has the most problems and is most capable of killing a small animal (remember, these are three and four year olds here), and in their searching, long-held secrets are revealed, along with diabolical plots and devious schemes. When the school auction does take place, let's just say that the Feds are involved.I just couldn't connect with this. The characters were so one-dimensional. Laura's friends were all snobby, backstabbing bitches; Laura herself had almost no personality other than feeling inferior and self-conscious. I didn't get much of a feeling at all that she loved her daughter, more that she was just irritated by her and felt pressed to constantly keep up with all the other Metropolitan parents. I was hoping for something fun and chick-litty, but this just seemed outlandish, far-fetched, and overdone."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"I read the Yoga Mamas by the same author and knew I had to read this one when it came out. It's an interesting look at a middle class mom thrust into the social machinations of an upper class preschool. Manhattan preschool is just as crucial as SAT scores these days it seems, with most or all of the burden on the moms to fit in, make their child shine and make the right connections. Along the way Laura stumbles onto a scam and cleans it all up. I enjoyed the look at today's preschools - not the same kind you'll find in Anytown, USA, that's for sure. Stewart's characters are all very interesting and this mystery had me scratching my head till the end."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"This book has none of the charm of Yoga Mamas. I found it odd that none of the yoga moms remained friends.I regretted buying this book. I was bored and didn't want to finish it but I did."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"For anyone who enjoyed Stewart's first book \\"The Yoga Mamas\\", this second novel does not disappoint. Same narrator (intrepid social ing&eacute;nue Laura); different cast of wealthy, social-climber characters. The themes in Class Mothers are darker than in the earlier book. While The Yoga Mamas was about unexpected and unlikely friendships formed through shared pregnancy and early motherhood experience; Class Mothers explores the world of ambitious, competitive pre-school Moms, with all the attendant alliances, schemes and betrayals.As before, Laura enters this milieu clumsy and inexperienced, but she soon finds herself co-opted by the values and preoccupations of this crowd. The competition between these women of means, played out on the grounds of their children's pre-school may seem trivial and absurd, but it's their all-encompassing world. Having one's child perform well at the most exclusive pre-school (or more importantly, avoiding disfavor and expulsion at an early age), has life-long consequences.Stewart profiles her characters with a delightful combination of spoof, satire and insight. To watch Laura get caught up in the intrigue and run around frantically trying to uncover the secrets of her various rivals is truly hilarious. And who would think of investing in a resort property with a name like \\"Iguana Cay\\"? Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"The social machinations surrounding preschools offer rich fodder for satire, and Katherine Stewart digs right in. The setting is Manhattan, but these mothers abound in Miami as well. Stewart creates slightly crazy characters whom she loves even as she skewers them. Like her previous book Yoga Mamas, Class Mothers is just the kind of parodic diversion multitasking parents need: a place where we can see ourselves, laugh at ourselves, and know it will all come out all right in the end (except for the hamster)."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"Class Mothers is a pleasure to read: fast-paced, witty and perceptive. It picks up the three main characters from Katherine Stewart's previous novel, The Yoga Mamas, when daughter Anna is three years old and her parents, Laura and Richard, have entered the high-stakes world of New York preschools. Although Laura and Richard have succeeded in getting their daughter into one of New York City's most prestigious (fictional) preschools, they are already worried about whether she can get into the best elementary school. Stewart is brilliant at capturing the way the parents, and especially the mothers, in this world struggle to demonstrate their superiority over one another. Parents must appear happily married and successful, children must show no traces of disability or misbehavior, and every detail of a mother's appearance, and a child's daily routine, marks their class position (birthday parties, clothing, after school activities, gym memberships, nanny's nationality). Because Laura and Richard's finances put them on the margins of this social world, Laura is perfectly positioned to observe and critique it. Much of the pleasure of this novel comes from Laura's hilarious send-ups of the other characters' class pretensions. Yet Stewart finally suggests that the blame for this back-biting atmosphere lies not so much with the class-conscious parents as with the schools themselves, which force parents into this behavior through their admissions procedures and fund-raising policies. As Laura realizes near the novel's end, her recent (crazily competitive) thoughts and actions are \\"a test case of what could happen to an ordinary mother under extraordinary conditions\\" (202).The resolution of the plot offers a satisfying wish-fulfillment for all of us who have ever felt frustrated by the jockeying for position at our children's schools. Laura becomes friends with three of the women with whom she had been in stiffest competition, and together they take actions that show that Stewart, like her character Kim, has \\"faith in people's abilities to forge their own destinies\\" (219). In the novel's near-final auction scene, Stewart is able to indulge her delight in describing the details of food, clothing, d&eacute;cor, and auction patter, while simultaneously giving her characters the chance to, as they say, \\"take back our school\\" (224)."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"Class Mothers is an entertaining and light-hearted look at super competitive Manhattan preschool culture. It's a combination mystery and \\"girlfriends bonding\\" novel."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"We chose this book for our book club because we are all mothers of preschoolers, and we loved it. It's a fun, fast read. On the surface, Class Mothers is frothy and fun, but the themes underneath resonate deeply. Friendship, wanting the best for your kids, anxieties about parenting and social standing, facing down marital pressures ( like annoying ex-girlfriends who won't leave your husband alone), and the potential for corruption in our educational system are just a few.I don't think you have to live in New York to relate to the extreme pressures around preschool education that this book very accurately portrays. The system is not at all transparent where we live, and the potential for corruption and back-room deals is definitely there. In the end, the plot gets kind of over the top and campy.The main characters were pretty complex, which is more of what people are like in real life. None of the women was as simple as she first appeared. Each one had a secret struggle, something that made her more ultimately more likeable and kept the plot rolling along. There is a lot of satire, which also made it fun to read.We had a lot of fun with Class Mothers, and I recommend it to other readers, especially mothers."},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"In Manhattan Laura's daughter Anna attends the prestigious Metropolitan private school on a scholarship. However, Laura does not know the other class mothers until they are to work together on an auction. Most are so pampered they offer nothing to the endeavor, but three want to be the commander in chief giving orders to everyone else especially the scholarship mothers.On her second spouse Bronwyn seems happy with her wealthy husband and their perfect kids. Dominique knows her spouse adores her with a passion. Finally Kim is a successful financial advisor. The three women fight for supremacy until a disgusted Laura uncovers a threat to the school that the mothers better become a band of sisters if they want to thwart the attempt to shut the place.The mothers with their common relationship woes involving spouses, children and other relatives in spite of economic and social differences makes CLASS MOTHERS a fine look at Manhattan's elitist schooling. The tale is intelligent and amusing when it concentrates on the mothers of the students especially the comparisons between Laura, Bronwyn, and Kim. When the story line spins into a save the school against a conspiracy it loses a bit of its bite. Still as she did with THE YOGA MAMAS, Katherine Stewart provides a smart look at upper crust education.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Class Mothers","review":"True - I could not put this book down.

It kind of jumped ahead a few weeks and ended.Where did the Federal agent come from? That whole part wizzed by without much explanation. When Laura broke into the apartment and was caught, that went by too fast too.

Chick lit is fun and I enjoy fun, frothy novels as much as the next girl but for that I'd turn to Risa Green or Jennifer Weiner who are smart, witty novelists.

Keble, who was born in 1792 and is credited for having started the Oxford Movement with his Assize Sermon in 1833, was an Anglican priest, poet, and professor. \\"The Christian Year\\" is his book of poetry in which he wrote a poem for each week of the Christian year, as well as a poem for each of the services from The Book of Common Prayer. It's a work that is not much read today but that was wildly successful in the 19th century. While the aesthetic level of the poetry is second-rate compared to Keble's contemporary Romantic poets (at least the more famous ones), when read as devotional poetry that connects one to God through the Church, the Bible, the Prayer Book, and nature, the poetry still has the power to move.While the poetry of \\"The Christian Year\\" will seem outdated to most, if not actually inferior, a proper reading of it in its context will benefit not only students of history and literature but also the patient Christian reader in search of a profound devotional literary work.The full title of the work is: The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year. The volume begins with a \\"Morning\\" and \\"Evening\\" hymn, corresponding to Morning and Evening Prayer services, followed by a poem for every week in the Church year. These are followed by poems for the various saints' days, Holy Communion, Holy Baptism, and the occasional services. In 1828 poems for the State services were added as well.Keble's poetic life originated in his undergraduate days when he relieved his emotions by composing poetry, often on any scrap of paper he could find. When Keble began around 1819 to compose the poems that would eventually be included in The Christian Year, he had no intention of crafting his poetry into a unified companion to the Prayer Book. He apparently began while a tutor at Oriel College, inspired by his tours back and forth between Oxford and his home in Fairford. Keble's own theory of poetry illuminates the personal and individual aspect of poetry from which his own poetry originally flowed: \\"Let us therefore deem the glorious art of Poetry a kind of medicine divinely bestowed upon man: which gives healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet without detriment to modest reserve: and, while giving scope to enthusiasm, yet rules it with order and due control.\\" Keble's poetry, in keeping with his theory, was written first and foremost for the comfort of his own soul. Its most immediate impression was on that of his close circle family and friends, who universally found something new and powerful in the poems. The comfort for the individual soul that the poems brought appears frequently in the correspondence and remains of Keble's family and friends prior to its publication.Keble continued writing poetry for his own benefit in the 1820s, and, at some point not apparently recorded in Keble's correspondence or in the memoirs of those who knew him, he decided to arrange the poetry so that a poem would be provided for each holy day in the Church year. By 1825 Keble wrote a friend, \\"I have got a few attempts at hymns by me, which I have from time to time written, principally for my own relief . . . . My plan was to have one, if I could, for every Sunday & holiday in the year: taking the hint for the subject of each from something or other in the proper Psalms or Lessons for the day.When he did publish the work in 1827, he added to it his own Advertisement, in which he admirably sets out his aims: \\"The object of the present publication will be attained, if any person find assistance from it in bringing his own thoughts and feelings into more entire unison with those recommended and exemplified in the Prayer Book.\\" Keble makes clear that his goal in publishing his poetry was to have his readers use The Christian Year as a companion to the Prayer Book. A better summary of the purpose and effect of The Christian Year could not be found than what Keble himself wrote in his Advertisement. Keble also expected that his poetry, along with the Prayer Book, would provide a \\"sober standard of feeling in matters of practical religion.\\" The Liturgy, he said, disciplined the tempers which need disciplining in such an age of excitement.There is, therefore, a dual origin and dual purpose of The Christian Year. The original poetic impulse for the poetry came from Keble's own desire to express himself as an individual soul addressing His God, often out of a need for comfort. This original source for the poetry was then fitted for use as an Anglican devotional manual which had specific reference to the Prayer Book. This dual origin and purpose of the poetry is highly significant for explaining the astounding success of the poetry in the nineteenth century and its continuing value.A work of High Church devotional poetry, at a time when interest in poetry in general was beginning to wane, was not expected by many to succeed. Keble himself thought that nothing would come of it. \\"I remember, when it was first in the press,\\" Isaac Williams wrote, \\"coming with Keble out of Baxter's printing-office, when Keble said, \`It will be still-born, I know very well; but it is only in obedience to my father's wishes that I publish it, and that is some comfort.'\\" Keble's perpetual embarrassment by his success provides further evidence that he was never prepared for, and thus never expected, the success he achieved.The Christian Year enjoyed an immediate, lasting, and enormous success. The 1827 first edition of 500 needed little time to sell out and persuade Parker of the need for a second edition. The second edition of 750 also sold out within a few months, and a third edition of 1250 was published around March of 1828. The total number of copies sold in the first year alone, combining the sales of the first three editions, was at least 2500 copies, while the total sold for the first ten years was 26,500. By 1873 when the copyright had expired, 158 editions had been published by Parker, the original publisher, and 379,000 copies had been sold by the same date. My research indicates that approximately 1,000,000 copies of \\"The Christian Year\\" were sold in the 19th century, and many used volumes are available, as well as a plethora of modern reprints.Christians from many different denominations read The Christian Year. One writer said that the spiritual life and feeling of Keble's poetry \\"exist in Christian hearts, whether reared under Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Nonconformist influences.\\" My research indicates that a great number of major figures in the 19th century had read \\"The Christian Year,\\" and many people had virtually memorized it. Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Christina Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, William Gladstone, and many other have left testimony to having read \\"The Christian Year.\\"Those who read The Christian Year most faithfully, however, were likely to be Anglicans due to its connection with the Prayer Book. Many people read Keble's poetry week by week for years: the vast majority of these were Anglicans. This is what one would expect, since the contents of the book were based on an Anglican Church year, a specifically Anglican lectionary, and services which were often specifically Anglican.Finally, many readers of the 19th century wrote that \\"The Christian Year\\" did more to promote High Church and Catholic principles than the Tracts for the Times because Keble wrote through the vehicle of poetry and a poetry that appealed to all Christians, even while it subtly expressed Catholic ideals of the Church and a sacramental worldview."},{"Title":"Jane's School Safety Handbook","review":"The Jane's School Safety Handbook is a MUST for anyone interested in school safety.

While some of the Gohr comics have seen book form, \\"Drum\\" never has.Which leads me to \\"Dick Master: Leatherland Under Attack.\\" Written and drawn by Roy Klang, this Science Fiction Sex Fantasy takes place in a future variation of NYC in 3069, renamed \\"Leatherland.\\" The Tom Of Finland type men that roam the city are protected by the Leather Space Dept under the command of the hero, Dick Master.

Very few authors could pull off a story like this with the finesse of Jennifer Fulton. I doubt many would be brave enough to try knowing they are liable to have it condemned by the thought police, irrespective of the quality or sensitivity of the writing.I saw on this author's website that she wrote it in response to requests for a spring autumn romance. My first love-the love of my life, was a woman twenty-four years older than myself, and I was fortunate to be with her until her death.Love can happen to women of very different ages and be consensual and wonderful, which is exactly how Ms. Fulton depicts it in this sweet and delicious romance. I would give it more stars if possible. It touched me and brought back some very happy memories of the partner I've lost, whose age was no more relevant than her shoe size.

Recently, for work, I've needed to dip into it. The insights fly from the pages. In fact the pages themselves fly from the volume I have as its far from the quality production such a collection warrants: a museum without covers?? Whatever, Malraux's insightful gems often lose directional thread in his impestuous, rambling style. He's what once was termed an aesthete, rather than a scholar. So don't go looking for deep analytic appraisals of particular works or of an artist or culture. And his insights presume you are acquainted with the subject under discussion. If you have a reasonable grounding in the visual arts, the book will provide revelations. The TV series made in his Paris flat in the 1970s is much better at getting a grip on the man."},{"Title":"The voices of silence","review":"Although Andre Malraux was not an art historian by profession, he did however write two extraordinary books on the subject of art; a subject which obviously occupied a great deal of his thoughts. This particular book, 'The Voices of Silence', has fared better than the lesser known 'Metamorphosis of the Gods', nevertheless it has still fallen somewhat into obscurity. These books were clearly not written as an introduction to the subject, but assume the reader has a thorough knowledge of art already. They would also probably never find their way onto the required reading list of a university course on art history either. Which is a shame, because they are filled with some of the most startlingly insightful observations. The kind of observations that you don't find in academic books on art, because they do not fall into the prescribed curriculum of a historian. Malraux's art books have often been criticized as being too unstructured and directionless; this criticism, while not entirely unfounded, I feel stems from thinking that has been conditioned by the expectations of more scholarly books; which it clearly was not his aim to write. It does not put forth an isolated thesis which is then thoroughly argued to the exclusion of any other possibility, thus closing the case on a particular issue. Instead he showers you with a thousand insights; each one significant enough to potentially lead to a whole other area of inquiry in itself. While he clearly aims at and achieves clarification of his subject (as opposed to obscuring, which French thinkers are often accused of) he also manages to continually deepen the mystery.If there is an overall or recurring theme to Malraux's writings on art, it is the transformation that various forms in art have undergone through time, and their signification of how man regards himself and his place in the universe. It's noteworthy that he uses the word \\"metamorphosis\\" to describe these transformations as opposed to the word \\"evolution\\". As Malraux rightly observes, the overlaying of evolutionary theory and notions of \\"progress\\" to works of art is misguided. Art has not been on a slow steady path of advancement toward perfection. In fact, forms in art have often degenerated; which he illustrates with an example of the continually abstracted imagery on some ancient coinage. What makes Malraux's writings on art unique is that he always seems to be writing not from the perspective of someone standing on a historical timeline, but rather, from the vantage point of eternity. In other words, not as a chronicler of a linear progression of art productions going on indefinitely into the future, but an observer of the emergence of forms into an everlasting present, and their occasional disappearance. Particularly forms that transmit man's sometimes strong, sometimes tenuous connection with a source, which is the very ground of his being. As the title of his book suggests, these works stand like silent sentinels, continually reminding us not of what we have gained in this \\"post-enlightenment\\" world, but what we have lost.Philosophically there is some overlap between Malraux's writings and the writings of the Traditionalist / Perennial school of thought. Malraux is much less dogmatic though; more conversational in tone. He is not on a mission to reform or convert you. Instead he invites you to pause a moment and allow him to share some of his observations on art, and our place in the larger scheme of things. He sees, for the most part, almost all of man's artworks as a kind of triumph or victory over destiny. All except what he refers to as arts of delectation, meaning, works meant to give only a fleeting pleasure. His insights are so diverse and numerous it is impossible to give a concise summarization of them. There are also a few correctives that he issues in this book; some of which had been said before by other writers. However, to this day their message has still not registered a change in the general perception of these issues, so I guess they bear repeating.Here are a few excerpts as examples:p.270 \\"That ferment of ideas--now bloody, now serene--which we name the Renaissance developed between two phases of Christianity. The Italy that was coming to birth was not to be a land of agnostic coteries; it was the court of Julius II. In fact it is impossible to understand Italian art, and Giotto's to begin with, if we read into the plastic genius of the Renaissance any anti-Christian bias... Even Raphael did not think himself less Christian than Rembrandt claimed to be.\\"p.481-482 \\"The anti-religious mood of the eighteenth century looked for precursors; but, though there had been Greek skeptics, there had never been a culture pledged to skepticism... the Eternal in its death throes was not replaced by any sorry substitute, until an adversary worthy of it had been discovered... and that enemy was History.\\"p.525 \\"But delectation is not concerned with values, only with sensations and thus with moments only; whereas true arts and cultures relate Man to duration, sometimes to eternity, and make of him something other than the most favored denizen of a universe founded on absurdity.\\"p.570-572 \\"...nevertheless implicit in these creations is an awareness of the universe, an awareness quite different from ours and unconcerned with history, involving a union with the cosmos and not a surrender to chaos; a conquest, not an abdication.\\"I'll close this review with a quote from another writer; the scholar Mircea Eliade, \\"...it is more probable that the desire felt by the man of traditional societies to refuse history, and to confine himself to an indefinite repetition of archetypes, testifies to his thirst for the real and his terror of losing himself by letting himself be overwhelmed by the meaninglessness of profane existence.\\"Indeed."},{"Title":"The voices of silence","review":"What an excellent book, the first half anyway. The connections he makes, the ideas he explores are not found elsewhere. And gladly as he is not writing for the academy but rather for the humanist, he gives himself permission to explore and expound without needing to prove his points. Malraux had vast breadth of first hand experience of art which makes his ideas fresh and convincing. -- In one way his work is a period piece. He writes about the challenge of seeing first hand the many works considered masterpieces and complains about how fatigues are senses are having seen so many reproductions of these masterpieces, and too, he bemoans the poor quality of reproduction through print etc. I can't help wondering how he would have responded to the vast variety of images and art works available to us now through the internet?But even as a period piece it is quite worthwhile. Reading Malraux's impression of art and the movements which influence and shape our perception of art is really quite fascinating. Absolutely one of my favorite books on art or ideas.

Simon has undergone a spiritual renewal with influence of Gen, and he now needs a wife and mother to his children. Gen slowly begins to accept the death of Daniel Two Stars, and promises to Simon that she will try to love him, while he promises to take it slowly. Far away, Daniel Two Stars lingers in a prison for rebel Indians, being put there by mistake with others who have also accepted the Christian faith. Miraculously, he is released, only to eventually find out that Gen is promised to Simon. He makes Simon promise never to tell Gen the truth, and resolves to lead his life without his beloved Gen. Whitson's master storytelling skill is evident as she weaves the differing stories of Gen and Two Stars, as well as those of Miss Jane and the Major and the orphaned twins into one riveting novel. This is a great read, a must for those who are fans of Whitson and historical fiction, as well as for those who like to read about the power of God in people's lives."},{"Title":"Edge of the Wilderness (Dakota Moons Series #2)","review":"Book two covers a lot of territory - some of the top Indians are offered jobs as escorted scouts for the Army. Daniel Two Stars has finally gotten out of a living hell prison and is wearing an Army uniform and hunting renegade Indians. Genevieve LaCroix is serving as caregiver for Simon's children and orphaned baby Hope who was rescued by Gen and Daniel after the death of her parents.The conditions of the Indians is deplorable - most of the children have died. Thousands are still sick, starving prisoners. Simon Dane buries himself in Indian missionary work but is frustrated at his limited resources. Simon is falling in love with the beautiful half-breed Dakota Indian, Blue Eyes (Gen) and even though she respects him in return, her heart still belongs to her true love, Daniel Two Stars who she believes is dead.Elliott Leighton, Ellen's brother, enters the storyline and has one goal in mind - to prevent his sister's children from being raised in the wild West, OR by an Indian mother. He has been discharged from the Army after losing one arm and having his long hair turn white overnight. He travels to Simon's home to retrieve the children, having no idea the changes that await for him.Jeb Grant is a pivotal figure in this book. He is a farmer who just cannot bring himself to hate all Indians and he opens his heart and his farm to questionable Indian activities.Simon and Elliott accidentally run into Daniel while traveling in a storm during an illness, and after learning that Gen is engaged to Simon, Daniel asks both men to promise not to tell her and to forget they ever saw him. This is NOT going to be easy to do but Daniel determines to leave her alone so she can have a better life. Simon has a strange illness that persists, and among his many nurses are Mother Friend, Daniel, Elliott and Genevieve.The devastation of the good Indian's homes and villages by soldiers and renegade Indians leaves families separated and thousands homeless, injured, starving and defeated. Several major questions are answered in this book:1. Will Gen marry Simon even though they both know her heart belongs to the memories of Daniel Two Stars?2. What will happen to an angry Elliott when he visits the Crow reservation?3. What happens to Daniel who was reported as hanged? Will he ever see Blue Eyes again?4. What is the fate of 5 orphaned children, including baby Hope?5. Which is stronger, love, committment or duty? Is it possible for Simon, Blue Eyes(Gen) and Daniel to make the right choices in spite of their hearts?I felt that Stephanie Grace Whitson reflected some of the pain of her own life in this book. Love, death, grief, faith, loyalty, overcoming and doing the right thing were foremost in the intrigue and interest this second book held.

Chesterton: The Outline of Sanity, the Appetite of Tyranny, the Crimes of England, Lord Kitchener, Utopia of Usurers, Ho","review":"One thing for sure: GK was no fan of Prussia. Volume V of \\"Collected Works\\" contains political essays mainly dealing with events surrounding WWI. One of my favorite selections is \\"The Crimes of England', a candid confession of his homeland's crimes against humanity. GK lays much of the blame on Prussia, or more precisely, on England's government for cozying up to Prussia beginning with the William Pitt government around 1800. In GK's view, England should have stood with France, as inheritors of Roman/Christian values, in opposition to barbarian Prussia. Instead, England created a monster by propping up the Prussian regime, to the peril of all nations--particularly France, Poland, and Belgium. Moreover, barbaric Prussian values crept into English political and intellectual life as a result of this unholy association. English fascination with German social efficiency and scientific determinism hastened England's decline from a pastoral country to one overwhelmed by an ugly, dehumanizing urban capitalism. These are common themes in GK's writing, but I think never more fully fleshed out than here, as he traces all these developments from Pitt forward. It's a pity Chesterton does not show up more on reading lists for Western college courses in history."},{"Title":"Ecce Romani II: Home and School Pastimes and Ceremonies","review":"Following the precident set by Ecce Romani I, Ecce Romani II is another excellent step in Latin Pedagogy. My high school Latin II (the last two thirds of the year) and Latin III(three quarters of the year) used this text to finish up the major corpus of Latin grammar. I feel that this series is an excellent pedagogical step in making the different logical system of Latin more accessible.This text cements the concepts of Latin into the minds of its users. I have found myself in my Ecclesiastical Latin courses at the seminary (which is part of my college's complex) having an easy time recalling grammar and vocabulary because this text helped me very much in learning fully the Latin language.As with Ecce Romani I, my only qualm with Ecce Romani II is that it tends to take a long time to teach concepts. For rapid learning of the Language (which requires extremely devoted study), I suggest John F. Collins' &quot;Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin&quot;. However, if you are not in a complete rush to learn Latin, I suggest buying the teacher's edition of this book, if possible (for independent study) because it is built on a very sound pedogogical foundation."},{"Title":"Ecce Romani II: Home and School Pastimes and Ceremonies","review":"This is a very well-written textbook series. I took Latin I and II using this series, but I had to switch to the Cambridge Latin series for Latin III when I changed schools. Ecce Romani is a much better series than Cambridge. It contains many assets (such as an English-Latin AND Latin-English dictionary, multiple challenging practice exercises in each chapter, enjoyable stories, well-organized vocabulary sections in each chapter, etc.) necessary for the enjoyable and productive study of Latin which the Cambridge books lack. The Ecce Romani books are well organized and more enjoyable to learn from.

Deming's ideas had been spurned by western corporations for years. He took his ideas to Japan and flourished. Conway took notice of it and studied. He was in a position to apply the ideas to his company. It was a major culture shock, but it turned his company around.The book is full of useful ideas and insightful examples of the ideas at work. At my company, it is at the top of the reccommended reading list for managers. Right up there with Stephen R. Covey's &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;.Anyway, it's a good book for middle management to read to help them succeed."},{"Title":"Torpedo!","review":"Harry Homewodd wrote 3 book triolgy on the Submarine service...why in some places it is slow I found the books enjoyable.

In this era of nuclear threats, TORPEDO is remarkably contempoary in plot and concept even twenty years after having been written. Naval suspense between two super powers with action oriented military decision makers keeps the readers' attention. Although fiction, the story is so close to Cold War realism that any one who has served can feel the tension. Easy reading, this book is a treat for naval war story buffs. Well done Chief of the Boat Homewood!"},{"Title":"Clouds Over Vellanti","review":"This came out during the height of the gothic genre, but Elsie Lee's books stood above most of the rest. Her feisty heroines, glamourous settings and romantic suspense are very enjoyable. She has a devoted following.From the back cover: At first, the job seemed a heaven-sent gift to a lovely young Megan Royce. . . who desperately needed a helping hand. What could be better than having all the expenses of her imperative trip to Europe paid. . . in return for being the pleasant guest of a charming, imperious Contessa? But the situation changed rapidly as frightening complication piled on frightening complication. Megan's trip did not end in Paris as originally planned. It went on to Italy. . . to the beautiful but menacing old castle of Vellanti. And two questions loomed urgently on the starkly brooding horizon: what was the menace, and who the victim? Megan's already bruised emotions were due for even more severe battering before she learned the answers -- and found the one person in the entire dark tangle that she could trust. . . and love."},{"Title":"Clouds Over Vellanti","review":"I like the author Elsie Lee and find it difficult to purchase her books. It is nice to see that someone has them in stock. All her books are fun, an easy read but interesting. The book came quickly and in very good condition."},{"Title":"Free & Easy: How To Create Your Own Adventure by Living on the Road","review":"I really hate to give a book negative feedback because after an author has slaved over their work, it's very hard to hear someone criticize it, I'm sure, however, I'd rather save another reader the $16 I spent. The author goes on forever on how things should be but he never gives SPECIFIC examples of what he did. I was led to believe this book will show you how to find money to live the dream on the road. I thought it would contain clever ideas for achieving the dream, but what the book actually says is, unless you're independently wealthy, you may take time off for a sabbatical, but you'll have to go back to work before you retire. To me, that's no solution at all! This is a great essay on how it could be, but for a real-world practical example, it just didn't deliver for me. The author says he wasn't wealthy but he never really says how he and his wife managed to live on the road. Also, I was led to think the book was about living on the road aboard an RV. Actually, that's a metaphor for \\"dropping out\\" of the machine. There is not advice or guidance on living in an RV on the road. So, when I closed the book, I was hugely disappointed, not only that I felt the money was wasted on the book, but that I had wasted the time to read such a misleading piece of work."},{"Title":"Free & Easy: How To Create Your Own Adventure by Living on the Road","review":"This book gave me the courage and the practical ideas to make a significant shift in my work life and independence. I recently went part-time at my technical job and am now doing the artwork I've yearned to do for years. This book helped me to take the leap after seeing, in a practical way, how doable it was for me.

This 1923 book was his major work, but he also wrote books such asEvolutionary Geology And The New Catastrophism,Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory, The Fundamentals of Geology and Their Bearings on the Doctrine of a Literal Creation, etc.He wrote in the Preface to the 1923 first edition of this book (the edition reviewed here), \\"Since the publication of the writer's 'The Fundamentals of Geology,' there has been a growing demand for a textbook based on the principles there stated. The presentation of such a treatise, however, involving the actual reconstruction of the whole science, has been no easy task. The present volume is only a tentative effort along this line...\\" (Pg. 7)Here are some additional quotations from the book (1923 edition, which is the edition pictured in the photo):\\"...this historical outline of the successive forms of life is still only an assumption, and has already become an incredible assumption, in view of certain facts which have come to light in recent years.\\" (Pg. 5)\\"Why should any apology be needed here for bringing in the hypothesis of a great world catastrophe to account for some (an indefinite amount) of the geological changes?\\" (Pg. 7)\\"...we can never ignore the alternative hypothesis, that these various deposits represent merely the ruins of a world well stocked with plants and animals, which, by a series of rapid catastrophic changes of no very great duration, was transformed into the world as we have had it since historic times.\\" (Pg. 20)\\"How did such an assemblage of animals all become extinct together? The diluvialist has an easy explanation, in saying that none of these happened to get back to this part of the world after the great disaster...\\" (Pg. 60)\\"...we who have had our eyes opened regarding the folly of trying to tabulate all the rock deposits in a serial order can still make good use of this classification, even though we have discarded the traditional time-values so long associated with these systems.\\" (Pg. 294)\\"Can any system of uniformitarianism be framed which will bear such a strain as the attempt to account for all this (extinction of dinosaurs) all at once?\\" (Pg. 534)\\"The record of creation as given in the opening words of our Bibles is now being vindicated by modern science in a way as surprising as it is conclusive...\\" (Pg. 607)\\"And while it would be rash to say that all the geological changes recorded in the rocks were due to (the Flood), yet we can make no scientific progress in attempting to unravel the events of the previous ages until we have settled the matter as to just what deposits were due to this event, and which ones probably took place in some previous age of the world's history.\\" (Pg. 678)"},{"Title":"The Brothel Boy and Other Parables of the Law","review":"The Brothel Boy and Other Parables... is an excellent presentation of key ideas and conflicts in the law.Beyond its lessons about the cases Norval Morris presents, the book is a very enjoyable read. It approaches classical English literature with the main characters set in Colonial Burma. The ever present racial and cultural tensions that pervade that era and roll forward to our own, give the stories an contextual richness beyond the immediate presence of the actors in the cases.Norval Morris had set another standard for us by combining the presentation of case materials in a three dimensional literary context within which the characters, Lt. Blair the District Police Officer and Magistrate, his East Indian friend Dr. Verasuami, and the Burmese Buddhist lawyer Lang, bring together the perspectives of their cultures, professions and politics as they work through the issues in the cases.These characters are more than the common foils used by most case study authors to present the facts in their cases. Morris has created full bodied characters who's struggle and pain are apparent as they confront the issues of the people they are charged to assist.After reading the first parable, (I was surprised by the ending) I found that the more I read the more attached I became the characters and their moral development. As the book develops, the stories link together into a comfortable novel that ends with another moral question.I recommend it for its sound reasoning about the law and for its quality and a fine piece of literature. This one is hard to beat"},{"Title":"The Brothel Boy and Other Parables of the Law","review":"This book is not designed to be a casebook for law students. It is designed to tease out ethical dilemmas encountered by law enforcement officials and illuminate the tough choices they face every day. The use of an Englishman in Burma under British domination allows the reader to distance him/herself and evaluate these complex moral issues from a fresh perspective. Social issues from wife battering and the insanity defense to social stigma and caste systems are addressed by the author in a way that promotes discussion and understanding. The characters are believable and easy to identify with. If you want a legal casebook, go to West Publishing and buy one. If you want an entertaining, albeit challenging discussion of morality and the law, this is your book. Keep the dictionary handy though because it will improve your vocabulary!"},{"Title":"The Brothel Boy and Other Parables of the Law","review":"Book is for my Philosophy class.

Many resolutions are made about love and life. This is no different in the four-story anthology, Kiss the Year Goodbye.Four authors pen four unique stories where the end of the year is fastly approaching and changes in their lives are inevitable. In Brenda Thomas' contribution, \\"Every New Year\\", a young doctor, newly engaged, is more dedicated to her work than her fianc&eacute;. In a random shootout, she loses her memory and opens her heart to another. In \\"Whatever it Takes\\", Tu-Shonda Whitaker plays out a May/December romance to the background of a Jill Scott song named \\"Whatever.\\" Crystal Lacey Winslow shows another side of love with \\"Dangerously in Love\\" proving nothing is ever as it seems. And \\"My Boo\\" by Daaimah S. Poole, gives insight to the effects of long distance relationships.Out of the four, this reader enjoyed \\"Whatever It Takes.\\" This was an engaging story of a thirty-six year old woman who is forced to consider a twenty-three year old man as her possible Prince Charming. Adding to the issue of age, the young man is the son of one of her friends. This story was intriguing to me for a few reasons. Ms. Whitaker deals with the struggle of age differences realistically while not sacrificing the electricity that is evident between the two characters. She was also able to share the comedy that is surely going to come from a situation like this. My only issue is that there were some points in the story where their behavior made me wonder who was actually thirty-six and who was twenty-three.With the remaining three, while I was entertained, they did not engage me like the aforementioned. In \\"Every New Year\\" I was not convinced why the character was dissatisfied with her fianc&eacute; or her fascination with the new man. In \\"Dangerously In Love\\", it was a story designed to have an \\"oh my\\" twist which was a bit predictable and contrived. And in \\"My Boo\\" there was quite a bit of drama and trifling behavior in a short story and I had trouble believing its resolution.With all that said, I will say that the stories were readable and entertaining enough. It would be a good commuter read.KotanyaAPOOO Bookclub"},{"Title":"Kiss the Year Goodbye","review":"This book was excellent. This was the first time I've read a book by Tu-Shonda L.Whitaker, but she is truly a gifted writer. Her book focuses on the relationship between a younger man and a older woman, it was good from beginning to end. Brenda L. Thomas's book was good, it could have ended differently, but maybe that means the story will continue. Her story focuses on a doctor that ends up in the hospital, and develops feelings for the doctor that's attending to her. Crystal L. Winslow's book was very good, it focuses on a female that has some serious mental issues, but devolps a relationship with a guy who has been hurt before. The ending will suprise you. Daaimah S. Poole's book was good also, it was the story of a female and male involved in a long distance relationship, when the female starts to feel lonely she seeks pleasure outside the relationship, and soon learns, sometimes what you need is right in front of your face, if you just exercise a little patients."},{"Title":"Kiss the Year Goodbye","review":"Tu-Shonda's, \\"Whatever it Takes\\" was absolutely hilarious!

She introduces Mr. Marcus and he will have you in stiches, all the while you will be rooting for true love, will it happen this year? Tu-Shonda, as usual does a great job penning a great story. I was impressed with the fact that out of the four authors that she is the newest author, but pens a tale that leads the pack of good stories and writers. Kudos to you, Ms. Tu-Shonda.Brenda Thomas, does what she does best and grinds out a story that is off da hook. Every New Year, is told Brenda Thomas style and is a good read. Will size mean anything to you after this read???Crystal Winslow, Dangerously in Love, shows the dangers that just can happen when we think love comes a knockin'. Can you trust it, is real love what it seems? Find out in this story of twists and turns as the New Year comes thru again.My Boo, by Daaimah Poole takes us on another journey but will have you thinking twice about that long distant love and ya friend's jump off! Sometimes you just want to hurry and kiss the year good bye, and good riddance!!!This book is a great end to the Old Year and a great way to begin the New Year. Good read, quick read, great combination of authors as we Kiss the Year Goodbye.Kudos to all the authors for a job well done!!!P.S. To Dat Girl Ashley,In Tu-Shonda's story there were two different chicks named Monique one was his ex-girlfriend and one was the jeweler. Both chicks probably had the same name, so it would make it believable when India thought he was cheating on her. Remember she found the number with just a name, and thought it was his ex girl and then it turned out to be someone totally different. Things like that happen in life and we as women when suspicious can't see pass anything. Also remember these are short stories, perhaps when they become books, if they do, they will probably answer all those questions we, as readers, think about."},{"Title":"Kiss the Year Goodbye","review":"India Parker is determined not to ring in her new year with collard greens and black-eyed peas. She's willing to accept that she's going to be alone; that is until her crazy girlfriend, Joan, is in need of her digital camera to catch her cheating husband in the act. India goes to return the camera and comes home instead with flashes of Devin, Joan's 23-year-old son. He's not a boy anymore and he wants to prove to India that tricks are for kids. \\"Whatever It Takes\\" written by Tu-Shonda Whitaker has all of the elements making for an entertaining short read. I absolutely couldn't stop laughing at Mr. Marcus, Ju-Ju, Joan and Tracy . I also really enjoyed the lesson that young blood Devin teaches India.Dr. Cynthia Lampley takes her job as an urologist serious. While most people love their jobs, I'm sure Dr. Cyn takes a little more pride in doing her job well. So well in fact, her patients mostly always leave with a smile. Work seems to take over every aspect of her life. Her fianc&eacute;e Terrell is not happy with her career or her schedule. He'd like nothing more than for Cynthia to allow him to do what he does best, control the rest of their lives. Cynthia loves Terrell. On the other hand, she finds herself questioning if he's truly the one. \\"Every New Year\\" written by Brenda L. Thomas was a tolerable read. I think that the story itself was deficient except when it came to the male anatomy and sexual romps.Jovie and London have a lot in common; both are single, creative and have already spent the New Year together. Thanks to alcohol consumption and a broken heart, London may not recall the encounter. As London pursues Jovie, a quality woman who is worthy of so much more, he's quickly caught up in the essence of her uniqueness and soon finds it hard to stay away. Unfortunately, he meets Jada, her cocky, disrespectful identical twin, who appears hell bent on destroying their newfound relationship. \\"Dangerously In Love\\" written by Crystal Lacey Winslow is riveting and wild. I liked the way the story materialized.Gina is by far the definition of I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T! She has her own house, her own car yet the distance between DC and Philly has her wishing that they were one in the same. Chris, her long distance boo, lives in DC. While they've been dating a year, it's still hard to come home to an empty bed and have to survive until they can both coordinate the time to spend with one another. Jealousy seeps in as Bianca, her best friend and roommate, seems to be hittin' the high notes on a regular basis. \\"My Boo\\" written by Daaimah S. Poole was just okay. While I got the point of the story being that you should cherish what you have, I felt that there were just too many other unnecessary things mentioned in the book.I've mentioned on more than one occasion that I'm not a fan of anthologies; I do exploit them when I can to see if the contributing authors may be ones I'd like to check out in the future. Seeing that I already enjoy Crystal Lacey Winslow and have read Brenda L. Thomas, I will now have to add Tu-Shonda Whitaker's latest work to my to be read pile."},{"Title":"Kiss the Year Goodbye","review":"I love this boook for beginning to end!

I am usually a person that re-reads books like watching movies, but this is one book I will never revisit."},{"Title":"Kiss the Year Goodbye","review":"Might want to read this one last. I really liked Whatever it takes by Tu-Shonda, but it was a little tacky. What I really didn't understand was *****~~~~IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING DON'T READ PAST THIS!!!~~~***** the Monique thing. If Monique was a jeweler, then why in the world did she start that huge argument at the poetry slam? And if she was just a jeweler then why would Devin call her back the next day and say \\"I'm sorry about yesterday, she'll be at work and I have off,\\" if he was just picking up jewelry then would he really need to explain all that to her? (If someone can understand that then please explain it in your review.) It would be nice if she wrote an epilogue. I felt like she left me hanging with the ending. I mean did they get married, have kids, and did Joan accept all of this? Or did he break her heart leaving her all along for the rest of her life? I read this in 5hrs. (But two of those were spent trying to figure out that Monique thing.)My most fav is Every New Year. It was so good and original. Not until the epilogue did I say, \`oh I knew that was going to happen.' The way the story was it kept me interested and wanting to know more and what will happen. *****~~~ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING DON'T READ PAST THIS!!!~~~***** When she stared to remember her name, I thought she was going to yell, \\"My name is...\\" right on top of him and he was going to say what, and stop what he was doing to look at her with a blank look, but then again that brings us back to it was not predictable. I really hated how controlling Terrell was. We really didn't get to see a lot of that in the book but from what we did read it was a little shut up and let her handle her business. The \`good doctor' made this a good story. This took me about two hours.If you should read any, read Dangerously in Love. The whole story was great and the end set it off. I would have never thought that in all my life this was a wonderful tell. If you don't read any of the stories at least read this one. At the end you finally see why a lot of stuff was (why they were never in the room together, the crazy voice, and why it jumps from person to person). I have never read any other of the author's books, but if she is always this great of a writer then I will need to.My second fav. is My Boo. In My Boo we find out that close to home and in arms reach is not always the best for you. Gina has a long distance boyfriend named Chris. She starts to think that he is not spending enough time with her, so she *****~~~ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING DON'T READ PAST THIS!!!~~~***** hooks up with her X-roommates \\"friend\\" Khalil. She goes on a New Years get away with him when she treats her like trash. She then finds herself in the arms of the one who she truly loves and who truly loves her.Every story could have been its own full length book personally. I hope that these four talented authors get together and make another one of these books maybe about Valentines Day??? I don't know but this sure was a nice way to bring in the New Year."},{"Title":"Identities, Politics, and Rights (The Amherst Series in Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought)","review":"Most of the essays in this volume reflect a critical theory approach. I found the essays in Part II to be the most useful.

And, I think that it would be safe to say that this Regency romance (at least) does not seem to have any of the plot 'flaws' that generated so much debate in &quot;Lord Huntingdon's Legacy&quot; -- save for an instance in chapter three where Harriet suddenly descends into 20th century colloquialisms -- and is quite a charming follow-up to &quot;Lord Huntingdon's Legacy&quot; esp since it seems to be chock-full of eccentric characters and strange goings-on.Lady Harriet is visiting with her aunt in the country while both her mother and sister are off on their respective honeymoons, where she spends most of her days rambling about the countryside and painting water colours of flora and fauna. A sudden downpour one afternoon causes her to take shelter in a barn, where she comes across a curiously carved wooden box, a litter of new born kittens, and the incredibly handsome and flirtatious Lord Stanhope. This chance meeting also propels her into The Adventure Of The Stolen Ivory Dragon Pin (Lord Stanhope's younger brother has been falsely accused of stealing the pin from their neighbour, Baron Rothson, and Stanhope is trying to return the pin unobtrusively), as well as a rather heady flirtation with the incredibly charming Lord Stanhope. However, Stanhope also seems to be courting the extremely fetching daughter of the village vicar, Nympha Herbert. What is Harriet to make of Stanhope's alternate pursuit of her and his equally serious courtship of Miss Herbert? Especially when the beautiful and sweet natured Miss Herbert makes it only all too clear that she feels that she has the inside track to Stanhope's heart?While I rather enjoyed &quot;The Ivory Dragon,&quot; I did think that it was not quite so riveting a read as &quot;Lord Huntingdon's Legacy.&quot; And that was mainly because of the character of the 'other' woman. Nympha Herbert was just not unlikeable enough for this novel. She's pretty much a young woman who mistakenly assumes that Stanhope's attentions to her are serious and hangs about the place driving Harriet into paroxysms of jealously. As such, while I wanted Harriet and Stanhope to clear the air and realise that they had fallen in love with each other, I also felt sorry for Nympha for the blow that she was about to experience.However there is also much to laud about this novel, most especially the realistic manner in which Emily Hendrickson has 'fleshed' out the character of Lady Harriet. It is very seldom that we get to see all facets of a heroine's character, and I liked that Hendrickson made Harriet human enough to experience jealousy over Stanhope's seeming courtship of Nympha. And I loved the subplots involving the disappearing ivory dragon pin and the goings-on at the Stanhope estate -- golf mad brother who is suspected of theft, bird enthusiast father who has abdicated his responsibilities in order to dissect birds, a mother who dresses absurdly in a bid to get her husband's attention and the relatives who have descended upon them and refuse to leave -- these subplots provided just the right kind entertaining diversion, and worked well as a counterpoint to the romance subplot.All in all, I'd say that &quot;The Ivory Dragon&quot; is an entertaining read; and even if it did not quite compare to &quot;Lord Huntingdon's Legacy&quot; (for me anyway), I would still recommend it as a pleasing and charming diversion."},{"Title":"Hunting trips of a ranchman: Sketches of sport on the northern cattle plains","review":"Roosevelt purchased two cattle ranches in present-day western North Dakota, and many times went out to hunt for sport or for &quot;meat for the pot.&quot;Hunting Trips of a Ranchman in effect provides essays on the description, behavior, habitat, and survival of several species known to the prairies and the distant forests and mountain ranges. He talks of wildfowl (grouse, etc), elk, buffalo, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, black-tailed or mule deer, and finishes with Old Ephraim, the grizzly bear. All of these books are good for armchair readers who have never been to the western wildernesses or prairies, where these animals can be viewed with perseverance and patience.Roosevelt speaks of elk as the most noble of the deer family and perhaps the most majestic of all animals (which I tend to agree). He speaks of the incredible speed but also remarkable (and sometimes fatal) curiosity of the pronghorn, who are able to outrun any foes and keep in the open to see them at long distance with their excellent vision. However, they run in a straight line to provide a fairly consistent target for a good marksmen. He speaks of the enjoyable hunting of both kinds of deer, the difficulty of approaching the haunts of the bighorn, and his big finale, one of the best accounts of hunting grizzlies that I have ever read. Roosevelt's respect for the bear's ferocity is manifest, almost amounting to an admitted dread, which shows his good sense.If you are interested in the American wild, are curious about the habits and habitats of these large species, and are drawn to the hunting and outdoor mentality of the President who helped strengthen the national park system, this will be an entertaining read for you."},{"Title":"Hunting trips of a ranchman: Sketches of sport on the northern cattle plains","review":"This collection of Roosevelt's hunting trips and adventures puts you right out there with him, on the wild plains. The clarity of his descriptions and the easy way he takes you through his experiences has made this one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.

While the prose may be somewhat dated, as an avid reader and author I find it refreshing and relaxing. I use the present tense of the verb because I never seem to tire of reading and reading TR's sagas of life on the plains and the pursuit of big game. Today such pursuit is mostly for sport and I am but one of many who enjoy this great adventure, even to its fullest. Life on his ranch in the Badlands however required such pursuit for sustinence and as such required patience and persistance in far greater excess than many of us today possess.

It is a wonderful historic work of the showing of the sportsman over the market hunter in America with all big game species detailed on his hunts, and, how Roosevelt felt that the virtue of freedom was based in Americans learning to experience stalking game, living in the wilds all to create the citizen soldier.The Wilderness Hunter is my favorite for in this Teddy touches upon the prose of his soul and is the best work I have found so far in crafting a beautiful stories in the experience of hunting.I have read this book twice and it is still the one I reach for to carry along in times to keep me company."},{"Title":"Hunting trips of a ranchman: Sketches of sport on the northern cattle plains","review":"Enjoyed reading this book.

I knew that TR was quite an active man, full of energy and adventure. But, I did not appreciate the fact that we wrote very well. In this book he describes hunting several different types of animals - deer, buffalo, goats, elk to name a few. You practically feel like you are in the saddle with him on these numerous hunting trips.

His writing style is highly contagious. The reader is with him every step of the way whether it is in the prairie, up the mountain, in the valleys or deserts chasing deer, antelope, elk, bear, and cougar or simply gallivanting in the countryside during the 1880's.Adventures were many in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana and all points west. Broken bones and bruises were commonplace to our future twenty-sixth president but the man was as tough as nails. Although he mostly hunted for food, he did occasionally hunt for trophy game.The man absolutely admired the wilderness and it shows when he put pen to paper.

We can still view a little bit of the old Tree magic when we watch Fellini's film &quot;IL DOLCE VITA,&quot; in which she plays a poetry-spouting old bore. Fellini's camera picks up every angle of Tree's aging, decrepit face, and cruelly turns her into a caricature of herself.Daphne Fielding actually knew Iris Tree, and many of the anecdotes of THE RAINBOW PICNIC come from the two of them running into each other in various European countries. The book is essentially a portrait of two women who lives extravagantly and without giving anything back to the world which treated them so well. Excerpts from Tree's poetry are given here and there, and they support history's judgment of her as one who had no talent except for living. She was close to Krishnamurti, Chaplin, Garbo and Gish, or so says Daphne Fielding. Most biographies of the famous people she got on with will not list her name at all in the index, because she ws the definition of a minor player. Vanessa Bell did an unrecognizable portrait of her and Cecil Beaton contributes two photos to this volume. In one she looks very much like the US actress Mia Farrow, and in the other, like a washed-up Lotte Lenya. A touching story, a memorable book, but a mis-spent life.

I might play this lecture instead of music at my next 70s party, just to add thick atmosphere fast.The material was over my head, but I liked listening to it anyway. Even though this is the basics of Quantum Mechanics, it's still pretty complex stuff.

According to him, \\"Feynman was a very good teacher!\\" Skip forward a little more than ten years and you come to Feynman embarking on formulating a serious of introductory physics lectures directed at undergraduates at Cal Tech in the early 1960's. I purchased these lectures as a college Freshman in Fall 1970 and continue to refer to them for my professional research as well as for personal enjoyment.In this sweeping introduction to undergraduate physics. 360 pages or more are included in a 9\\"x12\\" folio. These pages are not numbered consecutively, but broken into 52 separate chapters. The first 40 pages of the book are devoted to a general introduction to the subject of physics, addressing such concerns as the place of physics among the other sciences, the fundamental forces of nature, and the general scale of the universe from subatomic particles to galaxies.The next 100 pages are devoted to the sort of mechanics that generally constitutes the first semester of most undergraduate physics courses. Feynman runs through the typical topics of kinematics (defining and calculating position, velocity, and acceleration), dynamics; conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum. The damped harmonic oscillator is the final topic treated in mechanics, and the author includes an introduction to complex numbers which makes this topic much more mathematically tractable.Thirty pages are devoted to special relativity, a topic that was included in the first semester of physics major physics that I took as a Freshman. This includes an especially good derivation of the relation between energy and mass: E=mc2. The centerpiece of this derivation is showing that the relativistic mass is equal to the product of the rest mass and gamma. This derivation uses a clever center of mass view of the elastic scattering of two equal mass particles off one another.The next 100 pages address \\"radiation\\"--that is, optics, light scattering, and diffraction. Seventy pages are given to \\"Heat\\" or what we call thermodynamics and kinetics/diffusion. Thirty pages cover general wave phenomena, including the wave equation and Fourier analysis. An introduction to quantum physics spans all of 15 pages. A final 9-page chapter introduces the student to the place of symmetry in physics, from simple spacial symmetries such as mirror reflection; to the more abstract concepts used in particle physics such as parity, and the relationship between matter and antimatter.As is the case for all three of the Feymnan lecture volumes, this book is probably not the best choice for one's primary undergraduate textbook. From my own experience as a college Freshman over 40 years ago, however, it is certainly readable and useful, especially when paired with a more conventional treatment of mechanics such as Halliday and Resnick'sFundamentals of Physics: (3 rd. edition, vol. 1 Pt.1)."},{"Title":"Performance Support Engineering Part One : Key Concepts","review":"If you're involved in an e-learning or knowledge management initiative you would probably gain something from reading this special report first to make sure you're on the right track. It's easy to get sidetracked by vendors touting specific tools and systems and by the marketing hype surrounding e-learning with the result that you can miss the big picture. This report helps you take a step back and take a wider viewpoint. The sections on the five level performance support maturity model and on the performance support continuum in the report are especially useful when you're working out your strategy.For software developers, designing software that directly supports work processing and learning does not happen by chance. It requires a deliberate process with a defined set of activities and deliverables that build upon each other to achieve the desired result. The method and activities to achieve performance-centered design are not difficult: rather they are different from traditional approaches. These requirements are summarized in this special report and fully detailed in &quot;The Performance Support Engineering Reference Handbook&quot; by the same author which is available separately from z-Shops. The handbook clearly describes each phase in the methodology and how to integrate it into an e-learning or knowledge management strategy or into a software development life cycle. They should serve as a recipe for success and none of the ingredients should be omitted. The significance of the handbook is that it not only articulates a proven methodology to follow, but does such in the context of new goals of integrating support for work processing with knowledge, data, tools, and communications. Before it was written, all development methods were toward achieving successful parts, not the required whole.The reference handbook is different from the other text books on performance support, performance-centered design and knowledge management on the market in that it has been structured as a starting point for someone who wants to develop more structured internal documention of their design and development methodology. To this end it includes process charts, document flows, deliverables, how to's and examples in a three-ring reference binder that can be used to help manage and structure projects. Other texts on the market are much less structured and it is much more difficult to extract this process information. To build a manual like this yourself would probably take a year of effort. Barry Raybould is really one of the only people who could have written this book due to his experience, perspective, and expertise. We should all be happy that he did.I recommend you read the special report &quot;Performance Support Engineering Part One : Key Concepts&quot; first and if you find the concepts useful then get the full handbook. (If you're already familiar with the concepts, just buy the handbook which includes the key concepts report.)"},{"Title":"The Price of Whiteness: Jews, Race, and American Identity","review":"From the time that Gd spoke to Abraham, two questions have been bugging everyone, Who is a Jew?

However this is where the major problem begins. It is not just Jewish identity that became connected to 'white, european western civilization' but rather a process whereby European-white civilization decided to craft the Jews into a white identity in the post-Holocaust period. Under the guise of arguing that Hitlers racial theories were lies there was a drive to create a 'new Jew' whereby Jews had to be assimilated into the white majoirty, thus the Jews became 'white'. But this book doesnt see the two sided process. It also doesnt ask the central question: \\"is race merely a contrived fake idea, created in the 19th century and perhaps worth abandoning?\\" The author assumes that whites see themselves as seperate from the 'others' but this is a ludicrous idea that only exists among the leftist-white upper classes who see everything in AMerica based on varying degrees of skin color.

These lectures, subsequently published under the title _Naming and Necessity_, were quickly recognized as one of those rare events that turns the world of philosophy on its ear. Amazingly, Kripke was a mere 29 years old at the time and he delivered the lectures without any notes. This book reflects both the advantages and shortcomings of the spoken form: it is clear, engaging, and often witty, but it is also repetitive at times and frustratingly incomplete at others.It is perhaps fitting that Kripke delivered these lectures the same year that Bertrand Russell passed away, since their main target is the descriptivist theory of names associated with Russell. According to Russell - and to the reigning philosophical orthodoxy until 1970 - names are best analyzed as abbreviated definite descriptions, i.e. as unique sets of properties possessed by their bearers. However, Kripke argues that on this analysis, all such properties belong to their possessors necessarily - which is obviously false. For instance, if the name \\"Billy Strayhorn\\" just means \\"The composer of 'Take the \\"A\\" Train,'\\" then there is no possible world in which Billy Strayhorn did not compose the song. But this is false: Even if Billy Strayhorn had never written any songs, he would obviously still be Billy Strayhorn. What a puzzle!In place of descriptivism, Kripke proposes the theory of direct reference, according to which a name \\"rigidly designates\\" its referent in every possible world in which it exists. That is, a name is just a \\"tag\\" attached to its referent, with no descriptive content whatsoever. Kripke also proposes an alternative theory for how names are transmitted, the causal theory of names. For Kripke, the name I use for Strayhorn is \\"his\\" name in virtue of the fact that it is related, by means of some appropriate causal chain, to Strayhorn himself.Much of this was anticipated by other philosophers, though this often goes unnoticed. But Kripke developed his theory in a highly interesting way and put it to all sorts of surprising uses. His discussion of necessity and possibility almost single-handedly resurrected essentialism and gave a major impetus to contemporary modal metaphysics. He claims that names for natural kinds, such as \\"gold\\" and \\"tiger,\\" rigidly designate their referents and argues that this establishes the existence of necessary a posteriori truths. He closes the book by offering an essentialist argument against the mind-body identity thesis.In short, Kripke has given philosophers much to talk about. Indeed, _Naming and Necessity_ has spawned a whole cottage industry of commentary. In my view, Kripke's project is flawed in many (though not all) respects. For instance, his causal theory is too vague to be of much use, and his argument that natural kind terms directly refer seems question-begging. Nonetheless, Kripke's book is extremely provocative, interesting, important, and even fun."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"No, really. Kripke maintains a vigorously-argued and important thesis here: the surprising conclusion that statements involving identity (e.g., when calling something or someone out by name) involve a posteriori necessity. This is quite striking because many have assumed that necessity was somehow substantially correlative with the a priori: but that involves a confusion of metaphysical necessity with epistemological necessity. With that idea in place, Kripke goes on to apply (all too briefly, unfortunately) it in some extremely thought-provoking--nay, well-nigh mind-blowing--ideas about things like natural kinds and the mind-body problem. I just wish he had gone into way more detail on these fascinating issues than the three oral lectures transcribed on these 180 or so pages.If you're reading this review, you've either a) already read this and I don't have to tell you how unique and important it is, or b) maybe have just taken an undergraduate philosophy course that had some lectures on Kripke, and are thinking about checking out the primary literature yourself. If the latter, do so. You'll be enriched, and you might just be taken on a journey from which you'll never return.

In three 1970 lectures (originally published in the Synthese volume *Semantics of Natural Language*) Kripke ran through the contribution of \\"counterfactual\\" reasoning involving tacit use of modal logic to several philosophical debates. Although his conclusions are none too tentative, if you can stand to countenance the thought of Holy Roman United Nations after reading this book you could also come to appreciate the moral of its reception (aptly put by Oxford's Michael Dummett in an article entitled \\"Could There Be Unicorns?\\", but rumored of by Montagovians some time previously).Kripkean semantics for modal logic created an extremely flexible, pluralistic framework for assessing the role of modalities in reasoning, but is often taken in the form in which it is presented (here) to constitute a return to Aristotelian scholasticism. And although much work inspired by \\"Naming and Necessity\\" does allow such a construal perhaps \\"metaphysical\\" reasoning fits other conformances as well, and thoughts had by greats going back as far as you like live a life in the present somewhat other than one might think -- and if the reader will go this far with Kripke, today there are ample tools available for going *much* further.

With the reductio ad absurdum of post-modernism, Kripke restores the viability and stability of naive realism by fixing the referent in linguistic activity. It's a brilliant move, and one that has withstood the antagonists with suave and elegant argument. What Kripke has done is completely undermine the whole post-modernist project, which, at its core, attempts to deconstruct every semblance of reality. By using the very same tools, namely language, Kripke shows how the post-modernists have failed, and why they have.Intellectual skepticism is a healthy attitude for any critical thinker, but this very-well written argument on the necessity of naming that establishes and stabilizes our world around us is a must for all students of philosophy, and for all disiciplines that believe &quot;differance&quot; makes all the difference. Kripke shows that it does not."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"I would happily have hiven this book 4 stars if it hadn't been for the third lecture - it very nearly provoked a 1 star review. Why?Let's start from the beginning: Kripke makes a very persuasive argument to the effect that we know named objects simply by their names, rather than via a definite description. Thus, the example that one can know of 'Feynman' without knowing anything about him other than that he is a famous physicist, a description so far from being definite that it could apply to any number of people. So, a name is a 'rigid designator', something we use to point out a particular item, but not itself simply shorthand for a description.This is all good stuff, though it has the mild flaw that such rigid designators cannot achieve any meaning beyond one individual's mind unless they have some association to a description. For example, if you hear me talking about 'Cicero' without giving any description, then you have heard the rigid designator, but you have nothing to attach it to. You need a description, even if it may change over time, and it may be inadequate, to get some idea of what the rigid designator refers to.Unfortunately, in the third lecture everything falls apart. First Kripke attempts to argue that 'heat' and 'molecular motion' are necessarily identical. This may be so if you're prepared to attach a description to the rigid designator 'heat', something along the lines of 'the sensation which I feel under certain kinds of sensory stimulation, which can be shown by experiment to correspond with the action of causing mercury to expand and contract'. If you don't have that description, you have two entirely separate concepts: the intuitive sense of 'temperature' derived from sensation, and 'calorific heat', a scientific concept based around mean kinetic energy in ensembles of molecules. The description is what links the two, and so without that description, Kripke's argument collapses. But the description is precisely the thing he refuses to accept. In fact the argument collapses anyway, because in no way is it necessary that calorific heat and the sensation of temperature should be identical.Now things get worse. In this argument Kripke acknowledges quite happily that 'heat' = 'stimulation of certain nerve fibres'. But then he attempts to argue that while that equation is necessary, the equation of pain with stimulation of other nerve fibres isn't! He commits such open lunacy as the following: '...it would seem that God need only create beings with C-fibers capable of the appropriate type of physical stimulation . . . it would seem, though, that to make the C-fiber stimulation correspond to pain, or tbe felt as pain, God must do something in addition to the mere creation of the C-fiber stimulation; He must let the creatures feel the C-fiber stimulation as pain, and not as a tickle, or as warmth, or as nothing.' But this applies equally well to heat, so why was Kripke happy with that equation?The problem appears to be a very elementary mistake in modal logic, which I would not have expected of Kripke. Viz, he assumes that any conceivable counter-factual counts as a possible world accessible from this one (e.g. a counter-factual in which I feel pain but my C-fibres are not stimulated). But this is only the case in the strong S5 modal logic. In more realistic modal logics, possible worlds are joined by a complex accessibility relation, such that necessity in a world depends on truth in all worlds accessible from that one, not in all possible worlds. Just because Kripke can imagine such a counter-factual, it does not make it a world accessible from this one.So, in conclusion: buy it, read it, but don't treat it as holy writ. Personally, I'd stick to Quine."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"&quot;It's all just about language, not about the truly deep issues in metaphysics.&quot;You've got to be kidding!

The first lecture catches the reader a little unprepaired, jumping directly to the core of the argument, which develops in the second lecture and is expanded in the third. The third lecture is probably the best, with the discussion about natural kinds being my personal favorite. All the important names of analytic philosophy somewhat converge on this book, it is a classic, a revolutionary and inspiring book.

Kripke is regarded by many as the pre-eminent philosopher of recent times- while Naming and Necessity is widely viewed as the most significant piece of post-Wittgenstein analytic philosophy.In the book Kripke discussion of a range of issues and questions that has altered the trajectory of modern philosophy including:* Accidental and essential properties,* Theories of reference (direct reference v. descriptivist)* Epistemic and metaphysical necessity (he poses the possibility of necessary a posteriori truth and contingent a priori truth)Readers unfamiliar (or rusty) with Kripke may find the pertinent chapters in Scott Soames' excellent Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning helpful in preparing to engage Naming and Necessity. The small text \`On Kripke' in the Wadsworth series is also useful and even more introductory.Overall, this is an important work in analytic philosophy that would make a valuable addition to any collection.

This is true even if your primary philosophical interest is &quot;spirituality&quot; and the &quot;World Soul&quot;, whatever that is. The importance of language is recognized even by Continental philosophers, given their concern with semiotics, structuralism, etc. Analytic philosophers, needless to say, have always understood it, and none more so than Kripke. Kripke does an incredible job of clearing up a mass of confusions that have surrounded the notion of necessity ever since the days of Hume and Kant.

It has reshaped philosophy of language and metaphysics, and has significantly influenced philosophy of mind and epistemology, among other areas of philosophy.\\"Naming and Necessity\\" is largely a transcription of three lectures that Kripke delivered when he was 29 years old - without lecture notes. The book reflects the informal style of these lectures; it is friendly and engaging, albeit sometimes unclear.Among other things, Kripke refutes descriptivist theories about the meaning and reference of proper names and natural kind terms, and develops a new account in their place; defends the modal concepts of necessity and possibility, and distinguished between necessity and a prioricity; and argues that there are necessary truths knowable only a posteriori and contingent truths knowable a priori.Of course, the book has some critics. However, in my opinion, Kripke does not commit some of the errors of which he has been accused in other reviews here.I think that the book will be very difficult for those unfamiliar with analytic philosophy, especially philosophy of language. I recommend \\"Naming and Necessity\\" for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in philosophy.

(A very wise 29 indeed!)The books grammatically and punctuation construction can make you mad at times, but generally the writing (speaking) flows pretty well.The book's overall tone is highly specific but never pretentious, as many philosophers are known to be. Kripke also embodies something rare for a philosopher -a sense of humor.Despite the length of 164 pages, the work is incredibly dense but repetitive enough that if read closey can be readily understood.Summary:Kripke starts out by defining the terms he is going to use in the following lectures. A 'referent of the description' is the object uniquely satisfying the conditions of the expression. A 'rigid designator' implies in &quot;every possible&quot; world something that is unchanged or the same object. The &quot;possible worlds&quot; talk is about the theory of probability on a large scale. (Insert: &quot;Any world that was possible to happen had it have been any other way.&quot;)The first big thing he rejects is that a priori statements are not necessary and can be contingent and a posteriori truths can be necessary. Kripke then later on rejects the &quot;cluster of descriptions.&quot; The name means the same and it still won't be a rigid designator. Kripke's quandry gets multiplied when he claims that even if in a possible world some of the descriptions didn't fit the object in question it would still be what it is (i.e. socrates would still be socrates even if he wasn't the man from Athens.) In the second lecture he highlights the previous talk as &quot;transworld-identification strain.&quot;Even if the conditions don't satisfy to uniquely identify the speaker, the speaker still recieved the reference through a line of communication that was real. As far as synonyms are concerned we have to find out that something is still that same something (even though it has a different name) only empirically. (i.e. Hesperus is Phosphorus -can't be known a priori! Therefore an example of the a posteriori truth.)From general terms (i.e. cow) one can't know the properties that would uniquely identify an individual. He then agrees with Mill against Russell and Frege on particular names but not on general naming. He ends the book rather abruptly in my opinion where he leaves the reader with Gold has the specific weight that it has in all possible and a specific name that fixes a referent is a priori true.Conclusion:Perplexing...I probably did a bad job with that summary but it was the best I could do. I'll probably read the book again but I recommend if you read this to get the historical work he talking about to follow along (Mill, Frege, Russell). Kripke could have revised this properly to make it a little more clearer. Minus the clarity though this book is a gem that'll make you think about naming in a new way."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Actually, many works written by analytic philosophers are difficult for beginners to understand. However, this one written by Saul Kripke is more easy and fun because it was originally three lectures delivered by the author at Princeton University. Therefore, many vocabularies and expressions in the book are not much technical, but more colloquial. If you want to read analytic philosophy like listening to an easy and fun talk, Naming and Necessity is the proper one for you."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Kripke's much celebrated work should be read by everyone who has a serious interest in philosophy of language. Kripke claims that names are rigid designators, i.e. words that refer to the same in all possible worlds. This is intimately conncted to Kripke's strong thesis, that names do not have meaning. In my opinion this work, although HIGHLY original, is just based on dubious exaples, some of the language-users in Kripke's examples do not master the language they attempt to use at all. Does this provide suffiencient basis for saying something whoch is signifcant about language?Personally, I believe that meanings are in the head, and if i did not have knowledge in my head when I refer to Kripke, I would not really be refering to Kripke.Kripke also writes about necessity. This is creative work. But if I remember correctly, he says the &quot;This wooden table is not made of ice&quot; is an a priori particular truth. I think he does a serious mistake here. He does realize that this knowledge is derived from the two premises: (1) This is a wooden table, (2) If a table is made of wood, it is not made of ice. now the first prop, I think anyone should agree that is empirical. (I believe the second is too). So this is not known a priori.But Kripke is very interesting. His book should be read. But what happened to Wittgenstein's &quot;only death gives life it's meaning&quot;. When did this leave philosophy?"},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Naming and Necessity is one of the classics of 20th century philosophy. If you haven't read this book, I suggest you drop your current reading and pick this up. Simply put, metaphysics isn't dead (although Kripke is broadly speaking in the tradition of analytic philosophy).If you have read it, you might want to follow up with some of the work of Scott Soames."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"It is outstanding in its clarity. Although there is a debate on Kripke's originality in the new theory of reference, I don't think it could affect its status in the 20th Century Analytic Philosophy. A misery is that many people has written a lot of stuff pertaining to it but based plainly on miscomphrehension. I thus recommend those who want to write on the theory of reference should have a thorough reading of this book."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"I know that this book is famous and everything, but it's not an easy read, and i remain unconvinced. Having said that, i'm just a first year so what do i know~!"},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Given the style of the book, it is impossible to say whether Naming and Necessity's main thesis is true or false. The most appropriate truth value is incomplete. However, the truth value is not the exciting part of the book. It is the possible that science is metaphysically necessary. If we take names to be rigid designates and the names are contingently identical, then they are necessarily identical. Kripke's example is \\"Heat is the motion of molecules\\". Once heat is identified with the motion of molecules, then they most be identical in all possible worlds. This understanding of names (if correct) shields science from most forms of skepticism. The only form of skepticism left is the mundane possibility of miscalculating.Kripke's thesis is grandiose in its implications and plausible, these two qualities make it valuable. Even though it is an important thesis, I think Kripke's understanding of identity is flawed. He uses his thesis to justify \\"a cat is an animal\\" has a necessary truth. However, identity is reflexive and an animal is a cat is not necessarily true. So, Kripke's identity must be an implication of sorts. Or Kripke's identity only holds for a subgroup of rigid designates."},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"Put the dog out, slip on your fuzzy velveteen loafers, pour yourself a glass of cabernet sauvignon, pack your pipe full of a tobacco -- the smell of which reminds you of days at sea, settle into that worn leather chair -- the one that belonged to your grandfather and get ready to dive into one of the most delicious philosophical texts since derrida's last book. Absolutely riveting!!!"},{"Title":"Naming and Necessity","review":"This book reads like a novella, yet it delves the most complicated areas of philosophy today."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I cannot believe the previous reviewer and I had the same book. King Rat stands up there with the classic Ivan Denisovich any way you read it...for the great story, or for its cynical look into men's souls. This is truly Clavell's best work, no silly Ninja antics, no inane super TaiPans or Anjin-Sans and their ridiculous MegaMistresses...just a book about real men in real hell, simply written and therefore all the more powerful.King Rat is a young, cocky American civilian who finds himself drafted into the Army during WWII, and ends up a POW at the notorious Changi camp. But the King isn't an ordinary POW, he is the finagler par excellance. The savvy corporal trades whatever he gets and makes a profit however he can. And he holds sway over the corrupt POW officers because he deals for them on the black market, exchanging wedding rings and wrist watches for food -- with the King always getting his cut. Is the King wrong to take money or food as his price? The officers have been known to double deal themselves, giving King a fake Rolex to trade -- knowing full well the guard would punish King severely, maybe kill him, if the fraud was discovered. King isn't fooled. He just cheats right back, skimming a little of the top. The men of Changi are starving, their true blue, God Save the Queen officers are stealing their food and then playing bridge with clear consciences. Clavell has a great way of illustrating what most of us already know: the loudest braying patriot/hero/saviour is usually the most cowardly and venal. There is nobility, however, in the worst of us...and Clavell paints us a picture that is unforgettable. Is King the only truly uncorrupted soul at the camp? At least he's honest about his cheating. King shares his food willingly, uses his friends callously, and does his best to save those he can -- all things being equal. King's blatant disregard for moral fakery tarnishes him more than his actions. He befriends a young, innocent English pilot, all upper class bravado and stiff upper lip. At first, King seeks to use the pilot as an interpreter, but the friendship genuinely grows. King Rat looks in great detail at what men do what they have nothing left to lose. Some survive...one may even thrive. The rest cope and get by with whatever is inside them and a little luck. I hate to get all preachy here, because this is one hell of an exciting book. It's loaded with adventure. Although there is not enough explicit torture for the previous reviewer's tastes,I don't think most people would find it tame. This is not, however, a string 'em up and lash them book. It's about survival. Read it on any level you want, but by all means, read it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"James Clavell's \\"King Rat\\" is hands down the worst of his Asian saga. Only related to the other four by the main character's possession of a \\"gold ring, signet of the Clan Gordon\\" (italics) mentioned once on the seventh page. Any reader of Clavell would expect this to have some significance later but the thread never reemerges. Did the author forget about it, carried away by his clearly sophmoric adulation of his Hero? Or did he toss it in at his publisher's request in order to somehow justify this waste of print by weakly connecting it to his better works. And what is this shiftless down-and-out motherless drunkard's son doing with such a treasure anyway? Surely that would have made a more interesting book. Of course, the matural answer is that Clavell is telling his own story, what he lived through as a POW. He has, however, forgotten the first rule of freshman exposition: \\"Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting.\\" Certainly, there are traces of the Clavell magic--despite his always hackneyed prose, he is a master storyteller, but in this case the threads lead nowhere and peter out where a quick death would be more merciful. A large theme is built up around a secret radio, but when discovered not once but twice the Japanese commander who has been built up as a terrifying menace offers cigarettes to all involved. None are tortured,jailed or even questioned. It is as if he is uncertain as to whether he wants to write The Gulag Archipelago or Catch 22 and settle for Hogan's Heroes\\" (of TV sitcom fame). Changi makes Stalak 13 look the Hanoi Hilton. There is even a Corporal Schwarz-like Japanese guard who, like his sitcom counterpart has \\"no stomach for war\\" and comes close to saying \\"I know nothing-Nothing!\\" Clavell,who knows how to spin yarn, would be great on a campout and we cannot forget the majestic sweep of his four ?good? books, but, like the t-shirt says, \\"I spent nearly four years in a Japanese POW camp and all could come up with was this lame book. I was going to give the book away but instead chucked into the recycle bin."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"Although I hate that expression (see above), I must admit it applies totally to this marvelous edition. Granted that if you listen to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, you will want to follow the words--which are not always provided with many recordings nowadays. Then given the words, you will also want to know the meanings of most of Gilbert's more esoteric words (&quot;Daphnephoric&quot;), or simple words that have lost or changed their meanings since Gilbert's day (&quot;Be firm, my pecker&quot;!), or references to people (Captain Shaw), places (Basingstoke), or even objects (Parliamentary trains). Then too, the complete G&amp;S nut will want to see the original versions of some of the songs and certainly the texts to songs that were cut just after opening night or even during rehearsals. In fact, I still have a lot of fun just looking at the left-hand pages to brush up on my G&amp;S trivia. So while this book sells at twice the price of other collections of the &quot;Savoy&quot; plays, it gives twice as much and should be as welcome as the flowers that bloom in the Spring."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"Occupying that middle area between musicals and grand opera, the works of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan are showing their age to the point where this invaluable guide can become an invaluable, addictive pleasure.While their stories and music are lighthearted and accessible, the Victorian events and personalities that infuse the lyrics do need some explanation, and Ian Bradley s guide is the place to look.The book itself offers additional pleasure, since Oxford University Press decided to print the complete libretto of all 13 operas on the right-hand page, leaving the left-hand pages free for Bradley's footnotes. This saves an enormous amount of page-flipping.Bradley' footnotes cover a wide range of knowledge. They clear up obscure references, offer alternative line readings, give advice from actors, comment on stage business, describe who the major characters were modeled on and even add songs that were dropped from the production.Bradley also uses this opportunity to discuss Gilbert and Sullivan s solo works, and how they were sometimes cannibalized for use in their collaborations.Each work is prefaced with a short introduction describing the conditions under which they were created. While Gilbert and Sullivan were known to be at loggerheads through most of their collaboration, it is amazing to realize that the popularity of their operas did not reflect their distate for the work. This is particularly true in Sullivan s case; he always thought of himself as a musician first, and resented having to bend his music to fit Gilbert s words.&quot;The Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&quot; is a must for any fan of the Savoy Operas, and recommended for those just starting to discover the delights of comic opera's pirates, policemen and peers."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"The book nicely provides the (almost) complete librettos with detailed notes on, among other things, the various versions from preproduction onward to twentieth century changes, the origins, the inspirations, and the meaning of words Bradley thinks are obscure. He is much more likely to explain reasonably familiar words than to assume too much. The introductions nicely trace the history down to the most recent productions. Those who have seen the current movie Topsy-Turvy will find the notes helpful in seeing some of the actual events depicted in the movie. The one omission is Thespis, the first collaboration. The libretto, but not the score, survived. Two areas of omission are exhaustive treatment of either the major performers or recordings. However, this is an excellent source for lovers of G&amp;S."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"This omnibus edition of the complete Gilbert and Sullivan librettos is a handbook for the G&amp;S enthusiast who wants to know everything about the operas and their librettos. Each opera contains the complete libretto, as well as an interesting and entertaining introduction, which reflects the nature of the annotations in the libretto. The annotations are also humorous, which adds to the reading pleasure. As for the librettos, they are well-produced, with only slight inaccuracies, yet are still readable. The book is well-organised, with the lyrics on one page and the annotations on another. Overall, to all G&amp;S fans, this is excellent value for money. I would encourage all G&amp;S enthusiasts to buy this book whenever they can."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"This is the only book for a true Gilbert and Sullivan fan, especially since it literally is the only complete collection of their works available today for purchase. Luckily, it's a good one: it includes all of their Savoy operettas as well as their lesser-known later works such as Utopia Ltd. The real jewels of the collection, however, remain their best operas: HMS Pinafore, The Mikado, The Pirates of Penzance, The Sorcerer. This book is especially helpful because it contains all of the lyrics to all of the songs, and most CD recordings of the operas do not come with the lyrics (for many of the songs, it is impossible to catch all of the words simply by hearing them). Ian Bradley's notes, printed off to the side, are also interesting and help shed light on obscure words and phrases. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"This is just the best of several annotated G & S libretto collections that have been published over the years. It is actually a republication (with revisions) of two paperbacks by Bradley published some years earlier. They are listed as out of print, which they are, but that doesn't matter with this excellently produced single volume now available. Bradley doesn't have space to give us the last word on all aspects of the operas, but he is exhaustive on the texts, and no real G & S fan can afford not to have this on the shelf. The only other one to look for (it is out of print) is the volume by Martyn Green because his notes include a lot of valuable information about staging."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"Though sung in English, it can be difficult to understand the words of G&S operas without libretti. I listen to the CDs while following along in this book, and it has greatly increased my pleasure in G&S, as well as my admiration for both Gilbert's witty and insightful lyrics and the way Sullivan carries the words along with his music."},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","review":"This book is the ultimate source for information on all things Gilbert and Sullivan. Written for a contemporary audience, it has a plethora of background info on the productions of the Savoy operas, the singers who originated the roles, the translations to some of the meaning of the words in the lyrics (which were inside jokes back in the time of Gilbert and Sullivan:1870-1900 and a history of performances throughout the 20th century. There are profiles and biographies of William Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan as well as Richard D'Oyly Carte. William Gilbert was a playwright, poet and writer for the satirical magazine Fun. His comic style of writing came to its full powers when he wrote the lyrics and libretti for all the light operas he conceived. Arthur Sullivan was a serious English composer, who at the time was probably competing against the bigger names of Elgar, Ralph Vaughn Williams or Benjamin Britten. Arthur Sullivan wrote English equivalent for German Lieder as Victorian drawing room songs, as well as symphonies and concerti. The Irish Symphony and the Program Music- The Tempest are his most acclaimed. Gilbert and Sullivan were not always a perfect match. Their personalities were distinctly different. Gilbert was humorous, witty, playful and always catering to popular tastes. Arthur Sullivan was intellectual, artistic, serious and introverted. All his life he was unable to step out of the fame he got for the light operas he wrote with Gilbert. He wanted the fame of the serious music composer and not just the silly light operas he made so popular in what was at the time the ancestor of today's Armerican Broadway- the Savoy.Richard D'Oyly Carte was the manager and impresario for Gilbert and Sullivan. He first collaborated with them in Trial By Jury in 1875. He would manage finances for the Savoy, a theatre built especially for Gilbert and Sullivan light operas. D'Oyly Carte's children and grandchildren, among them Bridget D'Oyly Carte, would continue to produce Gilbert and Sullivan operas after his death. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued successfully launching all the great titles- The H.M. S. Pinafore (first premiered 1878) Pirates Of Penzance (1879-1880) The Mikado (1885)as well as other great but less popular Princess Ida, Iolanthe, Patience, The Gondoliers, The Yeoman Of The Guard, The Grand Duke and Utopia Limited. The D'Oyly Carte Opera has had a rich history of performers- baritone John Reed, soprano Valerie Masterson, tenor Phillip Potter and mezzo soprano Christene Palmer as well as bass Donald Adams. There is a sensational film made in 1967 of The Mikado starring these legendary singers. I hope this great book gets you into Gilbert and Sullivan.

All the librettos are here with useful annotations, especially for Americans for whom many of the references draw a blank - Gilbert's references to topical events and contemporary persons, and words which were sometimes rare even then, and Sullivan's to Handel, Verdi, &c. There is also much material on the development of the operettas, different versions, the inspiration for a song.

Her full-blooded life springs from the pages of this book, sharing a powerful message of self-discovery and self-love. If anyone can speak of the disillusionment fraught within celebrity, and the ensuing blows to one's self-esteem, it is Gloria Steinem. Criticized and scrutinized for everything from her love life to her choice of colored hose, Steinem has experienced first hand the ludicrous workings of the media. Her resulting insight into such issues as self-individuation and self-identification are timely and important. Gloria has created a beautiful work of art which defies the media's constant need to define and label her into neat little categories; in &quot;Revolution From Within: A Book of Self-Esteem&quot; Gloria defines herself as human being, a category we can all relate to."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"I have read many many books, and I have to say that this is one of my absolute favorites.

Yet in a way, that I believe only Gloria Steinem could tell it. She is at once brilliant, insightful, comforting, and angering. Her book made me see life through new eyes, better eyes. Steinem's book is also so obviously well researched, in fact startling facts and statistics reside on every page.

I remember a couple of years ago watching an interview with Gloria Steinmen who stated that there was no biological difference between men and women. Right away I thought she was crazy - of course there are biological differences between men and women - it's a scientific fact. But after reading this book, I understood the reason she had said that.Throughout history, people have used \\"scientific\\" reasoning to differentiate between men and women resulting with women being the \\"weaker\\" sex. Take for example, craniometry - which skull size and shape determines brain size which determines such things as intelligence and capacity for moral behavior. Of course we know now today how ridiculous and inaccurate it is to determine a person's intelligence by their skull size. But craniology was used in the 19th century by the British to justify racist policies such as Irish and black Africans (which the British considered to be inferior races.) Craniology was also used in France to demonstrated that women are inferior to men because of their smaller crania (implying that small brains equated inferior intellingence.) This book had a section about craniology as applied to women and different races, as well as other examples of how society has used many explanations (scientific or social or moral) to keep women in their place.So when Gloria Steinment stated that biologically men and women were not different in physical strength and ability, she was questioning our perception of the sexes based on \\"scientific\\" research. Basically, we can't always accept what the scientific community has to say about the sexes because much of their reasoning will be based on social expectations - veiled with a \\"scientific\\" explanation.This is a very empowering book. It questions a woman's role in society through history. This book reminded me what we all had learned in our education - to question everything that is accepted in society, because the reasoning is not always as \\"scientific\\" as they claim."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"I've read this book at various points in my life and it never fails to ring true. In crappy times it was the voice of clarity and confidence, and with the existing empowerment in the day-to-day, it serves as validation and a nice boost to want to do more. This book should be required reading for every teenaged girl."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"This book addresses the problem of self-esteem in general, but it is particularly suited for women. While every woman will not agree with all of Gloria Steinem's views, this book has become a classic. It addresses a fundamental problem in the female life cycle. The author has developed a clear insight into her own inner struggles, and has a remarkable ability of introspection. One may have the genes, the education, the financial security, and many other advantages in life, but if a woman is lacking in self-esteem their talents are wasted. The author has seen if happen among women, and obviously felt compelled enough to write a book about the problem. Gloria Steinem is a voice, one voice, but what a voice!"},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"From the jacket:\\"Self-esteem is created in childhood, but it's never too late for a happy childhood. She underlines the importance of \\"un-learning and of disrespecting the educations that so often disrespect us; offers practical ways of voyaging inward to learn from the unique knowledge within each of us; and mends the mind-body split by underscoring the wisdom that comes from our bodies.\\"Not just for women, my favorite chapter is on Romance vs. Love. 379 pages with index and bibliography."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"Great book, great service. Very fast shipping and cheap, great value. No complaints at all. Thanks a bunch!"},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"This book is Ms. Steinem's psychological autobiography. She certainly is a very intelligent and independent thinker but certain things, it seems, remain impossible for her to comprehend. When she writes, &quot;marriage is like a little death&quot; you immediately sense you are in the hands of a radical feminist. You can see your way clear to supporting her support of fat women(even though doctors tell us this not healthy) and lesbians, perhaps, but at certain point it becomes clear she is more anarchist than thoughtful intellectual. When she say: &quot;overthrow the whole f...ing. patriarchy&quot; you want to step back and think about what road she is actually taking you, the reader, down. The book is about self-esteem(something force fed to young black males in the 60's just before their rate of incarceration shot from near 0 to 50%) but does she really know what she means. Would she have us say to our children, &quot;you are the product of a little death&quot; to build their self-esteem? Or is she thinking of her perfect world in which there is no marriage? She fully reveals her extremely sad and unhappy childhood but nevertheless seems to have learned so little from it. If fact, men and women created each other through the forces of evolution for compatibility but she insists on ignoring this basic biology in favor of her own personal politics which seems little more than an extension of the disappointment she suffered at her father's hand. There are many books like: His Needs,Her Needs and The 91% Factor:Why Women Initiate 91% Of Divorce, which treat men and women as equal, and fundamentally compatible. They proceed on the safe, intellectually supportable, and civilized assumption that peace and love between the sexes is prefered to Ms. Steinem's constant battle of the sexes which seemingly can never be won."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"Over a period of decades sociologists have noticed an interesting trend: people who win Nobel Prizes, run large corporations, championship athletes, etc. tend to have high levels of self-esteem. Conversely, many of the unaccomplished tend to have low self-esteem. In this chicken vs. egg analogy, Steinem and her fellow travelers have arrived at the conclusion that achievement is a derivative of self-esteem. Wrong. Self-esteem, like everything else worth having, is earned. You cannot be given &quot;self-esteem pills&quot;. If it makes Steinem feel any better, a generation is being inculcated with the values she espouses in this book i.e. &quot;I'm OK, You're OK&quot;. Later in life, when confronted by failure, these citizens won't look for the causes in themselves (&quot;It can't be my fault, I'm OK&quot;). They will reach for politicians and leaders on the right and the left who will be more than happy to supply scapegoats."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"... but I just *can't* do it.Most of the book, I loved, orat least enjoyed.However, there's a problem with it. Like manyfeminists, Steinem has been suckered into believing in the vast underground world-wide conspiracy of Satan-worshippers doing unspeakable things to children who don't remember any of it for the next 15 years ....That bothers me. Having such an influential voice of modern feminism put her weight behind a movement that does more to make working mothers feel guilty about sending their children to daycare than it actually does to empower ANYone, in support of a phenomenon that any rational person can see does not exist, is a tragic waste of talent.If you can manage to tune out that aspect, enjoy the book..."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"If Gloria Steinem wasn't a cia operative...she maybe would be able to have some credibility to take seriously. but she is. so this book is junk"},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"Gloria Steinem reads this book. Generally, i do not listen to books read by the author, but this author is so genuine and heartfelt that it was a pleasure to hear a messageabout healing from her. She recalls her childhood and her insecurities in an effort to help other women (and men too) overcome their sense of worthlessness and lowself esteem. There are many \\"wow\\" moments after comprehending a concept and hearing her suggestions about healing...like women used to have sewing circles totalk and support each other, and she suggests: form a similar circle.

I am a 35 year-old woman and have had self esteem issues all my life. I have read different self help books, but only Ms. Steinem's book was something that I could relate to in my own life. I used a high lighter pen to high light some of the more helpful passages in the book and I must have highlighted 50% of the book. This book is something that I will refer to often when I need a little emotinal pick-me-up.

I love Gloria Steinem and all of her books, but this is definitely my favorite. I've read it twice and have listened to the audio countless times. Just listening to her is comforting. This book reminds us to question the status quo and listen to our true selves more. We are so used to doing things a certain way that we don't stop to question why some things are the way they are. Women are taught to think and act a certain way and so are men. Anyone who strays from the course is ostracized. Most people underestimate the importance of self-esteem. But if more people felt better about themselves, they wouldn't do or say the things they do. If you felt stronger, more comfortable and happier with yourself, not only could you deal with any abuse from others, you would be less likely to dish it out yourself. Please read this book or listen to the audio."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"I read this book several years ago and still refer to mattersamong its pages.

This book makes a great introduction.Power to you, Gloria Steinem! Thank you for the shot in the arm."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"Reading this a second time is helpful. Ms Steinem continues to share that light which has guided those willing to see for almost 50 years now. She asks that we turn inward and get to know ourselves and gives exercises and factual material to assist in the journey to self worth. My need to understand the destructive nature of hierarchical paradigms and to avoid any support of these societal structures drives me to read and re-read chapters and paragraphs. And, as always, I learned some things about me and a little more about the world and nourished my ambition to work to improve both."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"\\"The Nature of This Flower Is to Bloom\\" - a quote by Alice Walker, quoted in this book.Steinem writes \\"Without self-esteem, the only change is an exchange of masters; with it, there is no need for masters.\\" Steinem discusses how to identify patterns and definitions that are familiar and feel like home, yet are counter to our higher priority intents and health.\\"The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.\\" Muriel Rukeyser, quoted in this book.Steinem honors her mother by saying, \\"She managed to break the pattern of her own upbringing and pass on something quite different to us . . . my mother did her best to make us feel unique and worthwhile . . . 'Children don't belong to us,' she used to say, paraphrasing what she had learned from this blend of many world religions . . .'we don't own them. We help them become who they are.' \\"Steinem writes \\"Hierarches try to convince us that all power and well-being come from the outside, that our self-esteem depends on obedience and measuring up to their requirements.\\" Conversely, she points out that in Greek philosophy Allotriosis, \\"Self-alienation,\\" for instance, was the greatest evil . . . and oikeiosis (\\"self-love,\\" \\"self-acceptance,\\"or \\"self-contentedness\\") was the greatest goal. Plato called \\"rational self-love' crucial to progress because it alone 'requires a man to be concerned for his own future condition.' Aristotle equated self-contentedness with happiness.\\"After reading this book, I believe more strongly an idea I believed before reading this book: I don't primarily define Steinem as a great feminist thinker. Rather, she is a great social philosopher across many non-gender, non-race, non-religion, non-nationality, and non-era dependent disciplines. If I ever have a daughter, I will make sure she studies this book.\\"Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you. \\" Jean-Paul Sartre, quoted in this book.Steinem asserts: \\"The art of life is not controlling what happens to us, but using what happens to us.\\""},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"As you would expect, a book on self-esteem is likely to cover a lot of ground. After all, this is a huge topic, but Gloria Steinem manages to pare it down into seven insightful chapters, covering everything from unhappy childhoods, to the importance of un-learning and relearning, to our bodies, romance, and more spiritual and universal issues such as connecting to nature and animals to help self-esteem.Filled with references to interesting studies and individual stories to demonstrate points, the book is vintage Steinem. Some of the studies, however, began to feel familiar. I read Steinem's Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions a few years ago, and I'm sure that some of this material was covered in the earlier book. On the other hand, self-esteem issues in domineering patriarchal societies is likely to cause some overlap.For me, the book's flaw is Steinem's claim that it's for men and women. Obviously, millions of men have self-esteem issues that keep them from living full, rich lives, however, the book seemed so focused on women's challenges that the men seemed to be forgotten. Sure, there were some stories about men's experiences and studies about boys and girls, however most are centered on women's experiences and obstacles, which is a shame. If there were more studies/stories and more discussion about men's challenges, the book would have lived up to the author's claim. Also, when you slap a picture of a smiling Gloria Steinem on the cover, browsers will assume this a feminist book, which makes me wonder if the publisher was seriously interested in reaching the male market at all."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"Haven't had to much time to try and read yet, but I started it and found it incredibly moving so far.

Since everyone knew that pop-cultural conceptionalizations of important psychological concepts such as self-esteem cynically had been turned into little more than vehicles to get us to our private promised lands of personal and public success--while gleaning for their authors and designers massive amounts of money from people in pain--the recovery movement, almost from the get-go, was suspect: This is your brain...This is your brain on Faith Popcorn and Tony Robbins...Any questions?And, after all that prattle about co-dependency and &quot;inner children,&quot; what seemed to be missing? Susan Powter's hairstylist? Think again.According to Gloria Steinhem, one of modern feminism's most controversial figures, the recovery movement has never managed to fully examine and explore the crucial, culture-wide roots of poor self-esteem and what she calls &quot;an inauthentic self.&quot; Like a mechanic diagnosing the machinery of oppression in our corner of the world with tools borrowed from the recovery movement and self-help therapy, Steinhem cogently argues that when individuals--such as the poor, or women, or racial minorities--are continually marginalized, suppressed, ridiculed and ignored by a culture that holds a huge stake in their invisibility, they sink into a sense of obliviousness and apathy. After all, how is a single diabetic mother on welfare supposed to relate to the standards of beauty fostered by Jane Fonda and Heather Locklear? And, if these &quot;outer&quot; roots of poor self esteem are not rooted out of the &quot;inner&quot; self, any possiblity of changing the status quo--whether within the scope of our own lives or in the wider scope of political, social or cultural life--diminish and disappear. In other words, if we don't end oppression in our &quot;inner lives,&quot; how can we end it in the greater world? Using examples from her private life and her childhood, and gathering a wide array of theraputic and sociological evidence--as well as snippets of history and current events--Steinhem makes a strong, commonsense case for her arguments that is both easy to read and unencumbered by the dippy Marxist rulemaking and ideological hair-splitting that, even now, continues to marginialize and disempower feminism. And, for those who don't quite understand the rage behind feminism (or who only think we do), &quot;Revolution From Within&quot; is a compassionate and helpful survey of feminist thinking replete with hundreds of references and suggestions for further reading."},{"Title":"Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem","review":"I absolutely recommend this book for invisible scar issues.

This work, in my mind, is a kind of pair with the work on the Canadians' Old West. Brutal weather; challenging environment. But the human spirit ends up triumphing. Once the Americans purchased Alaska from the Russians, there was little sense of what had been acquired. The volume, at the outset, notes (Page 6): \\"Americans, even with a century of westward expansion under their belts, found it hard at first to comprehend the large chunk of wilderness they bought from Russia in 1867.\\"Real pluses for this volume--and others include: terrific photographs of the era, maps, and sidebar discussions on intriguing aspects of Alaska, and so on. One can get a sense of the context by these add ons.The Russians began establishing a foothold in Alaska in the mid to later 1700s. By the early decades of the 1800s, American traders has begun doing business with the intrepid settlers. Sitka was the first settlement of significance. Fur trading was the key economic activity at the outset. In 1790, Alexander Baranov became the lead person in the Russian colony--and he was the right person for the job. This chapter lays out his methods and his efforts to build the Russian presence. As the 19th century moved on, Russia had more and more financial difficulties. After the Civil War, the United States--with Secretary of State William Seward aggressively moving the initiative--purchased Alaska from the Russians. \\"Seward's Folly\\" eventually became attractive--with gold in the late 1800s as a key point.The book goes on to consider American governance and the development of the economy. There is ample discussion of efforts to explore the interior of the massive territory. The work concludes with Alaska acquiring home rule, when William Howard Taft signed the bill.Another fine work in the Time-Life series. . . ."},{"Title":"THE HARVARD CLASSICS","review":"This is a very professional company to place an order.

One's choice between the two will depend largely on where your interest lies.To those new to Middle Eastern cuisine, it can be described briefly as being based on olive oil and clarified butter; yogurt and soft cheeses; citrus, nuts and seeds; rice and bulgar wheat; honey and dried fruits; spice mixes; flatbreads; and eggplant and leafy green vegetables. Beans are common and used more creatively than in many cuisines. Wine and vinegar use is very small. Pork and cured pork products make no appearance at all. Breads and pasta are limited in variety, although those which do appear are distinctive. New world vegetables appear, but mostly as fresh rather than cooked ingredients. Fin fish and squid appear, but bivalves are uncommon.Levy and Roden concentrate on different geographical boundaries, with Roden including and Levy excluding North Africa west of Egypt, although Levy still includes reference to famous Morrocan features such as couscous and tangines. Levy identifies the primary regions of Middle Eastern cookery as the Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey, Levant, Egypt), Iran (Persia) and the arabian peninsula and Iraq.Levy discusses very little of the historical background but does discuss some of the says the cuisine has been influenced by India and how it has in turn influenced Europe, especially the Balkans; however, Roden goes into this in more detail.

In the beginning of her book Faye explains the nuances and the regional differences of Middle Eastern cooking. Next, in a mere 14 pages, she tells you everything you need to know about the ingredients. She gives a very good reading list (Bibliography). As a graduate of Varenne and a food writer for Jerusalem Post, Faye has the credentials to write about Middle Eastern cooking. She has authored one of the best cookbooks on the subject. One possible drawback is the book has no = zero photographs. I love photos, so my solution is to cook up her recipes take my own photographs."},{"Title":"Feast from the Mideast : 250 Sun-Drenched Dishes from the Lands of the Bible (Cookbooks)","review":"Faye Levy is an established cookbook writer who is offering a book on Middle Eastern cooking which closely parallels the range of Claudia Roden's classic book on Middle Eastern food. One's choice between the two will depend largely on where your interest lies.To those new to Middle Eastern cuisine, it can be described briefly as being based on olive oil and clarified butter; yogurt and soft cheeses; citrus, nuts and seeds; rice and bulgar wheat; honey and dried fruits; spice mixes; flatbreads; and eggplant and leafy green vegetables. Beans are common and used more creatively than in many cuisines. Wine and vinegar use is very small. Pork and cured pork products make no appearance at all. Breads and pasta are limited in variety, although those which do appear are distinctive. New world vegetables appear, but mostly as fresh rather than cooked ingredients. Fin fish and squid appear, but bivalves are uncommon.Levy and Roden concentrate on different geographical boundaries, with Roden including and Levy excluding North Africa west of Egypt, although Levy still includes reference to famous Morrocan features such as couscous and tangines. Levy identifies the primary regions of Middle Eastern cookery as the Eastern Mediterranean (Turkey, Levant, Egypt), Iran (Persia) and the arabian peninsula and Iraq.Levy discusses very little of the historical background but does discuss some of the says the cuisine has been influenced by India and how it has in turn influenced Europe, especially the Balkans; however, Roden goes into this in more detail. Levy's wraps her discussion in more of a linguistic focus, being careful to give the various different names of dishes for different nationalities.Both books divide the dishes into many similar categories.

So if you're looking for some unique recipes this High Holiday season, you might want to turn to Faye Levy's latest cookbook, \\"Feast from the Mideast: 250 Sun-Drenched Dishes from the Lands of the Bible\\" (HarperCollins, $29.95).Levy lived in Israel for nearly 12 years, where she met and married her husband, Yakir. A cooking novice until her mother-in-law took her in hand, she soon developed a love for the varied, bold flavors of her adopted home. She went on to train at the renowned La Varenne in Paris and to produce more than 20 cookbooks and writes with authority and passion on the cuisine of the Middle East.\\"It is amazing how all these people who can't get along eat the same things,\\" observed Levy, whose cookbook highlights cuisines of over ten countries.\\"Eating together and discussing food and recipes is a great way to bring people closer,\\" Levy continues. \\"Arabs and Jews share a lot of the same food. The Islamic rules of halal are similar to our laws of kashrut. We both don't eat pork. Arabs do eat shellfish, and they don't have a problem mixing milk and meat, but they hardly ever do it.While the book explores the foods of all faiths and nationalities of the region, so many of the dishes are perfect for Rosh Hashanah because of the Middle Eastern fondness for incorporating local fruits, a perfect way to wish guests a sweet New Year.\\"Sephardic Jews begin the Rosh Hashanah meal with dates, just as we do with apples and honey,\\" Levy noted. \\"And in Greece, Turkey and Morocco, all around the Mediterranean really, quinces are really important for Rosh Hashanah. Moroccan Jews do dip apples in honey, then dip them in sesame seeds, symbolizing our wish that our people be numerous. Pomegranate seeds are traditional for the same reason.\\"Chicken in Pomegranate Walnut Sauce, a classic dish of the Persian kitchen, is appropriate for the holiday, Levy said.\\"Pomegranate juice and paste are available in Middle Eastern and gourmet markets, because a lot of American chefs, like Bobby Flay, have suddenly become very excited about them. It has become trendy,\\" she said.If you can't find either, Levy advises using pomegranate juice, now readily available in supermarkets, and adding less water.Traditional holiday foods vary from country to country and from family to family. Some people avoid sour tastes for the holiday, like lemons and vinegar.Persians, however, favor tart over sweet and love a splash of lemon juice on many dishes, Levy noted.\\"In fact, I have a friend from northern Iran who says that the pomegranate paste available in this country is too sweet, so he asks his relatives from Iran to bring some from home when they visit.\\" Some people avoid black ingredients for the New Year, so they use golden raisins instead of dark and do not serve eggplant. Since the word for leeks in Hebrew means \\"destroyed,\\" many serve leeks to convey the wish that our enemies be destroyed.Some people will not eat walnuts, but will use almonds; others eliminate nuts altogether.\\"In our family we always have rice with toasted almonds and dried fruit for Rosh Hashanah,\\" Levy said. \\"Middle Eastern cooks have so many delicious ways to do rice, and some, like Almond Apricot Basmati Rice, are so good you could consider them a dessert, a side dish or a main course.\\"Sweetness for Rosh Hashanah is more of an Ashkenazi thing,\\" she said, \\"though certain Middle Eastern Jews do it, too. Moroccans often serve vegetables sprinkled with sugar, but sometimes instead of making food sweeter, they might just tone down the spiciness.\\"For example, fish is traditional for Rosh Hashanah, particularly served with the head.Moroccans might make Foil Baked Trout with Red Pepper and Garlic, but omit the jalape&ntilde;o and lemon for Rosh Hashanah.\\"It really depends on your family's tradition,\\" Levy said.For Ashkenazim, Rosh Hashanah would not be complete without honey cake, but Sephardim of the Mediterranean may choose Citrus and Spice Quinces with Cranberries or Date Pinwheel Cookies. Honey isn't found necessarily in desserts in the Middle East, Levy said, though some might use it as syrup on cake. Fruit with Honey, Figs and Dates will appeal to both camps as a sweet ending to the Rosh Hashanah dinner.\\"It's perfect for the season and really easy. And it goes well as a topping for traditional honey cake, too.\\"Dja'jeh b'Ah'sal (Chicken With Prunes and Honey)Sauce:2 cups pitted prunes, soaked in 1 cup cold water for 15 minutes1/4 cup honey1 teaspoon ground cinnamonChicken:5 to 5-1/2 pounds chicken pieces (white and dark meat), skinned1/4 cup olive oil1 cup finely chopped yellow onions1 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepperThree 3-inch-long cinnamon sticks2 cups cold waterPrepare the sauce.

I was fascinated by the life of Wyatt Earp as it was written by a man who interviewed him over a period of time. I was impressed with the research that the author, Stuart Lake, appeared to have put into his project. He had interviewed a number of surviving witnesses to the life of Earp. He also had a number of newspaper accounts and appears to have located a number of valuable documents in the course of his research. The book wasted little time in getting to Wyatt's career in law enforcement in the American West. The bulk, and I mean just about ALL, of the book is spent on his career in Wichta and Dodge City, Kansas as well as Tombstone, Arizona. The many famous (and not so famous) outlaws and lawmen of the Old West move in and out of the story on a regular basis. Stuart lists an almost endless number of feats of daring by Wyatt Earp in the process of making his case for Earp as the greatest of all men of the American West. Many of the events are depicted in great and compelling detail. Many of the parties are quoted, presumeably, from the memory of Earp himself. There is never a dull moment in the life of our hero, especially considering that all this action took place over a relatively short period of time. The book, at times, reads like a well-researched dime novel. For a chance to re-live the wild, wild West, it has little competition.As for my skepticism, I came away wondering first of all; did all this really happen? Perhaps it did but our hero (and I am not trying to be facetious, Wyatt Earp truly is a hero) does it all seemingly with one hand tied behind his back. My other reservation has to do with the politics of the times and places. There are only good guys and bad guys and no exploration as to the motivations of either side except for good and evil. I found myself wondering if I were the only source of information about the events of my time and I had to relate to the world in 50 years or so the events I had witnessed. Take the Invasion of Iraq, the presidential election of 2000, or the impeachment of President Clinton. I certainly could make a claim as to who was the &quot;bad guy&quot; and who was the &quot;good guy&quot; while somneone else of a different political persuasion could make the opposite claim. There is no one to speak for the opposing view in this book. The author quotes frequently from the Tombstone &quot;Nugget&quot; but always prefacing the unreliability of the source. I found myself wondering if there might not have been something of another side to the events in Tombstone. The labor strife in mining communities of those days was very significant; just study the history of Butte, MT. Is it possible that Earp supported the powers that be and the miners looked for support from wherever they could get it? Maybe not, but it would have been helpful if the author tried to give a bit of an impartial look at the motives of the opposing side in Tombstone. That said, and realizing that this is about Wyatt Earp, not the miners, this is a book well worth the time of any fan of the American West."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"Given everything I've read about this book I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and veracity of the narrative. I can understand how earlier reviewers taking Lake's claim to have received 100% of his facts from Earp, only from Earp, and entirely from Earp might have prejudiced people against Wyatt Earp, because there is a certain amount of &quot;The tall lean figure of the fearless . . . &quot; etc. The introduction puts this into context excellently well and I have no hesitation in recommending this book to people who are interested in the man and his era, with the proviso that they also read other texts (Sadie is referred two once or twice, never by name, during the portion of the narrative that covers Tombstone; Earp's marriage to and subsequent life with Josie (Sadie) Marcus Earp turns up only in the very last chapter -- on the next-to-last page, if I recall correctly). An excellent summarization of the Wyatt Earp mythos -- perhaps obviously so, since it is created with in large part creating that mythos (g). Still and all, not a book to be scorned, but to be read with a cross-reference or two at hand. The prose style holds up very well indeed."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"It is hard finding books that tell the stories of the old west (especially of Wyatt and gang) that are free of opinion and myths.

The author later admitted that Wyatt Earp did not tell him all the stories in the book. In fact, Earp was pretty silent about his life story. The Monmouth portion of the book omitted these facts: Earp lived in Monmouth, his birthplace, three different times-- 1848-50, 1856-59, and 1868-1869-- until the age of twenty-one. His grandfather was a justice of the peace in Monmouth, and his father was a constable. His family lived in town, and bought properties during the first two time periods. Wyatt was not married in Illinois, but in Missouri, by his father, then a justice of the peace. This book rivets your attention and makes you proud of Wyatt Earp, an Old West lawman, born into a family preserving the peace."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"A tremendous amount of research went into this book and it shows.

I would recomend this book to anyone and hope the publisher puts it back in print."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"I have just started reading the book. So this is really not a review but to pass on some information. Mr. Lake interviewed Wyatt exentsively before he wrote the book, so a lot of the viewpoint is Wyatt's. I don't know if Fred Dodge is mentioned in the book. He was my god father's father. I have a gun Wyatt gave him that he took off a dead criminal, also a stickpin the Wyatt had made for Fred out of a 1 dollar gold piece. Fred was a dead ringer for Morgan Earp. The other Earps had a hard time telling them apart. Fred was an undercover agent for Wells Fargo and was stationed at Tombstone. Wyatt did not find this out until Sep. of 1926. Wyatt had convinced Fred to allow Lake to do his biography. Fred wrote to Wyatt and informed him of his position and that solutions to some of the crimes would be found in the biography of Fred. Fred shipped a strog box to Lake filled with his notes and diaries. Lake died before he could write the biography. His daughter, Marion Lake, came across the strong box in a closet. She had to remove a board on the bottom because she could find no key. She compiled many of the notes into a book titled, &quot;Undercover for Wells Fargo&quot;. This book is interesting and a good add to the books about the Earps. The book has been out of print for years but hopefully with the resurgence in the interest in western characters, maybe Houghton-Mifflin will release it again. I have been searching for a copy for a long time. I found one in a library in Lubbock, but that is the only copy I have seen. If you can find a copy of this book, you will find it a useful addition to your library."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"I had a good time reading this novel. This was the first \\"Old West\\" novel I have read and I was very pleased. I have to admit, before reading this book I was fascinated with Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday.

I recomend this book heartily to history buffs and western fans alike."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"I have a small library of Wyatt Earp books and Lake's book is always maligned by other Earp historians. No other book, however, seems to give us as much insight into Earp as Lake's. Sure, the facts are exaggerated and, in several instances, created out of whole cloth but more factual books also contain significant mistruths without ever giving us a feel for the man. Tefertiller's &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is indoubtedly better history but it isn't a better read. If you can only read one book about Earp, this may be the best one to read."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"I read Lake's book as a child. Wyatt Earp became a real hero to me. Later I found there was much more to the story, and much less. Lake found Earp to be uncooperative. So much so he didn't publish this book until Wyatt had been dead three years. Great portions of it were complete fiction such as the episodes in Abilene, Ks. and the arrest of Ben Thompson which never happened. But then, Wyatt Earp never claimed that it had. Lake wanted to write a tale of the old west and in the late 1920's Wyatt was about the only survivor of that breed of men who lived by their wits and survived those days. Nevertheless this book is a lot of fun. If you want a true picture of Wyatt Earp check out the latest issue of American Heritage magazine (Mar/April, 1999). He was a controversial figure and in many ways an admirable one. The story of the making of the myth is as fascinating as the man."},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"What makes this book so different from other western books is that Wyatt Earp himself was interviewed for the book.

It tells the amazing story the man and the legend. The forward starts with:\\"Wyatt Earp was a man of action. He was born, reared, and lived in an environment which held words and theories of small account, in which sheer survival often, and eminence invariably, might be achieved through deeds alone. Withal, Wyatt Earp was a thinking man, whose mental processes were as quick, as direct, as unflustered by circumstances and as effective as the actions they inspired.\\"This book is a story of a time gone by, of adventure and amazing people such as Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson and more. The place was the old west. The men were a breed of hearty soles who survived by their wits, cunning and athleticism. Some died young; others (such as Wyatt) lived to a ripe old age. All had amazing stories to tell.Stuart Lake worked closely with Wyatt Earp in the closing months of his life to prepare this book. He also interviewed scores of eyewitnesses to verify circumstantial details, studied hundreds of document and files of frontier newspapers, and exchanged thousands of letters between competent old-timers in preparing this work. In other words Lake did his homework!It is obvious Lake is deeply impressed with Wyatt Earp and takes on the job with a humble attitude. In the closing lines of the forward he says: \\"... --my own feeling in offering the life-story of Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal, is one of notable inadequacy in the presence of the material of which this book is made.\\"Wyatt Earp's adventures are at the frontiers outposts of Dodge City, Wichita, and Tombstone.

Look for DOCUMENT 94!"},{"Title":"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal","review":"It's long been suspected that either Wyatt Earp embellished the stories told to Lake, Lake embellished the stories Earp told him OR Wyatt's WIFE encouraged Stuart Lake to embellish the stories through her own exaggerations and what not... whatever the case, this story is not the true tale of Wyatt Earp, the man.It's a decent fictional account and contains many of the legends that made him famous, but ultimately time has revealed it for what it is... a yarn.Read it to be entertained, but don't read it if you're wanting to know the true Wyatt Earp."},{"Title":"Corpus Concordance and Collocation (Describing English Language)","review":"This is the nearest thing you'll ever get to an idiot's guide to corpus linguistics. It is a collection of papers which discusses everything it says on the label - corpus, concordance, collocation, and more. Corpora are now very much part of mainstream linguistics; this book opens the door to the 'uninitiated', explaining the fundamentals in the lucid prose that characterises all of Sinclair's writing. Although there have been many advances in the field since this book was first published (nearly a decade ago), the basic principles remain the same. If you've heard of corpus linguistics, but don't know what it is, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue","review":"Kenneth Anderson lived in South India and a being a hunter, he hunted man-eating tigers and other man-eating cats. He did not hunt for sport, but to rid-off these man-eating menaces that lived off people. In this book he re-collects his experiences while hunting man-eating cats, especially tigers. This book is very very interesting and is probably amongst one of my all time favourites. Many of his other books like Tiger Roars , etc deal with the same subject and are all equally interesting.. This books paints a very clear and interesting picture of the whole affair of his hunting of man-eaters. Since this book consists of short stories, each of these stories can be finished in one sitting. I thank Kenneth Anderson for giving me such wonderful moments while reading his books on quiet nights and week-ends, that I will cherish for a lifetime. I only wish these books were more easily available."},{"Title":"Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue","review":"Reading Kenneth Anderson presents your mind's eye with a vision of an intensely dark tropical night: the fire cracking in front of you, the innumerable stars in the clear firmament, the soft, warm river-bed sand beneath, a slight chill in the still air, the sounds emenating from the dark jungle beyond and the soft, immortal voice of the scotsman as he reminiscened his adventures... Kenneth Anderson's stories are exceedingly pleasurable to read and everytime I read them, I felt I was indeed back in the deep dark silent tropical night of the South Indian wilds. Acquire. Read. Please. This Book is indeed an heirloom."},{"Title":"Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue","review":"I am reading Kenneth Anderson's books...since...I was a Class VIIth student...I used to read his books after coming from school, lying over a cot under an old Banyan tree.Today...I am 33 years old...work as Manager - Quality with HSBC GLOBAL RESOURCING...but that habit of reading Kenneth Anderson's books after work continues...and will always continue.I have read many books on hunting by many authors...but no one comes close to Jock's (Yes...that is what one of his closest friends used to call him as) story telling ability, his knowledge of the flora and the fauna, the description of the Indian jungle...One of my biggest regrets of life is - Mr.Anderson died around the time I was born and hence, I never got the opportunity to meet him.Wish you were here Andy...you will forever live in my heart and soul.

This book is so great because it showed me what the school is like better than my campus visit did. I got the lowdown on academics, safety and security, and even on nightlife.

The formulas are presented in algebraic format with the variables and constants poorly defined. The constants for typical materials and applications are not found in the article. All of the figures have been ommitted so any references to those figures are pointless. I found this article pretty dissapointing.

The operations (and fumbles) of the Mossad, operating in a democracy, are scary and poignant.Remember that the United States often places itself as the sole &quot;supporter&quot; of Israel when the World (including democracies, monarchies, dictatorships, et. al.) want to condemn Israel (via the UN) for some atrocity.This is a scary book about one of our supposed allies - a must read!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Some strange reason, the book I ordered didn't delivered first time (post office returned to the sender). Without further fuss, this seller sent me second time, apologizing the trouble, like it was his own fault. The total shipping charge must be more than the price I paid for. I strongly recommend this seller for his great business practice."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I found this book to be informative and surprisingly objective for someone who has been treated the way the Mossad treated Ostrovsky. I think it is time more of us realize that the real struggle of world politics takes place behind the scenes - the stuff we hear in the news has as much chance of being a smokescreen for something else as it has of being legitimate information. Read this book and you will understand what I mean; you will see the last 80 years or so in a whole new light.Before reading this book, I thought I understood the dynamics of the conflict in the Middle East, but now I see that it is much more complicated than that. It is not so much one side or the other that is to blame as it is bad people on BOTH sides that screw it up for every one else, using their positions of power to secure their own legacy and/or turn a profit. Trust me, if you are a freedom-loving patriot of any just cause, then you must read this book. It will open your eyes."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Victor Ostrovsky has written at the risk of his own life a shocking and riveting account of how Israel and its Mossad in particular commit and cover up, so far with total impunity, their crimes against their political opponents and victims particularly Palestinians under a 50 year old brutal occupation and the Lebanese whose country was invaded and occupied from 1982 to 2000 producing more than 120000 victims between dead and wounded."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"In my review of The Other Side of Deception, I was pretty clear that I thought it sucked. This book, however, the first of the two, is a 5 star book. I can see why the Mossad did not want this book published. I cannot believe we continue to support the state of Israel after they did not share the information they had about the Mercedes Benz truck being outfitted to become a VBIED. The VBIED that killed the Marines in Beirut."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I bought this book at a used book store in Chicago, and I'm two thirds of the way through it. While I have no way to verify or discredit his claims, they seem pretty outrageous. He contends that the Mossad manipulates not only Israeli policy, but the foreign policies of the United States (without our knowledge until now that he has become a whistleblower). While it is entertaining reading and has peaked my interest in Israel, I must take everything in the book with a grain of salt. So I'll go with the middle: three stars."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This is a very poorly written book. The organisation is poor, the writing is sloppy, and the translation of technical terms from Hebrew is quite often inexact. But if you want to read a well-written book, go and search for Shakespear! This book was written by an un-happy ex-Mossad agent. It's not altogether obvious what parts of this book, if any, are true and what parts, if any, are false. But the book is morbidly fascinating, in that it describes the inner workings of an organisation about which there are hardly any &quot;legitimate&quot; ways of finding out. Especially interesting is the detailed description of the training that Mossad career officers undergo! So get the book, and read it, and judge for yourself. Keep in mind that this book is banned in Israel -- neither it nor its translation into Hebrew can be sold in bookstores in Israel. Now officials in Israel have claimed on numerous occassions that this book is all nonsense. This raises a basic question: If this book is nonsense, if what it talks about is ALL false, then why ban it?"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"One of my atmospherics books, enjoyable for its description of Mossad training exercises for new Career Trainees, and for its insights into how Israeli fully integrates military assistance carrots and clandestine intelligence follow-ups. Some insights into Mossad's deliberate manipulation of U.S. intelligence and a few allegations regarding U.S. hostage situations where Mossad might have done more but chose not to."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Although it is true that we cannot prove much of the account given in this book. A well-known Canadian author who did the actual writing for Ostrovsky does stake his reputation on the fact that Mr. Ostrovsky was indeed an ex-Mossad officer. Seeing that so little criticism of Israel comes from any Jews, for whatever reasons, we must be willing to at least grant the possibility that this account could be true. Afterall, it is not even really a criticism of Israel as a nation, just of certain organizations, especially the Mossad, and their actions. Some reviewers would have you believe that some verifiable facts are incorrect, however the statements of the invidual I site below are loose representations of the intent of Ostrovsky's words, and he misses the point. Definately read this book if you are interested in Israel/Palestine, or just espionage!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Yhe book was delivered in excellent condition, in a timely fashion. Was notified by the seller ahead of time. Very pleasant exchange. The book is a great read. Thanks!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Then why did the Israeli lobby try to block its publication? And why, after being a best seller is it out of print? Pretty harsh treatment for a fairy tale? After all, we don't see Cinderella's publication blocked. This book goes further into depth to what anyone in the military and State Department has known for a long time - the Israeli governent spies on the US and have penetrated the highest levels of the government, all with the gleeful help of Jewish-American Zionists and politicians afraid to do anything about it."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Some say that 2% of the population controls 98% of the world. While I can't say who that 2% is, the author of this book elaborates on mindsets and techniques that may serve to contribute to global domination.Though the book is written some time ago, current events makes its reading more important than ever. The Mossad is simply an incredibly important organization. While I gained some new respect for their abilities, one is likely to be surprised at how they seem to redefine the word...machiavellian. My most important finding is that every Jewish person around the world is almost bound to act as an agent. Thus explaining how such a small agency can have globally reaching tentacles that often have the ability to affect change within hours.\\"Every Jew is a warrior.\\" Surrounded by enemies, they would argue that it is a matter of survival. Perhaps that argument was defensible into the 80's. It seems to me that the tilt has been of a more offensive nature since then. They had their way with Iraq. They are generally having their way with Palestine. Will they have their way with Iran? They certainly have their way with the US...as long as we stay in business anyway.Ostrovsky is brave enough to point that the German war machine, with 50 million victims, also sought to exterminate gypsies, poles, and russians along with those whom we hear about possibly more than all other groups combined. Only a person of Ostrovsky's background can say anything less than totally positive without having that liquid graphite 'anti-se*ite' card played.In spite of having thousands of facts in it, the book flows quite well and is generally enjoyable. By that fact alone, it is well worth reading. What makes it a must read however, is the elaborate education you will receive of how the Mossad truly does wage wars through deceptions. With a motto like \\"By way of deception, though shall do war,\\" one could argue that we were warned."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"What should you know about the book before buying?It has interesting stories. It's intriguing. It's exciting. It contains alot of history. It's unique.But... the whole time you're forced to think \\"Really....?\\" while reading it. The stories are pretty shocking and they're always \\"almost\\" believable. He's mostly very specific but then inside a story he can become very general very quickly. I suspect disinformation or bogus story telling in these moments.I do like the book. Sometimes I feel he's both ruthless.. and whiny at the same time.4 Stars because I never entirely bought it and I always had a sense that he was ratting out people he had grudges on(the gay scandal was entirely bogus I'm sure. So strange!)"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"If you have ever wondered about the Mossad and how they came about this will answer all your questions. A really good book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"As a spy story wonk, I really enjoyed this novel. It is not for everyone. It is not a well-crafted story with lots of detail about the leading characters. It is more a series of short stories about specific actions by the Mossad or specific departments or subparts of the organization. If the information in the book was accurate, and I have no reason to believe that it was not, I would not have wanted to be the author's insurer, because he really gave away lots of the keys to the secret kingdom. Facinating detail about previously secret operations (prior to 1990). It is a fast read and an interesting one."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I discovered Victor through his art work. This book is a telling eye-opener. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"The insider info on the Mossad was really interesting. He also tells about Jewish attitudes of themselves and Arabs which explains quite a bit in the wider conflict...The details were amazing- For example, I couldn't believe we are supposed to be friends and in 1982 when our Marine barracks were bombed in Beiruit, they didn't give us a heads up, but went on full alert themselves.There's tons more like that. Makes you wonder why we have such a friendly relationship and why we take their side in the conflict.In later editions, he recounts how the Mossad tried to prevent the publishing of the book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Highly recommend this book. He covers a lot in this book and most importantly how the intelligence agency commonly use False Flag operations. Operations committed by Mossad, but which are made to look as though they come from Palestinians or Arab militants, with the result that they and not Mossad gets the blame in the media. This is used over and over in todays wars, but never gets a mention in the media, nor in the analysis of events by political commentators. After reading this book, I now always ask myself the question as to who benefits, when an events happen. The one who benefits the most is most likely the culprit."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"The author of the book,Ostrovsky,gives you rare insight intothe Mossad. Ostrovsky was a former Mossad agent who wrote a tellall book. He tells you about the various traing methods that are used on potential Mossad agents.He also gives you better insightinto the various agencies thar comprise the Mossad. He also tellshow the Mossad spies on the United States. Ostrovsky also givesyou some excellent insight into some of the missions that theMossad has undertaken during his time in the agency. Ostrovskyalso defines the Mossad as being an agency out of control.This isan interesting look inside one of the most effective spyingagencies in the world. A very good book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This review is about the Kindle edition of this book.While the book itself is a nice read, and it even thought me some new stuff I didn't know before about certain events, it was full of spelling mistakes, especially in characters names. Some letters were misspelled with numbers...It looks to me like those mistakes were due to poor OCR of the original paper book (it's quite old by now).But I sure expected better QC from Amazon on books - I'm sure nobody read it before publication!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I found that up to the point of Victor being kicked out of Mossad started out with a mystery, nonetheless the continuing saga did not change much at this point from his first book The Other Side Of Deception. Understanding the training of an agent, much the same as in other countries, they are taught escape and evasion, being interrogated or breaking you down to giving away classified information. Victor always seemed to be the one who was being captured by the police and beaten up to prove a point in how conditioned one needed to become a Mossad Agent. The United States agents receives much the same training, with being captured and making one run the gauntlet to survive. However after that point then Ostrovsky seemed like he was running in circles, twists and bends, brick walls, always paranoid and making his own life more dramatic, be that as it may his self experiences were a little over the top, although if not would make for a very dulling story. One interesting fact, Victor being married to a very gorgeous woman in his point of view with two children was willing to leave, giving up his home life for the Mossad who in retrospect still believing he was a Mossad and was out to prove it. As he was no longer a Mossad, still leaving himself with a very intriguing life, howbeit, most agents working in intelligence would experience the same in their own mind. I can relate to his life and it is not an easy life for someone who married with children, as the book did bring back memories to myself. It is an interesting book as long as one reads it with a first time experience."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Although I found a lot of the story interesting it seemed obvious that the Author did not think highly of the \\"Institute\\" itself, nor of his former bosses and comrades. The Author often sounds bitter about his experiences and almost as if he is questioning the reasons for them. I would have to ask him, \\"if you were unwilling to serve, why did you do so?\\" Even the title has a negative connotation.Still, the exploits of the Mossad and its \\"katsas\\" (according to the Author, the word for Mossad operatives)would be a good read in any case, but I would suggest that an interested reader might read the same events recounted by others for a different view. History is always best understood from a variety of sources."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book seemed interesting initially, because it seemed to reveal information about the working of Mosad. Looking closer at its content, it should be pretty clear that this is just a bunch on non-sense. If Mosad was so deadly and efficient, why they did not simply kill him when he ran to Canada? This would be a decent fiction book, if not for the fact that it was really badly written."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I read this book with a grain of salt. Readers should be aware the author states that parts of the book are false. As to which parts, you'll have to decide for yourself. What impressed me most about this book was the description of the training that goes into becoming a mossad agent. I had no idea how much training was required. A very small percentage graduate to becoming a mossad agent and sometimes, entire classes fail to graduate.The insight into the various mossad missions was also very interesting.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the mossad."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"The author provides a very instructive narrative about the training and practices of one of the most secretive and effective intelligence agencies in the world. Several incidents are described in a way that differs dramatically from the official narrative of events. What's most impressive is that the book draws an accurate picture of the breadth and reach of the Mossad. It is certainly very impressive and a great read as well."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"If the Mossad is the loose cannon primarilly responsible for perpetuating the middle east conflict in order to fulfil it's right-wing aspirations, then Mr. Ostrovsky deserves to be commended for exposing the dirty dealings of the Mossad in his book.Even though I'm not jewish, I had always thought of Israel positively. However, based on what Mr. Ostrvsky has written, it has now placed doubts in my mind about what Israel is all about.It is plainly obvious, after reading BY WAY OF DECEPTION, that Mr. Ostrovsky is not attacking Israel, but an agency who is doing the Jewish State far more harm than good. It is the autobiography of a hero."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"When I got to page 119 the words just jumped out at me. Mr Ostrovsky says &quot;Many bridges in Arab countries had bombs planted in the concrete by combatants [a category of Mossad field agent] during their construction - ALL COMBATANTS ARE TRAINED IN DEMOLITION TECHNIQUES [my caps].&quot; My thoughts immediately turned to the World Trade Center and how the collapses of buildings 1, 2 and 7 (the last of which was not struck by a plane) looked exactly like CONTROLLED DEMOLITIONS. Now my thoughts were running wild. All three of those buildings were controlled by Larry Silverstein, president of the Israel Export Development Corporation and a great supporter of the state of Israel. I asked myself - if Mossad were needed a sayan [a Jew who could and would help Mossad] then Mr Silverstein would be a prize. In fact he only gained control of the Towers a mere eight weeks before 9/11 - plenty of time for demolition experts to set charges - and he had negotiated the insertion of a special clause into the lease, that he would have the right to rebuild on the spot if the Towers ever fell down. Yes - both of them. And since the Towers were never more than 50% tenanted, there were plenty of empty floors for demolition experts to do there work. As you will appreciate, my mind was racing. I then remembered the FIVE DANCING ISRAELIS. Who hasn't heard of them? They were videoing the collapses and were collared only because an appalled witness saw them jumping up and down with joy and high-fiving and laughing, after the Towers had collapsed. So they were nicked - and guess what? THEY WERE MOSSAD AGENTS. So of course the US government simply HAD TO LET THEM GO. But not before dogs detected traces of explosives in the van they were stopped in. And the van - their cover was provided by another probable Mossad sayan, Dominic Suter, owner of the company Urban Moving Systems which had provided ILLEGAL employment as cover for these Mossad agents who were celebrating the collapse of the Towers. These Mossad agents told the FBI that they were there &quot;TO DOCUMENT THE EVENT&quot; - those are THEIR OWN WORDS. Dominic Suter disappeared two days later, abandoning his company and emerging in Israel. And the first words out of Benjamin Netanyahu's mouth when he heard about 9/11 - &quot;THIS IS VERY GOOD...&quot;. As you can see that is a lot of associations triggered by one short paragraph of Mr Ostrovsky's book. Everybody should read it. It should be studied in schools. Exam questions should be based on it.Of course, if all this strikes you as fantastic, you can always read &quot;My Pet Goat&quot; instead. That would probably be more to your liking."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. One might wonder why it is out of print and why so many people are claiming that it is fantasy. I had to buy this book used - it is very hard to find!. I would like to ask those people that claim that this book is not true - why did the Israeli lobby try to stop this book from being printed if it isn't true? It looks like they succeeded because it is no longer in print. The book is full of details about the Mossad and the author's experience in it, and it is a VERY good book to read. Ignore those 1 star ratings of this book, because those people don't want you to know the truth."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Victor Ostrovsky says: &quot;I was elated when I was chosen and granted the privilege to join what I considered to be the elite team of the Mossad.But it was the twisted ideals and self-centered pragmatism that I encountered inside the Mossad, coupled with this so-called team's greed, lust, and lack of respect for human life, that motivated me to tell this story.&quot;He blames the Mossad for &quot;turning the Zionist dream into the present-day nightmare.&quot; For choosing war and hate over peace in the middle east. It is from Victor Ostrovsky's personal experiences that he makes these claims. It's very interesting and eye opening. And after reading this book you will want to know more about this Mossad.He talks about the fact that they are entrenched in the USA. That the Mossad owns hundreds of homes in the New York and Washington D.C.. How jewish businessmen all around the world agree to provide for the Mossad when ever they are called upon to do so. Providing money, businesses for cover, houses, apartments, cars, boats....you name it.In this book you will read how in Washington D.C. 1979, the Mossad &quot;thru their network of electronic bugs at the homes and offices of various Arab ambassadors and leaders in New York and Washington&quot; forced US Ambassador Andrew Young's to resign because he recognized the PLO. Young was open to both sides. And because of that he was seen as anti-sementic, anti-Israeli and therefore had to be eliminated.How the Mossad didn't like Yitzhak Rabin because he &quot;demanded raw data from intelligence, rather than the distilled version normally offered, making it much more difficult for the Mossad to use their information to set the agenda the way they wanted.&quot; They couldn't manipulate Rabin so they searched and search and finally found a way to discredit him. Mrs. Rabin, against Israeli law, had a foreign bank account with less than $10,000 in New York. Mrs. Rabien used it when traveling there even though she was entitled, as the prime minister's wife, to have all her expenses paid by the government. When the time was right the Mossad released that information thereby assuring Rabins fall and Menachem Begins installation as prime minister. Menachem Begin was their type of man. He was a hawk. A dedicated Arab hater.How the Mossad will supply any country with military training, weapons and ammo. for the right price. And has no qualms about sells opium and hashish. Everybody is a target...and to be exploited. Everyone is the enemy in the Mossads eyes.You will come away from this book seeing Jews in a different light. A dim light. I've been told that the Jews see themselves as gods chosen people. Chosen for what tho you will ask after reading this. To be an example of evil? Are they gods gift...or satans?Mr. Ostrovsky says that Jews will forever be seeking revenge for the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. That they conveniently forget that they weren't the only ones. That some 47 million one hundred and ninety nine thousand people were killed, from 14 different countries and of all manner of religious beliefs. He says &quot;The Holocaust could have been a source for unity with other nations rather than a tool for separation.I've always found it odd how religions and the followers of, can be some of the most intolerant and hateful people. The very things that most religions teach against. I've never understood it. But then I've never been religious.This is my first book on the subject of Israel so I can not making anyjudgments. But my interest is peeked so I will read more from various sources."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book is an excellent account of the secretive Mossad intelligence service in Isreal. However, I must say that this printing, by St. Martin's Press to be the WORST I've ever seen. The font choice is painful on the eyes, in that both the book and it's cover have clearly been printed using a run of the mill ink jet printer. I can literally count the dots contained in each letter. This leaves a strong \\"fuzzy\\" feeling while reading which is extremely distracting. The plastic film covering the outside of the book has already begun peeling off, despite having owned the book for less than a week.It was hard to choose an appropriate rating for this review. The book's contents (my hat off to Victor Ostrovsky) well deserves 5 stars, yet this paperback printing is well below professional quality, thus the lower overall score.Do yourself a favour and get a copy of the hardcover edition."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"If, as some people allege, this book contains so much false information and should therefore be disregarded, why did the Israelis work so hard to prevent its publishing, an endeavor at which they succeeded in the U.S., albeit only for one day. Also, how is it that a former New York Times #1 bestseller has gone out of print and virtually disappeared? The actions of the Israelis following the release of this book prove the truth of Mr. Ostrovsky's claims. Still in doubt about the whether the Israelis maintain an active spy network in the U.S.? 2 Words for you: Jonathan Pollard."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Who's to say the book isn't a deception as well? It has been 'confirmed' the author's life has been threatened. But he lives in Arizona, is an artist and has a website promoting his art, his books and his address! How threatened can he be? Yes, the book is good but keep in mind the training this man went through. Deception is the very act of convincing people what they are being told is true. As I always say, question everything especially that which is told to you by the masters of deception."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book contains an intersting look behind the scenes at the world's most formidable spy agency and how they get work done with a skeleton crew (35-40 active case officers at any given time, worldwide).At one point, he notes that about every major contemporary bridge that has been built in Saudi Arabia has explosives built into it, courtesy of Mossad. Kinda makes me wonder about the implosive nature of the World Trade Center buildings, especially Building 7, which had little damage, and Larry Silverstein's decision to \\"Pull\\" the building, a term used by demolitions experts to desribe the action of detonating the demolition charges which had been placed after weeks and months of structural and pyrotechnical research. Hmmm....An interesting read into the Mossad, and almost 12 years prior to 9-11 no less. Pick it up, not a bad read at all."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"My impression is that one should be careful about accepting everything the author writes, literally, since it is, afterall, from the words of a professional liar, plus, as the author writes, the Mossad is all about deception. So, who knows, are the formal objections to the book, just a ruse and really the Mossad didn't mind at all to the book, maybe because the book could be not as \\"explosive\\" as the author claims, or maybe the Mossad wants the book to serve as a warning to 'not mess with the Mossad?' Anyway, whatever, there are certainly some interesting things, which do seem informative, from the book, like:1. The Mossad only has about 1200 employees, with 30-35 case officers. They make extensive use of people not actually part of the Mossad, like supportive Jews around the world, and even various people unwittingly used. The book goes into alot of detail about the training of agents, so anyone interested in the mechanics of spying, will be pleased.2. The book describes the use of 'palm paper', a special paper placed over documents to be surrepticiously copied - with the reverse image transferred.3. Operation Sphinx, about how the Mossad was used to effect the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear power plant, is explained.4. The motto of the Mossad is 'by way of deception, thou shall do war'.5. Operation Moses - the evacuation of drought-stricken Ethiopian Jews in the mid 1980's to Israel is detailed.6. If a shooting is required there is no such thing as an innocent bystander.7. Mossad school teaches not to make friends without approval, teach agents to be \\"con artists\\" for Israel.8. White agents are those recruited without knowing they will be working for Israel.9. Agents don't necessarily gather direct evidence, but 'fiber' evidence using economics, rumors, feelings, morale, etc.10. The Mossad did not like Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin.11. 'Frames' recruit members of a friendly agency, like from the CIA.12. The Mossad had a theory about the JFK assassination - the target was really Gov. John Connolly - the Mafia wanted to muscle into the oil business. I find this hard to believe, but maybe.13. The Mossad was involved in the 1973 assassination of president Allende, in Chile, by secret deals - training and exchange of a French Exocet missile from Chile to Israel.14. Details and opinions about Sabra and Shatila killings in Lebanon.15. Spying on Libya to protect Israel against PLO manuevers.Anyway, an interesting, though dated, book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I've long acknowledged the Mossad as one of the best, if not the best, intelligence agencies in the world. They have a reputation as being both ruthless and resourceful. Even more unusual is that they have achieved this status with a relatively small organization, compared with, say, the CIA. Ostrovsky explains how this is possible, and details the recruitment and training of prospective agents at great length.The most disturbing element of the book is the way it conveys the omnipresent yet totally autonomous organization that is the Mossad. Highlighted in this book is the way in which the Mossad operates primarily for its own goals and agendas, and not necessarily in Israel's best interests. Indeed, some of its actions have run against that of Israel's interests, including the jeopardization of the peace process. While many might say he wrote this with Claire Hoy purely for financial gain, I'm convinced that Victor did it out of concern for what he was seeing. It's like that old saying goes \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\".In truth, I'm not a great fan of non-fiction, but I made an exception for this book based on the subject matter, and was not disappointed. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I have to admit at first I was skeptical. But after reading this book, there is no way any man could fabricate this stuff. It was captivating, and frightening to see how an agency as powerful as the Mossad can run itself, with practically no oversight. My impression was that Ostrovsky is a loyal Jew who simply followed his conscience, and in doing so made very powerful enemies. I think if he was in it for himself, he would probably still be in the Mossad, and we would not have heard of any of this. Thank you, Mr. Ostrovsky, for truly believing in, and living up to, the Zionist dream."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Highly recommend this book. He covers a lot in this book and most importantly how the intelligence agency commonly use False Flag operations. Operations committed by Mossad, but which are made to look as though they come from Palestinians or Arab militants, with the result that they and not Mossad gets the blame in the media. This is used over and over in todays wars, but never gets a mention in the media, nor in the analysis of events by political commentators. After reading this book, I now always ask myself the question as to who benefits, when an events happen. The one who benefits the most is most likely the culprit."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Highly recommend this book.

This is the story of a man who fought for Israel's independence in 1948 and was specially selected to perform covert operations in defense of Israel, without regard for international law and borders. He is a passionate Zionist and maintained the code of silence until he saw many of the corrupt practices of top personnel. It is sad that many Jews view him as a traitor to Israel, when it seemed to be his goal to reign in the abuse of power of the country he loved so dearly. Question....Why is the well reviewed 1991 book, &quot;By way of Deception&quot; out of print? Why is the 1995 sequel also not available and out of print? I think it is to prevent Victor Ostrowski's compelling tale from getting into the mainstream of social thought. One last question, who else beside the Jewish Defense League, The Anti-defamation League and other such organizations have a motivation to use their influence to keep this story secret?"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Although this is only one out of a very few books from an insider's view into the Mossad, it contains excellent detail and description. Describing how a small nation uses its allies to secure a place among the world's strongest powers, By Way if Deception illustrates the growing Israeli power. The strong-arm tactics described by Ostrovsky are slightly dubious, but they mesh with the rest of the details. Frightening look into the world's most aggressive secret intelligence service."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"The book discusses things that almost anyone could glean from a careful search of international newspapers and other open sources. Although it makes for interesting reading, and it is particularly fasinating how the author finds subtle ways to stroke the American public, I remain unconvinced that this is a credible book. He seems to also have some juvenile personality conflicts with his co-workers and superiors. If it is even 10% credible, however, there are some serious implications for Mid-East peace."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Great Book, well written and very enlightening"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"THis book is simply fascinating. What is really fascinating is that it notes that the Mossad training included an in-depth review of JFK's assassination, including several unreleased films (how were they taken?) of the assassination, pictures of the area, topography, aerial photo's and where the assassins were. How can the Mossad have such detailed knowledge unless the Mossad studied the assassination BEFORE it happened, not AFTER!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"How can you evaluate the value of a book when the author purports to reveal secrets that no one else knows? The and again, Victor Ostrovsky expects us to take his word for it about the actives of the Mossad. The best way to judge an authors veracity is look at those things you can prove through other sources. Looked at through this lens, Ostrovsky's credibility falls like a rock.Time and again he offers outright provable misstatements that can be checked in any library. The author asserts that most of Israel's Prime Ministers are former generals. Wrong, only three have been. He claims that most members of Israel's cabinet are former generals. Wrong again, and not true of a single government in Israel's history. Ostrovksy asserts that the Mossad was not useful to the United States in the Cold War. Strange, since almost every memoir by American intelligence officials state that Israel provided the US with some of the best intelligence received and was the best source of Soviet hardware stolen from the USSR's Arab client states.If what you can check is almost always wrong, how can any reader trust the bulk of this books facts which cannot be checked? Are we to take his word for it?"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I question Ostrovsky's motives for writing this book. I'm sure the Mossad has done many things that all governments have done and still do within the realm of spying and making secret deals with other countries. However, they are no worse than the CIA or any other such group. I also had the feeling that he is getting revenge on coworkers and authority figures with whom he had problems. Everyone in the Mossad cannot possibly be as evil as he portrays them to be. And why shouldn't Jews in other countries be willing to help Israel? I would also like to add that this book is found and quoted on many anti-Semitic and hate websites."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"The more I read of this book the more I regret buying it. The book is marketed as a description of the training and experience of a Mossad case officer. Unfortunately, The author seems to think that it is acceptable to repeat private conversations and reveal national secrets of his own country and the United States. His writing could set back intelligence gathering by both countries, and impair the relationship between Israel and several of its allies.That assumes that people take Ostrovsky at his word. However, there is reason to doubt the accuracy and veracity of the author. In a later, self-serving book, Ostrovsky claims to have written the first book out of self-preservation, a highly questionable claim. There is little evidence of Israelis killing their own. He also admits (in his later book) that much of the \\"facts\\" in this book are fabrications. This puts Ostrovsky's credibility into serious question. All of this raises an even more fundamental question: Is Ostrovsky a self-centered, arrogant and disloyal agent who has chosen to reveal Mossad secrets out of some belief that his personal judgment is superior to everyone else's and overrules the need for national secrets? Or, is the entire matter a Mossad disintelligence project, designed to mislead and confuse?It's easy to read, and you'll learn a little Hebrew, but I wouldn't put much stock in what Ostrovsky says. How much faith can you put in the word of someone who not only violates his own oath to preserve state secrets, but stoops to repeating portions of private conversations that serve no purpose but to embarrass the speaker? I suspect that if you knew Ostrovsky, you wouldn't like him.Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman's Every Spy a Prince ( LJ 7/90), provides more reliable details on Israel's spy network.On the positive side, the book is interesting, and an easy read. (There are however, quite a few typographical errors in the Kindle version).Every Spy a Prince: The Complete History of Israel's Intelligence Community (A Marc Jaffe book)"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Victor truly exposes Mossad for what it is, i.e. the world's second largest terrorist organization after the CIA. He mentions some of the terror perpetrated by Mossad, the lies, the frauds, the deceptions."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"If this was a collection of short stories it would be great. The disgruntled angle detracts from the stories, and is unsatisfying on its own merits.First, the good. I won't spoil the stories by repeating them. I'll just say that they are satisfying, and intriguing. Some of the stories have been duplicated -- e.g. in Spy Games -- but the author goes through them in much greater detail here.Now, the bad. The complaints sound more like whining, and the allegations sound conspiratorial. That Israel has banned this book makes it sexier, but on its merits, it is difficult to believe the parochialism, narrow-mindedness, and short-sightedness that the author extrapolates from a few select (questionable) incidents. E.g. the Israelis keeping their mouths shut about the Beirut bombings. I'm only surprised there wasn't more discussing of the Liberty Incident.As long as you don't expect the wrong things, this book is a good read."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book is a delight for all the anti-Semites in the world. The author, who no doubt was a failed officer in Israel, has come up with fantastic lies about the Mossad. In his drug induced hate filled mind, the author wants us to believe that the Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world. He is in good company with other miserable self hating Jews who blame Israel for everything. Its a pile of garbage."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"From the first Chapter Ostrovsky claims that the Mossad is not an ethical organization. And more humbug. He thinks the Mossad should probably ask the Pope and the Muslims for permission. And even after that mabye have a national referendum on each planned action. But in the first chapter he shows how because of Mossad's work, Israel eliminated Iraq's nuclear capabilities with a bold and daring action. This in itself may have saved millions of lives. Innocent lives. Basically Ostrovksy is traitor ! who wrote this book to make a buck. He could have decided to write a million different spy novels but instead he chose this path. Stooling on his friends who have or would have risked their lives for him. If he is not a traitor than the word &quot;traitor&quot; should not exist. This is fare is it not ? Otherwise the book is written well. Not exceptionally well. In some places however the sentences do not make sense. Appears as if the editor writer and Ostrovsky did not have time to review their own book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book is scanned and OCRed badly.

The book was interesting in that it provided more detail to world events that I lived through.The most disappointing aspect of this book was the content.

Today my eyes have been opened. For instance, I learned of a Mossad ploy to assassinate a PLO representative, just as he was about to make contact with Israeli diplomats and talk peace in 1981. Barring that attempt by the PLO to prevent war, the Mossad eased the conscience of the Israeli government as it launched an all-out war in Lebanon that left tens of thousands of victims.The same Mossad we learn planted false messages and bombs to blame on Libya, starting an age-old animosity between Libya and the United States that lasted almost to this day, based on little but falsified evidence. Written by an ex-Mossad operative, this book exposes (with a horrified tone) how even the government of Israel itself has little control over the Mossad. Intriguing reading."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I found this book had the ring of credibility in manner and detail used to describe everything from early recruitment and training tactics to specific missions.

He also tellshow the Mossad spies on the United States. Ostrovsky also givesyou some excellent insight into some of the missions that theMossad has undertaken during his time in the agency. Ostrovskyalso defines the Mossad as being an agency out of control.This isan interesting look inside one of the most effective spyingagencies in the world. A very good book."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Anyone who does not know who Victor Ostrovsky is can make up all of the lies they want, but the man is honest, brave and true as the day is long. After the Mossad planted the transmitter in Tripoli that misled the US and the Brits to think that Libya was responsible for downing the jet in Lockerbie, it decided to get rid of Saddam Hussein. It had aided IRAN during the iran-iraq war, and it wanted to get rid of iraq's big army, but did not want to attack it and have it coming back on its borders, and it did not have aircraft carriers and tomahawk missiles to do the job, so it spread the rumor that saddam was a madman, that he killed people with his bare hands, and that he was going to go nuclear and seize all of the oil in the Mideast.Mossad had sold weapons to Iran through Germany during the iran-iraq war and trained iranian fighter pilots. It killed UweBarschel, Premier of Schleswig-Holstein when he tried to stop them.Mossad also helped overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev via a deal madewith Vladimir Kryuchkov on Robert Maxwell's yacht in exchange for expelling all of the soviet jews.Israel has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire mideast, has chem-bio weapons at Nes Zionyya, and Ostrovsky risked his life telling the truth. The documentation is there.Anyone who says otherwise is either working for the Mossad or a liar.The death of Rabin is also a work of internal israeli security. Mossad does not want peace, but war or unconditional surrender. It logistically aided fundamentalist muslim extremists in afghanistan, and the Hamas and even Palestinian terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauros in order to make peace impossible and smear the PLO and the arabs. It has killed even israelis who tried to have peace talks.It agitated to start the first gulf war between iraq and kuwait and blackmails US congressmen or their aides to support israel.While we die in iraq you should think about this, and tell the President, tell Kerry and Colin Powell.Everyone should read these books by Ostrvosky!!!!!Especially Michael Moore, GW Bush, Dick Cheney, and Rumsfield!"},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Wow! 5 Stars is not enough. The title comes from the Mossad motto, By Way of Deception, Thou Shalt Do War. And that they do; they are the best.The book tells of the author's recruitment, training and brief career in the Mossad. The training takes years and is extremely intense. Very few that start actually complete the process. During their training, the recruits review in detail many real cases to gain experience. Since Victor was released from the Mossad due to the typical \\"office politics\\" very early in his career, it is the facts of these cases that the author relates in the later chapters.You can't make up better stories than the true international incidents. I'm not going to speculate on whether or not this perspective is reality, but the accounts are definitely plausible. The Mossad perpetuates conflicts, sells weapons to their sworn enemies, and trains both factions in countries like Sri Lanka. Contrary to what they profess, the Mossad even spies in the U.S. and runs an escort service in New York City, which was still operating when the author published this bookOf course, would the Mossad let a book get published giving away the company secrets? It's hard to say. Was the author let go to add credibility?

A scene by 'Spy Game(2001),' comes directly out of this book. It is quite discouraging to take a look into the world of the secret services, watching all those energies and intellectual resources invested in assassinations, manipulations and arms trade; one of the first priorities any \\"civilized\\" and \\"democratic\\" government would invest in for the sake of power. Don't think even for a moment that any of it it's done for the security and freedom of anyone, because believing in lies and deceptions it's just sick, especially considering the state of the World as it is today."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Highly recommend this book.

This book offers one view into that hidden world. Of course it was written a long time ago and many things have surely changed, but it's still amazing to read about the training program Mossad had already then. Not for the faint-of-heart.Interesting read if you've ever wondered about how things really happen in the world, and not just the movies."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"If you don't like all the political mumbo jumbo of a spy book but like the actual art of spying then this one's for you. The first hand accounts of the espionage, sabotage and assassinations ultimately ordered by the prime minister puts you right in the thick of it as if you were actually there watching the case officers and recruited agents yourself. I enjoyed reading the first hand accounts in the book &#34;Blowing my cover my life as a CIA spy&#34; by Moran and I am enjoying this read about the first hand accounts of the mossad. Victor Ostrovsky keeps the book interesting and accounts for his memory as best as possible. I like his writing style it's not boring."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"There are two parts to this book. The first half deals with the author's training and brief employment as a case officer. The second half describes a number of operations by the Israeli intelligence that the author was not involved in.There are multiple problems with this book and its content. Let's start with a physical one. The Kindle edition is terribly OCR'd; there are misspellings all over and sentences are occasionally garbled.As to the content... The author has destroyed his credibility right out of the gate, with his defensive introduction. If he has published this book to make the world a better place, what stopped him from quitting the Mossad in the first place (as many others do), instead of being essentially forced to do so? The story of the circumstances that let to the author's predicament is totally outlandish and destroys whatever credibility he may con you into thinking he has.The second half of the book cleverly intersperses facts harvested from open sources with \\"information\\" that the author supposedly had access to through his employment. How an employee at his relatively low level had access to such privileged information remains a mystery.The book is a quick read and is engaging, as long as you realize that this is a work of a disgruntled employee, and is partially fictional."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Victor Ostrovsky is certainly not Mossad. I am not saying anything controversial here. Ostrovsky is a DutchIntelligence codename, much as his writer Claire Hoy is a Dutch codename. The Dutch codename being Hoy (tobe more precise). The purpose of this book is to insult the Mossad.Some added verification (so you don't think I am making this up). Mirandola is a Swiss Intelligencecodename. The purpose of these codenames is to easily identify agents working for one power or another;so they do not get killed."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Love the spy vs spy stuff! A little disheartened by the author since it seems he is giving away so much about Mossad operations. Is he a little bitter after being let go?? Very interesting to know how widespread they are in the global arena. There were definitely chapters where I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"One thing you should know about this book is that in the sequel, The Other Side of Deception, Ostrovsky admits that some of the info in By Way of Deception was deliberately inaccurate and meant to serve as a message to the Mossad that they want to leave him alone or he will reveal the real info. The Other Side of Deception also reveals his true reasons for writing an expose, not so much idealism as it was self-preservation (if he weren't Machiavellian, do you think they would have made him a case worker?).To address another reviewer's doubts: he was given protection by the Canadian government. And he acted quickly to make sure he had a lot of publicity so any sudden death would be carefully investigated with the Mossad being the obvious suspect."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This is a fantastic book if you are looking for an operational manual on intelligence training. Most of the book focuses on how the mossad pick and train their agents, along with the author's experience with the training methods. It also touches upon the politics and foreign relationships within the intelligence community.The last part of the book details several missions of the Mossad from an insider's perspective. This gave real insight into details often missed when reading newspapers (often manipulated by the intelligence community).Buy the book, you will not be disappointed. This is a must have for any intelligence library."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"Ostrovsky's book is a must for people who want to understand the secret services. Initially, you are shocked by the revelations, recognizing that it may compromise Israeli national security and its agents. Then you are awed by the training, the logistics and coordination of information gathering. You then become worried, that such a complex and effective organization has no real accountability. Perhaps, the real worry is that Ostrovsky describes a mode of conduct whereby Mossad redefines right and wrong (redefining it in terms of &quot;what's good for Israel and especially Mossad is good, the hell with the rest&quot;), and acts on that basis. And finally, you reconcile your emotions with the knowledge that this couragous book can only force a re-evaluation of Mossad practices. Today's Israeli leaders cannot ignore the claims made by this book, and because of it, there is a little more accountability in the world. I enjoyed the book thoroughly."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book is best read along with its followup, The Other Side of Deception. The author is/was a true patriot who was honored to serve his country. He reveals many thrilling tales of derring-do, the grinding routine of spycraft and his shock and disillusionment with the personal corruption and immorality of many fellow agents.According to the author, the Mossad nominally answers only to the Prime Minister but often acts on its own agenda and in many cases against the interests of Israel and any prospects for peace. The assassination arm conducts killings authorized by secret Star Chamber-like hearings. Illegal arms sales to unsavory regimes fund operations. A tiny staff conducts worldwide operations with the assistance of local Jews. He refers to staff by their first names only which made it amusing when \\"Ephraim\\" wrote his own book, reviewed and panned by Ostrovsky."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book and its sequel should be essential reading for every American, especially now with American sons and daughters coming home in body bags from Iraq.The sequel to this book, The Other Side of Deception, was published over 10 years ago. What it reveals is stunning when compared to current events. And deeply disturbing.However, you must read the first book first to fully appreciate the second book.I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of negative reviews of this book were not the work of some of his former colleagues, or 'ordinary' citizens engaged to write for them. Any astute and extraordinarily well-read person can determine that the facts Ostrovsky states about various operations in his book have the definite ring of truth about them. They can be verified with contemporaneous news accounts, available now on microfiche at any large American library that houses world newspapers.I lived in NYC while most of the events he describes were going on, and kept up daily with a broad variety of news sources worldwide. I was front and center when these stories broke. Ostrovsky's account fills in the nagging questions the various accounts presented at the time, and confirm what I was hearing under the table as suspicions from our intelligence sources."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This is a great book written by a man who put his life on the line inorder to let the world know how terrible the Mossad really is. He eloquently summarizes his life story, growing up as an ardent Zionist, climbing high in the Israeli military ranks, and finally becoming disillusioned after achieving the dream of many Israelis: joining the Mossad. He explains in great detail many of the ways, training techniques, and past operations of this ultra-secret &quot;intelligence agency&quot; that he was a part of for four years. If, as some people say, this book is not factual, why is it that most of the events are actually recorded in old newspapers, magazines, T.V. news, etc.? All you have to do is spend enough time and you can find for yourself the articles on Yehia Meshad, Jonathan Pollard, Sabra and Shatilla, the Fallashas, and so on. Offcourse the major difference is that Ostrovsky, as an insider, ties things together and goes into the details that we could never find in the news. Furthermore, why would the Israeli govt. and Jewish groups in the U.S. try to prevent this book from being published in the first place? Finally, I just heard that this book is out of print and banned in the U.S. now. If this is true, it is a shame. It just goes to show that Ostrovsky is right."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This is a book about how one man became a Mossad agent in the Israeli foreign intelligence agency. He details his joining and ascent in the ranks. The main focus of the book is the description of the training he and others under went, and then descriptions of some operations he was involved in. I had always heard that the Mossad was one of the better intelligence organizations out there - in the class of the CIA, KGB, MI5, but the detail described about training and information gathering makes one really appreciated how good they are. All this with a substantially smaller force then the other groups have, it makes for an organizations that man for man is probably the best.The book really brings out the determination of the recruits and the dedication the members of the Mossad have. The author does a good job with this book. He is economical with his words and you do not ever get bogged down in dry information. The fact that he brings emotions to the reasons he joined and what he went through give the book more punch then just a telling by an investigative reporter. If you are interested in the world or espionage then this is a great book to read."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"There is a reason Israel does not want this book out and it isn't because it is lies. Newsstories, facts, other authors and stats back it up 100% and many of the situations from the 1970's through the 1980's that didn't appear completely legit, now make sense. This book will leave you with the question: why does anyone work with Israel given their entire stance is superiority and using others? Like the current US government's relationship with Israel, it's take, take, take and never give anything of value back.Most angering issue reading this book is that Israeli Intellegence could have saved the lives of the American Soldiers killed in Lebannon. The tactics used and how well they keep track of all &quot;black&quot; or Arab agents, leaves no doubt Israel knew about 9-11 ahead of time. But since the disaster would be good for US/Israeli realtionships, like Lebannon, they likely gave vague warnings without specifics. The only Israeli citizen killed in 9-11 was a Mossad agent on one of the planes. This book will clarify many questions and open your eyes up to what is real and what is done by way of deception. Absolutely incredible. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"This book seems to be an echo into today's Mid-East headlines.You see headlines like: &quot;Key Palestinian Leader Killed in Moving Car&quot;, or something eerily similar. These instances seem to spring from the pages of By Way of Deception. It describes many ways in which specific Palestinians leaders are targeted andexecuted. Obviously, their names are arranged on a hit list, with the &quot;go&quot; order carried out by Israeli Intelligence operatives.The book is a good window into the evolution of the processes and &quot;ideals&quot; of the Mossad. The reviews and methods of actual operations, as well as the quasi-political/religious motivations behind them color a fascinating behind the scenes narrative."},{"Title":"By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer","review":"I disagree with an earlier reviewer who said that you can't check anything in this book.

I was able to identify fellow Mossad officer \\"Jerry S.\\" after 30 secs of googling.If you were surprised (as I was) that the London police could identify all the subway bombers within a few hours of the 7/7 attack, the part about the bombing of American marines in Beirut makes that understandable. Mossad failed to warn Americans that the attacks would occur, but helpfully provided all the names of the attackers immediately afterwards.

The book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned Israel responsible for them. No wonder this book is banned in Israel. In fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of Mossad activities. True, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the Israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. This book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. I absolutely agree with J. A Magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that Ostrovsky once worked for Mossad.Vindictiveness is the word behind this book. Absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. All I can say is that I want my money and most importantly my time back.

Beautiful illustrations. My kindergarten class was enthralled with it."},{"Title":"Gilberto and the Wind","review":"Marie Hall Ets has written several lovely, understated stories about small children interacting with the natural world. In this one, young Gilberto tells about his interaction with Wind, which introduces itself by whispering \\"You-ou-ou,\\" then whips his balloon out of his hands and carries it into a tree. Throughout the story, Wind expresses many moods -- playful, capricious, stormy, and finally quiescent. Gilberto lies down and goes to sleep with the wind beneath a tree.This story captures the character of one of the natural world's most mysterious elements, describing its different forms in a way that a small child can easily grasp. The wind is faceless, and we view Gilberto mostly from the side or the back as he interacts with his invisible \\"friend.\\" The illustrations, like many from the early 1960's, are rendered in three colors only, but Ets makes the most of them, creating dramatic contrasts and a mysterious mood. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Gilberto and the Wind","review":"I was a little hesitant about this book at first, but it's so great.

Although it is said to be the first book in the genre, it is not alike to most of the spy novels I read. The plot develops slowly, and for the most part of the story nothing significant happens, but this is exactly what makes it special and valuable. Heroes are very human, they are prone to fantasies and mistakes, and for a long time it is not clear if the spy plot was a reality or the creation of their vivid imagination. There is a scene I particularly enjoyed, and if it were not written at the very beginning of the century, it might have been a satire of modern spy novels. Here I refer to the scene when one of the main characters is eavesdropping under the window of a house, but cannot hear much because the curtains are drawn! This is a jewel. I also enjoyed descriptions of sailing in the sands and of the life on the islands.Read this book if you are interested in the study of human character, do not read it if you are just after thrill and entertainment, you won't find what you are looking for then. This book requires time."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I read this many years ago, and wondered then why Hollywood didn't make a movie of it.

I mainly want to add that while it is quite good in its own way and may well deserve the label \\"classic,\\" it probably will appeal most to a rather limited and, with time, ever-shrinking audience.While it is a noted early example (perhaps even the first) of the spy/adventure genre, I doubt that it will satisfy or fully engage most fans of LeCarre, McCarry, Deighton, and others of more modern ilk. The writing often is superb, but now somewhat dated; the plot (such as it is) unfolds at a very leisurely pace; and from the reader it requires close -- even undue -- attention to the esoterica of yachtsmanship and to ever so small details of the coastal geography, topology, and tidal patterns of the East Frisian Islands. For the avid small-boat sailor or student of spy literature, \\"The Riddle of the Sands\\" may well warrant five stars, but for the average intelligent reader of the 21st Century, I suspect three stars is more on the mark."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Erskine Childers at his best. His book The Riddle of the Sands and the feature film starring Michael York only enhance each other. Erskines life in itself reads like a Indiana Jones story. He began sailing along the Frisian Islands in the North Sea in 1897. His experiences and imagination of the possibilities of an invasion by Germany would change the way Great Britain looked at it's defensive policies and the lack of realistic preparations of her coastlines. Did the book and it's warning influence and delay World War I? Was there a plan to invade Britain? Was it considered? Mostly like not, but we will never really know. The Riddle of the Sands and the warning changed how an entire country defended itself. Germany was at the time expanding her empire and particularly her Navy. Germany's only rival at the time was Great Britain. So....... The Riddle of the Sands is a particular insightful look at the end of the Victorian age and the dawning of a new century. A must read if you love historial fiction. Good reading."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"The Riddle of the Sands, Erskine ChildersThis 1903 novel is a spy story that includes a factual account of small boat handling in the treacherous waters off the Frisian Islands. The \`Preface' explains this book as a record of the adventures of \\"Carruthers\\". The British government was warned, but little was done. So Childers decided to publish this story to warn the public of a possible invasion of Britain. In Chapter 1 Carruthers gets an invitation to go yachting in the Baltic sea. He accepts out of boredom. The yacht is a converted life boat, thirty feet long and nine in the beam. Arthur Davies can sail this boat without help. Then Davies tells what happened before he invited Carruthers (Chapter 8). Carruthers decided to go along with the plan. Davies talks of the ambitions and rivalry of Germany (Chapter 10).The chapters describe sailing in a small boat in the North Sea. Cold, fog, and tides that imperil a small yacht. There is the story about the mysterious German, his young daughter, and his business associates. There is a mystery about a salvage operation on an old shipwreck by Memmert Sand. Carruthers has been called back to London. But in Amsterdam he disguised himself and doubled back (Chapter 25). Carruthers' suspicions are confirmed by a boat at night towing a lighter. There is a surprise in the last chapter. The \`Epilogue' discusses the plan to invade and conquer Great Britain by surprise.A similar invasion was planned in 1940 until it was prevented by The Battle of Britain. The difficulties of an invasion from sea were solved in June 1944. While a blockade of shipping can damage Britain, its internal resources will help. Only a successful invasion will conquer Britain [as in 1066]. There is no mention of the Territorial Army here. Some have claimed this was the first spy novel. \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" was published years earlier (political intrigue into a dynastic succession).The life and death of Erskine Childers is as interesting as any novel. An Englishman who married an American of Irish descent, Childers smuggled guns into Ireland from Germany (obsolete single shot Mausers). He was caught up in the Troubles and executed in reprisal for the assassination of Michael Collins. His son served a term as the President of Eire."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands is an unusual book: one that deserves to be read, not for the entertainment value it carries now (which is only mediocre, at best) but for the historical import it carries with it. It was written at the turn of the century, and the author meant to convey a real situation and what he concieved of as an emergency to the British public. It worked: the premise of the book led to significant changes in British Naval policy within a few years.The book itself is well-written from the style point of view, but the plot is sort of tame, and the suspense is rather shallow by modern standards. For all intents, from that point of view, it compares most favorably with some of Hammond Innes' Novels, which are good sea-adventure stuff also."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I was interested in this book because I do have an interest in a good spy story and sail boats and sailing but little knowledge of the latter.Having already professed my lack of knowledge of boats and sailing,this book was way over my head in that regard.I just was'nt able to appreciate the involved describtions of that part of the book which was the overwhelming majority of the book.The spy story made up a very small part and in my opinion was only included to justify writing basically a book about the perils of sailing a small boat along a coastline.Reilly:Ace of Spies this book isn't.I gave it two stars for the simple reason of the effort it must have taken to write it.I can't say I hated it,but I surely did'nt like it either.This fellow should have read some of Henty's books before writing this one.It took alot of willpower to plod through it."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I want to start this review of one of my favorite novels by using a quotation from a fellow member's review that, very succinctly and with true wit totally encapsulates the actual story\\"It's a story about chaps. And boats. And rotters. And mud, lots of mud. By Christ there's a lot of mud. Riddle of the mud would be closer to the truth...\\" Later he adds a \`warning' that despite being an guys adventure - that in truth carried significant implications and political repercussions - it does contain a love interest. But it is OK guys - no \`scribblin' wimmin' this -it is described with a true stiff upper-lip by a jolly decent chap. Ironically, Erskine was exactly that, a jolly decent upstanding Brit, even if he was eventually executed for treason, by his own side.This extraordinary tale of boating in the mud of estuaries and evil German plots against the \`old country' of a Britain in decline, set in time already gone, a time of Empire and servants, guns held by Bond Street outfitters and decent chaps fulfilling their duty in the service of their country is actually based on certain aspects of the author's own real life. In his biography of Childers (Thirst for the Sea: The Sailing Adventures of Erskine Childers -[...]), Hugh Popham reveals that Childers, in his Colin Archer designed yacht the Asgard had adventures of smuggling and gun-running for the Irish Republicans that could have been a chapter in the \\"riddle of the muds\\" itself! Indeed, using Childers' own words Popham offers some pretty convincing biographical evidence that the two divergent heroes of Riddle of the Sands were one and the same ... and were, in fact, Erskine Childers himself.This almost Conradian adventure - a pure delight for those readers who love boats and muddy swatchways or who know the Frisian Island - was treated very seriously in Britain because of its predictions of the probable intentions of the rotters and villains - to the extent that the first Sea Lord (one; Sir Winston Churchill) suggested that several of the Naval Contingency Plans, a duplication of the cruise by Secret Service members and even new Naval Bases were created in the World Wars with the Germans in later years because of its validity.The book is also credited as creating the genre of the fictional spy story set in factional geographical or political environs. Whilst readers were later assured that it's adventures and warnings were all \\"just fiction\\" based on the improbable and imaginary experiences of some pretty likeable but unlikely chaps, the fact that the author was a dedicated and enormously experienced yachtsman, who met his death by execution ordered by the Provisional Irish Government, and was justly accused of spying, supporting and gun-running for the Irish Nationalist cause, adds a certain element of doubt about just how much was based on a similar truth.What does ring true is the sailing, seamanship and general \`messing about in boats' - a delight to readers who know a bowsprit from a bumpkin - but also a great adventurous Spy-Story with torturous plot-twists and strong ambience that le Carr&eacute; himself might envy. A book that can be enjoyed and re-read, on several levels, and several times."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I expected this to be a great read after all the hype I have heard of this book. Alas it was not so, so maybe Childers will haunt me after this review. This book, like much of the narrative has me sailing in circles. I got some nautical terms out of this reading but not much else. The plot is the German Imperial Army planning the conquest of England. They expand their tranportation system in the land nearest the UK and build train stations and barges as a means to transport their soldiers.This story is perhaps more believeable than a James Bond movie. However, the narrative at page 200, is much like that at the beginning. This is an OK read for spy buffs, and those interested in WWI."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"This story moves at a very slow pace. The first hundred pages are just the two main characters out on a yachting trip. To call this story a \\"thriller\\" or \\"spy\\" novel is a stretch I'd call a lie by today's standards. It's about 280-300 pages of building not very tense tension and then finally at the end of the book you get a none thrilling conclusion. The only redeeming factor of this book, the reason why I gave it two stars and not one, is the dynamic between the two main characters. The characters are engaging but the plot is so dull I must recommend readers to stay away. DON'T READ."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Childers' novel was a real disappointment. After starting to read the original Ian Fleming James Bond novels for Fleming's centennial, my interest in spy novels was piqued and I decided to make a survey of them. I was going to start with The 39 Steps until I came across The Riddle of the Sands. I wasn't expecting a Bond-style thriller, and I came with an open mind, but this was a tedious and underwhelming story with little general historical interest.Originally published in 1903, the story is a first-person account of a pre-WWI British Foreign Office employee who gets caught up in the discovery of German invasion plans while on a sailing holiday. The book was written as a serious account of events for the expressed purpose of jarring the public into recognition of the German threat.While the plot sounds like a decent one for a spy novel, and while the reader with an interest in historical fiction might expect to find period interest, most of the book is detailed accounts of sailing, complete with nautical terms and descriptions with little meaning to those not familiar with boats and navigation. I figure the book could easily have been cut down to a half of its length without losing any plot or meaningful descriptive material.There's not much else to say. The evil villain turns out to be a double agent working for the British, which all but the dimmest reader will suspect from the introduction of his character. Whenever danger seems around the corner, it turns out to be nothing. There is no descriptive material that would be of interest to the antiquarian or historical enthusiast. One reviewer who said \\"it gives remarkable insights into the culture and attitudes of the period\\" must have been reading a different book.I'm not sure who this novel would appeal to, and I suspect that it was chosen as an Oxford classic because the novelist died for the politically correct cause of supporting Irish independence. Yawn.The best thing about the novel is this edition (Oxford Classics green cover with white portrait), and the introduction by David Trotter provides a nice background on early thrillers and spy stories."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"The title (Riddle of the Sands) is exotic but beyond that - it is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw one"},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I am not a sailor, nor am i interested in the details of sailing.

To me, reading this book was a waste of time."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat. The ending left me empty and unsatisfied. If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area. Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"This book is often referred to as the first spy novel, and it is not wrong. However, to appreciate the novel, you have to know beforehand several things. But, don't worry, that is not much.The story is narrated by an English gentleman Currthuers, who received an unexpected invitation of duck shooting from an old friend Davies. Being tired of his neglected position in \\"society,\\" he accepts it to go to the North Sea only to find that he is involved in a mystery, or \\"the riddle of the Sands.\\" His friend claims there's something in the air, something hiding behind the misty coast of Germany. But how can they prove it?As a story, \\"The Riddle of the Sands\\" is far from perfect. It is full of authentic descriptions of local landscapes (the author actually cruised his yacht there), but at the same time frequent reference to the geographical data and nautical terms are a bit wearisome to readers, and moreover, the narrator often refers us to the maps in the appendix. Those things only slow down the action of the novel, and actually the book sometimes has to go through lull.But, wait a while. The story gets gradually faster, and as the adventure of the heroes slowly gets near to the core of the plot, the tale becomes more and more gripping. Though characters sometimes are just more than cardboard (and especially female part is poorly done), your patience will be rewarded.It is well-known that Sherlock Holmes in \\"His Last Bow\\" turns a spy for his country, and says \\"There's an east wind coming.\\" The meaning of what Holmes says is clear to the comtemporary people, and Childers, a politician, also wrote his book not as an amusement but as a warning to England about the coming threat of Germany, and actually \\"The Riddles of the Sands\\" was written about 10 years before WW1 began. In this historical context too, the book is interesting, and the tediousness of the opening chapters is justified if you keep it in mind that it is meant for Childers's sarcasm against indifference and complacency among the English people (talking of English complacency, we remember later in 1938, immediately before WW2, Alfred Hitchcock again uses it as a satire in his thriller \\"The Lady Vanishes\\" with brilliantly silly two British gentlemen who are more concerned with cricket games than surrounding danger). People don't change.So, the book itself is still enjoyable, but these historical matters will make it more precious; after all, it is one of the proof how people reacted to the coming change in the history of mankind. And if you're interested in this kind of book (I mean, books reflects German-England relationship), check out \\"The Battel of Dorking\\" by George Chesney (written in 1871) and \\"When William Came\\" (in 1913) by Saki once."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I bought The Riddle of the Sands to use in an History essay for university where I was looking at how the spy was portrayed before World War I. As one of the more popular titles from that era of 'invasion literature,' Childer's work certainly fit the bill. It is the story of two men sailing around the Frisian Islands trying to uncover a German plot to invade the north of England. That's basically it in the way of plot. It was Childer's way of calling attention to what he believed where Britain's insufficient North Sea defenses, and the real possibility of a German naval invasion. He succeeded in that endeavour and the North Sea defenses were eventually strengthed, which you could view either as a testament to the power of this novel, or to the 'great underlying problems and increasing pessimism' felt throughout Europe (to quote Ruth Henig), in the lead up to World War I.Whichever view you take, the novel has a depth of characterisation that is quite remarkable for a first attempt at fiction. Davies and Carruthers are representative of the two poles of English class/social structure at the time, with the inarticulate, yet perceptive everyman Davies teaming up with well-mannered and intellectually capable Carruthers, figurative of the way that all aspects of British society would need to come together to face the coming invasion. However, the fact that this was Childers' first and only novel begins to show in his pacing. This is hardly the 'cliff-hanger' that Milt Bearden claims it to be in his brief 5-page introduction. However, Childers' purpose was not to write a thrilling page turner, but a warning against German invasion. To really enjoy this novel, you have to read it in that context, otherwise you'll be thinking 'what's the big deal?' There is relevance to our contemporary situation, given the whole 'invasion' theme, but to understand that connection, you need to be aware of the reasons for Childers' decision to write this book, and, by extension, the motivation of his characters.This Modern Library edition does offer some background in Bearden's introduction. Enough to give the casual reader some brief historical context, at least. It follows the Modern Library's tradition of having authors from relevant and related fields offering their thoughts, rather than the academic/scholarly approach that Penguin or Oxford take. The problem here though is that it is too brief to offer any real insights. There is also the standard Modern Library reading guide, offering questions that range between vaguely thought-provoking to superficial. I don't know why they bother with these reading guides, especially at the expense of a decent introduction. However, if you're just after the story without wading through the academia of the Oxford World's Classic release, then this is the version you're after. Plus, Modern Library's cover art is always so much nicer to look at!"},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"... not that I know enough about literary history to be able to vouch for that myself. It's hard to explain exactly what its kind is. Call it a modern spy story: and I think what makes it modern is the feeling that the protagonists are no more than a stone's throw from society, often WITHIN society, and can some of the time claim protection from society; and yet if they turn down the wrong street or move a mile or two to the left they might as well be in the wilds of Siberia, for all the mercy that anyone will show them. Everyone in this novel, in innocence or in guilt, leads a kind of double life.Two stories run side by side: the riddle of the title, concerning an unknown threat to England, and the redemption of a feckless civil servant named - naturally - Carruthers. The setting is lovely; the life aboard ship is vividly described; the author never leaves important details vague. But do pay close attention to the map in the front of the book as you read."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"This book has been described to me both as &quot;the best Yachting Book written&quot; and &quot;The book that saved Britain&quot;. Written in part as a wake-up call to the British Public at the turn of the last century -Childers (no stranger to Whitehall politics) was terrified that existing British strategy left the country wide open to an invasion from Germany- and in part as a celebration of a lifelong passion for boats and boating, the book &quot;works&quot; brilliantly. Even non-yachting enthusiasts will be drawn into the story, and those of us who have worked our way along a foggy coast by chart and compass will appreciate Childers' attention to detail and faithfulness to his subject. Overall I found the two principal characters well drawn, but the Germans are a bit cartoonish, and the hint of Romance towards the end was an un-needed distraction, other than that, this is a quite-un-put-downable novel of adventire &amp; daring that MAY just have changed the course of history."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the British government was prone to regular spasms of alarm about the possibility of invasion by a European power .Fortifications were built for the defence of London and a chain of fortresses were constructed in Kent and Surrey ,and intended to be the centres of resistance to the invader .The enemy was usually assumed to be France ,the UK's traditional enemy in war and main commercial rival in peacetime .While sharing the view of the need to arm against invasion Erskine Childers was of the view that it was Germany not France that was the likely rival and set out to dramatise this concern in The Riddle of the Sands .The book is openly propagandist in nature being written to convert military and public opinion to the dangers of German naval expansionism .It did so successfully and the book caused a hugh sensation when it appeared in 1903 .His warnings gained credibility partlt because Childers was not a professional novelist but rather a respectable civil servant ,a Committee Clerk in the House of Commons .His novel is the work of a man with a powerful romantic imagination -he devoured Fennimore Cooper and Dumas as a child -and he applied this together with a passion for sailing in a well written and propulsive narrative .The genesis was a trip he took in 1897 ,a sialing trip to the Fresian islands where he claimed he saw signs of German preparations for invasion .The book was cast in the form of a novel the better to engender interest among the general public .It also found a strong advocate in Admiral Fisher ,the only British maritime leader to warn about German naval strength at that time .These controversies are long dead and ,truth to tell ,the topical passages are the heavies-going in the book ,So ,why still read this book if all it is is a historical curiousity ?Well ,it is more than that .It is a tale of adventure ,and conveys as few books have ever done the zest and enjoyment of sailing .The two stalwart heroes are Carruthers and Davies who are on a sailing holiday in the Fresians when they stumble across a German plot to invade England .They must evade capture and return to England to warn the authorities of their discovery . The description of their fog bound journey in a dinghy through the narrow waters of the Memmert Balje is a superb piece of writing and the atmosphere of the islands is brilliantly captured .The two men are adequately characterised heroes and in \\"Clare Dollman \\" he created a spirited and personable heroine .The book is a precursor to the modern spy story and memorable for that reason amongst others .The book is no longer topical but it is still eminently readable"},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I became aware of 'The Riddle Of The Sands' while reading Andrew Lownie's biography of my favorite author, John Buchan ('The Thirty-Nine Steps'). Buchan, a contemporary of Childers, reviewed a reissue of the book in 1926, calling it, &quot;the best story of adventure published in the last quarter of a century&quot;. Well, 78 years later not much has changed. The writing is witty, intelligent and literate and the story at once simple yet complex. This novel is a perennial favorite among small-boat sailors, and is certainly &quot;riddled&quot; with enough sailing jargon to perplex most landlubbers. All of this is, however, very neatly integrated into a spy story that, like many of Buchan's wonderful novels, starts with the slenderest of threads and challenges the characters to figure out the skullduggery using sheer wit and intelligence.It may sound trite, but they really don't make 'em like they used to."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I was intrigued when I came across this unassuming little book at a used bookstore. The plot revolves around the dual quest of Davies, one of the book's two protaganists. An Englishman and amateur yachtist, Davies' spot of autumn sailing along the challenging Frisian coast, Germany's narrow mouth on the sea facing England, turns into something more when a man ostensibly out to aid Davies by \\"piloting\\" his small craft with his larger yacht through an intricate network of sandbanks in harsh weather, actually makes an attempt to lead Davies and his boat to their doom along the treacherous coast. This act of deceit piques the indefatigable Davies' curiosity. What was so important among these nondescript sand islets fronting the German coast that would necessitate murder? This question is one object of Davies' subsequent quest. The other is a lover's quest, namely in the form of the daughter of the putative pilot just mentioned. To aid him in his foolhardly quest, considering his small yacht and the inclement weather of the North Sea in autumn, Davies summons from England his acquaintance Carruthers, whose fluent German could prove useful. What he doesn't do, at least at first, is tell Carruthers just what is afoot, suggesting instead a spot of duck hunting and pleasure sailing. What follows soon upon Carruther's arrival is a nautical cat and mouse game involving the small yacht of Davies, an Imperial German gunboat, and an assortment of other yachts and shady characters peopling this melancholy and threatening coastline.I found Childer's work very engaging, especially as I chose to read it while doing some traveling along a similar shoal of islands, though far from Germany and not in a yacht. The novel certainly kept me riveted by its plot, and Childers does a fine job in developing the primary characters and personalities of both Davies and Carruthers who emerge in very human detail against their backdrop. I'm not sure what edition the reader will be reading, but one disapointment I encountered was that the backcover of my edition gave away too much. The nature of the mystery should be left completely to the reader to discover. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the frequent use of nautical terms and the heavy reliance upon the intricacies of coastal features (requiring, at least for the curious, a continuous back-referencing to the series of maps) does hinder the pace a bit, but not to any great degree. What I found particularly interesting about this work was its language. It is a period piece, not just historically, by revealing a growing unease among Britain of the period of a rising German power, but culturally, as seen in the very approach to their problem taken by Davies and Carruthers. It is a game, and the phrase \\"playing the game\\" comes up frequently in the course of the text. Manliness and ruggedness, being proven and found worthy by one's adversaries (be they the elements or the Germans), and most of all \\"winning the game\\" with pluck and verve are all salient characteristics of Childer's attitude (and certainly not unique to him). I found the novel revealing in the general attitude towards international rivalry and war in the pre-World War One years. It was this gamesmenship attitude to combat and its challenges (a very British notion) that helped contribute to the willingness with which men threw themselves into death in 1914. I'm not sure if \\"Riddle of the Sands\\" is indeed the first modern espionage thriller (what about Arthur Conan Doyle?), but it is a perfect insight into period attitudes and fears. It is also exciting reading."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Widely considered the first modern spy novel, and the still the best book about sailing. Perhaps a bit tedious due to the 100 year old prose, but well worth it. It is very appearant that the author, Childers, knows his subject matter. Not only was he an avid yachtsman, and a foreign office employee, but he knew a bit about spying, too - he was executed for running guns to the IRA in the 1916 rebellion. This book is somewhere between Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Treasure Island. Truly a classic...and the movie's great too."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Don't look for subtle characters.

Wonderful precise detail about practical sailing as we might recognize it today.The best sequence is an awesome feat of blind, tidal naviagation.I wish Hitchcock had made the movie. He would have known what do to do with it.This novel is reputed to be one of the tensions that started WWI. Certainly the fictional strings have contributed to modern espionage. You will recognize traditions of Le Carre and Deighton."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Erskine Childers was shot by firing squad during the Irish civil war in 1922. According to Wikipedia, his last words were a joke at the expense of his executioners: \\"Take a step or two forward, lads. It will be easier that way.\\"His son was subsequently elected fourth president of Ireland in an upset election in the 1970's, sadly to die in office a year or so later.Whatever the circumstances of his life and death, this story is a \\"cracking good read\\", one of the earliest novels in the genre of spy fiction. Don't be put off by the various maps and charts at the beginning of the book - it is entirely possible to enjoy the story without knowing anything about sailing (though presumably the fun of the story will be heightened for those who do have some knowledge of sailing and maritime affairs). The voice of the narrator is irresistibly charming, the story is an excellent one, tautly told. I feel almost ashamed to be discovering this story as late in life as I am.

Childers sailed the German Baltic and Friesian coasts in order to write this book accurately.It will appeal to fans of spy novels, because it is the first spy novel ever written. Besides being the first, it is a great spy novel, which has stood the test of time and is as fresh today as when it was written.It is a book that was written with a purpose in mind. Back in 1903 most British people still expected that any war in Europe would be with the French, the old enemy. Childers noted the industrialisation of Germany and the desire in Germany for expansion. He also noted the dismal state of UK sea defences on the shores facing the German Coastline. This book was a wakeup call to the politicians and the Royal Navy.What I find even more interesting is the back story of Childers own life. He went on to become an Irish nationalist, and rebelled against the British Crown. He used his own Yacht, the Asguard, to run guns into Ireland. He later donated the yacht to the Irish Government, who commissioned it into the navy as the national sail training vessel.Riddle of the Sands is a marvellous story. It begins slowly and seems immersed in \\"yachtie lingo\\", but once the true purpose of Davies invitation to Carruthers is revealed the book cracks off at a running pace, and you will find you cannot put it down."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Simply a great book.But! Was it fiction? Or was it a great way to release information gleamed through a real spy network in a way to protect the sources?There are very interesting connections to be made.1) Childers was an avid yachtsmen who sailed the North Sea exploring the coast along Germany and countries around it.2) Childers was an intelligence Officer in WWI3) Childers released the book in claims to warn the British government and citizens of the German danger and the need to defend the North Sea.4) The epilogue and postscript at the end of the book (continuing in the book style... treating the book as non-fiction) states the German danger uncovered in the book could not be put into effect for 10 years.... The book was published in 1903... That is 1913, one year before WWI!It is an amazing book and tickles the imagination to think of the possibilities. The book has no swearing I remember, no sex, no murder and no one misses it either. The book is grounded well in plot and does not need such junk to fill in the author's inability to capture the audience.Readers of mystery, spy, world wars or any such types should read the book."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Was interested in reading this authors material.

Claims have also been made for it as the first spy novel, although this is challenged by fans of Rudyard Kipling, who of course wrote Kim two years earlier than Riddle.It has also been credited with being so influential that it woke up the Admiralty to the possibility of invasion of Britain by Germany across the North Sea, with consequent opening of several naval bases on the East coast.I enjoyed it very much, especially as it encompassed two of my reading interests - sailing and espionage. I was sad when it finished, not because of the ending, but because there was no more.

Of stripping away from the office and running into the unknown. Childers' character descriptions were also top notch - painting subtle yet rich articulation into the storyline.The descriptions of sailing weren't overly technical, they were rich and atmospheric."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"For lovers of spy/espionage thrillers this is a great read. Childers, despite his slow(70 page) start maintains a high level of informative tension to almost the end. Who are the villains and who are the heroes and who can be trusted? The purpose of the the author,as was John Buchan's 'Thirty-Nine Steps' which was made into a fine Hitchcock film, was to warn the pre-World War I British establishment of the dangerous intentions of Imperial Germany and to awaken Britain from its complacent slumber. The evolution of the central character from snobbish dandy to a sea-toughened spy is skillfully drawn. To get the most from your reading, bring along your own maps of the North Sea/Friesan Islands,Baltic Sea region."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"I found this spy novel particularly interesting as I was born on the coastline described. Childers's descriptions of the Frisian Islands, the cities of northern Germany, and the dangerous tides are very accurate. That's what I like best about the book. The narrator, Anton Lesser, does a generally good job reading the book. In fact, he's much better than some other actors I've heard. However, his grasp of the German language is dreadful. Some sentences he reads in German are almost incomprehensible. This is inconsistent with the fact that the narrator of the story is supposed to speak German like a native. Listen if you love stories about ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary events. Listen if you love the North Sea and Baltic coasts of Germany. Stay away if you love the German language."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Only the first chapter may be boring, but then an epic like wonderfully written adventure story was launched.

What Childers clearly loves most is sailing. Although there is an espionage element thrown in to give it direction, this is really a very fine yachtsman's yarn, as detailed in its maritime technicalities as a Forsyth or a Clancy would be in their military ones. Lovers of John Buchan should enjoy this too; Childers' influence on the younger writer is obvious, though his style is perhaps a little stilted. But it keeps one reading, and the atmosphere of the desolate tidal flats behind the Friesian Islands is conjured to perfection."},{"Title":"THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS: A Record of Secret Service","review":"Picture to yourself a strange coast bordered by seven islands and a zone of shifting sands and ship passages that have a sudden way of disappearing at low tide. When a British yachtsman named Davies (one who would feel at home with the grundge look) discovers that a former British naval officer is in very cozy with the Germans -- did I neglect to say that the coast is East Frisia, that part of Germany between the Dutch and Danish borders? -- the mystery becomes not to find out who the guilty party is, but what type of skullduggery is afoot.The narrator is Carruthers, a British civil servant whom Davies talks into joining him under somewhat false pretenses. After some qualms, Carruthers joins in wholeheartedly. From this point on, you are looking at the coastline charts as closely as the principals are (if you don't, you will lose track of the story, which follows geographic features more closely than any other novel in memory).While the action is spectacular, Childers is noticeably weak on character, especially with regard to the sole female character, the German spy's daughter.

Just the acompanying CD alone is worth the money! (It comes with video tutorials not unlike the popular Gnomon series that visually demonstrates the main points of the book, helpful info for Max users trying to migrate over to Maya, and includes an improved and extremely useful hotkey/marking menu system that I'm permanently going to use.) In 2 days I consider myself much more profficient than I was, and the Maya workflow seems to make more sense now. Cheers to Jim Lammers and Lee Gooding for writting a superior manual on this complicated program!Summary: Experienced users may end up skipping some of the chapters, but you're bound to learn something. Newer users will get a lot out of it (including confidence in your skills and professional working habits). If you get only one Maya book, make it this one."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Having bought this book a while ago, I have mixed feelings about it. I think overall I would say that this book is best focused to the Maya (and perhaps 3d) beginner. If you're transitioning from another 3d app and already have 3d experience, this book might frustrate you somewhat from the simplistic exercises. If thats you, then skip this book. If you're getting into 3d for the first time, and Maya is the app you got, then this book might be a good place to begin.Things I liked in this book:1. The beginning chapters discuss and implement custom marking menus which can be very handy. This was a cool item for sure.2. Overall, the book covers basic functionality of Maya that IMHO does a better job than the tutorials that shipped with Maya (Instant Maya). And it tries to implement the concepts in applicable (albeit very simplistic) scenes.3. The video tutorial (chapter overviews) on the CD are excellent, and you could almost go through the book just watching the videos. Very helpful in making sure you don't get confused in a step.4. having accompanying files on the CD was nice.Ok, things that I didn't like:1. The exercises in the book are basically targeted to the beginner. the modeling exercises never cover anything intermediate to advanced. Since I already have 3d experience in other apps, I didn't find this very useful and left me frustrated cause it answered none of my questions.2. The chapters covering texturing IMO were again way to basic. It had a couple of good tips for procedurals applied to a House project, but it just didn't go very far.. Mapping methods were the most basic, and shader structures in hypershade were very simple. basically everything you saw in the shipped Maya tutorials was here. Don't expect a thorough explanation of shading networks here...3. The book frequently has you start off from a file on the CD. This really frustrated me, since you're not taking your own work literally from start to finish. Ok, well you can if you dig in somewhat and merge some file elements together. But like when they cover animating the twisting of the house, you have to start from a house file that already has deformers applied to it. Why doesn't the author just take you through it?? argh.. so I found that a bit annoying albeit its not a big deal.4. The part I looked forward to the most was incomplete, the creature creation project. it only covers the basics of modeling the head. They went step by step with so much else in the book, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't follow that though for the whole character. An attempt to continue the tutorial was online on the CD (in HTML form), but it was simplified and made pretty big leaps between steps. So it assumes you learned alot doing the basic head... hmm from newbie to expert I guess5. Character rigging was completely omitted. This was definitely unfortunate so even if you had finished the creature, you wouldn't be doing much with it. Also, UV unwrapping was ommitted so texturing a complex object like the creature was left out. again unfortunate.Well I can see many people were pleased with the book, so its up to you how to take this review. Overall, I'd say its an ok book, I got some useful tips out of it. But if I had it to do all over again, I'd probably go with Mastering Maya 3, it seems alot more in depth. If you're a newbie, this book will get your feet wet. If you're intermediate, hmmm you might get frustrated... I'd say simply go to forums like highend3d.com or cgtalk.com and you'll get the equivelent info for free. If you're an expert looking for a new twist on things... well ok this is definitely not for you.

Maya is a powerful 3-D modeling, animation and rendering program that has been used to produce numerous display ads, television commercials and full-length movies such as Harry Potter and Toy Story. Until recently, Maya's price and complexity have kept it out of the hands of the prosumer computer video/graphic audience and those simply wishing to learn the art of 3-D graphics. Both of these issues have been addressed this year. Alias|Wavefront lowered the price of Maya Complete by [Thousands of dollars] this February and offered a free, fully functional Personal Learning Edition of the program and New Riders Publishing has released Maya 4 Fundamental by Jim Lammers and Lee Gooding.Maya 4 Fundamentals is perhaps the \\"Gold Standard\\" of computer training material. It utilizes the educational philosophy of \\"tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you have told them.\\" While this is a simple principle, it can be difficult to implement. Lammers and Gooding have succeeded beyond my expectations. Utilizing a framework of didactic material and tutorials reinforced by outstanding chapter-by-chapter videos and sample scenes on an accompanying CD, they have made the process of learning sophisticated 3-D graphics fun. By the end of chapter 4, the reader has created an impressive animation that anyone (who has just read four chapters of a 3-D textbook) would be proud to show their friends, family, a potential employer or a client. The subsequent chapters delve deeper into the complete modeling, animation and rendering process presented and integrated so successfully in chapter 4. The authors of Maya 4 Fundamentals even offer quick-start instructions for those familiar with other popular 3-D programs.The introduction states that the book is intended for beginners and intermediate users but stress that experienced Maya users will also profit. I believe it exceeds its intent.

Additionally, the specific user actions (Choose File&gt;Options or Click the LMB) are not highlighted in a way that make them easy to pick out in the paragraph.With a subject as this tough as this, it should be much easier to move through the tutorials. Being forced to read through a long paragraph just to find one or two user action is not an efficient way to learn an application as heavy as Maya. However, this style of documentation may work for some people. This book would be better if the user actions were set apart from the other descriptive information.However, I understand that there are very good AVI movies on the CD that is supplied with the book. I have not opened the CD package because I am considering returning the book for the reasons previously stated."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"MAYA 4 FUNDAMENTALSJim Lammers with Lee GoodingPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Maya 4 Fundamentals is a book on 3D animation for the professional designer wanting to learn Maya from the bottom up. It contains a tear-out card of hotkeys on the very first page thus preventing a reader from having to hunt through the book for what a key does.Beginning with Chapter 2, the book walks you through how to use Maya and interact with the CD. When the information is provided on the included CD, there is a sidebar called ON THE CD and it tells you exactly which file to use. There are tips and traps sidebars as well.Know what NURBS are? If not, check out page 115 for a definition. Cameras, rendering, lighting, polygons, materials and artistry are subjects contained in the rest of the chapters. The wording in the book gives enough detail to make understanding what is being described easy enough and allows the reader to follow along using the CD...."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I read in an earlier review that someone was upset that Maya 4 Fundamentals would not work with Maya PLE (Free Version). I would like to inform all PLE users that it DOES work in PLE, but you have to download the scene files in PLE format. You can get them from ...in the downloads section."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Althought the title of this books is Maya 4 fundamentals, Jim lammers and Lee Gooding forgot to include a chapter with the new features in this version. In my personal opinion this books is only for beginners, not intermediate level. Take care about buying this book if you aren't completely sure what's in inside. The explanations are poor if you have some background in others 3d programs or just in Maya. So I only recomend this book for beginners with enough money to buy another one, once they finish this. Finally Maya 4 fundamentals it'snt a reference guide with all the fundamentals that there're inside of this program."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"hello ppl..i think maya 4 fundamentals is a very good book, but it could be more extensive with more tutorials and stuff..."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book would be just like any other if it wasn't for it's cd-rom. It contains not only the working files and images you need for the tutorials, but also hours of video tutorials compiled by the author. They are very close to what's written in the book, so by watching them you can jump across the book and read only the important bits, speeding up the learning process. It really saves you a lot of time. It's just like online training, but much more affordable. I hope other authors add this to their books too."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book is by far the best I've seen of its kind. I have read reviews that say the tutorials get lost in the long paragraphs, but those reviewers obviously didn't open the CD, because every single tutorial is presented in a step by step video that is shot from a first person perspective. How much easier could it be? This book is perfect for those new to Maya 4, because once you've finished this book, you can model a character from scratch, apply textures, set camera shots and various other activities and for those who have intermediate experience will find this book useful as a refresher and possibly learn short cuts to their work flow. The best thing about the book is that if the reader chose to, he or she could simply pop in the CD and learn all that this book has to offer. I am actually looking for other books written by these authors, becasue I haven't seen anything close to the way they teach."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book is by far the best instructional book I have ever purchased and I don't just mean in the field of Computer Animation. Although I have bought several books for Lightwave, 3dMax as well as one other book for Maya, I could only recommend this one. Not only is the text informative and understandable, but with the CD Rom that comes included, you don't even need to read the book: Every tutorial is demonstrated by one of the two authors of the book and they follow along with the text verbatim. If I buy another animation book, it will be by these two guys."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book made the conversion from other software very easy.

They walk you through designing a haunted house...and much more...I did have a hard time understanding Lee Gooding... but he only covers 2 or 3 of the 14 chapters.

Once I started going through the book and watching the movies on the accompanying CD I was immediately at home. The structure of the book allows anyone, with or without, prior 3d knowledge to jump right in and start creating. The tutorials are very well laid out and very precise. If you only buy one book for Maya make it this one. You go from Newbie to Intermediate in no time."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This is one of the best maya books I ever saw.I was already quite deep into maya befor the book, but this book overviewed all basics really good! If you are a beginner, you will have no problem with it since they overview all fucntions and explain every action they do. And the best of all is the cd-rom you get with the book. Every tutorials is showed and explained in full detail. If you want to get deeper into maya or start learning maya BUY THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I like the introduction, it has a comfortable, conversational tone. Most of the lessons are in long paragraphs of text. I think a beginner requires simpler step by step instructions. Each &quot;step&quot; in this book has many sub steps which assume you know how to do a lot.This is probably a better book for intermediate user, someone who is comfortable with the interface but hasn't gotten too deep into the program.I really like how each chapter starts with important hotkeys and key terms. Overall the book is thorough and good."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Maya Fundamentals is just that...the basic fundamentals.The cover is a little misleading, showing a very technical piece and the book goes nowhere near the detail shown. The tutorials are very basic and the color examples very limited(3 of 8 pages show the book's projects). I didn't open the cd because I decided to return the book but just from what I saw in the book, I really find it hard to be too impressed.Overall, if you're a beginner and want to get a feel for the basics without too much technical details, this is a decent book. If you're an experience user with some of the earlier Maya book, save your money."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book literally has taken me from a clueless newbie to a novice artist. The concepts you learn in this book are presented easily for the reader and take you step by step through each hands-on tutorial.The most valuable feature of this book are the video tutorials on the CD. These videos, created by the authors, take you through every tutorial in the book and then some. This is esspecially useful if you're like me and hate having to jump from book to screen constantly.This book also is distribution independent so if you have Maya Complete or Unlimited, you do not have to worry about missing out.The only complaint I have about the book is that it does not go more in-depth into modelling for you. I would have loved to see more character modelling and mapping than what was presented. I think a tutorial in organic NURBS modeling would have been an excellent edition.That lapse in judgment aside, this book is a must have for anyone seriously interested in learning Maya."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"The book is a wonderful book that covers the fundamentals. It goes into many details and explains the fundamentals nicely. I was hoping that it would go into bones, animation of the skeleton and skinning but as the name implies it is the fundamentals. I have purchased several books on 3Ds Max as well as Maya and this book I find to be excellent, more because of the details that is given in the CD. The CD has some excellent how-to tutorials that I found to be very good. These CD based tutorials performed some real-time screen capture and are worth as much if not more then the book."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I have picked up every book on Maya 4, and let me say that this one is clearly ahead of the rest. It covers every area of Maya such as complex character modelling to mood enhancing Paint Effects. This book is rare in that it teaches you so much that the projects you create with this book leave you inspired to create your own masterpieces.It is also one of those rare books that has a fantastic CD. On it are excellent visual aids, so if you get stuck on one of the tutorials, you simply load that tutorial video, and find out where you went wrong! It's great.If you own Maya, THIS BOOK WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU!!"},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This is, without a doubt the best Maya book I've ever read. A must buy if you want to learn Maya 3D."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This is a must buy for all who want to learn Maya. Their method of tutorials are outstanding. I really enjoyed the fact that I could have Maya running in the background and your tutorial running in front then pause it and do the step. I wish others would learn from you. I have spent a lot of money on books but this is by far the best. I highly recommend this book for all who want to learn Maya. The cd is filled with scene files and animations. Just an all around outstanding book. THANK YOU to the Authors. I hope there will be more from all of you.For all who are debating on purchasing this book, look no further. I have about 13 books on Maya including ones from Alias/Wavefront and there is no comparison in my eyes. The tutorials are very easy to follow and are done in a way that users with very little knowledge of Maya can learn from it. I am looking forward to getting the next book put out by these authors.There are scene, animation and project files on this cd that prove to be an added bonus. Not only can you see how they are done step by step but you can go through and compare your project with there's. (for those who are perfectionists like me)I am in no way affiliated with the authors or the publishers of this book."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Looking for the one best book to start learning Maya? You've found it, this is it! The instructions are clear, straight forward and specific. You won't get lost and there are no vague instructions like in other books.For people that already use Maya, the tutorials are a good way to refresh your basic skills. And, you may learn something simple that you didn't even know, like me!"},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Yes, I have learned a lot from this book. But.., I knew nothing about Maya &amp; this is my first book, so that is expected. Like almost all computer books, I don't think the command sequences were checked for accuracy. Several times I had to fumble around with the menus until I found what the author was talking about. Here is one example from chapter 5, the author has you hide ALL of the UI elements. Then he says click the save button. How am I supposed to click on the save button after I just hid it? There are a lot of things like this.Then the style is a little off for me. The author gets a little wordy. It becomes tedious reading a paragraph for each simple command.And one more thing, the first part of the book is concerned with creating an animation of a boat following a path around an island. I think the author wanted to demonstrate the impressive capabilities of Maya and to a degree he did this. At the same time, he managed to wear me down with complicated procedures I didn't yet understand, and frustrate me with command sequences that were not clear and accurate.I find this book useful, but.. it has a lot of room for improvement."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I have had this book for only 2 days and it is great! This is a great beginners book for Maya, which has a pretty steep learning curve. It covers everything you need to know for creating beginner level animations, models and dynamics. Probably my favorite thind about this book is the tear-out Hot Key guide -- PERFECT! Located right in the beginning of the book is this most splendid instument which will make any keyboard/hot-key junky drool.Also, i think what makes this book so great and easy to use and very effective is that it has not only the tutorial files -- but, get this, video tutorial files. That's right, this is not only a book, but video tutorial.Thanks to a great screen video capture program called Camtasia, the authors have capture their use of Maya in creating the project in the tutorial, to create a video tutorial to supplement the book. And the quality is better than you would get in a vhs/dvd tutorial (i know this for a fact since i bought Learning Maya: The Beginners Guide, which is A/W's own beginners tutorial dvd -- which, by the way is really good intro tutorial, particularly for only [$$$]!). The video files are Window Media video's therefore, can be view directly on your computer -- you can follow along while working in Maya without having to have a tv/vcr/dvd in the room next to you.As for the quality of the tutorial projects, the direction and desciption of the program -- very good. As in any tutorial (book or video), you can move at your own pace. All the tutorials are simple, yet effect. They use many of the features in Maya, including all the basic features, as well as some of the more advanced.One of the other great features of the tutorial is the tutorial files. Each chapter contains files for both working on the tutorial as well as a finished file to see what you file should look like in the end. Which is also good for those of us who learn quickly by deconstructing files. Also, the book has a great supporting website as well."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I purchased this book with very little knowledge of Maya and 3D animation but really wanted to get into the 3D world. I found this book one of the most user friendly books on the topic. Along with the movies that show you all the basics, they include enough to make you know how experiement or learn more by yourself. The exercises were excellent and speed was great (in most excercises) for taking it all in before trying it myself. I also have Mastering Maya and although Fundamentals seems like it has less material (which i don't think it does) it is many times superior in what i got out of it. Also included are some marking menus that make some short cuts in the UI. The only thing that i found that didn't work for me was the Polygon section. It was a little too fast in places and not as clear. But then again this is a complex topic.I rarely give compliments like this but this really deserves it."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This is the perfect format for someone with a little 3D animation experience who wants to get a feel for Maya as quickly as possible. The book reinforces common tasks by working through projects that require the same types of operations many times (e.g. NURBS Trim comes up many times while modeling a simple house). It only took me a few days to go through all the videos, only consulting the text occasionaly, mostly for figures.I hope to see more software-oriented books in this format in the future."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"For a person that does not enjoy reading through what is close to a computer manual, the CD included was worth every penny. For thirty dollars, you get hours of video lessons on many of the function of maya that are parallel to the book. The videos go step by step and tought me the basics of maya is about 3 monthes (doing around 3 lessons a week). Simply - if you are just learning maya, or if you have been merely playing around with it, buy this book. I wish they would have covered character set-up though."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I have never seen a format as well thought out as this book. The movie tutorials let you see the work being done before you go into the chapters to attempt to try them yourself. I am a beginner and found this book to be the best resource so far. (I am using the Maya Personal Learning Edition, which is another great help). This book is well worth the money for someone starting out. I also wanted to add that the people who made this book took the time to recreate many project files for the new Personal Learning Edition. I got a personal response from one of the authors leading me to the sight where I downloaded the new files and elements needed to do the tutorials. I am cruising along beautifully at this time!"},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I am just only Maya beginner and purchased Maya4 fundamentals for study by myself.

To go allong with the subjects covered in the book, all of the files are on the disk as well as videos of the authors preforming the work as well. This is helpful if you think you did something wrong or don't understad something. you to open these files.A few things that I didn't like are that in the beginning of the book the authors rely on the files that they provide on the disk for you to finish the project. This happens on the boat scene with materials and the camera with sky attaached to it. Also in chapter 7, creature modeling with polygons, the disk explains how to finish the model, it would have been esier to work from the book in my opinion.Aside from these minor setbacks the book does a really great job of launching your learning experance"},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"I learned how to build a door!!This is a really nice book, with the CD that comes with it you dont even have to read all that is in the books cuz they almost explain all in the CD.They teach you how to build a spooky house with some fog and spooky threes and a small boat at the lake and animate it."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Having decided to learn Maya (after a lengthy research and testing of many 3D Packages) I searched for a book to learn the basics. I work as an architect and have a solid grasp on 3D (working with 3D AutoCAD and Rhino and watercolors ), Everything I read regarding this book is actually true and it has some features I like a lot: the talked about CD is indeed a gem, Jim has a very pleasant voice so listening to him is not a burden on your ears, He knows what he wants to do and often (also in Lee's tutorials) you get many tips that are not in the text which is great as many times you can only see stuff when demonstrated and not written about. The written part of the tutorials is good and is not cluttered with theories - you just do the tutorials, maybe this is the reason for a very thin book. The tips that are given are very good and valueable. I like the fact a big tutorial was architectural related so I could relate to it very easily although I would try to solve the problems (modeling-wise) in a different way.The book sits easily on the table and is also lightweight so you can read it in your bed .The book definitely demonstrates how easy it is to work in Maya (I compare it to my little knowledge with LightWave which was my second best contender to be my 3D Package but lacked many needed features)All in All - a Great book , buy it and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"This book will give someone a good foundation for Maya.

The other two books are great, but better for people that are comfortable with the Maya interface orhave a good understanding of other 3d packages."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"Pros:The book takes a very hands on approach to learning Maya by walking you through a modelling a house from start to finish. It also comes with a set of mel scripts to speed up workflow. To top it off all the tutorials are viewable on cd, which must have added to the workload of the authors, and enhances the value of the book. It's coverage of the modelling tools and the hypershade is excellent.Cons:It lacks depth when it comes to animation. There's no tutorial on creating a skeleton for a character. Also lighting, which lots of people say is a key factor in making a good scene, is not covered in sufficient detail. However this is a fundamentals book and if you want more detail the manual is a good resource. It won't teach you how to make a pretty face like that on the front cover of the book, but thats too be expected from a fundamentals book."},{"Title":"Maya 4 Fundamentals (Fundamentals (New Riders))","review":"The book itself covers the necessary material, however there is some polish missing from it. The project that the authors take you through isn't particularly impressive (or interesting) but it does serve it's purpose. The manual is written clearly and concisely and covers most areas of Maya the a new user would be interested in.The real value of the book is the CD that comes with it. It contains several hours of Video of the authors using the software and it matches the book almost exactly. The quality of the video isn't that great in areas, however it gets the point across.Overall this book is worth the money and will teach someone how to use Maya, however, I would like to see some more polish in the next revision (mostly in the video)."},{"Title":"The Vixens","review":"Frank Yerby was an outstanding author and this is another example of his great writing."},{"Title":"Nezha Stirs Up the Sea","review":"DECADES AGO, THE MAINLAND CHINESE FILM INDUSTRY BUSIED ITSELF WITH THE CREATION OF ANIMATED FILMS ABOUT LEGENDARY CHARACTERS, WHO WERE SMALL, WISE, AND APT TO BE HEROES OF REBELLION.

Although quite young for such an assignment and is not even aware of the names of the cops she reports on, Olivia normally arrives after the police and medical examiners have completed their efforts. This time she happened to hear the report of murder over the scanner and was close enough to beat most of the homicide cops to the scene. For the first time she sees the brutalized corpse lying in the park before the tape prohibits voyeurs and reporters (some might say that is the same).The victim is Allison Avery, who haunts Olivia, as she seems so similar to herself down to her painted toenails at least to the reporter. An obsessed Olivia needs to know the truth because the similarities between them bedevil her and she could have been the person lying in the park. Olivia begins her own investigation into the life of Allison by flirting with the victim's brother and former boyfriend. Olivia digs deeper into a life that increasingly strikes home.Though in some respects, BODY OF A GIRL is an amateur sleuth tale, the story line centers more on Olivia's state of mind. Olivia is a complex character whose actions obfuscate the barrier between reporting a story and becoming the story. The support cast, including the victim, exists for readers to dig deep inside the mind of the protagonisst. Purists who enjoy an amateur sleuth examining a murder will probably be a bit disappointed by this tale, but readers who relish a psychological portrait of an investigator who stepped over the line will devour Leah Stewart's debut novel."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"Body of a Girl is so wonderful I can only urge you to order it and read it as soon as possible.

Olivia bears a resemblance to Allison and soon the murdered girl's family and friends open up to her, giving her insight into Allisons life. Olivia is drawn into this shadowy and dangerous world, fascinated by the wild side hidden inside her. Leah Stewart is a wonderful writer .

As the reporter uncovers more and more about the murdered girl, she begins to relate and even aspire to the vistim's personality traits. The author enjoys placing her heroine in dangerous situations, crafting an intense storyline that applies to all women who do not feel safe alone in an urban environment."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"This is a fascinating book, with an amazingly developed protaganist. Olivia Dale is a complex and intense character who will stop at nothing to get the story. A crime reporter in Memphis, Olivia comes upon the case of a dead young woman who looks like her, is her age, and for all intents and purposes, could just as easily have been her or any other young woman in the city. Wanting to get to the bottom of what happened, how, why and by whom, Olivia begins living as the victim might have. She tries to piece the puzzle together by recreating the victim's life and experiences. We watch this woman transform as a person and reporter, and learn a great deal about herself. What are human boundaries, and how far are we willing to extend them in different circumstances? A highly recommended, page turning, thriller."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"Body of a Girl is dubbed as a cross-genre literary/ mystery novel. I personally hate labels and peoples' need to categorize everything into neat little categories. Screw that I say. Body of a girl is quite simply a well-written, novice newspaper-reporter-turned-sleuth novel. It is a story of a young journalist--motivated as much as she is naive--beginning her career (ironically paralleling the author's life, in some sense) and trying to remain true to who she is among a seedy, often cruel and corrupt world. And like the author's true life symbolically mirrors that of the main character, so does our main character spend much of the novel peering into the looking glass of the victim's life who eerily also mirrors her own; and, hence, we have a tridimensional dynamic in the deep, deep underlying machinations of this literary work which (for me) gave it real substance and made for an undeniably genuine and fulfilling read.On a lighter note, I really enjoyed the precise prose, even pacing, well-developed characters, sweltering setting, and most importantly: the author's willingness to take risks. What makes this novel really shine is the author's willingness to give us a main character who takes chances and assumes risks that catch us completely off guard. I often found myself saying, \\"No way she is going to do that.\\" And, sure enough, she did. This however, is also my main gripe. I think the author needs to continue taking risks! Body of a Girl looked to be the beginning of a special journey into a darker, rawer realm of confronting one's own desires, fears and deep internal thoughts: the dialogue we hear and let run rampant in our daydreams but do not dare share publicly. I felt a crack of this door opening and saw a splay of light fantastically beginning to shine through . . . I've waited and eagerly hoped to continue such a journey in the author's next novel; however, seeing as the next book is about relationships. . . (needless to say)I am very disapointed. On a positive note, I will read and buy the Myth of You and Me--and I am sure I will be able to enjoy it for what it is; or so I hope. But I probably will never stop wondering what could have been, where and what direction a second novel in a series could have gone: it certainly would have been somewhere unique and compelling, in a land not of categories--but a new land existing between the files, surely outside of the genre box. Maybe, maybe we will be so lucky with novel three."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"Leah Stewart is a talented writer. I read this book after finishing her most recent novel, The Myth of You and Me (which I highly recommend). This story is dark and chilling. Olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in Memphis on a hot summer. When the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for Olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. The characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in Memphis is well rendered. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"A 25-year old fledging ace crime newpaper reporter seeks the answers to a night time street murder of a multi-faceted young lady with a surprising resemblance to the reporter herself.

And in this case, the police do a fine job in crime solving, a nice change from many novels of the genre. A fine atmospheric job you'll read thru to the end! My only quibble..Is it that easy to enter the apartment of a murder victim?"},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"This book would make a great Sunday night movie. It reads very visually, but I don't get enough of a sense of who the main character (Olivia, not Allison) is. There is so much writing about what she is physically willing to do for a story, which is supposed to show you who she is, but often that does not actually say who the person is. I never really got a sense of that, and I felt like I needed more character development for Olivia. I also felt like the ending was very anti-climactic. The whole story is builds up to a pressure point, and it never quite gets to the climactic point. I think there was also a problem with the focus of the story- was the focus on Allison or Olivia? As an editor, I felt like the book could have used a couple more revisions before its final printing. The main character makes statements about herself, and I'm compelled to ask why she's saying that, but I get no explanation. I think it just needed more of everything."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"From the moment I started this book, I was hooked. Every page had me on the edge of my seat. Was there nothing the main character wouldn't do for her story? (You'll have to read it for yourself to find out if and where she draws her line in the sand.)Stewart's writing style perfect for the tale. She does a great job of helping you understand the motivations of the lead character without giving away her next move. No easy task.A great read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"I really liked reading this book. It took a while to get into, but once you knew who everyone was and what they were doing, it really sped along. I am curious more about what Olivia is like, not only that she thinks a lot about her job, but other things, like how she acts and looks. David also seems &quot;not involved&quot;. I liked most of the book, but the ending could use some work. I was really curious what would have happened after. The epilogue was strage. I guess it's a lot of things to handle for a 13 year old girl like myself, :-). This is a great book, it would make a good movie too. I couldn't stop reading it!"},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"I loved this book. It has wonderful writing, strong pace, and a fascinating main character -- a reporter who risks herself to pursue a story about a young murder victim who looks like her.She penetrates the dead woman's world and dresses like her and goes to the nightclubs where she went and interviews her family and friends as she digs up the dirt. The character and personality of the dead woman haunt the narrative. Her fascination with this crime victim is the engine that drives the story. The dead woman's presence is riveting.This is not your typical hard-boiled mystery, thank heaven. It reads like a mainstream or even literary novel and comes closer to \\"The Secret History\\" than to the genre stuff of Robert B. Parker. It swept me up in its world. As a writer myself, I had very few nitpicks, which is unusual. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"It's been a few years since I picked up this book at the library. I scan the pages to read a paragrah of a few chapters before I check out a book and I read the back and had to get it. I remember it so strongly because it was THAT great! Leah Stewart, author, has written only two books 'Body of a girl' and after reading this I got the other book, 'The Myth of you and me'; and it's great, too. Stewart's knowledge of her characters are amazing and her usage of words take you \\"there\\"The novel is graphic and I suggest mature readers. I urge you to read it! You're turly missing out if you haven't."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"This was a very interesting book - quite different from _The Myth of You & Me_. It reminded me a lot of _Sharp Objects_, actually. I was a little disappointed in the ending, but, really, it was the only thing that made sense. I enjoyed the book, but just didn't love it."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"The transformation of the main character, Olivia, into her own newspaper crime victim is thrilling. Leah Stewart accomplishes a great task at showing how similar Olivia and Allison are despite their different lifestyles, and how Olivia's personality evolves as she learns and embodies the life of a young lady whose secrets and passions exemplify the complexity of her character. Great job Leah!!!-EC"},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"A wonderful read. A wonderful experience. Protagonist Olivia Dale's own hypnotic pursuit of self is enough of a therapy session for the common reader. By combining the essentials of prize-winning literary fiction and a cool, hip beach read, Leah Stewart, in this exceptional debut novel, stuns the reader into discovering things about himself while being completely engrossed and entertained in her own seedy Memphis crime story. This is a psychological thriller that delivers! Buy today, start it today, don't put it down until it lets you. Stewart may just be the queen of a new generation of young writers poised to take the lierary world by storm."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"Leah Stewart really knows her way around a newspaper office or else has a vivid imagination. She recreates the alienation reporters sometimes experience when they are involved in a story for a long time, with all the relationships entwined that end when the reportage does. Her descriptions of newsroom politics and police/female reporter relationships are right on. So are some of the fears that women reporters (editors, too) experience when working strange shifts. Moreover, this is a terrific story that rings with truth and makes the reader, like the main character, want to feel a kinship with the murder victim while seeing many of her friends and relatives as potential killers."},{"Title":"Body of a Girl","review":"This was a fairly good novel about an amateur sleuth who is helping solve a crime because she's a crime beat reporter and that's her job. What bothered me was that, as I read the book, I kept changing my opinion about who might have done from Carl to Peter et.al. as she introduced characters and then, in the last few pages, here come the real suspects apprehended already. I felt a bit cheated and as if I'd wasted my time trying to figure out the mystery. But - hey, Leah - not to worry - even Patricia Cornwell cheats in that same way occasionally. I'm sure you'll do well with subsequent efforts...."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Great basic pressure cooker coverage and excellent recipes. I especially liked the part about cooking dry beans without pre-soaking."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I had never used a pressure cooker until I bought an electric one a few weeks ago. This book has a lot of good basic information. Tried several recipes and all turned out great. I did not have to adjust any timings. Also appreciate that the recipes don't call for much processed food."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"One of two go-to pressure cooker books I use. A great source for recipes and ideas. You'll be spending less time in the kitchen if you prepare any of these recipes."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"If other new-to-pressure-cooking people are like me, one has a bit of anxiety around taking on such a reputedly dangerous cooking tool as a pressure cooker. I read avidly, reading aloud to my husband so he could know, too, the manual for my Fissler. And I read the cookbook Cooking Under Pressure with the same zeal for doing things safely as well as gastronomically successfully. For that reason I recommend Sass's book. The author is reassuring and informative. I branched off from one of her recipes to create a middle eastern dish and that worked fine. So, her recipes can be modified for more options. However, in that, and other recipes she only called for 1 cup of liquid. Fissler Manual admonishes us to never use less that 2 cups of liquid. Thus, I recommend reading both a manual and the cookbook, and letting the manual trump the recipe book if there is a discrepancy. The dish did not suffer from having more liquid. We enjoyed the leftover sauce."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Great book and good recipes too, so far. The additional info it provides will let me modify other recipes for use in pressure cooker."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Good Book, simple, but a number of very similar recipes for my taste. However, it does allow you to learn how to use the pressure cooker and make some good stuff right out of the gate. I'd recommend for a novice cook or a new pressure cooker user."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Lorna fills in the blanks with some good tips from her experience like using more water than the recipe calls for to make up for the fluid lost by the steam. The recipes were not glamorous--just basic recipes. I read a few and tried them but nothing really stood out as a favorite to go back to . I did make the risotto in the pressure cooker using her recipe and I was impressed that it was so well cooked and not hard/crunchy. And, I didn't have to stir it for 20 mins to add the fluids but i like my other recipes better--more flavor.I'll try more recipes and update this as I go. The book was highly recommended by others so maybe I am missing something."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I bought my wife an induction cook top, and Fagor pressure cookers. She loves the equipment, but needed a guide. This is a classic, and well deserved to be called that. She has been non-stop with her pressure cooking. From wonderful, quick, juicy meals for us, to cooking low cuts as gourmet dinners for her puppies, this has been an indispensable guide. Well recommended."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Great way to make yummy meals in times that rival the Microwave. I did try using a hot grill to brown the meat then put it in the cooker and it was amazing. Lots of good recipes and can't wait to try them all."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I recently purchased a new InstantPot pressure cooker, which only goes up to around 11 psi. I am pretty sure that Cooking Under Pressure was written for pressure cookers that reach 15psi, so I was worried about making some of the recipes. However, with just a bit of tweaking, I made two really delicious dishes from the cookbook tonight. The Sweet Potato Soup was delectable with its onions, celery, apples and sweet potatoes sauteed in butter (I added a bit of creme fraiche for serving). The Quick Lentils with Dijon mustard and parsley was surprisingly delicious - who would have thought? My guests raved about the Moroccan chicken stew with lentils, carrots, and spinach. I am excited to try the other recipes in the book.One of the things I loved about Sass's cookbook is the use of fresh ingredients and produce. You won't find onion powder, garlic powder, Coca-Cola, Bisquick, Velveeta, and other processed ingredients that are found in many popular (and well-rated on Amazon) cookbooks. I appreciate the emphasis on healthy, flavorful foods. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"So far I've found easy to follow recipes that are delicious. I have tried Quick &quot;Barbecued&quot; Chicken, Chicken Curry, and Boston &quot;Baked&quot; Beans. I'm making Porcupine Meatballs tonight. And there are a lot of other recipes I want to try from this book. Lorna Sass gives a lot of expert advice here that is useful that I don't find in other pressure cooker cookbooks. I own quite a few pressure cooker cookbooks and this is one of the top books I go to. The New Pressure Cooker Cookbook by Pat Dailey is also good as is Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by Sass."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I count myself as someone who loves being in the kitchen, creating delicious meals for my family. I am also a gadget person, and love adding new items to the kitchen. However, I'm very picky about bringing new items in, because I have limited space. So I want my gadgets to have multiple uses. Since I work full-time, I started investigating pressure cookers to get meals on the table quicker after a long day at work. I knew nothing about them, and knew that I needed a book that would not only teach me the basics on using the pressure cooker, but also have lots of good tasting recipes that I could work my way through while learning to best use the PC.I read lots of reviews and decided on Lorna's book Cooking Under Pressure. I actually bought the book before my pressure cooker, so I would make a better purchase. Her style of writing was very easy to follow, and I had my cooker put together and was testing the boiling point in no time! With her coaching, I knew that I had the basics of operation down before I put my first food item into the cooker.To date, I have tested quite a few of the recipes. I was having guests over for dessert one night, and made the cheesecake, and followed the directions carefully. I didn't substitute and ingredients, nor mis-time recipe. However, the cheesecake didn't set up properly. I found Lorna's web site and shot off a quick note asking if there was a chat room or message board that I could post my problem on, hit send, and hoped I would get a response from the webmaster. I was thrilled to check my email later THAT SAME DAY, to find that Lorna had personally emailed me back with a couple of questions, and then specific instructions on how to improve the cheesecake next time.I had noticed that most of my items did take longer to cook than the recipe stated, so we think the problem is my cooker isn't pressurizing to 9 pounds. I'll just have to cook my dishes for 30% longer now. That's great service: post a question and get a same day response!With the pressure cooker, you are cooking all the ingredients in the same pot, so despite the recipes directions, I always brown the meat for better flavor. I've made meats, vegetables and desserts so far. Each time I put the food on the table, I marvel at how quickly it was cooked. Plus, it tastes wonderful!This is the book if you want to learn how to safely use a pressure cooker, and then get started on learning how quickly foods cook, how to properly plan a recipe, then bring something fast and nutritious to the table. Once you have the basics down, courtesy of Lorna, the world is your oyster. Don't be afraid to make changes and perfect each dish to your own taste. That's the skill that having Cooking Under Pressure will give you. Stick with her recipes and make delicious dishes, or venture out on your own, and make delicious dishes. It's truly a win, win situation!"},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"The other night I gave a Valentine's Day dinner party using recipes from this book. The osso buco (with risotto) was \\"to die for\\" and was easier than I ever thought it could be. The guests ate and ate, then complained of being too full but politely accepted a bit of dessert - being the chocolate-kahlua bread pudding. After raving about the bread pudding, they all took seconds and devoured the rest.I had previously tested my new pressure cooker by making a chocolate bread pudding from the recipe book that came with the pressure cooker. It was runny and tasteless and I wondered why anyone would bother. I scratched bread pudding off my list. I was then advised to try Lorna's recipe since she tests them carefully. I was so happy I did!!!!! I used brioche bread (challah) and 71% Valrhona chocolate which helps, I am sure.Apparently my guests all called other friends, and two days later I was getting calls from the others asking why they were not invited and \\"could they come next time\\".I am new to the pressure cooker but am becoming a convert, having bought two sizes (so far). However, I am NOT new to the Sass cookbooks. I am a devotee and it is because of her cookbooks that I decided to try the pressure cooker. Her explanations and suggested variations truly teach you how to cook, which is more than just being able to read and follow a recipe. Sass is a rare combination of scholarly and anti-snob. She understands and explains how to select, store, use, and prepare the ingredients (especially the grains), but where there are shortcuts she will tell you about them without apology. (\\"If you have no dried mint leaves, empty a bag of mint tea.\\") For those of us who are trying to move to more of a grain-based diet, her cookbooks are a MUST.Further, the format of her books - all her books - is the easiest to read and understand. The instructions are straightforward, the ingredients are clear and provide a readable shopping list. The charts and the basics are right where you would instinctively look for them."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I rely on the charts for cooking beans and grains and love the risotto recipes. The timings are all right on the money. Chicken with lentils and spinach is also a great favorite. Lorna Sass really takes you by the hand and teaches you all the great things you can do in a pressure cooker.I get rave compliments when I cook her easy-to-follow recipes."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I started considering the purchase of a pressure cooker after reading Lorna Sass Whole Grains Every Day Every Way. I finally purchased one last week-along with Cooking Under Pressure. It was the single best purchase I've made for my kitchen stocked with every gadget imaginable! I haven't put it away yet and don't plan to anytime soon! I don't understand why the pressure cooker is not a staple in every American kitchen, but it will be in mine! I love to cook but, as a busy mom to 3 children, I don't always get my meals planned out before I need to start cooking. The recipes in Cooking Under Pressure are so simple and delicious and, most importantly, healthy. My husband tried to take us out to dinner the other night but I told him no. I wanted to try another delicious recipe from my new cookbook in my new pressure cooker! Everyone should have a pressure cooker and everyone should buy this cookbook to accompany their pressure cooker!

Luckily, on impulse I bought a pressure cooker because it seemed easy enough to use.

She has overcome my fear of pressure cookers and I now own three of them and one stays on top of my stove ready to be used at moments notice. I have cooked almost all of the recipes in her books and each one has been a winner. How about pasta in meat sauce in five minutes, barley risotto with lamb in 23 minutes or my grandsons favorite of beans with sausage and greens in 30 minutes. I make cheesecake and cook salmon in foil and the best soups in minutes.

Lorna Sass' excellent 20th anniversary edition of COOKING UNDER PRESSURE, however, has rekindled my interest in using a pressure cooker to prepare meals.I'm impressed that an amazing range of dishes can be done to perfection in the pressure cooker. It's not just all about old-fashioned pot roast! How about Moroccan lamb tagine or Rock Cornish hens stuffed with apricots and prunes, just two of the many appetite-inspiring recipes contained in COOKING UNDER PRESSURE. Indeed, the cookbook contains many delicious preparations I wouldn't have dreamed could be made in a pressure cooker. Imagine risotto, for example. This divine preparation of rice is done in 4 minutes without stirring. It is also worth pointing out that there are other reasons for pressure cookery besides minimizing cooking time. The conservation of fuel it allows is vital in today's environmentally conscious world.Lorna Sass' 20th anniversary edition of COOKING UNDER PRESSURE not only brings back to print the popular first edition, its recipes have been adjusted to reduce their fat content. In addition, the amount of liquid required has been reduced because technology has made it possible for today's cookers to come to pressure with less water. And if you are still a holdout, there are electronic pressure cookers available.Joan Peterson, PhD, author of the EAT SMART culinary travel guides for food lovers."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I bought this book because I tried the Brown Rice and Lentil stew recipe, which was on a website.

I had heard that pressure cookers were the microwave ovens of the 50's. Then after several people blew them up by overloading them they lost favor. I borrowed one from a friend and bought this book. After making chilli in 20 minutes, and lentil soup in 10. I was a convert.I now own 2 cookers, one really large one (16qt)for making spagetti sauce and stew, and one medium large one (8qt) for soups.The one thing the book doesn't really cover, is that once the top is on, there is no stiring, (duh!) So if you leave it on high heat, it can burn the thick sauce recipes. So I always heat the mixture until just to simmering, lock the lid on and then cut the heat to medium. It takes a minute or two longer for the pressure to come up but I rarely burn soup any more.Also, if you haven't bought a pot, get a big one, when you fill a pressure cooker, you only fill it 1/2 way. So a 8qt pot, is really good for 4qts of soup. If you have time shop estate sales. That's where I got mine. The pots last a long time, and many who cooked in the 50's will have one that is just fine.

I bought this book when it was first issued and have referred to it countless times, since.Pressure cookers today are indeed different than the earlier models (including my old Mirro). With my old cooker, even though I never had an accident, I had to stay close at hand to monitor the pressure regular rattling, etc. Pressure cooking with a modern cooker is so much easier! My latest purchase, earlier this year, was an electric, programmable cooker from Salton that's as easy to use as my rice cooker or Crock Pot.It's true that some of the recipes in this book use ingredients that are not freely available in non-urban areas of the country. No problem: just adapt to what you want to cook! I read a review by a prior person who lamented that they must be a 'meat and potatoes' person. Fine: do your meat and potatoes here! I find that baked potatoes are much more delicious done in the cooker than in the microwave. The time required is rather a split between nuking and conventional baking. Pressure cooking can do wonders on tough meat the same way that a Crock Pot can. Just be sure and brown your meat first!However, I still use my cooker more for beans than anything. Sass gives a full and careful explanation of bean and legume cooking here, as safety must be considered.Since this book came out several other cookbooks have been released on pressure cooking. I've bought some, and the best alternative to this book is the one published by Presto, the maker of the original pressure cooker. It's an excellent reference also, and also recommended."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Pressure cooking is, unfortunately, very misunderstood. This book should go a long way towards changing that. It presents an excellent range of recipes, well organized and written, and every one of which we've tried has been fabulous. Because of the speed and flavor, we've been pressure cooker fans for three years, and this book opened our eyes to new possibilities. Ms. Sass's taste in spiciness tends to be a little milder than ours, but once you see where she's coming from, it's very easy to adjust. We'll try the vegetarian version of the book, too"},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"We've tried nearly every meatless recipe in this book and, with the single exception of &quot;peanut butter-carrot soup&quot; (yes, you read that right!), they've been exceptionally good. One of the best things is how quickly all can be prepared. You can go from deciding to cook a bean dish for dinner to eating that same bean dish in well under an hour. No more overnight pre-soaks! The recipes are all easy to prepare and are really delicious. I'm getting copies for my mom and sister for Christmas! (Psst -- don't tell 'em!)"},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"As a newcomer to pressure cooking, i need'ed some where to start, and someone to give me the basic's of pressure cooking. I went to my local book store, and the sales person suggested this book over a dozen others on the subject. It is not only a easy read, but is is full of more information then you will ever need. The recipes are great and written so that anyone can start cooking right away, and turn out a great meal in minutes. This will always be number one on my cook book list Thank you for helping me on my way to better and healthier cooking."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I bought this book in 1997 to learn about pressure cooking. Now I use it to adapt my Latina recipes to fast pressure cooking. I've made Ropa Vieja (Flank Steak) (25 minutes under pressure), Black Bean Soup (35 minutes under pressure), Coconut Bread Pudding (15 minutes under pressure), and Flan (an amazing 15 minutes under pressure).Though these recipes are not in Ms. Sass' book, you can easily adapt your favorite recipes by following her guidelines and expertise.A must-have book for all busy cooks."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I cannot praise this book too highly. As a long-time cook,but novice pressure cook, I found Ms. Sass's recipes simple to follow, and always as promised. Delicious doesn't begin to describe her Mushroom Barley Soup, which she correctly bills as the same comfort food that is served at Ratner's Restaurant. I grew up in NYC, and ate often at that landmark, and my family has patiently tolerated my frequent references to how scrumprious that particular soup was--well--I just produced it, courtesy of Lorna Sass, in my own pressure cooker (Kuhn-Rikon, also divine to use). The risotto with leeks, mushrooms and olives is also noteworthy, but I am confident that all these recipes are. This book, as well as The Pressured Cook, also by Sass, are all anyone needs to produce exceptionally satisfying dishes made with wholesome ingredients, and ready quickly. The portions are generous, and the introductions to each recipe are accurate, informative and inspiring. If more stars were available, I would award them."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I was always afraid of pressure cookers, but this book sold me on them. All the recipes I have tried are great; my children will eat them too. For me it has the ease of a crockpot, but without having to prepare the ingredients in the morning. I highly recommend this book. It also is a good introduction to vegetarian cooking."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I've used this cookbook since I started cooking with a pressure cooker seven years ago, the recipes are consistently reliable and delicious. I've given this book along with a pressure cooker as wedding presents to my two brothers who are now both avid pressure cooker chefs. I've also adapted recipes of my own, my mother has a holiday red cabbage recipe,cooked like Lorna Sass' own red cabbage recipe it now it takes 5 minutes to cook instead of 1 1/2 hours and doesn't make the house smell of cabbage. I'm looking forward to buying some of her other books."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I've been using a pressure cooker for 25 yrs. and just bought this book. It's great! The recipes are all up to date and everything I've tried has been terrific."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"All those years ago, a co-worker of mine was raving about the fantastic rice pudding he had made the night before. Now, if there's one thing I like eating, it's rice, and rice pudding that much more. I felt a bit jealous because I hadn't made any in so long -- cleanup and length of cooking time kept me from some of my favourite recipes. We talked some more, and he told me about all of the great recipes in the book. The next day, he brought me the rice pudding recipe he had spoken of. I had done a bit of research on cookers, and found a Lagostina cooker at a very reasonable price, and was ready to go. Talk about delighted. So easy, so fast, and since the cooker retains moisture so well, cleanup was simple. I bought this book and dove into the realm of the pressure cooker.Lorna Sass has no boundaries for what she'll try pressure cooking. Her braveness is worth every cent her cookbooks cost - she tests everything, makes sure it works, gives advice, gives tons of suggestions and alternate versions of the recipes, charts for how long it takes to cook beans and other things. I've become a pressure cooker fiend, and recommend it to all my friends. Cookers are not the scary things we thought they were when we were kids - I encourage anyone to take the plunge. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Has good solid information. Sass does not pre-soak legumes before cooking so all the cook times are wrong for me. I always soak legumes at least 24 hrs. This starts the germination process and converts the starch so no gas after eating legumes.Other popular pressure cook book recos. at least 4 hr. presoak so cook times work for my style. Both books are good. Just depends on your preference."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Thumbing through the recipes I found the ingredients' lists wholesome with most of them in my cupboard or easy to find at my local grocer.

Then it got put away until the next year. I honestly didn't know they were so versatile. I have tried several of the recipes in this book with my new pressure cooker and I am really impressed!! Venison stew (modified the beef stew recipe found in the book)....fork tender in 20 minutes cooking time. Cheesecake....the best I ever had! And dried beans in 22 minutes. This book will have you cooking like you never knew you could. The only thing I didn't like about it is there are no pictures. But that's OK.....it's still a 5-star book."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"I bought the original version in the early 1990's when I bought my Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker, and I am still using them both regularly. I have made many delicious meals and side dishes, as the stains on the pages will prove :-)I grew up eating meals made in my working mother's old jiggly top cooker, but I was always afraid to use one myself. My all time favorite was her porcupine meatballs. I thought that the recipe was lost forever, until much to my surprise and delight, I found it again in this book - thank you Lorna. My other favorites are the applesauce, cooked in a fraction of the time, and her various risottos, no constant stirring or standing over the pot. My husband compares every risotto that he orders in a restaurant to Lorna's recipes - and her's always comes out way ahead. Her Creamy Leek and Potato Soup is fabulous - almost no guilt - no cream is used and it still comes out rich and creamy.I understand that this new 20th Anniversary edition contains basically the same recipes, but they are updated and use less fat. I am ordering one for a vacation home, that's how much I use it."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Got the book and a cheap pressure cooker with safety devices and have and great success and pleasure using the obviously tested recipes in this book.

I did love her sweet potato soup combination so far."},{"Title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"Not being a neophyte at pressure cooking, I was expecting more, based upon all the positive reviews.I gave this book 2 stars because her combining ideas are intriguing. The beginning reads like a Dummies book (if this is your cup of tea, then by all means purchase it), the cooking times listed are wrong for the grains and beans (I do not know what else, I have not completed checking the rest, though ALL are suspect after two wrong cooking times). Upon writing the Author, expecting a response, none has been forthcoming. For a self proclaimed expert, I was extremely disappointed! Miss Vickies pressure cooking (.com) is much more reliable and considerably more cost effective. I had originally considered purchasing additional titles by this author, but the inaccuracies of this book shadow all others.

Dr. Jean Ayres, a renowned Occupational Therapist who pioneered treatment of sensory integration disorder; her nephew and patient Philip R. Erwin. Zoe Mailloux, Director of Administration at the Pediatric Therapy Network in Torrance, CA. provides pertinent commentary in each chapter for parents of children who have learning differences, giving excellent information about what to watch for, how to cope, and how to help the child around the obstacles the learning disorder creates. But the unique and endearing quality of the book is that it is composed of selected letters between loving Aunt Jean and her nephew in New York. Young Phil's letters express, sometimes painfully, the injustices and emotional trauma he experiences from fifth grade on, as he struggles with his inability to do math, physical education, and his feeling of frustration and social isolation. His Aunt Jean's perceptive and compassionate letters encourage and inspire Phillip as he experiences these traumas of growing up with a learning disability. She offers professional advice as to what to do to help his brain learn to re-wire itself so that he can function successfully in the world. These letters began several decades ago when Aunt Jean was a pioneer in this field of psychology and learning as she encouraged Phil. The triumph of his life story, through its poignant struggles, is a great victory, proving Phil's determination, his parents' support, and Jean's therapy successful beyond imagination. Ultimately thousands of children have reaped the benefit and thousands of parents are given hope and directions of how to help their children. This is a must read for anyone who suspects a child has a learning disability."},{"Title":"Love, Jean: Inspiration for Families Living with Dysfunction of Sensory Integration","review":"This book, written by A.

Some readers, especially those who are just beginning their careers in econometrics and financial modeling may believe that economic models form a hierarchy, with the best ones being on top while the marginal ones are at the bottom. In addition, some may believe that more modern approaches are better than the ones taken several decades ago or conversely that no improvements have been made in economic modeling since it was established as a profession. As an example, recently a former chairman of the Federal Reserve stated that the economic forecasting tools of today are no better than ones in existence fifty years ago. He offered no evidence for this claim, no doubt because of the gargantuan amount of effort it would take to establish it. Indeed, to compare econometric models requires agreement on what constitutes a \\"valid\\" or \\"good\\" model, and once this is settled one frequently requires another model to do the comparisons. In addition, models are built for particular situations, domains, and contexts, and it is very common for a model to work much better than another in one context but fail miserably when compared to the other in another context. Ordinary linear regression for example can be better than more \\"sophisticated\\" approaches like neural networks in some areas of application. A more complex model is therefore not necessarily better than one that is relatively simple. So economic models do not form a hierarchy under any nontrivial classification of merit, nor can it be said that no progress has been made in economic modeling over the past fifty years.The approaches to economic modeling as outlined in this book definitely support the idea that there is no free lunch when it comes to forecasting. It is the context that governs the efficacy of one model over another, and it might be said with fairness that the ability to select the proper model for this context comes with experience. This experience is definitely reflected in the authors that have composed the articles in this book. Readers will probably not read every article in the book, but will instead select those that interest them or those that show the most practical promise.For this reviewer, some of the highlights of this work include:* The discussion of the two principles behind Bayesian forecasting: the principle of explicit formulation and the principle of relevant conditioning. The later principle is always violated by non-Bayesian forecasting techniques* A view of economic models of being \\"means\\", not \\"ends\\". This distinction is one to be kept in mind especially at the present time where financial modeling and economic forecasting is being blamed for much, if not all, of the turmoil in the financial markets.* The discussion of the importance and need for discarding irrelevant information when doing simulations of joint distributions. As discussed in the book the justification for this omission can be given a sound, quantitative foundation.* The importance of doing simulations rather than finding analytical solutions in economic modeling.* More in-depth discussion on how to choose the prior distribution in Bayesian economic forecasting, thus removing some of the objections of this selection always being \\"purely subjective.\\"* The discussion on \`hyperparameters' and their connection to latent variables and \`hierarchical prior distributions.' These notions have recently been applied to forecasting of housing prices. The book mentions many other applications.* The discussion on the \`Bayes factor' and its use in assessing the evidence in favor of one economic model versus another. Recently the notion of a Bayes factor has been generalized in the field of artificial intelligence, wherein it is used to measure to what degree one machine is more \\"intelligent\\" (i.e. can better solve problems) than another.* The discussion on the role of \`posterior predictive' distributions in the construction of new economic models.* The discussion on state space models, particularly the Kalman filter and its Bayesian interpretation. More discussion on the evaluation of the likelihood function would be appropriate here, especially computational issues surrounding the inversion of the innovation matrix.Some of the downsides to the book include:* There are relatively few explicit numerical examples illustrating the efficacies of the different models.* Some of most important discussions are delegated to the references, although the reference list is quite extensive.* The more \\"exotic\\" approaches to modeling, most of these coming from the field of artificial intelligence, are omitted or are only discussed briefly. Omitted topics include support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and inductive logic programming.* No in-depth discussion of the tractability/computational complexity of the econometric models included. Issues of tractability are very important to those who are to implement these models in practice."},{"Title":"Handbook of Economic Forecasting, Volume 1 (Handbooks in Economics)","review":"This is the most comprehensive and authoritative source of reference for the econometric forecasting, I've seen. The editors and the writers are from the top of the discipline. Many texts are fairly mathematical, so the solid understanding of the basics of the statistics and the time series econometrics is required."},{"Title":"The Architecture of Diplomacy: Building America's Embassies (ADST-DACOR Diplomats & Diplomacy)","review":"I have had the good fortune to meet Ms. Loeffler, to hear her speak on this subject, to be involved in designing embassies, studying embassies, and also in reading this spectacular history.

Unfortunately, this book was not what I thought it would be. Mr. Comfort does do a wonderful job with his commentaries, including them with quotes from the bible and presenting them with in a way that does challenge the reader to examine his/her own beliefs. He does a most excellent job at explaining man's sin and our need for a Savior.The problem is, that among the many quotes from the celebrities, many of them are nothing more than one or two-sentence comments, and in reality says nothing about the person's true beliefs (like Lily Tomlin, for example.) Another disturbing thing I found is the quote he included from Della Reese, which, by reading it, the reader would think that she is a bible-believing Christian. However, upon further research on my own, I found that Ms. Reese's beliefs are more New Age and unbiblical, rather than true biblical Christianity. And the bad part about this is that Mr. Comfort did claim that this book was well researched, but I get the feeling that it really wasn't.It makes for an interesting read, but don't expect to walk away with too much new information on what the celebrities believe."},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"Recently I purchased two copies of this book.

I picked a winner. She absolutely loved it and is normally not much of a \\"book person\\" nor typically interested in things of a religious nature. This struck her fancy, big time. I then began reading my own copy and found it much more entertaining than I expected, being that I am not half the movie lover she is. Right off I was intrigued by some of the names I was finding in the table of contents. Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Stephen King, Alice Cooper, Tom Cruise, Charlie Chaplin and Christopher Reeve were just a few names that caught my eye. It would be interesting to have a look inside their heads to see what makes them tick. I wondered though, if it would read like a tabloid. Quickly I found that not to be the case, as the author seems to have done his homework, in many cases using quotes from the celeb's themselves, on just what it is they believe and how they came to that conclusion. Regardless of who you are a fan of, you will raise an eyebrow or two at some of these candid quotes on the often unheard of beliefs in Hollywood. This will definitely be making it into the hands of a few more friends of mine for Christmas. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in celebrities, although that is by no means a prerequisite for enjoying this book. I think just about anyone would find it intriguing and it's a great gift for an office grab-bag too! Keep a copy on the coffee table when you have guests. They'll love it!"},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"Although not as thorough as I had hoped, What Hollywood Believes is an interesting look at what some of the most popular actresses/actors of our day have to say about their religious beliefs. My main complaint about this book is that most of the sections are not very elaborate and only deal with one or two quotes from a particular person. This can hardly be evidence of that person's genuine beliefs. I think the author tries to read too much into what some of them say.Still, it does make for a very worthwhile read. The author offers many counter-arguments to some of the more outspoken artists' statements toward Christianity in particular. He has a keen understanding of the Christian faith and offers insightful apologetic antidotes. This is especially a worthwhile read if you're interested in knowing the basics of the Christian faith and how it is most often reflected in today's modern popular culture."},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"We all want to know what celebrities eat, what kind of toothpaste they use and perhaps even what their favorite TV show is. However, did you ever wonder if they believe in God or not?This book interviews many well known celebrities and asks exactly that question. You might be surprised as to what they really believe.Yes, some of the stars comments were short and to the point, but what they did say will amaze you. However, \\"Dean Jones\\" interview took up 5 pages. Want to know what he believes...buy the book!"},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"When I picked up this book, I expected that the author had done research and even interviewed celebrities to get their opinions on faith, etc. However, most of what I found was clippings and soundbites that were often taken out of context and used to prove whatever \\"point\\" the author was trying to make. This not only casts a needlessly bad light on many of the celebrities, but it also exposes the lack of effort and research that went into the writing of this book. It seemed to me like the author was more interested in publicizing his critique of celebrity quotes than of actually delving into dialogue with celebrities and their beliefs. Thumbs down on this one."},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"First of all, let me say that I was entertained by reading about what the famous actors/actresses believe. It actually helped me to discover Scientology, and while I don't believe in it, this book helped me to expand my latitudes. It is also fairly brief and easy reading, and I found it fun to learn some of these people's real names.That's about where the second star ends. One can easily conclude from reading this book that Ray Comfort is an apologist, and a bad one at that. Sometimes he simply presents an actor/acress' beliefs, but when he finds it convient to push his agenda, he'll go off on a tangent about what someone believes. His conclusion is borderline offensive--he presents a list of those actors/actresses who have passed away simply to make his point that life is temporal and that you NEED to consider Christ. Furthermore, he lists \\"Jesus of Nazereth\\" as his last entry, as if Jesus was some great Hollywood actor needing our attention.If you're interested in learning about the spirituality of Hollywood, by all means, consider this book. But please don't give it to people you care about in hopes of converting them...that's just plain wrong, and if you really cared about them, you wouldn't subject them to this kind of guilt trip, or drivel."},{"Title":"What Hollywood Believes: AN INTIMATE LOOK AT THE FAITH OF THE FAMOUS","review":"This book states that Hollywood started as a \\"Christian\\" settlement in the early 1900s. It has fallen in stature and has a reputation of Sodom and Gammorah instead of a Godly place. No true religious nature has been reflected in television shows or movies. Wonder why. One quote I found may state it all: \\"In Hollywood, self is on the throne. The culture of Hollywood encourages it.\\" Being a Christian isn't 'hip' in Hollywood.As I looked at each entry, I was amazed that most of the stars use their own names. It wasn't like that in the past. Two in particular who didn't were Charlton Heston (birth name: John Charles Carter) and Kirk Douglas (Issur Danielovitch Demsky). Most of these he chose were not my favorite stars, so I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to those not familiar; when he quoted George Clooney, I could identify (though I am closer to Nick's age), then I saw that Mr. Comfort had included a good sermon on George's comment.He used quotes for Walt Disney who died in 1966; Charlie Chaplin (1977), John Wayne (1979) and Orson Welles (1985). These amazed me even more than the false names. He quotes Eddie Fisher's daughter Carrie saying her dad is happy because of his faith -- he is Jewish. I hope he is happy now.George Nader, one of my favorite actors, always the gentleman, is dead, but I know he was a good Christian. I think, too, that Bing Crosby believed in God. How could he not after portraying a priest in all those movies?He named presidents who had a deep faith in God, but he omitted Lincoln, the most ethical we've ever had. The only one connected in any way was Reagan. He should have quoted Nancy.At the end, he interviewed Jesus of Nazareth. Now, that is a feat unworldly. He had the most to say, as he is the son of God! But I've always had a problem with a 'virgin birth.' There can be no such thing. And I do believe in God, but he is a personal God. I don't ask for material things like some devoted Christians I knew in 1980 (and behold! they were given what they asked for, with one exception). I thank God for the people I love, and I pray for them to be safe and happy.Some churches are an abomination and treat their members cruelly. I won't name names, but they know who they are. I was christened a Methodist as a baby, grew up Baptist, and returned to the Methodist as they are not emotional and use ritual. I don't believe in emotion in religion. I've always loved and admired the Jewish people.Ray Comfort has written many other religious books, and some not so religious. He is the co-host of a t.v. show out in L.A."},{"Title":"Lockheed P-38 Lightning - Aero Series 19","review":"Originally published in 1968, this book is showing its age. In nowadays standards the text is a bit lacking in detail and the illustrations leave something to be desired. There is, however, nothing wrong with the photographs, as usual in this famous series which started as early as 1965 with bringing us aircraft monographs and whose publications about some aircraft remained THE standard for years to come.This is however not the case with the Lockheed Lightning, where there was much material to discover, so other publications soon followed. Most of them have surpassed this book, some of them did not.If you already own several big books about the Lightning, there is a chance that most of the photographs look familiar to you."},{"Title":"New York Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"This book of photos should really be called Manhattan - Then And Now since all of the photos are of this Burough of New York. The book begins with photos of lower Manhattan and continues slowly uptown showing just about all of the important landmarks. This book was published after the 9/11 tragedy and some emphasis has been placed in showing the area in lower Manhattan before and after the terrorist attack."},{"Title":"New York Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"A city that has changed and continues to change with the speed and energy that New York does, invites books like these. Annette Witheridge's &quot;New York: Then and Now&quot; is a gorgeous collection of photos from days past juxtaposed with recent shots. For me there are two effects of this juxtaposition: one is a sense of loss. Many of the old buildings, now gone, were beautiful. But, more strongly, is the sense of admiration for New York's eternal dedication to progress. &quot;New York: Then and Now&quot; gives the reader an appreciation of the labor that has gone into the building of the greatest city on Earth.PS--Most photo books have great photos, but the print quality is mediocre.

Oh did I forget to say pricey."},{"Title":"New York Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"I love the idea of then and now photos in NYC. I've picked up a few books of this kind over the years and it's amazing to see how much the city has changed and what has remained.This book is nice on the surface but has some big flaws. For example, the author did not match up the \\"now\\" photos with the classic shots, so it's hard to compare the time periods. Additionally, in many cases she doesn't even provide the same view; you are simply looking at 2 completely different areas. This really defeats the purpose of doing a \\"then and now\\" book.I also thought her notes were really trite. Rather than highlighting particular structures that remained or what was replaced in a given set of photos, we get very superficial comments like \\"this area is now home to many swanky stores\\". This type of caption is utterly useless, and unfortunately, prevalent throughout the book.Finally, I'm not sure if it's on purpose but it appears that several of the photos were doctored with a blurring technique to give the appearance of streaks of light in traffic. Not sure if this was intentional, but it looked a bit amateurish nonetheless.Overall, I was disappointed with the book. It really feels like a book someone did as a hobby rather than a well researched project."},{"Title":"New York Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"If you compare this book to the Boston series or some other cities series, the 'now' or current views of NY were not done as well in terms of viewpoint. A lot of the photos do NOT match up well and you'll find many closeup views compared to wide angle views, so you'll be hunting a lot to find landmarks.I have the first edition (c. 2000) and there is a gross error on pps.52-53, Bleeker and Thompson Sts. The photo on the left ('then')shows a Federal style four-story red brick building with canopy roof on second floor and recessed two top levels. The photo on right ('now') is described as the same building having been sandblasted \\"...second floor canopy is gone, but the facade has hardly changed.\\" Clearly, the photo on the right is a six-seven story building from a more modern era (perhaps glazed bricks white/grey) with huge windows in comparison and a flush facade (no recesses)containing some kind of inner courtyard with four street openings. Not a difficult thing for any mediocre editor to catch! (Perhaps this was fixed in the further editions--hope so.)Fun book for history and architecture buffs, but could've been so much better. I'd say it had been done in a hurry with little editing/checking."},{"Title":"THE POETICAL WORKS OF LONGFELLOW.","review":"This book is part of the Cambridge series of poets and is certainly well worth the money. Longfellow's poems are nicely grouped, with introductory comments to set the background of each. There are also notes back near the index that further explain some of the passages. Longfellow was an extremely successful poet in his lifetime, but his popularity fell in the century following his death in 1882; considering the 20th century's penchant for the abstruse, there is both humor and truth in Canadian novelist Robertson Davies' wry remark, that Longfellow's dimming popularity is owing to his being wholly comprehensible. Many of Longfellow's poems are familiar for the stories they tell (e.g. The Courtship of Miles Standish, Evangeline, Paul Revere's Ride, Hiawatha), but there are many little known specimens which are moving in their own right. This is a wonderful volume of poetry, highly readable, and worth the effort to obtain for yourself."},{"Title":"Understanding African American Rhetoric: Classical Origins to Contemporary Innovations","review":"Even for my college course, this was more of a research text for a graduate school course."},{"Title":"Fact and Fiction.","review":"Bertrand Russell often gathered essays he thought would have lasting value, and published them as collections. This book not only has essays, but the text of talks he gave on the BBC. The topics are wide and disparate. He begins with books (and their authors) that made a deep impression on him while he was in his formative years. Then follow essays on politics, starting off with &quot;What is Freedom?&quot; and &quot;What is Democracy?&quot; -- two basic questions that many people don't even think about. The &quot;Divertissement&quot; section contains pieces of fiction. Russell stated that he found fiction a useful medium to express ideas he half-believed in, but had no firm grounds for belief. The last section is on &quot;Peace and War,&quot; and includes the famous Vienna and Manchester addresses on nuclear bombs. His style is incisive and pithy as usual. If you like Russell, you should not miss reading this book."},{"Title":"Fact and Fiction.","review":"Besides literary reviews (Shelley, Turgenev, Ibsen, Swift), B. Russell tackles in these short comments the crucial problems of our world: freedom, power, science, war and peace, truth or the real nature of mankind.Political, economic and mental freedomHolders of power, always and everywhere, are indifferent to the good or evil of those who have no power, except in so far as they are restrained by fear. Therefore, mankind needs democracy in order to break the monopoly of political power. Liberty cannot be secured without democratic elections. But within democracy, there should be tolerance against minorities cemented in laws.Economic freedom doesn't mean \`laissez-faire'. It consists in freeing man from economic compulsion. If a man is law-abiding and willing to work, he must not be allowed to starve. Laissez-faire cannot secure this result.Mental freedom means freedom of opinion, free discussion, free inquiry and free speculation. Education should promote the courage of dissent and free inquiry, and should combat the forces of militant ignorance.ScienceScience in itself is ethically neutral. It confers power, but for evil as much as for good. It has always had an intimate and sinister connection with war. If one wishes to exterminate the human race, it will show one how to do it. But, if Pythagoras, Galileo and James Watt had not existed, daily life would be profoundly different from what it is.War and peaceMilitarists have often been able to achieve their aims. History is a long series of imperialist conquests. Today, some who profess democracy admit that total war might end in total death. They are prepared to see the human race destroy itself rather than forgo the pleasures of fanaticism.But, wouldn't it be better, instead of producing heaps of weapons of mass destruction, to lessen the load of poverty and malnutrition and to invest in real innovations in order to make the world happier?Mankind and hopeMankind descends from progenitors who exterminated their enemies, occupied their lands and grew rich. Man's most effective ferocity is directed against his own species.But, B. Russell never lost hope: mankind can prosper and create a happy world, but only by unswerving courage in the pursuit of the truth, his shining goddess.Dangerous ideaB. Russell wants to install a world government with a monopoly for all armed forces.As K. Jaspers has said, \`a world government with centralized power over the whole globe, holding the monopoly of all means of violence unchecked and uncontrolled by other sovereign powers, is not only a nightmare of tyranny, but also the end of all political life.'This formidable book, written by a superb free and independent mind, contains also incisive sarcastic satires and brilliant parables.A must read, certainly for all B.

The book is set up like a novel, with chapters and subheadings, a straight-line narration, and a cast of characters. Neruda's communist ideology is visible throughout the work and is a major theme. Canto General leaves the reader with an interesting impression of American history seen through the eyes of the impoversihed people of South America, as well as an idea of how third-world communists perceive reality.

Obviously the book is a reflection of Neruda's left wing inclination, but that only adds to the book.In Chile and other parts of Latin America this book is called &quot;The American Bible&quot; and it truly is. Along with Residencia en la Tierra, it is probably Neruda's finest.

I remember being very impressed with it way back then, so re-reading it now - in my early thirties - was an experience.I've read all the Gord the Rogue books by New Infinities, but never read the Greyhawk Adventures books released under TSR. Despite - or perhaps because of - this, I was able to enjoy this book on its own merits.And really... well, it's not bad. If you've been a gamer for a long time, it's a sterling example of what a good D&D; novel should be like. Gary did a good job here - at least for the first portion.As far as chronology goes, the Gord the Rogue series is a mess. I'd put the first parts of this book first, followed by the stories in Night Arrant, then back to the remainder of this book, then on to Sea of Death, and onwards to Come Endless Darkness and (if you must) Dance of Demons.Gary's at his best when talking about Gord's childhood and earlier exploits. Things fall apart a little bit once he gets to the Shadowrealm, but it's still a fun read. The last 30 or so pages, however, are a hot mess. The chess metaphors get excruciating (even to the point of including a *lengthy footnote* explaining a chess variant), everything is written in an indirect way without names, and all in all it just gets crazy. Until, at the end, a character important for Come Endless Darkness is introduced. It's like Gary tried to cram as much as possible into the end in order to bridge the gap between Sea of Death and Come Endless Darkness.Regardless, it's still a fun, pulpy read after all these years."},{"Title":"City of Hawks (Gord the Rogue, Book 3)","review":"If you love Greyhawk, you will love the Gord books - period. There is only one exception, and that is &quot;City of Hawks&quot;.Gary Gygax tried to change the background of the Gord-stories in mid-stride. What originally (in Saga of Old City) seemed to be fate or cunning of the hero is now &quot;unmasked&quot; to be meddling of powers.It is obvious that these developments are NOT what EGG originally intended. There are major breaks in continuity and outright contradictions. In the context of the Gord-story, this book had best not been written. Anyway, since the rest of the books is 4 to 5-star reading, and since everyone owning the other books also has this one, there is just one advice: Read this one last (after Dance of Demons), so as to not spoil the storyline."},{"Title":"City of Hawks (Gord the Rogue, Book 3)","review":"this book goes all over the place. The novel is Gary Gygax trying to explain who Gord the Rogue is by showing you his early childhood and the events that happen about him, some of which are behind the scenes. The deeper you get into it the more details, some very vague details about other characters and other events, are tossed at you. The book is not the first in the series and you should not read it till either you are finished or almost finished with both the Greyhawk Adventures series and the Gord The Rogue series (which seems to be a spin off)."},{"Title":"City of Hawks (Gord the Rogue, Book 3)","review":"City of Hawks is intended to be read at about the same place as its numeration in the series would imply, not at the end as another reviewer suggested.This book introduces the character of Gravestone, who becomes central in Come Endless Darkness. Also, the book contains a story ( depicted on the cover ) introducing the sword from the Plane of Shadows which later becomes part of Courflamme. As a more minor example, the reference to the Blademaster in Come Endless Darkness is seemingly a callback to a part of City of Hawks. Thus, this book is intended to be read before both Come Endless Darkness and Dance of Demons.The book itself may be the weakest of its series; the character of Bru is a blatant retcon, and both short story collections in this series are uneven. However, the sections on Gravestone and the Plane of Shadows, along with a chapter in which Gord invades a temple of Nerull, are the highlights of this installment."},{"Title":"Baby's Animal Friends (A Chunky Book(R))","review":"This book just goes to show that you don't have to spend a lot on expensive items in order to make your child happy!

Matt teaches the way to tighten, and more importantly strengthen your abs through the method of deep breathing, squeezing and flexing.I lost 5 sizes in my waistline and over 40 lbs. exercising and using Matt's techniques."},{"Title":"Combat Abs: 50 Fat-Burning Exercises That Build Lean, Powerful and Punch-Proof Abs","review":"In Combat abs, Auther Matt Furey focuses on 50 exercises that are done with almost no equipment other than your own body. Many of these are isometric but all focus on building firmer, stronger abdominals. The exercises are broken down into beginner, intermediate and advanced and the book starts with The Magnificent Seven, a series of basic exercises which the auther suggests you do to start each day. The strong points of the book are the exercises, most of which can be done in your own home without special equipment. Some of the advanced exercises use special equipment. There is a lot of self propaganda in the book where people rave about how Furey changed their lives, and the author hawks some of his other products. He also gives you a list of things not to eat but he is not a nutritional expert and should not do this."},{"Title":"Combat Abs: 50 Fat-Burning Exercises That Build Lean, Powerful and Punch-Proof Abs","review":"Where do I start clawing this book apart.

I recommend Ross Training 100x over this worthless garbage.

In the beginning, the heroine is portrayed as so innocent, pure and good it sets your teeth on edge. Despite being completely sheltered and totally unprepared to rule, Meriel miraculously develops into a supposedly strong charcter. This is spoiled by her spending most of her time bemoaning her fate and waiting for rescue. The hero Gage, beyond being handsome and sexy comes across as self centered and borish and not in a particularly forgivable or interesting way.Their interaction with their child was written like a plot convenience. As a mother, I was left wondering if the author has ever been exposed to small children. Mostly, I felt the characters were poorly developed, and the science fiction/fantasy portion of the story was poorly conceived.I am a long time fan of science fiction and romance, it's been a joy to discover this genre, but I am finding that a great many fall into the terrible 1970's 'bodice ripper' trap. No convincing or engaging charcters no real plot and poorly developed story lines -- just an excuse to right steamy sex scenes. Love scenes are fun to read, but it takes more to make a great story! In a word this one was disappointing, but okay if you are sick of some the poorly written and unbelievable time travel stuff."},{"Title":"Firestar (Love Spell)","review":"If you are a brainless reader who just accepts whatever an author writes without thinking too hard, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you actually think about what you're reading, you'll be amazed at the numerous contradictions in what passes for a plot in this substandard fare.CAUTION: SPOILERS!The characters are stupid & unlikeable. The hero is supposedly so bitter about his mother that he can't trust women, yet he believes everything the women tell him, even when it's an obvious lie. He's sent on a dangerous, important mission, then gets drunk & is captured by slavers. (Maybe if the slavers had slipped him a mickey, it would've been believable, but instead he \\"imbibed one mug of Moracan ale too many\\": just the guy I'd choose for undercover espionage...not!)The heroine's queen-bitch mother knows her planet's sun is dying, but cuts herself off from her allies, which isn't logical when the planet needs to be evacuated. The dying sun is somehow making the noblemen impotent, but after \\"seventy or eighty cycles...the affliction is beginning to affect (sic) them all\\" (meaning the non-nobility), so the queen has off-worlders kidnapped to use as breeding slaves. Huh? If you've still got fertile males on the planet, why not get them to donate sperm, instead of giving your virgin daughters to captive breeders? And why are only the nobles effected for so long?Later, the hero throws the newly crowned heroine's 'beloved soul-mate' husband - this according to HER private thoughts! - into a cell, takes her baby & tells her if she doesn't have sex with him, he'll make her entire planet suffer...sounds like rape to me, but according to the author, since she consents under duress, it isn't! Sorry, but a rapist isn't my idea of a hero.The heroine, after about 3 days of being called a liar & treated like crap, decides she's always loved him (even though they only spent a few hours together, years before). Frankly, I saw her as an common adulteress, not someone I could empathize with or like. The hero assures her that she's smart, but despite knowing alien mind-slaving parasites are taking over her people, when her bodyguard suddenly doesn't understand the simple concept of 'play', this woman doesn't suspect he's been taken over. And after years of enslaving others, she's outraged when her parasite-invaded husband tells her the hero intends to enslave their people, so she's a hypocrite, as well. (And no, she never notices the changes in her husband after he's invaded, either!)The alien villains seem to have no real motivation; they're just trying to take over the universe for no good reason, and their plan makes no sense. First, they want to kill the hero because he's evacuating people to a planet they don't want, then they decide they want to go there anyway, but they still want to kill him. The main characters can't figure out how the aliens are enslaving sleeping people's minds, until one merely sneaks into the heroine's bedroom & tries to insert one into her head. Sorry, but how could they NOT figure that out, especially since the author already made a point of how the entire palace is being watched on security cameras? And once the hero realizes the danger, the only person who's guarded is the queen. Yeah, I'd assign him as Lord Commander of Imperium Forces, if I were in control!I gave up about halfway through the book. This author doesn't seem to bother with basic research into science, medicine, etc. (The sun is red, which is a cool star, but the author claims the temperature is rising!) She also seems unaware of the old writer's adage, \\"Show, don't tell.\\" Her plotting is haphazard, her characters psychologically unrealistic, and her writing is choppy, plodding, and immature. I was extremely disappointed by this book, on every level.I realize the romance genre isn't meant to be intellectually stimulating, but it shouldn't be insultingly stupid, either. There's no reason why a futuristic love story can't have a logical plot, realistic characters, and be reasonably well-written...and there are plenty of good romance novels out there. This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Firestar (Love Spell)","review":"I have read previous books y Ms. Morgan and was really disappointed with this particular one.

I have to admit the beginning wasn't that great - the couple falls in \\"love\\" really quickly and unrealistically - and I almost put it down. But I stuck it out and I was really glad I did! I don't think Gage is not \\"self-centered\\" or \\"boorish\\" as \\"A Reader\\" says. He has some serious problems in his past to overcome and sacrifices himself over and over again to protect those he loves. He and Meriel both grow over the course of the story. \\"A Reader\\" has also stated that Mariel's growth is unbelievable - I completely disagree. I also disagree with the statement that she sits around moaning and waiting to be rescued. She saves Gage's life and then insists twice on going on dangerous missions with him picking up a blaster and knife to do so. The only point I have to concede to \\"A Reader\\" are the scenes with Kieran, their son - those are pretty unbelievably written. But over all I think this is a much better book than the other reviewers have given it credit for. It is certainly not the \\"bodice ripper\\" that, again \\"A Reader\\" [sorry but she's the only one that had actual criticism!!] accuses it of being.

I read the reviews - which I now conclude we written by the author or her family under different aliases.There is a section in the book where the author suggests to confront bullies not by being more mature than them; but rather sinking to their level of name calling and intimidation. SHe justifies this by saying \\"bullying is illegal and the police do not use gentle means to catch criminals; nor should we when confronting bullies...\\" Here's the problem, the bullies, by nature, are meaner than out kids. We don't want our kids to be meaner than the bullies - to \\"win\\" a tthe bullying fame. Seriously, the author includes the following actual exchange in this book as an example of how to confront a bully in a section called \\"master the witty comeback\\": \\"When they call you \\"Skinny,\\" call them \\"Fatso.\\"\\"Are you kidding me? Aside from violating a state law (at least in my state), this is actual instruction in discrimination and bullying behavior and the encouragement to go ahead and do it.

(YAY!)[1-VOL REVIEW]Trigun Maximum isn't so much a new series, as it is a continuation of an already popular manga in the US. Yep, America loves it, and Japan wants to forget it(hey, facts are facts). From this point on, the things you knew from the anime series is completely different with this one; it parallels itself from that counterpart. I mean, come on, look at the black sides from Vash's hair in the book cover; IT'S DIFFERENT! With its new physique, expect some additions and differences onto this new adventure: new companions, new enemies, and from this manga ongoing, Nicholas D. Wolfwood doesn't die...hopefully.The parallel thing doesn't start, yet. The first volume pretty much covers episodes 18-20 of the anime series, which is Vash leading a new life with a new identity as he lives with a young girl named Lina and her granny, but after being forced to bark like a dog in the nude by those sasafrassin' baddies and later got into a bullet blitz with Nick Wolf on his side, he realized he can't avoid what he is, so Vash the Stampede was reborn and left the caring ones behind to avoid harm. Enter the two stoogettes, Meryl and Millie, plus the conflict on the kidnapping and family vengence, and it's the whole celebro hoo-ha. There's only some key differences between this and the anime, i.e. Vash getting his new outfit during the feud chapter instead of the flying ship episode from the anime and this manga actually took place two years after the Fifth Moon instead of the five years in the anime, but other than those, I can only assume the true parallel act can happen in the second volume.This is actually my first Trigun manga ever bought. I would like to buy the first two 300-page volumes, but I've seen the whole anime as it is, so why read the chapters originated for the ones I've already seen? That, and plus I don't want to pay five extra dollars more than the average TOKYOPOP manga for each volume(yea, I'm a cheapskate). Thankfully, Dark Horse made the TM series more accesible by making it cheaper, while keeping the same format and quality as the last two. In other words, the sound effects remains untranslated, and strangely, the honorifics are there as well. Not to be biased with the honorifics, if its there, it means that Digital Manga is doing great with the translations, but I don't recall ever seeing or reading a western medium where someone called the superior &quot;sempai.&quot; It's just weird, that's all.Some guy isn't kidding when he warn me about the art style of the manga, and I should've heed his words, cause that's the manga's biggest flaw. Trigun Maximum is VERY SKETCHY. I've read manga with sketchy designs before, but this is the creme de la crop. Characters are angled and not that detailed and polished, even some of their clothes are just scribbled in. And the panels within are so messy, even if they're big, I can't determined what's happening; like in one panel for example, and I was thinking, &quot;What the-? Is someone playing paintball or are those gunshot wounds? WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?!!&quot; That's the reaction I have with this design, and it made me lose track from fluently guiding through the whole story. Although the design does provide a positive message to future comic book artists: &quot;Kids, you can draw as crappy as this, and you can still make a lot of money on your work.&quot;Trigun Maximum is a great way to continue what's already a funny and stylized action series, and make it a little different by its looks. The messy art style alone prevents me from giving it a perfect grade, but it doesn't destroy what's good about this series, either. If you bought the other Trigun books, you probably have one in your hands right now, but if you haven't read the first two volumes, and have seen the entire anime series, Trigun Maximum is a perfect start to continue along this seemingly fun westerner. I Reckon'men'd this here book."},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum Volume 1: Hero Returns","review":"Short review-Dark Horse is doing an excellent job on their translations for Trigun. All honorifics are left in.About the actual content- This volume's mostly filler, following the fifth moon incident. Wolfwood's huge cross is revealed to be a machine gun, and Vash is still a god with his revolver. The art is pretty sketchy, but I still love Nightow-san's syle.Also, there's been some talk about Vash's 'new' look. Most Americans have seen the anime, in which he keeps his original look the entire time, before reading the original manga, in which Vash's look abruptly changes in Maximum. Vash's new coat is a little crazy looking, but/so it fits Vash's personality a bit more. What's more, does it really matter what Vash looks like?

But the heart of the story lies in differences between Vash and the traveling holy man, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, especially when it comes to taking a life. This omnibus sheds more light on the subject, and puts both gunmen in character making or breaking situations.Nightow's art is just as good as I remember it from the original Trigun manga. Other positives for this omnibus? This book is huge! For the price of 19.99, you get over 500 pages of Trigun goodness, all ready to be read and devoured. This is the perfect time to get in on one of the best mangas on the planet, and Dark Horse makes it extremely affordable.I don't really have anything bad to say about this collection. Sure, at times, chapters can drag on a little, but it is well worth it for the titanic battles we see.The Verdict: Trigun Maximum Omnibus 1 is an amazing collection, as it brings Nightow's work to the US for fans to explore. Being a huge Trigun fan, I cannot recommend this enough, it brings everything you would expect from the planet Gunsmoke. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum Volume 1: Hero Returns","review":"A good start to a return of the spikehead. Some of what is in the novel is was part of the later episodes of the anime. The art is good but not fantastic, it does capture the world well though. Buy it if you love sci fi ,westerns and characters who go out of their way to help people."},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum Volume 1: Hero Returns","review":"Trigun Maximum picks up where Trigun volume 2 left off. Story wise, we jump 2 years after the end of Trigun. However, nothing has really changed. When Vash is found the story again returns to the old \\"wild wild west\\" antics and gunfights that were the bread and butter of the old Trigun manga. So has the addition of the noun Maximum added something to this franchise?It sure did. The art style looks much better than the old Trigun. In the old Trigun the action was not drawn very well and most times I couldn't understand what I was seeing. This time the pictures are more refined and works well for the most part. The main characters all have a new and very detailed look. This might not be too obvious when looking at Vash himself, but it's amazing how the once generic looking Meryl gains a real personality in Maximum. Little new details in the story about Vash's history and body also cover for the almost slapstick fighting scenes. Dark Horse chose a better paper for Trigun Maximum than that of the old Trigun. Looking and touching the pages feels much better and the cover art is way better.That said, some of Triguns faults have transferred into Trigun Maximum. The story seems to move much faster, but the old formula of Vash getting to a town, discover that villains are corrupting it, and then save the day is getting really old. It almost appears like this volume is an entire filler. Moreover, Yasuhiro Nightow goes into great details when drawing the main characters, but backgrounds and all the other people that appear in the manga are drawn very poorly. It even gets worse in some parts: when Vash starts acting all goofy he is drawn in a comedic goofy sense (that reminds me of Bart Simpson) and remains so for a couple of pages. This goofy Vash, when coupled with the really poorly drawn people and backgrounds, made me feel this isn't even a manga but a really bad American comic. Luckily this only effects 1/8 of the manga, the rest of which looks very good. Another problem is the English translation, which can be very lacking at times. There were some pages in which I could not understand if the good people are saying a sentence, or the bad people confronting them are the ones saying it. At times a sentence is cut to fit the text bubble and becomes meaningless. Dark Horse also chose to leave some Japanese words untranslated and just transferred them to English. For example the Japanese word \\"oi!\\" was left as is without being translated into the more daily English word \\"hey!\\", and the Japanese word \\"gasha\\" stays as is instead of being translated into the English \\"rattle/ruffle\\".The book is also very short, and Dark Horse could have easily bundled it with volume 2 for this price. In the future I hope an omnibus edition of this and the next volumes appear because this volume is a little on the short side.All in all I found this manga a good buy. The story picks up, the quality of the printed paper is better, the art is much better and the jokes are still funny."},{"Title":"Mexican Churches","review":"Contiene una amplia colecci&oacute;n de fotograf&iacute;as que muestran la gran variedad y riqueza arquitect&oacute;nica de las iglesias de M&eacute;xico, algunas de las cuales son poco conocidas, y que en cierta medida deben su esplendor al sincretismo cultural hispano-ind&iacute;gena.

This blessing is a blessing for the world, since it gives us a revelation about the nature of President Smith's mission as an apostle, and later as a prophet.President Joseph Fielding Smith is the reason why I am so religious.

Begin was imprisoned in the Soviet Union's hellish gulag system accused of being a British spy while on his return to pre-state Israel he was hunted by the British colonial administration. which ruthlessly executed and tortured Jews in the Palestine Mandate with Nazi-like brutality, and was responsible for the sinking of ships-the Struma and Patria carrying Jewish refugees, including many children, from Nazism..Begin's family were murdered by the Nazis, and he resented Germany as a result for the rest of his life.This book cover Begin's life as an underground guerilla fighter against British colonial rule of pre-state Israel, and his role in the War of Independence, the Altalena tragedy and the truth about the so-called Deir Yassin massacre. It describes Begin's role as leader of the opposition Herut Party for 30 years and his election as Prime Minister of Israel in the 1977 turnaround in Israeli politics. mush of the book deals with the peace process between Israel and Egypt which earned Begin and Sadat the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. It details Begin's modest personal habits and talks about his family.It is also a history of the Jews in Israel during the times of Begin, who described the relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel thus in a discussion with Sadat: \\"No Mr President, we did not take srangee land , we returned to our homeland. The link between our nation and this land is eternal. It began in the dim days of history. It has never been cut. In this land we created our culture, here our prophets prophesied...here the kings of Judah and Israel ruled. Here we became a nation. And when we were exiled from our land because of the force that was applied against us and when we were thrust far from our land., we never forgot this land even for one day. QWe longed for her.

(It was assigned in two of my MBA classes.) At just under 300 pages, it provided only a high-level overview of marketing, and in some cases, the information was stale and outdated. The illustrations and charts are also rather crude and unsophisticated and sometimes downright difficult to interpret.The only good thing was that it was quick and easy to read, but I didn't really absorb much new knowledge. As a supplement to a curriculum that uses case studies extensively (which is the recommended usage of the book), it is adequate. Each chapter concludes with a section listing Additional Readings, which are probably necessary if you want to really increase your knowledge of the subject."},{"Title":"A Preface to Marketing Management","review":"This book provides the right content for an entry level person in the marketing function or any person supporting the marketing department.

The stories with which James' regales his reader come alive on the page, with the voice of a real cowboy.Reading Lone Cowboy, is like sitting around a campfire on the range, having a cowboy tell you stories in the firelight. Added to its charm, are Will James' own original pen drawings, which make the tales spring to life, all the more.Although in reality, this is actually a work of fiction--despite what the uninformed will say, it's still well worth reading.Will James isn't the author's real name, he wasn't born in the west, but is French-Canadian, having been born in a small town outside of Montreal, Canada, in 1892. He changed his name and his place of birth (several times over) only when coming to the west. His name became Bill James, when he crossed the border into Montana, later changing it to Will James upon becoming a published author.However, don't let this knowledge put you off: James' was a real cowboy! He jumped off a train and learned his trade at the age of 15, at a working cattle ranch in western Canada. He was always interested in art, and studied at the School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and also, believe it or not, breifly attended Yale University! He also was a rodeo cowboy, a broc buster, a convicted cattle rustler (he served 15 months in a Nevada prison for it), a probable horse theif, movie stuntman, artist-illustrator and a rancher.Two of his books made it into film, including Smokey the Cowhorse, which was filmed three times--last in 1966, starring \\"Daniel Boone\\" and \\"Davy Crockket\\" TV star, Fess Parker. Will James died alone and penniless, of cirrosis of the liver, in a hospital in Hollywood CA, in 1942."},{"Title":"Lone Cowboy: My Life Story","review":"This is a favorite from childhood. It's a good novel to get a picture of what a cowboy's daily life and background were truly like in the period of U.S.history when ranches were a big part of the western scene. The sketches by James add much charm."},{"Title":"Lone Cowboy: My Life Story","review":"This is a book I read when I was about 15, and enjoyed reading it again. Basically a book for teens or young adults, the story covers Will James from childhood to adult, written exactly as if he were speaking.

He writes about the West as it was when he was a boy."},{"Title":"Fishing and Thinking","review":"Mr. Luce has done a fine job of extending the fishing metaphor into a study of life and classical philosophy.Don't let that description deter you from reading this fine book. It is accessible and thoughtful on so many levels that I frequently pick it up and open to a page at random just for the insight I can draw from that random passage.If Norman MacLean's father had put pen to paper (and if he was not as dogmatic as Norman MacLean paints him), this might have been his take on the world, fishing and morality.A great addition to any library."},{"Title":"The Paradise Trap","review":"Prequel to TONGUE OF TREASON also starring Ben Corbin. But while TOT is a rock-em sock-em military-spy tale with lots of color, grit, detail and action, here... there's not much. The two books couldn't be more different. He's in Hawaii, but might as well be anywhere for all the lack of color. There's little action: he's ambushed early on, tough-talks a guy, has one shootout (I think), then nothing until the end, which is a monumental fistfight and - that's it. The middle of the book has him shagging gorgeous women (with no juicy details) and talking tough about how tough he has it and \\"Civilians don't realize what military people go through\\" and how junkies deserve to die for selling their souls and Commies are bad and it was awful in Korea and yada yada. The amounts of heroin being smuggled are also quaint: it comes in camera film tubes. (And now it's imported by the tractor trailer load.) There's an ostensible mystery about who the kingpin is, but trust me, you won't care.

Who wouldn't want ideas on \\"living a more rewarding life?\\" The author, William Sinunu has traveled around the world looking for \\"cultural intelligence.\\"He travels to Norway and learns about simplicity, to India and learns about inner peace, and to Spain, to learn about creativity. He also keeps his eyes open when his friends travel to the United States. He studies them and asks questions and how to make your life \\"sweeter.\\"Maybe not everyone in those countries is exactly like the example he writes about, but one thing he discovers is certainly true: Some Americans rush around, wanting more, needing more...money, time, things. We can always learn from other people, other cultures. From each other.I loved that, at the end of each small story (only about 2-3 pages) he would have a quote at the bottom, or a blurb taken from psycholgists. The book was fun to read, it read very quickly, and I found myself breathing more slowly as I went.Even though it's frustrating sometimes to be seen in a certain way, as if our culture is \\"wrong\\" somehow, you can take from it what you will.

Better yet, the suggestions that Bill makes are small - sometimes we get wrapped up in the idea of making grandiose changes to our lives.

The author doesn't have an agenda for or against the American way. He simply is well-traveled enough to be able to share with us the many different ways that people around the world handle our common experiences. The stories are short (2-3 pages) and easy-to-read and are usually accompanied by a nice factoid or tidbit at the end. Like any book comprised of short vignettes, this book can lose power if one tries to read a lot of stories in one sitting. There should be no rush with this book...you sip from it to get the maximum effect."},{"Title":"Life Could Be Sweeter: 101 Great Ideas from Around the World for Living a More Rewarding Life","review":"Sometimes, a book will catch me off guard . . . such was thecase with LIFE COULD BY SWEETERby William Sinunu . . . I had never heard of it or the author before,but when browsing in a bookstore, its jacket caught myattention . . . it promised \\"the secrets to living a happier, healthier,more rewarding life\\" by learning from our neighbors around the world.That sounded good to me . . . turns out that I was not letdown . . . this was a treat to read, and I've already enjoyedsharing much of it with others.Some of the advice is basic, but we need to be remindedof it; e.g., Sinunu describes one trip he was on in this passage:\\"Oh no, not at Miss Daphne's party,\\" our hostess scolded, shaking herfinger playfully at her newfound friend. \\"All the watches come off baby.\\"Reaching toward him, she unsnapped his watch and slipped it into hispocket, then grabbed his hands and began to dance. \\"Life is to enjoy,\\"she reminded him. \\"Just laugh and let it all go. Make life a vacation.\\"I also liked how the author cited various research studies to supporthis beliefs, such as:* According to psychologist Thomas Spencer, Americans wearapproximately twenty percent of the clothes they own.* According to a study examining the effect of close relationships onhealth and well-being by University of Michigan psychologist StephanieBrown, it's better to give than receive! The study found that older adultswho do not help others are more than twice as likely to pass away asthose who do help out.* According to Psychologist Paul Rozin, Pizza Hut personal pan pizzasin Europe are approximately two-thirds the size of personal pan pizzasin the United States. According to an article in the August 14, 2004WALL STREET JOURNAL, a serving of Philadelphia Cream Cheesemarketed to U.S. consumers contains fourteen percent more caloriesthan the same size serving in Italy. A jar of Hellmann's Mayonnaisepurchased in the United Kingdom has half the saturated fat of theHellmann's sold in the United States. Kellogg's All-Bran bought inthe United States has three times the sodium as the same brand soldin Mexico. A standard beverage bottle for sodas in Europe is about halfa pint--roughly half the amount of the standard sixteen-ounce can soldin the United States. Perhaps it's no wonder that the United States hasthe highest rate of obesity in the world.Lastly, there were these other memorable tidbits that made thisbook so interesting to me--and the perfect gift to give somebody:* Running her hand along her chin, Rania said, \\"Well, I do have a fewrules that I try to remember before every purchase. I ask myself, \`Do Ireally need this? Do I really love it? Is it made well?' \\" Deep in thought,Rania went on, \\"But my cardinal rule,\\" she said, clapping her hands gentlytogether in front of her face, \\"is to always go for quality. I buy the cheapestof the best, never the best of the cheapest. That way, I spend relativelylittle on clothes, but still have a good-looking wardrobe.\\"* [at a party for friends] \\"To our friends,\\" Martine whispered as asingle tear trickled down her cheek, \\"To the family we have the luxuryof choosing. Each of you is very special to us. Thank you for joiningus tonight.\\" . . .As Eduoard grew misty-eyed, Martine reached out and took his hands.\\"Life is about cherishing and appreciating the people in our lives,\\" she saidquietly.* I remember rocking in the chair by his bedside, pleading with God to takehim now and end his suffering. Even if euthanasia had been legal in theUnited States, could I have made the decision to end his life? I cannothonestly say. I was so distraught at the time that I don't know if I wasin the proper state of mind to make such a momentous decision. Nor do Iknow what means could be used that would guarantee no pain. What I doknow is that dying does not scare me, only the potential suffering thatprecedes it.

In our Mcfast society, his stories offer opportunities and gentle challenges to be mindful of the insights we may learn from others outside of our everyday existence. In Life Could Be Sweeter, Sinunu captures the fundamental ideas of well-being and simple enjoyment, concepts many of us need to recapture in our lives."},{"Title":"Movement for Self-Healing: An Essential Resource for Anyone Seeking Wellness","review":"This marvelous handbook with an unprepossessing cover has as its source of power, a significant number of stories and anecdotesbased on the author's personal experience as a natural healer. There is no stronger force for changing and altering our lifestyle than \\"been there, experienced that\\".Schneider takes us from his early years having been born blind through wonderful tales of wry humor and astute observation of his peers and adults that shows his gifts as an intuitive healer.The book is easy to follow: divided into three parts with 17 chapters. The author vacillated between despair and hope for many years, and the force of his will, along with the inevitable mentor we have all had at times in our lives led him to open up to the world as his vision emerged. As a senior in high school,Schneider began teaching others how to recognize the equilibrium and balance that our bodies cry for as we gradually act all too often against our better angels of healthiness.Living abroad, the author continued to learn and express his own wisdom as he helped others with diseases such as polio, failing vision, back problems, arthritis, even multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. Examining the all-too-human phenomenon of \\"internal resistance to healing\\", the author uses case studies, graphic drawings, and repetitive examples to help us gain confidence that we too can alter and adopt the behavior of well-being. For example, Schneider devotes a fair amount of space to the well-known but oft overlooked Bates Method of better vision. But he does not focus on that issue with great technical reliance on medical terminology. Indeed, the value of this fine volume is that the subject matter is dealt with in common sense verbiage: \\"back problems\\" are near-universal and the mechanics are often way beyond what most people want to know. Schneider knows his subjects of body movement, natural healing with sleep and time, the use of yoga and its variants, visualization, and support from friends and compassionate healers. Einstein (or Virginia Woolf) would be quite happy with the emphatic clarity of his writing.This book will be of value to those interested in holistic health (and medicine) as well as Philosophy (mind and body issues). His commentary on ageing, breathing, body imagery, and the need to simply \\"listen\\" to ourselves may seem simple expressed in a review, but through the two-page Epilogue of his School's Education Director we come to realize that the Meir Schneider Self-Healing Method is a healthful approach of great quiet authority. The seven-page Index is an excellent tool for referencing Schneider's well laid-out and thoughtful scheme of how some 30 people came to improve their health and stay healthy.Note: a much-shortened version of this review first appeared inthe Nov/Dec issue of New Age Retailer."},{"Title":"Movement for Self-Healing: An Essential Resource for Anyone Seeking Wellness","review":"The first half of this book is Dr Schneider's account of how he got to where he is now and who he has helped and healed.

I sound like a preacher when I talk about it, my belief is so strong in how well it works. I noticed increased energy immediately after trying some of his exercises.

Ladybird has a reputation of making nice children books with great illustrations. The editions I used in Grammar school were different than this one though. I prefer the old one and wish I had kept it. It's worth a lot of money now."},{"Title":"Kings and Queens of England: Book 1","review":"Ladybird history books are social history at it's best, from; I would estimate ages 8 to 14 for school use of simply to enjoy. They bring history alive for children, and are filled with fascinating information. As well as bringing alive an animated, exciting past, they also show how events of the past, are with us today, in so many fascinating ways.Written by L Du Garde Peach, with superb illustrations by Frank Hampson which really bring mediaeval England to life, and first published in 1968 by Ladybird, this book should be a treasure for any child interested in history.The reigns of kings and queens in this book cover more than six hundred years, from the accession of Saxon King Alfred to the death of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth.It would require a large history book to tell in detail, all the things which happened in England during these six hundred years, wars, revolutions, struggles between kings and parliament, treaties and alliances all affected the course of history. More than once England was in danger; more than once English armies occupied large areas in Europe.However, these happenings did not always affect the greatly the lives of the ordinary people of England. Most of them where farmers, living far from such little towns as then existed. Here and there some village lad would come back with stories of the French wars, or some wandering peddler of Friar brought news of far- away happenings.That was all the people living in the wide spaces of the countryside knew of the world beyond. Age after age the countryman was content with the life of his ancestors. Kings and queens came and went, but the ploughing and harvesting went on.It is important to remember these ages at a time when British and European-Judeo-Christian culture is being destroyed by the multi-culturalist neo-Marxist left, and the masses of Islamic and other anti-Western immigrants."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I was absolutely captivated at the start of this book and stayed up much too late reading. By just past the middle however, my interest started to wane.A very well-written book, with believable characters, but IMHO it should have been wrapped up a couple of chapters sooner.I've read many of Ms. Coulter's books and the first half of this is in my opinion one of her very best."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I read this book from the attractive title. Very shallow of me, I know, but I really, really enjoyed this book up until Taylor was introduced as a main character.It's been a few weeks since I've read it and I still think of it often. Lindsey's character is not especially memorable, but the things done to her definitely are. Sydney's character struck a cord in me and I thought, with such little development, she was a pretty well-rounded character simply by the fact that she was indeed just a shallow person. She dug her own grave, she knew it, and it distressed her. Sydney shows no remorse, and I felt such anger with her character I often just wished Lindsey would punch her square in the face! I absolutely hated her. The only time we receive any remorse on Sydney's part is near the end, when she starts to play the kindly sister just to meet her own ends. Even then, this justice wasn't dealt by Lindsey's hand.I wasn't overall very impressed with Taylor. A strong, good looking male suddenly looking out for poor Eden? In love with her within 2 days because his rape sense is tingling? Whatever. Before Taylor, Eden was the epitome of strength in women. She was MADE out of stainless steel. Only twice after Taylor's even brought into the picture do we see the backbone emerge from Lindsey/Eden, both times without Taylor around to pick up the pieces. She is a strong character and Taylor muted that in her, which is why I'm giving this review a three. I appreciate Taylor helping Eden stand up for herself, but didn't think he had to smother her so badly. Their relationship seemed just a little too perfect without many hitches, which was slightly annoying. I also HATED that Taylor got to know things about Lindsey that she didn't learn for herself, because he deemed her too weak to take the news. This woman is a survivor! She would eat that up for breakfast with a smile.Overall, besides the stain of Taylor and his buttload of bad decisions, the bittersweet ending was perfect. The story I will never forget, and Sydney, the character I will never forgive."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"This book was good enough to keep me hooked, but also left some things hanging that left me dissatisfied at the end. The story goes back and forth between the point of views, and most of the characters you wanted to just punch in the face, especially Lindsay's family. There were things that didn't make sense, characters that were never developed but should, etc. However, it did make you want to know what happens at the end. Good book, well written, but several obvious flaws."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I just love all of Catherine Coulter's books. Her suspense and FBI thrillers are the best. She really fooled me with this one. I thought I new for sure who the guilty person was, and as usual it wasn't. She fooled me again.

She neatly wraps up all of the details with a very satisfying and hard-to-predict conclusion. Coulter is one of those writers who rarely disappoints, and she hits the bullseye with this one!"},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"If you're looking for romance, look elsewhere (like Nora Roberts). This book is awful. I'm a new reader of Catherine Coulter and can honestly say, \\"Never again!\\" What irked me most was the dialogue between the characters, which was stilted, unrealistic, and .... Instead of witty repartee between them, the characters would get out all they wanted to say in one big paragraph. Exhausting! Moreover, I disliked both the hero and heroine and ended up not caring if they died at the hands of the crazed random person (aka the big bad killer).Coulter overused the line, \\"As for [insert name here],\\" which I found unbearable. The characters shifted moods so often that they seemed bipolar. And I got [mad] every time Lindsay/Eden put up with Sydney's put downs (which was quite frequent, so I was rather ill-tempered throughout the book).Yeah, so stay away from this book if you're used to more refined writing. If you don't mind that her dialogue lacks originality, the characters spew whatever brain vomit they're thinking of at the particular they're thinking it, and you actually enjoy whiny people, then, by all means, read away. Me, naw, I won't touch a Catherine Coulter book again."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I went to the States when I was 19 with my Nan to see her sister who lived in South Dakota. Personally, I thought it was utterly brain numbingly boring and would have preferred to go home to the UK. We went to some random book shop one muggy afternoon and I picked this book up. It looked good on the back and I figured I would give it a go.I read it fanatically. It took me several hours of dedicated reading and I finished it. It was amazing. I loved the whole book and all it's many literary devices. I especailly enjoyed Catherine's use of native British colloquailism that I found particularily sweet because I missed home like mad.I contacted Catherine to ask her if she had any british ties because of her use of language. She told me that her grandmother was scottish. Nuff said.This book should be made into a movie. People can identify with Lyndsay in terms of personality.

I liked it for the most part. The rape scenes didn't put me off from wanting to finish the book. Even in the FBI Series there were violent scenes (the rape and abuse of a little girl in one)and unfortunately these things do happen. What disturbed me more is the guy got away with the rape. Taylor was quite a guy. This romance was a lot of work for him. Not too many guys would have had the patience to do what he did to get Eden/Lindsey to trust him. The end was a little far fetched like Lindsey taking out 2 different attackers right after she had been hospitalized with a collasped lung and other serious injuries and then again right after she has been shot. I think probably the point here was CC wanted to portray her as no longer a victim, but still a bit unbelievable. I don't know when I've seen a nastier father or sister as 2 of the characters in this book. I kept wanting Lindsey to say enough already. All in all , it was a good read. There were many different characters throughout the book that keeps your interest."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I believe this book was one of Catherine's first attempts at Contemporary.First of all I must state that I had taken a hiatus from reading Ms. Coulters work since 1994. I'd been meaning to read this book for some time since it has been in my TBR (to be read)pile for sometime and I had heard from many different sources that this was a worth while read. I recommend that if you read the reviews on here still take a chance and read the book, I read the reviews and thought to myself it was going to be awful, but was pleasently suprised. I did not give this one a high rating because the end [was diasappointing], the plausibility of the whole Family [thing stunk]and the relationship did progress incredibly quick for someone who had been sheltered from men since she was 18 years old and then suddenly after 2 weeks of knowing someone feels so comfortable with them, to accept a proposal?????The end had so many ludicrous twist and turns it was like OH COME ON NOW!!!!! (NO SPOILERS HERE) but when you read the book you'll understand EXACTLY what I am referring to. It was a fast read and one that I didn't actually won't to put down because of the mystery that was going on but still I really just HATED the last 3 or so chapters. Didn't make any sense.Respectfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I read this book many years ago and I was happy to read it again. Coulter has a way of getting you close to her characters. Lindsey was raised by a horrible father. Always treating her like an outcast and constantly putting her down and abusing her verbally. The biggest deception and hurt happened when she was 18 years old and raped and beaten by her sister's husband. Lindsey's father blamed Lindsey and claimed to the press that she was a slut and a Lolita. Finally several years later Lindsey discovers herself. She becomes Eden a famous model and meets the man of her dreams. And now someone is out to kill her. Is it her Father, who was disinherited by his mother and gave Lindsey/Eden all the fortune, is it her old professor from college who is a crazy, is it her sister, or her sister's husband, or is it someone else who wants her dead. Good surpise at the end. This book keeps you guessing."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"This is my second Coulter book and I only read it because I had hoped, no, actually I had prayed that my first book(Devil's Embrace) was a bad example of her work, but this only intensified my opinion of her and I am a little surprised she is a New York Times Best Selling Author. I am not going to get critical of all the flaws in this book, but I will say this, romance it was, but a suspense it was not.The story is a long and drawn out portrayal of a woman who is gone from ugly duckling to supermodel. The blurb on the back of the book states it is about a woman who becomes a model and is being terrified and stalked by some maniac, but who is it? Someone from her past? What is she hiding? I will tell you, nothing...she is hiding nothing,. She is brutally attacked by her sister's husband when she is 18 in France. Her family treats her badly and her father especially hates her. They all blame her for her loser brother-in-law's brutal rape. Lindsey(the heroine) years later becomes a supermodel named Eden. She is popular and is beginning to get on with her life until her sister comes back into it to stir the pot. Somewhere in here (I assume) Coulter was trying to bring some tension and suspense into the story by adding the hero of S.C Taylor, Lindsey's bodyguard. For what, I'm not sure, Coulter never makes that clear either. After some unnecessary chapters where nothing happens but Taylor falling for her, the story gets off-track and you're not sure where the stalker is or if there IS one at all.Taylor must sort through her messy past and try and win her trust, while keeping her meddling family at bay. He succeeds and then by the last 10 pages or so, the stalker is revealed and I was left wondering,....why?This story was lacking in true suspense and it was choppy to the point of not understanding what the plot was. If you like a good romance, this was ok, but I would steer clear if you're looking for a good romantic suspense story, it is poorly written in that department..."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I have reached page 94 of this book and already two horrific rapes have occurred.

Beware those who cannot stomach rapes scenes."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I often see Catherine Coulter's work on bestseller lists, but never had occasion to read one of her books. This reprint was enough to convince me that I wasn't missing anything. The good news is, it's a beach read. It's quick, and you can easily put it down while you go for a swim. The bad news is, the characters are more like caricatures than real people, so a mildly interesting plot goes to waste for lack of a hero or heroine who can handle it. The unbelievable venom in every sentence spoken by Eden's father and half-sister made me laugh rather than sympathize with the heroine, because it was so theatrical. It was also poorly edited. All the people in the book tended to speak with the same mannerisms and cut-off or run-on sentences, with only two or three exceptions. The best I can say for this book is that I think it had potential. If only it had lived up to it!"},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I picked up this novel after finishing Catherine Coulter's Riptide which I thought was excellent. This novel while not bad was a very very average read. Lindsay Foxe is a supermodel with the family from hell. Her father hates her; her mother's an alcoholic; and her wicked step sister stepped right out of the Cinderella fairy tale. Lindsay has just been involved in an explosion on a set and is rushed to the hospital. At this point the novel goes back in time and you learn of all the events leading up to the explosion. The main story line is who is trying to kill her? Her family, etc. I personally though the Lindsay character was very annoying. She was one of the wealthiest girls around but did nothing to help herself heal. She took constant abuse from her family for no reason at all except she didn't have enough guts to stand up for herself, and this is our pathetic, whiny heroine. Enter the hero Taylor who is hired as her body guard, and who of course falls in love with her. He doesn't love her because she's beautiful (although she is a model who was on the cover of Elle), but because of her kick me while I'm down personality?This was an average read with an annoying heroine."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I picked up this book as a freebie. I have enjoyed Catherine Coulter's books in the past, the FBI series as well as some historical romances. This one certainly did not measure up. The story was totally implausible. Rape victim suffers for years from the trauma of her rape but in one week overcomes her fears and totally trusts the hero.The story is trite and predictable. The characters are shallow and I found that I did not really care how any of them fared. I forced myself to finish it just on the off chance that it might improve along the way. Fortunately is is a fast read."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I could not stop reading this book in the beginning. The author does write it well. However, soon it became obvious to me that the lead female character, Lindsey/Eden, would be one of those heroines who I absolutely hate - no back-bone and suffers through abuse without fighting back for far too long. She does not fight back even a little bit against her \\"perfect\\" sister whenever that female character goes over the top in her nastiness. And the rest of her family were so abusive to her that they became too unbelievable. By the end of the book when Lindsey/Eden finds somewhat of a back bone, it was too late for me to even like her. I had no empathy for her or her situation either because she was just too pitiful. I had to keep reminding myself that this book was written back when strong, kick-ass romance novel heroines were not popular. It was the only way I could get myself to finish the book.I've read other Catherine Coulter books and thank god that most of the heroines in her later novels are strong women, funny and more often than not, demand respect from everyone. So unless you want to get really annoyed at the female heroine of a romance novel, I suggest reading this author's later books."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I've read numerous Coulter books in the last several years.

But when I read the synopsis, I was delightfully surprised to learn that it centered around a terribly isolated and victimized woman named Eden. If you want to sympathize and even emphathize with all the trials and tribulations of an oppressed female character, and yet simultaneously delve into the superficial world of modeling and the upper crust society in general, then I highly suggest this book.

The characters in the book were believable and well written. You could picture the characters and their behaviors went along with the way they were displayed throughout the novel. I hated Royce Foxe as a character but couldn't help but admire the way Ms. Coulter wrote about him. The novel is written well and made you feel the emotions the characters were feeling. I almost cried at the hateful words Lindsey's father had to say about her, or when Sydney was dredging up the past. The novel showed growth in the main character Lindsey and you want to get up and applaud her on her bravery and her honesty about her feelings. You also want to sigh when Taylor comes into the picture and makes her feel things she has never felt before. I know I would feel exactly like her if something like that ever happened to me. Taylor was an interesting character and I wholeheartedly loved him. He was an excellent edition to the novel and he made it worth reading. Lindsey and him was an unlikely pair but you could see them together in the future. It was clever of Ms. Coulter to put Taylor in the hospital at the same time. It was interesting to see where that would fit in to the rest of the book. All in all this was an excellent novel. I would recommend it to just about anybody. The graphic rape scene might put some people off but other than that being an avid reader I couldn't find any other faults in the novel."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"The first novel I read by Coulter was impulse, and I thought that it was a great suspense book. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development. Therefore I decided to read her others and particularly enjoyed Beyond Eden. While I am an avid fan of suspense novels, the romance in the story was quite touching. I have had the tendency to shy away from typical romance novels, but the hero was very refreshing. If you are looking to read about a great guy- a guy any woman would fall for, Taylor is it. This book offered more romance than suspense, but it was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely read her other novels."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"For some reason I have avoided Ms Coulter's earlier contemporaries. I am pretty sure it has something to do with my not being a fan of her earlier historicals, but I am an avid fan of her newer FBI series. However, BEYOND EDEN surprised me by being classic Coulter. A very entertaining, poignant, and humorous read. There is a very graphic rape scene, but it sets up the book and is quite necessary for the plot. You heal along with the heroine as she finds a life where she finally fits in and someone who wants her just as she is. Taylor, the hero, is just that. A perfect foil for Lyndsay and a prime example of one of Coulter's better heroes.The mystery is a very good one that kept me guessing the whole time. A regular whodunnit. I highly recommend this book to Coulter fans, old and new. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"This is the first book I read by Catherine Coulter... I borrowed it from a room mate, and now I'm reading more of Coulter's books. I thought the story really evoked emotions from the reader... you get very angry at Linday's family, and you feel so envious of Lindsay because she has Taylor... what a great guy. The romance is tasteful, and I think he's the kind of man every girl is looking for. Other readers were put off by the rapes in this book, but it part of the story and is what forms the characters and their actions."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I have just finished this book for A school project. When I first saw this book I thought it would be a bore like most of the ones I see around my house, but it turned out to be the best story I have read since Where The Heart Is. It has it's moments but other then a few pages It is miraculous and well writen. Must read and should be on the best sellers list."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"One of my roommates was going on and on about how great this book was and how she couldn't put it down. So it floated around our apartment for a while and two more of us read it. However, the 2 of us have come to an agreement that she must have been crazy when she said this was a good book. This book was completely unrealistic, confusing, boring, and had absolutely the worst characters ever. I especially didn't like the story being told from 2 different POV's. Both Eden and Taylor sounded identical in Coulter's attempt to give another dimension to the story. My biggest problem was that Taylor was BORING!! He's supposed to be the man who eventually earns Eden's trust?? If I were her, I'd run away. He's insensitive and uncompassionate and not even likeable. It's my understanding that you're actually supposed to like the hero in romance novels and actually want the heroine to get together with him at the end. This was not the case at all. And i loved how Taylor knew that Eden was terrified of men, and the first thing he does is strip down naked and get into bed with her. What a way to be sensitive. I couldn't believe this book! I hated how it jumped back and forth between characters and times. That was completely unnecessary and could have been told better if it just ran straight from beginning to end with one narrator. Coulter's attempt at creativity just resulted in a lot of headache and confusion. The story was incredibly slow and at the end, it seemed like there was a rush to finish, which resulted in not a particularly well-written ending. And I shouldnt even start with Eden. She was much to cynical, and she was abused over and over and over again-we get the picture. None of the characters had any depth to them and could not be related to in any way. Also the &quot;bad guy&quot; was some random person, like Coulter tried to add a twist at the end but failed miserably. Mysteries are supposed to allow you to figure out who the antagonist is, but that can't be done in this book b/c he only makes a cameo appearance once or twice at the beginning. True, I couldnt' put the book down, but it was just so that I could see if there was some redeeming quality at the end; there wasn't."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"When Lindsay Foxe's brother-in-law rapes her, at first I was shocked, then I got angry at both him and Lindsay's sister.

Her fiancee Taylor is trying to find out who and stop them. There is a lot of backstory in this novel, as we go back in time to see Lindsay as a teenager and the brutal crime that takes place when she is very young. As a result, her family has more or less turned their backs on her.I found this novel to have me on the edge of my seat and turning pages quickly. I hated almost every character except Lindsay and Taylor. There were times when it seemed that maybe Lindsay had allowed herself to be trampled on, however, that did not take away from the overall storyline."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"&quot;Beyond Eden&quot; is a fabulous book. The emotion I felt for the characters was bone deep. Taylor and Lindsey were two mismatched characters that found acceptance in eachother's embrace.Lindsey(Eden) was an affection depraved, naive teenager taken advantage of by a cruel brother-in-law, hated by her half sister, and despised by her own father. She found protection behind a false identity and aloof facade. She had things settled..until Taylor happened in.S.C Taylor was a perfect candidate for Eden. He was compassionate and loving to Lindsey as herself, but also solid and steady for Eden, her model persona. He showed her a side of herself she thought she had lost a long time ago and a love so potent that she just couldn't escape.I have already recommended this book to friends, but I didn't borrow my copy out for worry of wanting to read it again and not having it on hand."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"According to Amazon: Amazon Bestsellers lists are updated hourly.

Strange.The legal stuff was beyond stupid, made no sense.How to protecdt Lindsay after she gets the money....hmm what to do? She could just write a will leaving all the money to PETA if she is killed that would stop her family... OR she could just marry Taylor. Of course if the killer was her family hoping to get the money the could just as well kill both of them... Stupid.Do not get this book even if it is free. Do not pay any money for this book.My goodness it was bad, bad, bad."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"When I opened up \\"Beyond Eden\\" to begin reading I was expecting a romantic suspense/thriller as it had been categorized. It was heavier on the romance and not so much the suspense, but I think even those expecting a lot of suspense couldn't be disappointed in this book (although I see there have been a few negative reviews surprisingly). It was absolutely wonderful in my opinion.The format is just slightly different in that it begins in the present day but then goes back in time to when Lindsay Foxe was about 16 and then a couple years later when she was 18, the time where she was brutally raped by an Italian prince who just happened to be her half-sister's husband. This is a graphic scene but necessary for the overall story. We also learn about Taylor, the hero, and how he ties in to the story even then in these background chapters. The story continues through the years until again we reach present time (althought not until 300+ pages into the book [paperback edition]) where the story had originally begun.Without giving away any spoilers, I will just say that is an incredibly touching and poignant journey of a woman as she tries to come to grips with her past and the brutality at the hands of someone she thought she admired and could trust, and on top of everything, being told she was the one at fault. Through this journey she finds strength to stand up to the family that has tried to keep her down and finds love with Taylor, a man originally hired to protect her and a man she eventually comes to trust and love and know wouldn't hurt her for anything. When they finally make love, it was very passionate and beautiful. These two characters were meant to be together and it's hard not to fall in love with them. This is definitely a story I will read again."},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"This was the first Catherine Coulter book that I have read. It was easy to get hooked. There were many twists and turns that kept me wondering. I loved Taylor. What a guy. Isn't this who we all want? I was very pleased and surprised with this book. I love finding a new author to explore!"},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"Once again Catherine comes thru with an extraordinary story that builds to a climax that the reader will certainly appreciate when it finally ends. She is a master at mystery writing and combines just enough interesting-type romance to make the story exciting and suspenseful."},{"Title":"And Now the Story Lives Inside You","review":"Much of the poetry in this book has a haiku-like quality, not in its form but in its style. Elizabeth Reninger's poetry can be read as both a meditation on a moment in nature, beautiful and complete in itself, but also where the elements of nature spontaneously suggest a more transcendent truth. Each poem is finely crafted while maintaining an ephemeral quality, something fully present yet fleeting. There is an inherent mysticism in these poems; they express a deep sense of stillness that resolves into pure awareness. Beautiful and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"And Now the Story Lives Inside You","review":"The 61 poems in this remarkable collection represent fine brush work indeed. They bring us the realism of the natural world as only a careful observer might see it merged with the magic of each encounter with rock and wolf and leaf as only a seeker on the path of mysteries might tell the story."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"When I was looking for a new series to read, Stardoc caught my attention. The story of a juniour doctor escaping 'her father' by fleeing offworld seemed ineresting. Ive since gone through the series and the books have steadily gotten worse and worse.The problem is quite frankly the plot. The basic idea is ok but the fault with this book, is that Cherijo is too....perfect. She always does the right thing, no matter how improble the choise. She is up against a mad scientist, an evil game, a backwards community and an incompetant doctor. None have any redeeming features at all.I just can't handle it because I can't see anyone being so perfect in a saddistic world like this.The only reason that I carried on reading is because it is an unusual take on the world. Every other book has the human race as the good guys and are loved by all others.I am thinking VERY hard about whether I will get the next one."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Can you say &quot;had to get a book in at deadline?&quot; This book is terrible. The &quot;Shockball&quot; that graces the title plays only a minor role in the book, and is nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse for the author to vent her hatred and misunderstanding of contact sports. The rules of the game are never explained, yet the main character rails against the &quot;evils&quot; and &quot;testosterone-stoked mindlessness&quot; of contact sports. It seems obvious Ms. Veihl has never even played an organized sport, let alone tried to understand the concept of one.The book is full of love triangles that are supposed to be shocking, yet the reader has no lead-up to who might love who. Characters constantly stray from their motivations, and the author changes character orientation at will in order to &quot;surprise&quot; you with another twist or turn. This reads like a poorly written eight grade melodrama.And, if you last long enough to read the ending, the author reveals that not only is she oblivious to the purpose of sports, she's oblivious to the concept of rules, scoring, and personnel. The dues ex machina at game's end staggered my ability to comprehend that not only did the author have to think this made sense, but so did test-readers and the editors."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Not as great as the previous books in the series. However, still well written and very interesting. The main characters seem to still be having problems communicating with each other to keep their marriage happy, but they compliment each other.

(i.e. Conversations in a resturant around them or in passing, ad on some sort of space ship TV.)All-in-all, I highly recommend this entire series!

However, her joy turns to sadness when she learns her cloned body's immunity system is killing the baby. Before she informs her husband she has a miscarriage. Cherijo knows she can never birth a child with anyone except perhaps her demented creator Joseph Grey Veil.While Cherijo recovers, a meteor shower disables the Perptua beyond repair. Transferring to their other ship Truman may mean that Cherijo's creator who gave her that spacecraft may be able to track them via some undetected device. Soon the duo is forced to go underground to live among half-breeds. Duncan has no choice but to participate in the local version of SHOCKBALL even as Cherijo now knows you can hide, but at some time you must fight especially when the cause is personal.SHOCKBALL, the fourth Stardoc tale, is an exhilarating science fiction space adventure. The zestful story line stays at warp speed even when introducing new readers to the lead characters. Cherijo is as fresh as ever as she undergoes new heartaches while her spouse has his own problems. Fans of futuristic outer space novels will want to take off with this tale and the three previous Stardoc books as all four stories take the audience where they rarely have been before.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this one. I have all of her books and have enjoyed this one almost as much as her first. The other two were a little violent for me, but her characters draw a reader into the world that the author has created. I feel this writer is very gifted and will continue buying and keeping her books, but would request a little more bonding with husband, child, family, a little less violence. Our real world has enough of it, I really don't care to read alot of it. I use books to escape the real world and go into one that is full of fun, life, fantasy, magic and a bit of unreality thrown in. people do usually read book, watch movies,etc to escape the things they don't or can't deal with at the moment. books, movies, etc help people deal with the crazy world we live in and we are very thankful for people like this author who can help us with this goal."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"The book description gives the plot so I mostly wanted to add my rating to the overall score.This series became progressively darker and this one was one of the better ones for me. I felt the true mystery of Cherijo's past is largely revealed here and it's not very pleasant. Earth and Duncan's obsession with Shockball (like future football of some kind) added the only levity, I think.That said, their captivity and the darker aspects were rather depressing and rather won out over interesting."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Once again Dr. Healer, Cherijo Torin, has slipped from the hands of his father, Joseph Grey Veil. The Jorenian house clan Torin, her house clan, come to a rescue with renewed starship Sunlace. She may finally settle down with his husband, Duncan Reeves, the mystical telepath who was forced to treat Cherijo steel cold in the caves of Hsktsk prison planet. All is now forgotten and forgiven and they are having their first baby together. But her body is rejecting the fetus and she don't know how to tell Duncan about it. Her father has left his goodbye and promised not to interfere with her life any more. In an accident the Sunlance and Duncan's ship are damaged and they are forced to evaluate gift from Cherijo's creator: the beautiful ship her father left for them. They should have known better. Joseph Grey Veil never gives up to claim what is his; the genetic experiment Cherijo Torin. The new ship is a trap and the Allied League transports her back to the Terra. The truth about his birth and plans of his father are starting to open up, and there is no room for his husband Duncan. His father insist of her becoming...After escape from Terra to explore diversity of alien cultures in planet K-2 inStardoc book 1, theBeyond Varallan book 2jumped to explore blue colored Jorean aliens in a starship. InEndurance book 3it was the turn of feared slave trader reptilians of Hsktsk Faction. In this book 4, the circle is completed back to the Terra and we take a look at renegade band of half-breed Indian natives who resemble Navajo. Cherijo is miracuously rescued by the tribe from her father and Duncan is forced to participate in a brutal shockball contest. It is disappointing to have to read about Native Americans because the aliens in other books were so much more interestig. The events flow predictive paths of macho ideals, chief pow-wow and shaman spirits. With all the advancements in earth, superior genetic manipulation and technological anvances, it is a too big of a gulp to believe that underground reservates can still exist in Terra. The supposed xenophobic background in Terra, somewhat arian-purity mentality, has difficulties to carry to cover it all. To learn that Cherijo has brother(s) was a good start but making one of them beserk and another experiment of her father fades into the Navajo background. The tension of the series is diminished further as the major political figure, Cherijo's father Joseph Gray Veil, who kept the strings in a high tension from book to book, meets his final destiny. In a blatant scene he is put playing a \\"good father\\" and surprisingly stripped off the sinister vulture aura he had accumulated. Bringing back an unlikeable character, the smuggler pilot Dhreen, to explain that all the huge betrayal he did was simply a mistake and forgivable, is a turn that we halfheartedly read. These are more a averse diversions than exiting turns. As usual, the ending drops cookie crumbles to lead the reader anticipate what his mysterious subconsious, Maggie the Mother, is all about in next book.Two (2) stars. Written in 2001 this is the book 4 in the stardoc series that follows life of female Dr Cherijo Torin, the genetic experiment and clone manufactured by his Father. The encounter with her father, Joseph Gray Veil, is a masterpiece. The prospect of things turning ugly give high expectations right from the beginning. The plans of her father are devious, startling and troubling to think about. Cherijo's destiny doesn't look bright at all with this monster. But then a sudden Indian tribe rescue, a rampage on her father's premises, his lab, is difficult to digest because everything in Terra is supposed to be high tech; security included. The dark childhood events of her brother, child molestation and rape, give chills but may push the tolerance of readers to the edge. It is a little worrying to see that the writer likes to rewrite dislikeable characters into \\"good guys\\", like Josepth Grey Veil, Dhreen and in part Duncan Reeves (see book 3). This make the books to feel scripted. The enermous potential of the encounter with her Father, revealings her past, fighting for her rights, would have been a jackpot. A whole book could have been dedicated to include politics to see Cherijo fight in World Court to get her non-sentient status lifted. But no. The setting of Cherijo being as Lab Rat is discarded in favor of \\"out in the wild and nature\\". Saddness and disappointment of a lost oppurtunity to brought up for more mystery is what's left after you turn the last page."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"I have loved all the books in this series. I would compare this series with the Sector General books. This one has several twists that make it worth a read. Doctor Veil finds out more about her past, her parent, and her childhood friend. I must admit that I love any book that has doctors out treating aliens and zipping around to other planets. This book, for a large part takes place on Earth, but the things she finds out will answer lots of questions for the previous books. I am waiting to see what other twists and turns are in the next book!"},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Fourth book in the Stardoc series. This is a continuing story, and I very much recommend that you start with the first book, Stardoc, and read the sequels in order: Stardoc, Beyond Vallarean, Endurance, then Shockball. If you haven't, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for the first three.Again, I was a bit disappointed with Shockball, but only because the first two books were so very good. Shockball continues the adventures of Cherijo Grey Veil Torin, a genetically engineered human who is being pursued by her creator/father throughout the galaxy. After escaping the Hsktskt in Endurance, Cherijo finds herself surrendering to her father in order to keep the peace once again, but this time her husband Duncan is with her. After enduring many brutal hours of testing, she is miraculously rescued by an odd little man who takes her though miles of underground tunnels to his tribe that lives beneath the ground in caverns.Cherijo discovers she is not so much rescued as she is kidnapped by these strange people, half Indian and half alien.Again, I found this book to be a step down from the first two in the series, there are not many aliens, as Cherijo spends most of her time underground with the half breeds; and not much titillating space travel either.Dhreen re-enters her life, finding her in the tunnels and once again helping her out, though this time she trusts him much less. She also discovers that experiments A through I were not destroyed as Joseph Grey Veil had told her, and also discovers that the reason Joe has pursued her so heavily throughout the galaxy is that he intended her to be his mate all along.Cherijo patches up patients, stops another outbreak, and develops her relationship with her husband Duncan who is forced to participate in the Shockball contests and discovers he actually enjoys the physical competition. But the story seemed almost blas&eacute;, missing the mystery of the aliens and the excitement Cherijo stretching her capabilities to the fullest.I have really enjoyed this series, but I am left hoping that the fifth book brings back the old Cherijo and the old mystery and excitement that made this such a special and unique reading journey."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"On the one hand, there's a whole can of weird going on in book four, here. There's some stuff on child molestation and rape that, well, kinda makes you wonder about the author's own history in a sad sort of way. There's also some stuff in here covering Native American future-culture that seems handled strangely. And the beginning is about as predicable as it gets. (If your arch-nemesis hands you a starship to get away in... DUH!). The setting itself is rather unique, I disagree with those who say an underground setting can't be useful.Some of the characters also take some strange detours... Reever, her husband, becomes a sports nut, for instance. A break from his role as slaver in the last book.But it is one of these detours that saves the book as a whole. Througout this series, the clever settings, plot twists, good concepts and developed secondary characters have shined in spite of the main character, who is usually just a pack of one-liners and snotty God-complex. Here, she starts to show the edges of some actual depth. Perhaps some maturity may be starting to leak through. Suddenly she is less window dressing and more person, in this one.The setting and secondary characters in this one suddenly seem aimed at back-dropping this deepening in Cherijo's character. It is a pity that so many of the other characters in this story seemed to loose their depth and become one-dimensional to support her. Cherijo's father's character could have been better developed before he dies in this one, and her husband could have opened up more to her. So much could have been, in this one, but wasn't.Of them all, this is probably my least, and most, favorite, for different reasons."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"This entry in the Stardoc series plods a bit. Since for most of the storyline Cherijo &amp; Duncan are out of reach from there friends (again!) and the new characters seem very contrived, it doesn't grab your attention like the stories with the Joren's do, for example. And then it ends in a most irksome fashion, with very little actually being accomplished in the the middle 400 pages of the book and all of the major plot developments in the first and last 20 pages.On the other hand, Ms. Viehl can write, and the dialogue is snappy. So the ride, though somewhat empty, is nonetheless enjoyable."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Ok here's what you do.Go to the local book store, get a copy of this useless book and read the first couple of chapters and the last few.

Shockball is definitely a jolt, to say the least, and fans of the series should not go into this book expecting anything because trust me, you will be surprised beyond belief. The book starts out innocently enough, and for those who know the series, you won't be surprised when Joseph Grey Veil shows up to kidnap Cherijo and Duncan Reever. Been there, done that. Then they get rescued by a mysterious Indian tribe living underground and suddenly you are thrown into a turmoil of confusion and terror and nothing is what it seems. When you think the book is starting to slow down, it punches you in the face and electrifies you.Throughout this book, Stardoc series fans will learn a bunch of new strange and disturbing information about Cherijo and Joseph and you may think you know where this book is going but you have no idea. Like the previous books, Shockwall goes through some very disturbing, violent subjects, but if you could handle Endurance, than this will not be a problem. Bottom line: this book will definitely engross you."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"I admit, I am a fan of the Stardoc series. Its fast, its fun, its cheese, but its just good. So I breezed through the first three books within a weekend, but with this edition, I came to an abrupt crawl. Shockball has a very weak plot, with a few shocking secrets unveiled about Cherijo's past but that seems to be the brunt of it. Its not up to par with the usual pace in action & suspense in the previous books.After Cherijo and Reever get hauled back to Earth they're soon rescued from Joseph's mad-laboratory by a group of Navajos. Knowing how irate Cherijo gets about her only family being House Clan Torin she doesn't take the Navajo's claim as her blood kin amiably, even if she is nearly 100% Navajo herself. Well, her rescue comes with a price and the chief, Rico, takes her captive as medic for their Shockball team. Some are human hybrids who need to be fixed to look 100% human to legally play on the team. For most of the book she cures another mysterious plague. Reever gets in a few squabbles, gets enlisted in the Shockball team, and enjoys some machismo time as the suave new MVP. Rico has a queer fascination with her upbringing (quite obvious why but the brilliant Cherijo is clueless). There were no interesting new characters like Quilyp, Furreva, or Rogan. Some, like Rico's short secondhand man were mere brutes - but for no reason other than to point out how much Cherijo hates short men. Cherijo's new assistant - Hawk, a Quasimodo lookalike is very timid and quiet. In the first chapter, they visited a world of flying people so I wonder what \\"Hawk\\"'s condition is. Anyway... I lost a lot of respect for Cherijo's character in the way she views the Navajos. She frequently mocks their beliefs & traditions just like she did the Torins' attitude toward suicide and continues to carry a superiority complex about advanced society and medicine. On the other hand, I respect Viehl's characterization because it makes Cherijo that more real.Shockball had nothing to do with the story. At the end the reason why she had to deal with the whole Shockball nonsense is so ludicrous and flimsy you'll feel like you just got hit by a shockball yourself! Nevertheless, I am anticipating the next edition and hope it will be just as good as Endurance. I recommend that you read it only to find out some few things about Cherijo's past, but the whole story in of itself, leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"I LOVE S.L.

She also writes under several other names including Lynn Viehl and I love them all!She creates realistic worlds with an intriguing cast of characters who grow and develop throughout the series.

Shockball is a book that seizes you violently in its jaws, shakes you like a hyperactive terrier, and slams you against a wall several times before letting you go, leaving you confused, exhausted, exhilarated, and not quite sure what just happened to you save that it was really cool and you can't wait to do it again.Shockball is the fourth novel is S.L. Viehl's Stardoc series, and fans won't be disappointed. Cherijo's past finally catches up with her, and she and Reever are taken back to Terra, where things don't go quite as either Cherijo and Reever or Joseph Grey Veil planned.Viehl's combination of medical knowledge and imaginative extrapolation create a host of alien creatures so believable that you'd swear she'd operated on them herself. The majority of the action in Shockball takes place on xenophobic Terra, so there isn't as much xenobiology in this book, but Viehl still manages to fit in an entirely new alien species, complete with architecture and art forms, as well as giving us a disturbing look at what has happened to the human race.The appeal of the Stardoc books lies partly in the extensive worldbuilding and the medical believability, but I find that most of it is due to the characters populating the books. They are sometimes funny, sometimes annoying, and come complete with a host of strengths and weaknesses. The heroes aren't perfect. The villains aren't wholly despicable. In short, they're real. Sure, Cherijo is a genetic construct tooling around the far reaches of the galaxy, but she's real enough to be my neighbour down the hall (who I also wouldn't trust with a dermal probe when she's in a bad mood). It's very, very easy to get attached to these people.Which is when Viehl goes into maniac mode and puts them through hell so fast that you have no choice but to hang on for the ride and hope you make it through. She's an expert at distracting you with something bright and shiny so that you don't see the punch coming until you're flat on your back. Viehl isn't content to wrap everything up in a neat little package for the reader, so the Stardoc series consists of a number of deftly-woven threads which connect each book and may come back to haunt you at any time. No one is safe, nothing is sacred, and you never know what she's going to do next. I've laughed, cried, and screamed out loud reading these books, sometimes within the course of a single chapter. These books are fun. Roller-coaster, breathless, heart-pounding kind of fun. Just make sure you start reading early, because they'll keep you up long past your bedtime."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"What happened to the series??? Yes, there's a plot, yes, we get new stuff revealed about Cherijo, but...it feels like nothing major happened. It feels like I've been stuck in a big hole in the ground the entire novel. There is no real forward progression of characters, of ideas, of feelings. It is the same stuff again, but this time on Earth. Where it's evidently a lot more boring.There was a lot of potential in Cherijo dealing with her father. And it is mostly wasted. I can't tell you how disappointing it is to discover that she's not so unique. And soon after getting into the lab, she escapes, and spends a good chunk of time underground. Jules Verne did a great science fiction book about being underground. He was able to pull it off. Most writers since then have realized it's pretty hard to make that interesting.And, Wow, Ick! I *don't* want to hear about vivid descriptions of rapes and child molestation. I read novels for enjoyment, and enlightenment. Not to be disgusted.There's a fifth book out there in the series, which reveals the final details about Cherijo's life, beyond what her father did. I'm not going to bother to buy it. At this point, I've been too disappointed, and too bored, by the last two novels. The investment I made in the character in the first two novels doesn't carry me over into any further interest in her."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Let me start with the fact that I loved the first Stardoc Novel. The next was good, but less so. The same with the next and now we get to Shockball. For a scifi book, there is a startling lack of your typical space saga while human alien hybrids and a fictional sport seem to be the only reminders that the book is set in the future. Cherijo manages to find a disease that has long since been extinct, which of course means it is a current day disease.I liked Reever the best in this novel compared to the other three books, however, that was not enough to save the book from overall repetitive storytelling. I personally have had enough of the angst. We get it, Chreijo has a awesome immune system so can be tortured and recover. It seems all that happened in the last book was that she was tortured and then escaped. The same happens here.The characters have potential, but instead we are treated to the soap opera angsty life of Cherijo."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"I admit, I am a fan of the Stardoc series. Its fast, its fun, its cheese, but its just good. So I breezed through the first three books within a weekend, but with this edition, I came to an abrupt crawl. Shockball has a very weak plot, with a few shocking secrets unveiled about Cherijo's past but that seems to be the brunt of it. Its not up to par with the usual pace in action & suspense in the previous books.After Cherijo and Reever get hauled back to Earth they're soon rescued from Joseph's mad-laboratory by a group of Navajos. Knowing how irate Cherijo gets about her only family being House Clan Torin she doesn't take the Navajo's claim as her blood kin amiably, even if she is nearly 100% Navajo herself. Well, her rescue comes with a price and the chief, Rico, takes her captive as medic for their Shockball team. Some are human hybrids who need to be fixed to look 100% human to legally play on the team. For most of the book she cures another mysterious plague. Reever gets in a few squabbles, gets enlisted in the Shockball team, and enjoys some machismo time as the suave new MVP. Rico has a queer fascination with her upbringing (quite obvious why but the brilliant Cherijo is clueless). There were no interesting new characters like Quilyp, Furreva, or Rogan. Some, like Rico's short secondhand man were mere brutes - but for no reason other than to point out how much Cherijo hates short men. Cherijo's new assistant - Hawk, a Quasimodo lookalike is very timid and quiet. In the first chapter, they visited a world of flying people so I wonder what \\"Hawk\\"'s condition is. Anyway... I lost a lot of respect for Cherijo's character in the way she views the Navajos. She frequently mocks their beliefs & traditions just like she did the Torins' attitude toward suicide and continues to carry a superiority complex about advanced society and medicine. On the other hand, I respect Viehl's characterization because it makes Cherijo that more real.Shockball had nothing to do with the story. At the end the reason why she had to deal with the whole Shockball nonsense is so ludicrous and flimsy you'll feel like you just got hit by a shockball yourself! Nevertheless, I am anticipating the next edition and hope it will be just as good as Endurance. I recommend that you read it only to find out some few things about Cherijo's past, but the whole story in of itself, leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Ohhhhhhhhh, Ms. Viehl. What the heck took you so long? 'Shockball' was a . . . well, a shock. Almost from the start it went in a direction that I completely did not expect. And just when I was feeling smug about being able to predict where things were going. I like very much that Reever takes some nice abuse, though I don't quite understand the way his role in the story changes. Maybe it'll be explained in the next book. I'm hoping so. Viehl's inventiveness is wonderful. Her depiction of an underground society is very well done and that alone helps drive the story. It doesn't have to, but it's a bonus I won't complain about. As with 'Endurance', there's a dark side to this tale, but it's more subdued, not so relentless. In 'Endurance' Cherijo began to deepen and take on much hoped for new demensions. That continues in 'Shockball', though not at the same frantic pace. Is this Viehl's best story to date? My favorite is still 'Endurance', but I'm betting that many people, especially those who shirked away from the intensity of 'Endurance', will find that 'Shockball' is their hands down favorite. So why are you still here? Go buy the book, and be ready for several days of ignoring everyone and everything around you while you sit alone in a lighted corner of your home, with 'Shockball' glued to your fingers"},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Readers who particularly enjoy Viehl's colorful and eccentric aliens, and her high-tech settings, may feel somewhat deprived by this fourth StarDoc novel. Cherijo and Duncan spend most of it on alien-challenged Terra, and much of it in decidedly low-tech surroundings. There are several compensations, though.There are people who write horror stories for a living and still never manage to dream up a monster as twisted as Joseph Grey Veil. Shockball delivers a lot of new information about his genetic experimentation, his motivations, his personality, and his predilections. It sure isn't pretty, but it's great reading, in a bent sort of way.Some of what she learns about Joe will affect Cherijo's ongoing adventures. Viehl lays the groundwork for other future story lines in Shockball as well. There's the cache of data disks that Maggie left for Cherijo to retrieve. There's also a rather belabored point about Duncan's anomalous kidney function, which may reflect a secret about his past. Poor proofreading and Viehl's history of basic writing errors make it impossible to be certain, but smart money says there's at least one clue that Shockball leaves fewer dead bodies than readers might expect. There's something about Cherijo's reproductive situation that indicates either future plot twists or poorly rationalized plotting. Then of course there's the not-quite-surprise at story's end."},{"Title":"Shockball : A Stardoc Novel","review":"Shockball (2001) is the fourth SF novel in the StarDoc series, followingEndurance. The initial volume in the series isStarDoc.In the previous volume, Cherijo learned that she is pregnant. FurreVa was shot with a pulse rifle at close range. When Cherijo and the slaves were rescued from Catopsa, FurreVa was transferred to the Sunlace and underwent massive surgery.In this novel, Cherijo Grey Veil is a modified clone of Joseph Grey Veil. She is a physician and surgeon. She had been Senior Healer on Catopsa.Duncan Reever is a telepath and a very talented linguist. He can learn a language almost as fast as it is being spoken via a link to the mind of the speaker. He escapes from the Hsktskt with Cherijo.Jenner is Cherijo's Tibetan Temple Cat. Cherijo understands his looks and moods very well.Squilyp is an Omorr, a four limbed alien who hops on one limb and uses the other three as arms. He is Senior Healer on the Sunlace.Vlaav Irde is a Saksonan. He had been a fourth year intern until Cherijo raised him to Resident status.In this story, Cherijo is viewing Vlaav's work. He was told to perform an appendectomy, but instead did an autopsy without anesthesia. The simulated torso is a mess and Cherijo is not pleased.Vlaav asks Squilyp to take over his instruction. Vlaav will never be as brilliant a surgeon as Cherijo and feels intimidated by her methods. He is working hard to imitate her style, but not really getting anywhere.Then the ships run into space junk. Although shaken up, people on the Sunlace are unhurt. But there have been casualties on Reever's vessel, the Perpetua.Cherijo and the medical staff pull the injured through the calamity, but the Perpetua is severely damaged. Reever insists on transferring to the Truman, a gift from Cherijo's creator. But that vessel is a trap and Cherijo is captured by the Terrans.This tale has Cherijo in the custody of her creator. Joseph is as cold and uncaring as usual. He immediately starts a series of tests to find her limitations. Then Cherijo and Duncan are rescued by a Navaho man.Cherijo soon learns that she and Duncan are still captives. The next volume in this series isEternity Row.Recommended for Viehl fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of gene modified clones, medical procedures, and persevering women.

It is one that all romance novel readers will want to read more than once. Nora Roberts displays her characters with style, yet with values and respect. Maggie and Rogan are two people not likely to fall in love. Maggie with her look at her mother and fathers marriage is bound and determined she will never fall in love and get married because of the way her parents own marriage failed, Rogan on the other hand is a very demanding man with high expectations for Maggie and a good out look on life.

Overall, I'd give him 4/5 stars. He read a wee bit fast, didn't pause at chapters or where I would assume there were page breaks because the story suddenly changed gears, and he didn't use different voices for the characters. His voice was animated and entertaining and I loved his Irish accent, but his lack of different voices for characters was confusing for the listener at times.This book was just okay for me. I loved hearing about the glass making and art pieces that Maggie created. I've never read Nora Roberts before and I'm not sure if this book is a good representation of her work or not. However, I thought the story was short and predictable. There didn't seem to be much depth with the characters and the timeline moved quickly from one time period to the next. The relationship between Maggie and Rogan seemed to come out of nowhere. Then it's so tumultuous and based on wit and arguments with each other it doesn't seem realistic at all.I have the next two books in the series that I will be listening to next, so I'm hoping that they have a bit more depth to them, but I won't hold my breath.***EDIT 3.5.12***Just realized that the audio CDs are an abridged version of the books.

Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie's fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself. Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring. Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person. Rogan is an extremely likeable hero. Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm. The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.

I read the entire trilogy for the first time while I was pregnant with my daughter. I bought the books backwards. I finally own the first in the Born in Trilogy by Nora Roberts. The story follows an Irish woman by the name of Margret Mary Concannon. Her past is littered with may terrible things, the most recent and tragic is when her father died in her arms. She doesn't get along with her mother for reasons explained through out the story. She's a glass artist. Her father look out a loan so she would be able to go and be trained as a glass artist. Now she makes amazing creations and a world renown gallery owner Rogan Sweeney is out to manage her carrier and make her rich. She's smart, independent, and stubborn, which Rogan uses all of that to break down the walls she's built around herself. Despite her unwillingness, distance, and harsh behavior, Rogan gets his wish, which starts the sparks flying between them. It's not my favorite in the trilogy but it's an excellent start and caught me, and got me reading the next two books that follow. If your a Nora Roberts fan and haven't read this book, I highly recommend it. It's an amazing story.

Rogan is a wealthy Gallery owner in Dublin. He wants to represent her work. He calls her repeatedly but she never answers her phone. He has to travel there just to be able to talk to her. After he signs her, he has to send telegraphs to her because she still doesn't answer her phone. He views her as irresponsible, scatterbrained, canny, obstinate, brilliant, bad-tempered and beautiful. He's her opposite, a business mind and manner with schedules and timetables. Maggie is constantly throwing insults at Rogan and others, but I find her insults funny. An example of her insulting style is below in Caution Spoiler. In the sequel \\"Born in Shame,\\" Shannon describes Maggie as suspicious by nature, hot-headed, frank to the point of rudeness, overly protective and fiercely loyal. Shannon describes Rogan as \\"cultured, smooth, organized, shrewd, sophisticated and sharp enough to run an organization that was respected around the world. And, she thought grimly, he had to have a sense of humor, and the patience of Job, to live with Maggie.\\"I also enjoyed the subplots concerning Rogan's friend Patricia and his grandmother Christine.I'm not usually moved by descriptions of place, but in this book, I was, especially on page 116. Maggie has just finished an intense creative session for several days and is riding her bike to town for some food and a break. As the author describes the sights and scents around Maggie's bike ride, I felt like I was experiencing a piece of art. She describes the sun, the hedges, the breeze, the scents of honeysuckle, hay and sweet mown grass, etc. Maybe, because I was so into Maggie's artistic activities, I continued to feel the art surrounding her bike ride. Who knows what it was, but I felt a lovely, emotional fulfillment, with that bike ride.\\"Born in Fire\\" is the first book in a 3 book series. It can be read alone. Books 2 and 3 are about Maggie's sister Brianna and half-sister Shannon. Maggie has small parts in the subsequent books, but it's not necessary to read them, although it was nice to see Maggie having a child in a later book. I gave 2 stars to \\"Born in Ice\\" and 3.5 stars to \\"Born in Shame.\\"CAUTION SPOILER:I'm quoting a section of the book, to give readers a sense of Maggie's insulting style. If readers enjoy it, then I think they will enjoy the book. On page 49: Rogan offers to manage and sell Maggie's glass sculptures. He tells her he will take a percentage from all sales. She asks\\"What percentage do you take?\\"Hoping for a reaction, he kept his eyes level with hers. \\"Thirty-five percent.\\"She made a strangled sound in her throat. \\"Thirty-five? Thirty-five? You thief. You robber.\\" She shoved back from the table and stood. \\"You're a vulture, Rogan Sweeney. Thirty-five percent be damned and you with it.\\"\\"I take all the risks, I have all the expenses.\\" He spread his hands, steepled them again. \\"You have merely to create.\\"\\"Oh, as if all it takes is sitting on my a** and waiting for the inspiration to come fluttering down like raindrops.

Characters that become your friends until the last page!"},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Been reading Roberts for many years (20 plus) and this is one of her best. This is a very quick moving book with sub-stories that will tantalize the need to read the next two books (the third book is my least favorite of the series). A definate re-read in my house.The two main characters have alot of chemistry and the herione has just that great mixture of hard and soft. Love the hero's frustration with both the herione and his grandmother."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Nora Roberts produced one of the finest coming-of-adult-age stories I've ever read. Faced with the untimely death of her father and the incessant criticism of her mother, the heroine of this novel goes on to win both the respect of others and the love of a worthy man.I truly enjoyed hearing the content MP3 CD version of this novel, but unfortunately, the audio itself was very poor. While the reader is an authentic Irish man, the recording was also artificially sped up in places, to the point where the combination of his Irish accent and the tempo of the audio made the book distressing to listen to.And sometimes, the words fly so fast you don't know what he said.Recommendation to fellow readers:Enjoy the story. If you get the MP3 CD version, it will help to do the following:- Load the MP3 audio into an audio editor.- Slow down the speed by 20%.- If slowing down also lowered the pitch, increase the pitch by 20-25% so it sounds normal again.I did this with Audacity (a free open source program -- find it by doing a web search).Recommendation to Brilliance Audio:I really love MP3 CDs. But please, have someone else listen to the results of your audio books before releasing them!"},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"This is a great book, I listened to the audio version while I was traveling and I hated to stop the car I was so engrossed in the story line. I immediatly loaded the next in the trilogy when I finished this first book."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Fast Read! Nora Roberts has got to be one of my Fav writers and she doesn't disappoint with this one. I want to say I read the trilogy out of sequence but that didn't make a difference. I would love to see more books from her like this."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"This is the novel that hooked me as a Nora Roberts fan for life! My sister, Jana, had suggested this author to me so I went to the local library and picked up Born in Fire. Unfortunately, I got very little sleep in the next couple of days because of it. It was impossible to put down! But it was also the beginning of a wonderful journey - I had found a new favorite author and I was and still am determined to read all of the books she's written. Not an easy task when many of these books are out of print and very difficult to find. Luckily for those who have not read Born in Fire, the Born In trilogy is readily available.The story follows Margaret Mary Concannon, a young woman from the small Irish village of County Claire who is a very gifted glass artisan. Maggie's father, Tom, sent her to Venice to study glassblowing. Before she can acclaim international fame, her father dies and she must return. She sets up a studio and continues her craft, much to her mother's chagrin.We're shown that Maggie has continued with her talent because of the love and encouragement given by her father. The family life of the Concannons is dysfunctional at best, as the mother is unhappy and determined to make everyone around her as miserable as she. She had to give up her dreams of becoming a singer when she was a young girl and married Tom Concannon. She continues to blame her daughters for her never being able to fulfill those dreams.When the wealthy owner of an art gallery with international branches visits Maggie, she instantly brushes him off and doesn't want to be bothered. He's planning on opening a gallery in Ireland and wants to focus on local artists. This owner, Rogan, falls in love with Maggie and has to figure out a way to make her fall for him, while convincing her to let his gallery handle her glass sculptures.The best part of this book is the fantastic characters. Maggie is vibrant, full of life, driven by an inner source that the reader ultimately admires, and I personally loved the spit of temper that we periodically saw. Rogan is handsome, reserved and completely floored by Maggie and her Irish boldness. We're given glimpses into the life of Brianna, Maggie's sister, who is Maggie's opposite. She's quiet, reserved and spends her days trying to please the ever sarcastic mother. We are introduced to Murphy Muldoon, the gorgeous hunk of a neighbor that always seems to be there whenever Maggie or Brianna needs help. We often wonder why neither Concannon can see through the shy looks and see the love beneath Muldoon's surface.Being an avid Nora Roberts fan, and having read most of her books, I have to say that Maggie Concannon is one of the strongest characters she's created. I keep hoping that the Born In trilogy will have a follow-up book soon, like Roberts has done with several of her other successful trilogies!Born in Fire is action packed, full of emotion and definitely a book that will hook you until you've finished it. As the beginning of a trilogy, it captures you and ensures the reading of the next book. I'd suggest that you have Born in Ice in your possession so you can jump right into the next tale in the series. Definitely a series to be added to your Must Read list!"},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"If you are a lover of romances this is the book for you.

She's fiery and petulant, and I loved getting to know her. If you like a good romance, one that keeps the pages turning, you'll love Born in Fire, and you'll love the other two, as well (Born In Ice, Born In Shame).There is none better than Nora. As a writer myself, I long for the ability to turn a phrase in such a becoming, simple manner as she. I would recommend her to anyone, and this book in particular.Have fun in Ireland!

Her Born in Trilogy is one of my favorite of her trilogies. In this first book you meet the characters and you see the story begin to unfold. You begin to discover which characters you love and which ones you hate. She is so good at describing her characters you feel like you actually know these people, she is wonderful. I also love how she spends one entire book focusing on one character and their world in its self. Her characters are rich in style and passion. In this first one we meet and discover Maggie and Rogan, they come from two totally different worlds and although her attitude towards Rogan is like a rollercoaster ride all the way through the book you can't help but admire her strength to hold on to her independants, even though in the end you know she will fall in love with him. I loved how for all that fighting for independance in the end it was pointless... she was completely love with him."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"I was not familiar with Nora Roberts when I read this book and the companion, Born in Ice.

All three books are set in Ireland -- charaters are true to life and easy to identify with. The books follow the lives of three Irish Sisters near Galaway, Ireland."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"I'd always thought this was my favorite of the trilogy, but it's been years since I'd read it.Maggie Concannon is an Irish glass artist--reclusive, a bit temperamental, independent. Rogan Sweeney is a businessman, art connoisseur, and owner of a gallery. He's been trying to sign Maggie for his gallery, but she ignores his letters and won't answer her phone, so he decides to visit her personally.Sparks fly, of course, between Maggie's artistic passion and Rogan's implacable determination.That's the romance part of the story. Then there's the family story. In the prologue, Maggie's with her father as he dies. Her mother is a bitter, nasty woman, and Maggie butts heads with her constantly. Maggie's sister Brianna, on the other hand, bends over backwards to accommodate the unsatisfiable Maeve.Which is the source of my dissatisfaction with this story. In the same way that Maeve spoiled every family gathering in the book, she also spoiled the story. I absolutely could not sympathize with her at all, and it seemed that part of the message of Born in Fire was that Maggie should try to be more understanding toward Maeve, which left me feeling vaguely as if I'd been chastised for not being sympathetic toward her myself.Heh. Sometimes I take these things a bit too seriously.I also, when I'd put the book down for a while, questioned Rogan's persistence. The business persistence was fine, but the romantic persistence felt just a little squicky. That was only when I was thinking about the book, though, not while I was reading it."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"After finishing the last book in the \\"Born In..\\" series I felt like I was saying goodbye to long lost friends. This rarely happens for me because I read so much, but Nora introduced me to the best of people and the best of traditions. I may not read for a couple of days and those who know me will be shocked because I am rarely seen without a book in my hand or a book on the fireplace calling my name. I feel I should mourn the loss of never again getting to read for the first time this \\"Born In...\\" series. If you have never read any of Nora's books please just pick one up. Yes as we all know there are a number of wonderful authors out in the big ole' world of books, but there are only a few who can ever dream of being as good as Nora!

However, witnessing the unhappy married life of her parents has put her off the idea of love and marriage herself. Until, her true love finds her.

Maggie is devoted to her father who believes in her, but dies early in the story leaving her to provide for Brianna and her mother.

Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring. Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person. Rogan is an extremely likeable hero. Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm. The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.

Never a dull moment for these two.This was a good light read, but not my favorite NR book."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"this is the first in the \\"born in\\" series by nora roberts. it tells of the romance of maggie and rogan.maggie is a red-headed irish girl who's tempermental, candid, brash at times, sexual, and afraid of marriage. she's a gifted glass blower who is on the cusp of stardom, although she's not aware of it yet, living in a small town in ireland.rogan is a black-haired hunk with blue eyes and a focus on his business. he's the opposite of maggie in that he's more emotionally controlled, holds his tongue more times than not for appearance sake, is uncomfortable with the idea of losing control sexually (at least initially), and values marriage over just a sexual relationship. he is immediately enamored with maggie's artwork and wants to display it in his galleries. the conflict begins when he wants to take control and she doesn't want it because she's always controlled everything in her world up until then.i loved maggie because she was comfortable with her sexuality and was committed to her art. she was outspoken and didn't hold her tongue if she felt something needed to be said. there wasn't any coy games going on with her when it came to rogan. she let him know early on she was interested in him sexually.it was really cool watching rogan lose control of the situation, when he was so used to having control over every aspect of his life. i loved how the two characters came together sexually, too. it was definitely HOT, although i wish roberts had spent a little more time describing more of the interludes.and the banter between the two was hilarious. maggie had an uncanny way of getting under rogan's skin, and the arguments between these two were almost as entertaining as the sexual encounters.there were a few weak points of this book, though. for one, there was an unnecessary amount of time spent on them at work. while i understand the need to educate the reader on the process of glass blowing, sometimes i found myself wanting to skim over it so i could get to the interaction between maggie and rogan. i wish there had been more of it in the book. it wouldn't have been a bad thing if the storyline was interesting when they were apart, but it really wasn't. the only time it got interesting outside of the romance was when maggie and her mom were going at it.if you want a strong female character who's funny and knows what she wants and like the idea of watching a man's control unravel, and you like reading about spontaneous and heated sexual encounters after reading uninteresting stuff for about thirty pages prior, this is the book for you. i thought it was aiight, but i'm not pressed to read it ever again."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Well, I usually read historical romances set in the United States but every now & then I'll try something different. Since Nora Roberts is such a big name author I thought I'd give one of her series a try. I have to say that I was very disappointed. I was pretty bored actually. I felt that this book had more to do with their jobs then it had anything to do with romance. The majority of the book Maggie & Rogan weren't even together or even talking on the phone. When they were together they spent a lot of the time not getting along. I also felt the few romance scenes were too short & lacking. I would have liked to give this book a 2 star rating since it stands for \\"I didn't like it\\" but since it's not my normal reading material I gave it a 3 star rating. I figure if a woman makes her man watch a highly rated romance movie & that's not his type of movie & then he goes & says that the movie was bad that it wasn't the movie that was bad it just wasn't his type of movie. I love romance books but I honestly couldn't wait for this book to end. I'll finish the series since I have them already but I sure hope they get better."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"As a reader who most often prefers historical romance, I was skeptical when my bookseller urged me to read Born In Fire, the first of a trilogy set in modern Ireland. I have often said that I can only enter the fantasy world romance offers when the time and place is long ago and far away. Well, I was wrong, at least in terms of the time. But the place, well, Nora's Irish setting, both in Dublin and County Clare, offered me a wonderful fantasy world, and that's due to her phenomenal skill as the creator of characters and story-lines.Born In Fire is the story of Margaret Mary Concannon, a brilliant and tormented artist whose medium is glass. After the death of her beloved father, she is determined to live her life alone. After all, while she loves her sweet sister Brianna, she had seen no love between her parents, and her mother despises her very being.In walks Rogan Sweeney, wealthy and handsome gallery owner. He wants to make her a star. He sees in her art something he must possess, and he soon comes to see that in her as well. Like the water and hot glass that form her art, Maggie and Rogan are destined to be together, even though it's going to take him some time and finesse to convince her.In a nice change of pace, it is not Rogan who is the tormented soul. No, that distinction belongs to Maggie, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. The manner in which the author describes her torment is heart-wrenching. The manner in which the author uses that torment to fuel Maggie's art is beautiful. I had no trouble seeing in my mind's eye the works of art Maggie created, and when Rogan assists Maggie on a particular piece, I felt I was in the room with them.The imagery used by Nora Roberts to describe not only the art Maggie creates but the process as well is incredibly well done, and these were the scenes that put the book over the top for me. Maggie's creativity, Rogan's commanding persona, along with his comforting patience made a devastating combination.The cast of secondary characters only added to the richness of the story, and there's at least one small yet strong secondary love story for readers to savor. What especially appealed to me about Maggie's mother was in the lack of resolution of their battles, which rang true to life - after all, not everything can be tied in a package with a neat little bow. Maggie's sister Brianna was more difficult for me to care about and seemed too much like a doormat, but whether that's because I was seeing her through Maggie's eyes or because Brianna becomes stronger in the second book of the trilogy, I am not certain.I am certain that Margaret Mary and Rogan's love was definitely born in fire, but that Rogan's patience and skill will allow the fire not to consume them in a quick fit of passion but to burn slowly for the rest of their lives. This is one wonderful hero! I greatly anticipate the next books in the series and can only hope that Brianna finds a man who completes her as well as Maggie did.This is the first part of Nora Robert's \\"Born in\\" trilogy.1.

While the relationship between temperamental glassblowing artist Maggie and upper-crust gallery owner Rogan is obviously at the forefront of this tale, the larger tale being told is that of 2 sisters and how they are coming to grips with the death of their adoring father and the reality of the long, loveless marriage he shared with their cold, bitter mother. The relationship and interplay between Maggie, her sweet-natured sister Brianna, and their shrewish mother provides some of the best dialogue in the book.Maggie is a very well-developed character, who is so flawed and yet so wonderful that she is as human to the reader as one's own best friend might be."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Roberts brings the culture and atmosphere of Ireland to life with her vivid descriptions of settings and the portrayal of her Irish characters in the novel.

I will definately read the rest of the Concannon sisters trilogy."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Though I read these books out of order, I thoroughly enjoyed each and everyone.The start to this wonderfully enchanting trilogy takes place in the heart of a glassblower. Perhaps one of the most interesting and creative settings I have ever seen Roberts devise.Not quite as bloody and gory as some of her murder mysteries, you'll find that this is a true romance novel, centered around the emotions of the two main characters.And it takes place in Ireland! I loved it!"},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"As the first of three sisters, this is the strongest. Ms.Roberts pushes her to the limit, and she can handle anything."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"Allow me to be the sole voice of dissent here- but (I'm sorry if I'm insulting anybody) I really think Nora Roberts' books should be read only by Americans who have never spent long amounts of time in Ireland. I read excerpts aloud from &quot;Born in Fire&quot; to a middle-aged Irishwoman on the train from Dublin to Belfast, and she both laughed and groaned. I lent &quot;Born in Shame&quot; to a friend of mine from Belfast and he said it was &quot;the biggest load of s***te&quot; he'd ever read. One part of &quot;Born in Fire&quot; I took especially great exception to was when Maggie Concannon makes a cute remark to some Brit who is looking at one of her sculptures at a gallery show. He asks her if it's about her sexuality; she says, no, (with &quot;a twinkle in her eye&quot;): It's the Six Counties, yearning to be free, or something along those lines. Embarassed, the Britisher beats a retreat, while Maggie and a friend chuckle over her cleverness. Excuse me, I know I'm probably being oversensitive, but I find this cutesy attitude towards the North both inappropriate and quite frankly very stupid. (This section was another part I read to the lady on the Dublin-Belfast train.... I remember she shook her head in incredulous disgust. She told me that she'd lived all her life in Co. Down, and even though she was happily married with grown children living in the area, she often thought about moving out of the country because the Troubles saddened and sickened her so much.) Excellent Northern Irish authors, like Colin Bateman, have their own black (and very funny) senses of humor when they choose to write about the Troubles. But when Americans choose to treat such a ghastly subject in a cutsey, flippant, unrealistic, TV-sitcom sort of way, it makes me angry. I know, &quot;it's only a romance,&quot; and people read it for escapism, etc. I know, &quot;the relationships between the sisters is so well-written,&quot; etc. But I don't care how &quot;well-written&quot; the book is otherwise- &quot;Born in Fire&quot; is just another example of the unrealistic, oversimplified picture Americans have of people who live in other countries. Again I am sorry if I offend anybody, but this is how I sincerely feel."},{"Title":"Born in Fire: The Born In Trilogy #1 (CONCANNON SISTERS)","review":"I was given this and Born in Ice by my mother in law, who thought I would enjoy reading novels set in Ireland, where I am from - I cringed through reading this book, the use of dialect was nothing more than Shakespearean Irish - if Nora Roberts actually visited Ireland, I would like to know where she found the characters that actually spoke like this at all - it was an infuriating mix of the country woman, Maggie, speaking old Irish and the main love interest, Rogan, speaking as Irish people speak today. The storyline was a good premise for a novel of glass artist Maggie meeting up with city art dealer Rogan, however, if you are going to write about a country that is not your native own, steer away from the stereotypical tourist imagery and be realistic. Needless to say, I did not bother reading Born in Ice and both copies went to a Salvation Army store."},{"Title":"David Glasgow Farragut, our first admiral","review":"Using sources ranging from official documents and ship's logs to personal letters and the Farragut family bible, Lewis presents the fascinating true story of David Glasgow Farragut.

A Naval Officer at the age of 11, his Commanding Officer remarked that he was seven pounds of uniform and seventy pounds of fight. He was made a prizemaster of a captured whaling ship, in the war of 1812, at the age of twelve. This is not dry historical subject, but a fascinating account of a truly heroic man. Read this book!

David Glasgow Farrigut, however, was to be found in the heat of battle, lashed high in the rigging of his flagship, barking commands through a megaphone, bullets flying around him, while his junior officers begged him to come down before he was shot to pieces! Farragut reached the level of a truly epic hero. Congress wanted no titles of nobility and had no rank above Captain in the Pre-Civil War U.S. Navy. Farragut's performance was so fantastic that Congress created the rank of Vice Admiral and then Admiral to award to a man who is argued in other text &quot;THE DAY THE WAR WAS LOST&quot; to have done more to win the Civil War than any other person. With the daring taking of New Orleans, the Southern armies soon found itself without shoes, or tools or gunpowder. This book tells how it was done in graphic tales of action and stunning detail."},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"Corwin pens a defense of genocidal regimes cloaked in an attack on imperialism and the West, continuing to spread a false representation of the facts on the ground - that all three sides are equally to blame - instead of focusing on the verbatim strategy of ethnic cleansing and genocide on the side of Serbian aggressors. No, as a previous reviewer mentioned, he categorically misses the point as he touts his case despite the glaring evidence to the contrary. In short, an unapologetic piece of propaganda that should be as vehemently condemned as the crimes it actively ignores."},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"Philip Corwin's captivating memoir reveals the dark secrets of the UN mission in Bosnia during its last days. By mid-1995, the UN had become resigned to playing mercenaries to the Muslim government in Sarajevo, harassed by the cheerleading international press, pushed around by Washington and held hostage by the local gagster-leaders. Corwin describes how the mission degenerated from a supposedly good-faith, impartial peacekeeping effort into an open war against one belligerent. His notes reveal the crippling internal politics of UNPROFOR and the enormous pressure of NATO to come in, guns blazing. Corwin escapes the temptation to moralize and preach to both the world and the Bosnians. Instead, he exposes the malicious incomprehension of the situation on part of the foreign factors, and blasts the thuggery of Bosnian leaders - Serbs, Muslims and Croats alike. Though he does not absolve the Serbs from a shred of responsibility for the horrors of the Bosnian war, by giving them a voice at all he has probably risked vitriolic condemnation by various &quot;Muslim partisans,&quot; among whom you will find some familiar names... Corwin's book is not THE ONE BOOK you need to understand the Bosnian tragedy. But between him and general MacKenzie, the UN side of it is told as it was. If you want to know how today's world of mercenary peacekeeping and random bombing came to be, read this book. It is a must."},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"For perspective, start with the publisher's bio of the author: \\"Phillip Corwin held a number of posts during his twenty-seven years with the United Nations, including that of a speechwriter for former Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. After participating in peacekeeping missions in Haiti, Western Sahara, and Afghanistan, he became the UN's chief political officer in Sarajevo. He is also the author of three collections of short stories and three books of poetry.\\"Corwin is a poet and speechwriter who is rewarded with a plum post after a lifetime of high living in the UN bureaucracy. He was in way over his head as a political officer in the deadliest European conflict and worst genocide since World War II. Fortunately, he was only in that position for a few months, limiting the further damage. From a true believer in the UN, this book is simply a settling of scores to assuage Corwin's bruised ego. He is miffed that a person of his exalted stature was not properly treated by the impertinent Bosnian government. His genius is unrecognized by others in the UN mission, not to mention the dreaded NATO cowboys.He repeatedly and bloodymindedly misses the point, as when he finds himself advocating ethnic cleansing (he is upset by the focus on the right of refugees to return to the property they were forcibly expelled from saying \\"Why not encourage exchanges of property?\\"), and decrying the arrest of the war crimminals Karadzic and Milosevic (\\"I was sure that, given the proper amount of time, the Bosnian Serbs would deal with their own criminals.\\"). It's no wonder that he continues to advocate the partion of Bosnia, fulfilling the vision of Karadzic et al.Corwin does unwittingly provide documentation of how ineffectual and counter-productive the UN peacekeeping system is, not to mention the entire self-absorbed UN mentality.Shame on Duke for publishing this tripe, a combination of self-serving score settling from s petty bureaucrat out of his depth, and putrid tacit support of some of the more heinous crimes of recent history."},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"Philip Corwin is not a professional apologist, advocacy journalist, propagandist or self-aggrandizing Imperial shill, the kind one would expect writing a book about Bosnia. Corwin, an American in UN service, was the head of UNPROFOR Civil Affairs in Sarajevo during those crucial months of 1995 when the UN became NATO's handmaiden. As a result, he is a disillusioned, embittered witness to Imperial ascendance....Right from its very title, Dubious Mandate gets to the heart of the matter. As the Bosnian War unravels, so does the UN peacekeeper mission, whose mandate is self-contradictory, ill-defined, and under constant political and military pressure. From his position in Sarajevo, Corwin witnessed the disintegration of the last shreds of UN credibility and impartiality. His journal entries read like a Greek tragedy, with growing awareness of the impending disaster literally rolling in over the hills.Arguably the best features of the book are Corwin's \\"hindsight\\" notes. Unlike other memoirs, Dubious Mandatecontains the author's reflections alongside the original writing, clearly marked to avoid confusion. This provides the readers with an insight into how Corwin thought then, and how subsequent events and understandings impacted his earlier opinions. It is exceptionally difficult to write an honest memoir, avoiding the temptation to spruce up the original notes with hindsight. Dubious Mandate has found a way, and it works extraordinarily well.Corwin does not mince words. He is not anti- or pro- anyone, often describing the local Balkans leaders as \\"thugs in suits.\\" But his insistence that there were legitimate concerns among the Serbs (even though their methods were reprehensible) and that the Sarajevo Muslims were far from angels, earns Corwin the undying hatred of the international diplomats, western Press, and, of course, the Izetbegovic regime.Read the complete version of this review- and many more- at Balkanalysis.com"},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"Ever wondered why the UN &quot;failed&quot; in Bosnia, only to be replaced by NATO? Ever thought about what causes UN missions to fail in some situations (as in Bosnia) and succeed in others (as in East Timor)? From historical evidence it appears that there is no inherent institutional flaw in the UN structure but that the Security Council, by assigning different mandates and rules of engagement, determines the likely outcome of various missions. Who interests does this kind of &quot;peacekeeping&quot; serve?This book adds to our understanding of the critical role of outside factors in the partition of Yugoslavia. It sheds some light on the reasons for (intended? ) failiure of UNPROFOR and the subsequent insertion of NATO. It is required reading for anyone trying to understand the Yugoslav mayhem beyond superficiality of mainstream media coverage."},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","review":"It was only because of military intervention in Bosnia that the war finally ended. The fact that war ended had nothing to do with the UN's humanitarian mission, from the start a disgrace and a failure. It is amazing how hard it is to find UN personel willing to admit their policy, prior to military intervention, was disastrous. This year finally, the Secretary General, in a report framed by the massacre of Srebrenica, did admit the UN's total failure."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"It's not that I'm a prude or overly modest. But you know what? I don't want to read the intimate overly detailed explanation of anyone's period. And that is the glue that holds the story together.

It goes downhill from there."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"I like Claudia Dain and her other books. This book was too focused on her period, which occurs for 330 out of 390 pages.So obviously nothing happens for that entire time. As well,the entire concept of having relations during one's period is very unappealing, and not worth buying a book to read about that possibly happening.Plus, the heroine is a shrew, never softening towards Hugh, or making peace with her world, as she tells herself she will and must. Hugh is too easily forgiven for lying through his teeth, although he comes to care for her more readily and honestly than she does for him. Skip this book and try another one of Ms. Dain's."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"I can understand Ms. Dain's trying to explain how hard women really had it back then with the period situation (which took up too much of the story ) and the childbirthing deaths not to mention no rights on what they did with their lives. The book covers a lot of subjects that were very depressing with not enough humor or romance to get over the sad parts. I don't know why Ms. Dain made the book so sad. But I still think she's a good writer. I've read other books by her so maybe she was just showing the dark side of living back then."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"It's not that I expect literature from my romance. God knows truely wonderful writers are few and far between. And I appreciate charecter developement, however, I do not want to read a romance where one of the major plot points is a women's period.

When I say many, I mean hundreds. It's one of my hobbies.Having read so many, I'd like to think that I am a good judge of them.This was a horrid one.I could barely get through it. While it tries to tackle child abuse, it does it haphazardly. The author spends most of the book focusing on the main character's period, God and prayer.While I'm all for God and prayer, this novel has page after page of medievil theology coupled with mensutration.&lt;sarcasm&gt; Yah!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;I'm all for romance novels that try to go beyond the tried and true story lines of boy meets girl, etc., but I'm afraid that Ms. Dain does not succeed in her efforts to expand the genre.A romance novel with the heroine on the rag is not my idea of a good time. Please, please, please save your precious reading time for something more worthy. Pick up a Jo Beverley romance or Julia Quinn. Or give Karen Marie Moning a chance.

Maybe she was trying to break new ground in romance writing but this was not the way to do it.

I can't say I was thrilled, but I was shocked, horrified and repulsed.This book was about the most dull and patient man I have ever heard of and a terrified girl who spends the entire book (basically) having her period - not kidding. The book is filled with disturbing references to medieval sanitary napkins being changed by someone other than the wearer(also not kidding), blood gushing during childbirth, bloody baths, this blood, that blood and more blood. Did I also mention that everyone discusses her blood? Yep: her husband discusses with her dad who discusses with his chief who discusses it with his girlfriend, who discusses it with the maids who discuss it with herione. Oh and there's a ten year old girl also discussing it somewhere in the mix. I could not make this stuff up (although apparently CD can).The makings of a decent story is hidden in here somewhere, but something went dreadfully wrong in its execution. All in all a bloody disappointment...pun intended."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Although the book goes on about the girl's menstrual cycle, the way it was used, to me, was not so much disgusting as... well, I'm not sure how to describe it.This girl's struggle to remain grounded in her ideals of faith and religion, and be submissive to what the historical period's idea of how she was to act made it a good read.In today's society, the way this girl is treated would be an outrage. Its an outrage that women were treated this way in any age, but she comes through it like a champ.I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"This book is a battle of wills between the Elsbeth and Hugh and will keep you cheering for both up until the end.

However, Gautier denies her wish to never marry because a contract exists that allies him with a powerful family. Elsbeth knows her duty, but begs release anyway. Her father forces the marriage between Elsbeth and Lord Hugh of Jerusalem, who overheard the debate.Her plan is simple as she cannot overtly destroy her marriage so she thinks she can coax her spouse into repudiating her starting with persuading Lord Hugh to delay consummation of their vows. Hugh initially agrees because he plans to win her love as nothing less will suit for him. As the couple falls in love, Hugh knows in his soul that once they make love, their hearts will join forever.The tale starts and remains at a snail's pace as Claudia Dain introduces her key threesome and the impact of the Church on life in the twelfth century. The story line towards the middle goes into full throttle and never looks back. Still the refreshing key to THE TEMPTATION is the powerful look inside the religious elements that serve as the prime conflict between the lead couple. Ms Dain provides a deep look at how the Church is involved in almost everything inside a warm love story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"This highly emotional and evocative read is romance at its best, with a keen picture of Olde England as it truly was, and a wonderful battle between the hero and the heroine."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"Unbelievable sexual tension between a submissive girl and a true gentleman leaves you wanting more with every turn of the page. Hugh of Jerusalem is every woman's dream of seduction and fulfillment. His character is so strong and sensuous that he becomes addicting to the reader as well as Elsbeth, his naive and untrusting bride. The book is 388 pages of pure seduction. Dain offers great insight to the beliefs and practices of the time period (England, 1156). To anyone who finds the book distasteful or vulgar, they must remember the realities of history. It takes true talent to turn such a dark and dreary time to pure seduction and fantasy."},{"Title":"The Temptation","review":"but is well worth the wait. If you've read Ms. Dain before then you know that she is a good writer. This book starts slow. I should say the first few pages are intriguing and then the next 25 are slow. This is called &quot;building the characters&quot;.If you put the book down at this point then you really miss out on the whole story. Elsbeth's &quot;Period&quot; plays a small part in the beginning of her unwanted marriage to Hugh of Jeruselem.

I had, however, never read anything by Claudia Dain; I liked the look of the cover art, & the plot blurb on the back cover sounded intriguing...stupid me! Don't buy a book by its cover!! It's not that it's so badly written, but with the heroine having her period throughout the whole book (just about)...what a plot device! There's the hero's impatience to consummate the marriage, and then when her father reveals his true nature...in somewhat graphic detail...Ewww! My one-star is for a moving passage about 10 pages from the end of the book, when the heroine questions why God didn't save her from her father's attentions, and the hero responds about Christ having suffered horribly, why should his servants suffer less? I've just messed up the quote, but I think that's what the author wanted to convey all along but she couldn't get that across until the end (maybe).

First of all, the woman was a very sheltered virgin - yet from the get go, the hero carries on continuous conversations about her menstrual periods. and she discusses it back with him - BOING! knocked me out of the story. and between the GRAPHIC childbirthing scenes littering the book - BOING! just freaked me out of the book. the &quot;blood&quot; imagery throughout the book made me feel like a well used blood donor. And for some reason, the heroine (the very sheltered one) seems to know that if the man she married is a sodomite, under church law she can get out of this marriage. of course, there is absolutely no inkling that he might even be of that persuasion so i don't understand how she leapt to that conclusion.further, i find it hard to believe she would even know about that stuff, being such a sheltered girl. Now, just to be fair, there is some very clever dialogue between the hero and heroine and he is PERSISTENT, to say the least. but i am not sure - perhaps, like jo beverly, ms. dain suffered from a case of anemia (due to loss of blood, i'm sure) thereby creating a book that is anemic at best.

Sometimes the main characters have been of the mischievous type like Squirrel Nutkin, Hunca Munca or Samuel Whiskers. Well, in \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\", the main characters, Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, are two thoroughly disagreeable and unpleasant creatures. Mr. Tod has foxy whiskers and is of a wandering habit. The other animals either cannot bear him or are frightened of him. He has several different houses but is rarely found home. However, his houses are not always empty, for Tommy Brock is prone to moving in without Mr. Tod's permission. Tommy Brock is a fat, waddling badger with a horrible grinning face and a habit of digging things up. One day he pays a call to old Mr. Bouncer, Benjamin Bunny's father. Today he is in charge of looking after the young, while Benjamin and his wife Flopsy are out. Unfortunately after conversing with the badger and smoking a very strong cabbage leaf cigar, the old rabbit falls asleep and Tommy Brock makes off with the rabbit babies. When Benjamin and Flopsy return they find their young gone and Benjamin at once goes out to track down Tommy Brock. Along the way he enlists the help of his brother-in-law, Peter Rabbit. Of course, they are not the only ones after the terrible badger. It seems that yet again he has set up house in one of Mr. Tod's residences and the fox, who is not in the best of moods this day, discovers the badger asleep in his bed... There are not many color pictures in this book, but there are many black and white illustrations in the style of woodcuts. Of course the story is extremely interesting and suspensful. \\"The Tale of Mr. Tod\\" is a longer story than some of the author's other tales. Also, there is more narration than dialogue and the language is early twentieth century, so this story may be more suitable for older children. Parents and children should not pass up this lesser known tale by a very talented storyteller and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Tale of Mr Tod","review":"My 7 year old loved this book.

At last we find out!Polton, who worships Dr. Thorndyke and adores clocks, finally tells us his life story, at the urging of Doctors Thorndyke and Jervis. In this way, Polton explains how he was able to help solve two puzzles connected with a tricky case.Polton's personal story has a wonderful Victorian flavor (although this book appeared in l940), including many tribulations, a villainous enemy, and a happy ending.The mystery Polton helps solve revolves around a suspicious fire in Soho and a body charred beyond recognition by the fire. Polton's understanding of the mechanisms of clocks leads to a breakthrough in the case.Polton has by now advanced to the role of \\"technical advisor\\" in the Thorndyke household, and a boy has been hired to relieve him of domestic service. This is all very gratifying to us Polton admirers.In past books, A. Austin Freeman has reflected the prejudices of his times by indulging in anti-Semitic stereotypes, but in this book he redeems himself with some admirable Jewish characters. Polton is quite free of prejudices.Parts of Mr. Polton Explains were written in a bomb shelter during World War II. Some critics consider it Freeman's best novel. I certainly loved it. And if bombs were exploding during its composition, they failed to disturb the Edwardian charm of the prose."},{"Title":"Petrarch's Songbook: Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta : A Verse Translation (Medieval & Renaissance Texts & Studies ; V. 151)","review":"This book, Petrarch's Songbook, is a bilingual edition of the songs and sonnets, originally titled Canzoniere, of Francesco Petrarch - a 14th-century Italian.

I have known about them for decades but had dismissed them as trash without ever having read one because of their reputation for misogyny and the promotion of bondage. During a recent trip to a used book I came across a copy of Priest-Kings of Gor with a cover by Boris Vallejo that intrigued me. It showed a barbarian standing over a slave girl with what I took to be a golden idol of a gigantic insectoid creature in the background. (As it turned out, the &quot;idol&quot; was a living Priest-King!) I was in the mood for &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; so I bought it. I expected to get slam-bang action, lurid writing, a no-brainer story, and lots of politically incorrect pornography. Boy, was I wrong! The story has its share of action but it also has a fair amount of exposition and character development. The writing is far from lurid. It actually has a somewhat stilted feeling to it that I associate more with Victorian prose than with modern writing. The story was reasonably complex and the cultural background was surprisingly detailed. What impresses me most about this book, however, is the convincing presentation of an alien with a truly ALIEN perspective, the Priest-King of Gor, an intelligent creature whose sensorium is based on olfaction rather than vision. I've been reading science fiction for more than 40 years and I can't think of a book that has done it better. Oh, yeah, the bondage stuff. It's there but not as prominent as in the other Gor books, I'm told. And there is no pornography...whatever sex there is in this book (I don't remember any!) occurs offstage. Nevertheless, anyone with feminist views is advised to stay as far away from this book as possible. For everyone else it's a hell of a good read!"},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"I'm not sure why I'm still reading the Gor books. I guess it's partly because Brilliance Audio does such nice productions, but it's also largely because these books have been maligned for years as poorly written sexist-BDSM-erotica, so I can't help but want to see for myself before dismissing them as such. After finishing book 3, Priest-Kings of Gor, here's my take so far:They are not poorly written. The quality of the writing is quite good except for the overuse of phrases such as \\"to my amazement,\\" \\"to my surprise,\\" \\"I found it strange that,\\" \\"I marveled,\\" \\"I was astonished,\\" \\"I looked at him dumb-founded,\\" \\"I was thunder-struck,\\" etc. This may be more noticeable with the audio version, because the narrator, Ralph Lister, reads vivaciously, so these expressions of enthusiasm seem a little overdone. (But generally I appreciate Lister's spirit and recommend the audio version if you want to read the Gor books.)The best aspect of the books, \\"to my surprise,\\" is the world building. John Norman has created a fully detailed alternate world which is fun to explore. In Priest-Kings of Gor, we finally meet the Priest-Kings who rule the planet, and they are not at all what we were expecting. In fact, they're a different species altogether and Norman gives a lot of attention to their language, culture, sensory systems, and lifestyle. Personally, I found the Priest-Kings to be somewhat disturbing (I won't go into details so as not to spoil things), so I didn't enjoy spending so much time with them, but other readers are likely to feel differently.The Gor books are not, so far, erotic. Yeah, there are beautiful scantily-clad pouty women in chains who are kneeling at Tarl Cabot's feet and claiming to be his pleasure slaves, but so far that's all they do. It's pretty silly, really. Which leads me to my next point:Sexist? Yes -- but trying so hard not to be. And, unfortunately, this is where Gor goes wrong. It's too hard to take it seriously because mostly it just feels like a teenage boy's wet dream. That's because Tarl Cabot keeps talking like he's a feminist and denying that any woman is his slave, yet he keeps getting himself in these situations where he accidentally procures a female slave. These ladies are invariably beautiful and proud and are at first contemptuous, insolent, arrogant, and headstrong. Cabot admires their spirit and refuses to consider these wonderful humans to be slaves, but then two things happen:1. He suspects them of treachery (while I'm wondering how they can be faithless if they're not his slaves) and uses this as an excuse to degrade them (\\"Be silent, slave!\\", \\"Wake up, wench!\\"), grab them by their hair and throw them around.2. His refusal to use them as pleasure slaves insults them and makes them pout and demand to know if they're not pretty enough for him (my goodness, aren't they silly?).The end result is that each slave girl becomes submissive and is soon begging to please him (\\"please, master!\\") and insisting that she loves him and wanted to wear his collar all along. Tarl, meanwhile, innocently insists that he doesn't understand.After thinking about it for a while Tarl realizes that \\"every woman in her heart wants to wear the chains of a man\\" and that Gor is a man's world and that women rejoice in this. In Priest-Kings of Gor, he uses natural selection to explain that men have evolved to be courageous and aggressive and that women have evolved to be submissive because they need food and shelter and to be forced to reproduce. If they're too independent, they'll die before breeding. Thus, natural selection favors submissive women who want to belong to a man.Those ideas are intriguing and I won't completely dismiss them out of hand, but then Cabot goes on to suggest that if a woman is grabbed by her hair, thrown down, and raped, she considers this \\"proof of her mate's regard\\" and the \\"expected culmination of her innate desire to be dominated.\\" Cabot's evidence for this is our practice of giving a bride a wedding ring and carrying her over the threshold, which he suggests are analogous to bondage and rape, respectively.I don't know a lot of women who are going to find these ideas acceptable or stimulating, but some do, and that's fine with me. The problem with the Gor books, though, is that they try to propound this idea while trying to make Tarl Cabot out to be a humanist (and specifically a feminist) at the same time, and that doesn't work. It just makes him sound like an idiot.In one scene, a slave girl assigned to take care of him while he's in a particular room says she's hungry and Tarl (who has just met her and didn't know she hadn't eaten) curses himself for not thinking about the feelings \\"of a girl who must be protected and cared for.\\" One minute later, she says something slightly snippy and he disciplines her by not letting her eat dinner. In fact, he's constantly flipping between spouting humanistic sentiments and announcing that a slave girl (who he says isn't his slave girl) needs discipline so she'll learn her place. Um... what place? It's no wonder he doesn't understand these women -- he can't even keep his own philosophies straight in his own head.The whole thing would work better if Tarl Cabot found himself on this misogynist planet and, while being shocked at first, admitted and embraced the fact that all his puerile fantasies had come true and just went with it. Stop making excuses, Tarl. Stop accusing women of secretly wanting to be yelled at, bullied, thrown around, and raped. Gor is a man's world, so just shut up, get out your collars and chains, and have some fun, okay?"},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"In this, the 3rd episode of the Counter-Earth saga, Tarl Cabot has determined to enter the forbidding Sardar mountains where the Priest-Kings, legendary rulers of Gor are believe to reside, and demand an accounting from them for the destruction of his beloved city Ko-Ro-Ba.Cabot learns the true nature of Priest-Kings, and becomes enmeshed in their machinations as a not-unwilling paladin in a power struggle between factions of the Priest-Kings. He eventually learns of the reason for the destruction of Ko-Ro-Ba, and how his own choices may doom or save the Counter-Earth.As of this writing, I just recently re-read this novel, and enjoyed just as much as the first time. Some may pooh-pooh Norman's writing as appealing only to adolescents, and deride his themes and pseudo-psychological theorizations as perverted or denigrating, but Norman's work is pure, unadulterated escapist fiction, where evil receives its just desserts, and you can lose yourself for a time."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"Tarl Cabot, enraged at the Priest-Kings for destroying his city Ko-Ro-Ba (In Outlaw of Gor), finaly reaches the Sardar mountains.

He befriends Misk, and along with other Priest-Kings and slaves is able to defeat the enemy Priest-Kings while restoring the honor of his city at the same time.While not the best of Norman's early books, Priest-Kings of Gor is still head and shoulders above any book written after (Book #18) Blood Brothers of Gor. I liked the storyline and the haughty and tenacious Vika got my blood boiling! I both loved and hated her. Norman created great characters in this book.I reccomend this book to new readers of the series. However, I suggest readers start from the beginning of the series so as to better understand what has occured to that point. Indeed, Outlaw of Gor (Book #2) is a direct prequel to Priest Kings.If you like Sword & Planet styled Science-Fantasy you will not be disappointed in these early Gor books.A.

The creation of the Priest-kings is Norman's best work. Incredible detail makes them believeable. The only chapter that went on too long was Tarl putting Vika in safe keeping (I think Chap 26) in the plastic cage. other than that chapter, the book was darn near perfect.His writing is MUCH better than the first book.

He follows his heart to the Sardar Mountains, the home of the Priest Kings, only to find that they are not the monsters he thought them to be. At least those he befriends are not monsters. He leads a revolt against those who want to destroy human life on Gor.

It's ME again.Now those of you who READ John Norman... let me give you some advice. STOIP reading after about the eights book. K? So far I've read just about all of the things and have the eye-calluses to prove it. Am I a Norman fan? Read my review of Kur of Gor to find out.Priest-Kings of Gor is the Book That Explains Gor. It's also a turning point in the books and turns a pretty good set of books into a Long Story Arc. The plotline is fairly simple, the aliens believable (Uh... well... mostly) and the story moves along at a reasomable clip.This is Early Norman. Like Tarnsman and Outlaw and the next three or four. After that, Norman gets all juiced up about slavery and it goes downhill from there.Tarl cabot has found out (in Outlaw of Gor) that his city Ko-R-Ba has been destroyed. No two stones may stand together (now where'd he get THAT image! Profound!) and it was the Priest-Kings whut dunnit. Soooo being the brave knuckle-brain he is, Cabot goes to beard the lions in their den. The Priest-Kings turn out to be an alien race that OWNS Gor. The Landlords so to speak They get into a political fight, and a war and Gor is almost torn in half (no REALLY) Fun For The Whole Family... that is if your idea of family is a Queen Termite And Her Million Sexless Kiddies! Yeah, imagine THEM around the table at Thanksgiving....Turns out the Nest Mother is dying and without HER there's no THEM (Yea, movie reference here. Sue me!) but before you can yell &#34;Quick, Harry, the Flit!&#34; it is discovered that there's a MALE Priest-King hidden away and a FEMALE EGG Out-There-Somewhere. So Mother dies, the Nest War rages, The Good Bugs win (I think) and Tarl cabot goes rabbiting off with his &#34;I-love-her I-hate her, no, wait, I love her...&#34; arm candy to play Find That Egg.I recommend this book IF you are a fan of Gor and want to know more about the world .. as opposed to Norman's THING-About-Slaves. Do NOT get me started, about not getting HIM started! At least his early works soft-pedal the woman-in-a-collar yawp that poinsons his later works.

Tarl Cabot has suffered the first one on the list, and goes looking for answers, hoping not to die."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"\\"The Priest-Kings of Gor\\" is the third novel of John Norman's Gorean Saga. The first book talked a bit about the priest-kings of the Sardar Mountains who held the planet Gor back technologically. The first book didn't give much info on the priest-kings beyond that they had brought the hero Tarl Cabot from earth to the planet Gor and that from this it was known by Tarl that the priest-kings were either very powerful or had some high tech equipment that they were not giving the Goreans access to. The second novel teases the reader by fooling the reader into thinking that Tarl is going to travel to the Sardar Mountains to see the priest-kings but Tarl gets sidetracked onto another quest to liberate the city Tharna.In the third book of the Gorean Saga, Tarl Cabot finally travels to the Sardar Mountains to meet the priest-kings. The unveiling of the mystery behind them is at the center of this novel. It is revealed to the reader whether the priest-kings are using magic or are using advanced technology. Other mysteries are also unveiled.This book was climactic to me even though it's not even close to being the last book in the series. It was a big deal for me to finally find out what the priest-kings were like. The first two books were fantasy novels that took place on another planet and had no magic. This book however is almost a sci-fi novel. It has some romance but as it always is like on the planet Gor, the woman Tarl meets is not entirely trustworthy."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"This is the best writing Norman has done so far in the Gorean series.I find the dwelling on female slavery tiring. Every female is to die for, everyone of them learns to just love being his slave.This book had enough action to keep me interested. Hopefully he is growing as a writer as the series progresses."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"I have known about the Gor books for ages but dismissed them as trash without ever having read one. At a recent trip to a used book store I came across Priest-Kings of Gor with a cover illo by Boris showing a giant golden insectoid creature (a Priest-King, as I later found out) and bought it because I was in the mood for &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;. To make a long story short, I got the pleasure without the guilt! Is the book offensively sexist? Yes, and if you have feminist leanings, I suggest you stay as far away from this book as possible unless you want to be outraged. (I understand the later books in the series are even worse.) Frankly, I found Norman's ideas on sexual relationships to be too ludicrous to take seriously. Anyway, if you can get past the gender issues, what is left is a rather entertaining book that demolished all of my preconceived ideas. What I expected was non-stop action that was luridly and perhaps poorly written, pandering to male power fantasies, perhaps, but certainly nothing to appeal to the intellect. In fact the writing is far from lurid. It has a detached, somewhat stilted feel to it that I associate more with Victorian prose than with modern writing. There is plenty of action but there is also a considerable amount of exposition and even character development. What impresses me most about the book, however, is Norman's depiction of an intelligent but totally alien creature, the Priest-King, whose world view is olfactory-based rather than visually-based, and their society which is presented in considerable detail. I have been reading science fiction for more than 40 years and I can't think of a book that has done it better than this one.

There was a lot more fantasy in this book three."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"In his third Gor book, Outlaws of Gor, John Norman takes our hero, Tarl, into the nest of Priest-Kings who are the space alien rulers of the planet Gor. We learn that the Preist-Kings (as they are called in Gorian language) are a race of twenty foot ant-like creatures who live in a nest with one queen and thousands of worker ants. Humans are treated like we treat cattle, a race subjugated to the will of a superior species. Most of the work of the nest is done by human slaves. After a couple of million years of scientific research the technology of the Priest-Kings is far beyond that of humans. But the old queen, who was hatched before their science perfected eternal life, is finally dying. Left without a dominant queen the various Priest-King factions engage in a civil war. Our hero, Tarl, sides with the faction that seeks to raise a new queen and male consort to continue the nest. The female egg, we learn, was taken from the nest and hidden among human cities several centuries ago. There is a lot of action between our hero swordsman and various creatures. There is more of Norman's philosophy about dominance, such as human dominance over lower species, and the dominance of strong men over females. Our hero succeeds by avoiding the trap of a human female who uses all the female tricks in an attempt to overturn nature and dominate men. Tarl shows her male strength and she finally succumbs to his manly strength. In the end he leaves the nest of Priest-Kings and returns to the society of humans. The human caste of Initiate Priests is exposed as useful frauds. It was an enjoyable read with comment on human psychology and religion as well as the common themes of male/female relationship."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"Tarzan this is not. Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"PRIEST-KINGS OF GOR","review":"Loved this book...the third in the series.....so descriptive, it was easy reading and flew along.

My advice to readers of _Happy are the Merciful_ is to hang in there through the first half of the novel. It is not told from Blackie's point of view, but from that of an idealistic young district attorney. I actually gave up on this book about halfway into the D.A.'s narrative, because, though well-written, it just wasn't giving me the &quot;Blackie fix&quot; I crave in one of Greeley's novels. It turns out that the information provided in the D.A.'s narrative is information vital for the reader to fully comprehend the case once Blackie steps in. Without it, the story would just not work. Once you reach the portion of the novel where the narrative switches over to Fr. Blackie, you will NOT be disappointed! I am so glad I went back to this book, and would encourage Blackie fans to keep the faith."},{"Title":"Happy Are the Merciful (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":".John and Mary Turner are found dead in their studio, a locked and secure room. Their daughter Clair is arrested and charged with the murder of her parents.In Happy are the Merciful, John Blackwood Ryan, newly appointed auxiliary Bishop of Chicago, investigates a case at the request of his boss, Sean Cardinal Cronin, Archbishop of Chicago. Vital to the Cardinal, is the perceived scandal that may result from the will of a deceased couple. The couple leaves their lavish estate to the archdiocese, since their only child, Clair, was their accused and convicted killer.Bishop Ryan, (Blackie) works the case with Terry Scanlan, Assistant States Attorney. Terry was the prosecutor in the case but now believes Claire to be innocent.Several things I like about this story. First, the characters are fun. In this case a procuring attorney who is like a bull in the china closet of love - he responds to a woman who attracts him by charging her with murder on very weak evidence. Is it any wonder that he is still single? The convicted woman is an heiress who, when charged and arrested for murder selects a lawyer that is handy instead of asking for the best attorney available. I also like the newly appointed Bishop who stumbles around in his investigation and, although astute, purposely appears to lack competence.Second, in this story, Blackie is cupid. He observes the attorney and the heiress and realizes they are falling in love. Both are reluctant because of the situation. Blackie subtly pushes them together.Third, this novel projects the image of a church that really cares about people. Rarely do churches get involved in defending convicted people they believe innocent. Seldom does the church actually lead potential lovers toward one another.Forth, is the locked room. In this case, the murders occurred in a fortress like room with a specially made lock. The company who manufactured the lock made only one key and only that specific key will open the lock. The lock is made to automatically lock when the door is closed.Happy are the Merciful is an excellent mystery. The locked room puzzle is complicated to solve. The tale is full of suspense and intrigue.

The adopted daughter of the wealthy Turners has been sentenced to die for killing the people who had taken her in as a young child. At first, she'd seemed guilty to him, and she had a sizable fortune as a motive. Still, the more time passed, the less guilty she seemed. Of course, falling in love with the accused didn't make it easier for Terry. Bishop Ryan loves a good locked-room mystery and can't resist \\"poking around\\".

I like the happy and intelligent Ryan clan as a whole and have to laugh a little at all the swearing going on around, and by, the Most Reverend John Blackwood Ryan. The book does date itself a little, with a car phone (as opposed to cell phones) and the Compaq 386/20, but those are little and unimportant details. For a good mystery that won't melt your brain trying to keep you guessing, Greeley's always good.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Happy Are the Merciful (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"Andrew Greeley can always be counted on for an entertaining &quot;whodunit&quot;? In this installment of the Blackie Ryan series, Father Ryan is asked to help an idealistic young prosecuting attorney, Terry Scanlan, in the case of Clare Turner. Scanlan was instrumental in getting a conviction against Turner, but in the meantime he has fallen in love with her and is convinced of her innocence. Claire's parents were brutally murdered and she was the only one with motive (a huge inheritance) and opportunity (she was in the house with them at the time of the murder.) Terry asks Father Ryan to use his contacts, influence, and sleuthing skills to help find the real killer and the Bishop is happy to oblige. Greeley fans old and new will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Happy Are the Merciful (Thorndike Press Large Print Americana Series)","review":"mercy I was told several times by my peers is a lost concept.

The author tells the story from the dog's and the hen's points of view, displaying a keen understanding of animal behavior. Sensitive children will identify with the protagonists, and it is impossible to avoid caring deeply about the fate of the two friends as the reader is drawn into their world. The story is suspenseful without being too scary for young children, and also includes a valuable message about accepting those who are &quot;different.&quot; I loved this story as a youngster, and borrowed it dozens of times from my elementary school library. I just re-discovered it now at 36 years of age (I had assumed that it was out of print). It has not lost any of it's charm in the 25 years since I last read it."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"I loved the story!

Anyone who has ever watched canine or chicken behaviour will immediately recognize these protagonists."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"I just finished reading this book to my almost 7 year old who is homeschooled. It is very well written, great literature, lots of information about chickens and their behavior, good social studies and would be a great read aloud for someone studying chickens and eggs and all that good stuff. I really wanted to post a review for the book and give a little warning to parents who might have sensitive children, that there are some graphic parts to the book which I was not expecting. I had to do some serious editing and skipping of paragraphs so as not to upset my daughter. Mauling, thrashings, toes falling off, chickens hanging themselves etc. It has a very sweet heart but it may not be for animal loving sensitive children."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"This year will be my 10th year reading this book outloud at the dining room table!

You enchanted my family and I with your \\"Journey from Peppermint Street\\", and now I am searching out all your books.We have been reading your stories in the evening, aloud, and your word usage is so perfect for read-alouds - your style helps the little ones stay focused, while your ability to render complex emotions - from a dog, a man of few words, and a chicken - has us older ones spellbound.The story is a quiet one, but lovely. A lone man. His favorite hen. A dog looking for a home...themes of friendship, honesty, integrity, hard work, hunger, home, injustice, and kindness...It all takes place in the 40's? 50's? A glimpse into a simpler time perhaps, but also reads as a timeless story...a man trying to do his best in a complicated world...There's adventure and disaster, and crisis and resolution. There's terrible misunderstandings, and wonderful moments of truth.And then there's the amazing dogginess and chickeness.(My family has flirted with the idea of raising chickens, and your book has helped us realize what an enormous endeavor that would be...worthwhile maybe, but enormous, somehow I never realized how chickeny it would be to have chickens running around acting all, well, chicken all the time.)I think you're wonderful Mr DuJong. Glad you took the time to write what you did, wish you were still around to write some more.Yours is a strong and lovely voice in this wild world of ours.Sincerely,Autumn"},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"After reading one of De Jong's books (The Wheel on the School) as a child I was thrilled to find more by him on Amazon. Can't recommend his books more highly. His use of the English language is beautifully crafted."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"I just pre-read this book before reading it to my son and I love it! Most of what I would say has been covered by others, but I did want to point out that if you don't care much for chickens, or don't 'get' why some people do, then you probably will not appreciate this book. General animal lovers should enjoy it, though.I love chickens and raise them and, like the man in the story, I talk to them whenever I am around them. This book does a very good job displaying both chicken and canine behavior. We had a dog once who 'mothered' our chickens whether they liked it or not.In response to the review about this book not being good for sensitive children, I would just like to mention that the best way to deal with death is to start as a child and with the death of animals, pets or otherwise. If we protect children from the reality of death it will just make it harder for them later on. So I hope those with sensitive children do figure out how to help them deal with this very important topic."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"I recently read this book out loud to my family- husband and kids 8,5,3 and and infant that slept through most of it. We read it in one- yes one- day in the car because no one wanted me to stop. We have a small flock of chickens and a dog, so we could totally relate to the animals in the story. It portrays small farm life and the personality of chickens very well. It's a bittersweet story, full of suspense, with a very happy ending."},{"Title":"Along came a dog","review":"This is a really, really nice story. Other reviews state it's not well written. I wouldn't say it's not well written. It's written in a manner reflective of the setting. The story moved along at a good pace, with suspense and uplifting moments. It often leaves the reader wondering what will happen next. We had alot of chuckles! Highly recommend!

The book teaches you enough theory to understand the concepts, but doesn't get bogged down in a lot of mathematics. It's easy to read, full of good example problems, and has answers at the back of the book for every other problem at the end of the chapters so you can check your homework solutions. There are worked application example problems at the end of every chapter, and application problems in the homework sets too. The appendix has all the thermal propeties you need to work the homework problems, and there are even curve fit equations of liquids and gases that you can use in computer programs for convection problems. There were a few errors in the book, but they weren't serious. I think that a person could even learn heat transfer on his own without a professor if he had this book, but it always helps to have someone there to explain it when you have questions.

In the guise of a week-by-week account of one summer in his garden Charles Dudley Warner waxes philosophical on religion, society, animals, schoolboys, hunters and neighbors as well as plants. Its style will feel familiar to readers of the later literary garden-musings of E.B. White and Elizabeth Von Arnim. Although Warner died in 1900 his language is remarkably fresh and the complaints and joys of gardening familiar. The side comments on women's suffrage only remind one with surprise that in spite of the similarities he was living in a very different time.I found the book when tracking down the following Warner quote, \\"Regrets are idle; yet history is one long regret. Everything might have turned out so differently!\\" and in reading the book discovered other gems such as, \\"Nothing shows one who his friends are, like prosperity and ripe fruit. I had a good friend in the country, whom I almost never visited except in cherry-time. By your fruits you shall know them.\\" It is the gentle humor and subtle wisdom of his observations that elevate Warner's book above the ordinary. Being, at present, a city dweller transplanted from childhood gardens, I found reading the book a great comfort."},{"Title":"My summer in a garden","review":"Charles Dudley Warner appears to have lived an enviable life. He was educated when most men did not have an opportunity to become educated. He was editor and publisher of the 'Hartford Courant' and lived in Hartford next door to Samuel Clements. Warner was not only a neighbor but a good friend of Mark Twain with whom he co-authored THE GILDED AGE, and with whom he seems to have shared a sense of humor. Warner's writing is insightful and funny, but not always politically correct according to 21st Century U.S. standards. Allen Gurganus introduces the book with an overly long essay.In MY SUMMER IN A GARDEN Warner shares 19 weeks of life in his garden (one growing season). His garden is located in Hartford at the edge of a game preserve. During the course of the summer, President Grant is in Hartford and stops by for a visit. As the men sit in Warner's yard, Grant says he can hardly wait to retire to his own garden as he is fed up with politics. Warner has been fighting pusley in his garden and he and Grant discuss the advantage of inviting immigrants who eat pusley and would soon rid the country of both problems.Warner has various encounters with: hunters tracking quail who stray from the game preserve, one of whom claims he is looking for a lost chicken; small boys who eat berries from his vines and gather nuts from his trees; birds who attack his pea pods, the neighbor's hens who range too freely until he is looking for one to fill a pot; and the owner of a cow pastured in his yard. In spite of drought, theft, and green worms, at the end of the summer Warner is able to put aside enough vegetables to feel he has accomplished something and then his wife Polly takes credit for the work.Of interest to me is that more than 100 years after Warner published his book, U.S. gardeners can still complain about some of the same things Warner complained about--and more. Most gardeners know that the U.S. has been infested with a whole array of pests and diseases that were not around when Warner gardened. For example, three new plagues including the Varroa mite have attacked American honey bees since the 1980s. Partly these attacks are owing to the introduction of containerized shipments that cannot be inspected and may hold verboten materials (plants, animals, insects). Partly these problems are owing to flagrant violations by individuals who believe U.S. laws concerning the transport of \\"foreign\\" plants do not apply to them. Warner's worries about green worms in his celery, witch grass in his potato hills, and pulsey seem mild in comparison."},{"Title":"My summer in a garden","review":"Nicely written and witty book about the pleasures of gardening and its relationship to other aspects of life."},{"Title":"My summer in a garden","review":"I was intrigued by the title and sold by the exerpt. Charles Dudley Warner is fun. But skip the opening 30 pages or so. It's not that the other gentlemen don't write well, but they're not exactly fun. Besides, I didn't buy it to read a discussion of his more boring, 'professional' work in all those pages numbered with tiny Roman numerals. So go directly to Warner's first essay (which is the exerpt) on page 11."},{"Title":"My summer in a garden","review":"I didn't know until I actually had this book in my hands that it was written in the nineteenth century. Those are my favorite reads. I love getting a firsthand account of life in the past.As a flower gardener, I'm always interested in what flowers gardeners grew in the past. Although Charles Dudley Warner writes about his veggie garden, it turns out we have a lot in common. I was delighted to read about the toad in his garden. Oh, how I wish I had one in my garden eating pests! We disagree about birds. Perhaps because he was a veggie gardener and I'm a flower gardener. He considered birds pests because they ate his produce. I like them because they consume pests.He had to deal with some very different \\"pests\\" than most gardeners today. At least the ones who garden in my area. We don't have to worry about cows or chickens wandering into our gardens or boys stealing our produce.The biggest difference between then and now was a visit from the President. Try to envision what it would be like to have the President visit your garden. The entourage. The Secret Service. The paparazzi. When the President visited Charles Dudley Warner's garden, he came alone. He toured the garden, enjoyed some liquid refreshment and jokingly offered the job of Head Gardener at the White House to his host.It's anecdotes like that that draw me to books written long ago. I can understand why people say that they hate reading about history. Who wants an endless recitation of dates and wars and empires? It's so much more interesting to read about the every day lives (and gardens) of every day people (and gardeners)."},{"Title":"My summer in a garden","review":"This is a scanned copy of a book which is available for less money in a much nicer typeset version from the Modern Library Gardening Series. A friend accidentally bought this one as a gift for me mostly because of a flaw in Amazon's search engine. It arrived with a cover that had a picture of a mountain on it (not an interesting one at that) and a note that pages may be blurred or missing because of the scanning process. I do not appreciate the \\"publisher\\" showing so little regard for an author's work (it is in the public domain) as to sloppily scan old pages and slap any old cover on it. The book is also available for free through the Gutenberg project. I have replaced it with the ML one, which is edited by Michael Pollan and includes a nice introduction. Please honor Charles Dudley Warner by purchasing the properly published version of his work.

This delightful book celebrates Colorado's 100 plus years of statehood with rhymes and facts about selected Coloradoans, historical landmarks, natural resources, and even the state song. The text is creatively and well written, the corresponding illustrations are well chosen, complementary, and beautifully done, and the entire book is a treasure to read. Each new alphabetical letter that is introduced is so interesting that you want to immediately turn to the next page to see what the following letter represents!Many of the well-known sites (especially to visitors of the state) are represented, such as Mesa Verde, Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, Four Corners, and the Royal Gorge. But you will be surprised by the numerous additional facts about Colorado that you didn't know about such as herbal teas, the poetess who wrote \\"America the Beautiful\\", rodeos, the Pony Express, and even bicycles! Bravo to Louise Whitney for her authorship and extensive knowledge and to Helle Urban for her lovely and life-like illustrations throughout the book and the cover. You can really see in reading Whitney's creative work that she holds Colorado close to her heart.This book is not only for children of all ages; adults will also enjoy the illustrations and facts about Colorado. It is a real treat to sit back and read about a state well traveled and loved by many. \\"C is for Centennial\\" is a splendid book that needs to be in homes and on the shelves of school and community libraries. It will prove to be a valuable resource book for students who may be assigned the task of writing a state report in their classrooms."},{"Title":"C Is for Centennial : A Colorado Alphabet (Alphabet Series)","review":"This book is just wonderful. I loved reading it and enjoyed the illustrations. The illustrator got the feel of Colorado just right. Younger children will love the rhyming couplets, and will try to memorize them on the spot. Middle school children will find the sidebar texts interesting and full of fun facts about Colorado. As a Colorado resident, I especially enjoyed discovering the places and people the author featured.

This book is yet another one which neglects the eastern third of the state.I hate to break it to the author and the Colorado residents who live west of I-25, but the High Plains didn't secede from the state of Colorado and join Kansas or something. The prairies are a part of Colorado and they're not going anywhere.There is a short mention of the plains in the letter C: \\"C is for Colorado, the Colorful Centennial State. We have high mountains and broad plains and a history that makes us great.\\"That's it.The author mentioned Bigelow Herbal tea, the Pony Express, and Square Dancing. I somehow think that these aren't as important to Colorado as 1/3 of its land area.There is no mention of farmers or homesteaders or grain elevators or anything remotely related to the Plains of Colorado.The Colorado Plains have a rich heritage of their own. It is sickening how no one mentions them or cares about them. This book is no exception.I did give it an extra star because the illustrations are beautiful.I'm glad that we only took this out of the library.

It is unbelievable that such a young generation had to go through such pain and hardship at such young ages, my heart went out to them many times.

I, of course, read it myself along with her. This book does tell an unrelentingly sad story but I totally draw the line at saying it is \\"well written\\", as some other reviewers have stated. Honestly, a six year old who has been forced to walk for days across the desert wearing nothing but lice filled red underwear suddenly notes \\"at three o'clock in the afternoon...\\" something happened. How does the author expect anyone to believe this narrative with jarring nonsense like this? I also feel that the graphic description of the rape of a small child has no place in 9th grade reading material. Our literature teachers are supposed to be teaching our children to love literature. They should not force feed their social agenda on our kids and kill any love of reading by forcing a series of utterly depressing and horrifying books like this one on our kids. I am very sorry for the suffering in Sudan. I am sorry that humans are cruel and commit crimes, such as those depicted in this book. Is this a well written book? No. Is this a good read?

The voices of each narrator are very distinct, and I particularly enjoyed the early chapters about life in a typical Sudanese village (before the civil war). This book is not only about the slaughter of rural Sudanese, but is also a nostalgic look at a lifestyle that is fast disappearing on this earth--where humans and animals live in close proximity to eachother, and where communities raise children together.

Our book club was touched both by the simplicity and intimacy derived from the first person accounts and by the strong values conveyed--lessons on resilience, family, loyalty, and determination.This is an excellent choice for a book club, and also for older students (high school level). There is much to discuss. Educators especially will find the book a good read, since even as they are nearly starving to death and wrought with disease, these young boys placed a top priority on becoming educated."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"I knew that a first person narrative of the harrowing journey of the lost boys would be compelling, but I was stunned by the way that these narratives pulled us behind the cultural filter of the storyteller. Too often we read of these matters from our own Western perspective, seeing the actions or thought process of the protaganists as \\"interesting.\\" Here, we come to think and see the world in the cultural frame of tribal custom and thought, and appreciate the time and space perspectives that fed the survival of these young men.I stayed up late into the night to find my way through the desert with the narrators, disappointed only by the paucity of detail on their assimilation in the US. Well worth reading for anyone wanting to be inside the saga of the lost boys."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This book is an insipirational read. They young boys in this book experienced so much pain, hardship, and relentless fear and despite all of that they managed to emerge with hope and optimism and go on to lead very productive lives. Students in middle school and high school would be served well by reading this in their schools as they could perhaps find real heroes to emulate. Though the descriptions are vivid, it is not brutal and therefore I believe young people could read this without being traumatized by its content."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This book is really awesome because i learned to be grateful for the things i have, instead of complaining about the things i dont hav i learned to take some time to be thankful."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This is a wonderful-horrible book of hope-despair. It teaches history while providing perspective and clearly shows how life can zigzag from contentment to torture to growth. The book is a treasure chest holding the lost childhood of thousands of children."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"I knew little about the Lost Boys of Sudan but this book gave me a real account of how these young people fought to survive in a world of war and hell. The authors' stories make the reader realize how simple life really is for all of us and how much we take for granted. These young boys survived through total deprivation, starvation and illness but their turmoil did not make them give up hope of what may lie over the next hill. Their determination is chronicled in three authors' perspectives that made the book exciting to read as I personally cheered them on in their personal journeys for survival."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky is the captivating story of three boys: Benson, Benjamin, and Alepho, who must flee their homes when they are very young children due to a civil war between the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army and the country's government. The book follows the lives of each of the boys through alternating chapters, as the chaos of war seperates and reunites them. They go days without food and water and walk thousands of miles, living on the edge of death as other boys die of thirst, malnutrition, war, and animal attacks. When they finally find relative safety and a home in the Kakuma refugee camp, they must contend with lack of food and water, corruption and oppression by the Kenyan camp workers.This is a book that will fill you with waves of emotion, from guilt to sadness to anger and amazement. Despite these varying emotions, I still could not put the book down. I found that it made my first world problems seem trivial in the face of what these children and this country has gone through. It was amazing that children as young as 8 or 9 had to act as adults and give up their own resources to help the younger children survive. Most surprisingly, I smiled at the optimism that the boys had despite their situation. They clung onto their childhood and were happy and played like children when they were able, even though they never stopped facing terrible adversity.The book is amazingly well written, with an authentic tone that reflects the authors' true connection to their childhood experiences. The only thing that subtracts from this novel's brilliance is that sometimes the changing narrators got a bit confusing, as the tone of the narratives sounded similar and there weren't very many striking differences between them. In the same vein, I feel that each of the characters were not as well developed as they could have been; although this may have just been a consequence of the situation as the characters were focused almost solely on survival.I believe that They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky is a must read. It is very important to know their story and learn about the genocide that is killing and displacing thousands of Sudanese people. I hope it will transform you the way it has transformed me."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This book is about boys in Sudan who were made to run away from their village homes due to a terrible civil war in Sudan fought over religion. These boys are from the Dinka tribe and the Arabs want to convert them. This book is written by the boys themselves, so the accounts are very genuine and make it feel very real (because it really is real and is happening). The details are quite gruesome at times, but it shows how horrible their lives were. The book covers their story from the time they were in their villages, to their terrible journey across the desert, to various refugee camps where life was still horrible and finally a UNHCR program facilitates them coming to America to basically start a whole new life.The story, as mentioned before, is told through the accounts of three boys. These accounts were compiled by an American woman who was a mentor to them in San Diego. The descriptions are very detailed and really make you feel what is happening to the boys. At least, it did that to me. It is surprisingly very well written, and actually made me want to read it to the end, as opposed to making me want to stop reading it and complain that it was just a bunch of whining, like some other books about suffering are. This makes you very emotionally invested in the characters, and nothing is considered whining. Their feelings are justified, and I cannot recall one instance of them complaining in this account. That's what makes it so readable.The only problem (which isn't really a problem) I had with this book is how sad it made me. Which is supposed to happen. You read about a lot of suffering in many fiction books, but reading a nonfiction book about that suffering, coming straight from boys who experienced it for no fault of their own really drives it in. There is a lot of suffering in the world, and not much is being done to solve it. The book made me do more research on these boys and I found out what is done for them, and I realized that there isn't much done to help them. Anyway, back to the book.I think this is a very very good book to read for anyone. It doesn't matter that it is a little depressing, because that's how their lives are. And it actually keeps you interested in the story because you want to know what happens to the boys always. Even now, I'm curious to how these boys are doing in life after the part the book covers. The introduction is worth reading as well to get some background information on these boys, and it also reassures the wellbeing of these boys in the end. This is a book I would recommend to any friend to read."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"Even as a ninth grader, this book reached into my mind and made me feel the hardship and sorrow the main characters went through. Some young readers might judge that a nonfictional book must be boring and have no thrills. Not this one. The journey of three little boys feels unique because it shows a completely different culture. \\"They Poured Fire On Us From the Sky\\" is truly inspiring and adventurous to all ages of readers."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"It is hard for me to write a review. These children know the meaning of pain and suffering beyond my comprehension. The book is beautifully written from first hand experiences and the stories come together in perfect harmony. The determination of these three boys (grown men now) to survive the impossible will stir emotions you aren't prepared for. Not only read it, but pass it along or buy several copies to hand out. You will want to help - there is no way you can go back to your regular life after reading this. Their stories will change you from the inside out."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This is a book that should be read by every American. It's hard to write a review without editorializing and comparing our country and our children with what happened to these courageous, persevering young boys left to fend for themselves in the chaos of war. In a destitute country, facing starvation, disease and death every day for years on end, this is an amazing story of triumph for those who survived."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This is a great book and difficult to put down. These boys are absolutely amazing and it's hard to think about what they and others were going through just to survive while most of us on this earth were carrying about our daily lives. Young boys, some toddlers, separated from their parents, traveling miles in the hopes of making it to a better, safe place. The ways that these young children adapt to their situations (thirst, hunger, illness, death, captivity)and the way that they help each other is inspirational, but so sad at the same time.

A wake-up call to a continuing genocide in a land we have neglected in our moral slumber. I can only pray that it will be widley read , and that it will alert us all to the crimes that the Sudanese govenment habitually commits against it's own citzens on account of their skin color and religion.This might just lead our politicians to take some kind of action to stop this outrage."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This book is at once a book of triumph, of tragedy, and of great sadness.It is a tale of triumph because the three young boys, now young men were able to survive, even prosper enough to get out of a horrible situation to living in the United States and are now published authors.It is a tale of tragedy because the situation in their country was so horrible and then made so much worse by the actions of the Government in arming a rebel army intent on genocide merely because this group was of a different tribe.It is a tale of sadness because this situation has been repeated so many times across sub-saharan Africa since the departure of the colonial powers in the years after World War II.This is the story of one group of children. It is only one incident among many. And this book concentrates on telling this story, which it does very well. This book puts a human face, the face of children five and seven years old, on a horrible incident.For a broader picture, not only of this incident in the Sudan, but of the numerous similar conflicts consider reading The Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith also published by Public Affairs Press.

It is truly a testament to the enormous capacity of the spirit, the power of one's soul to overcome adversity, and a lesson in courage and faith. I expected to be upset by these boys' stories, instead I was inspired by their strength and resilience. After reading this book, I felt I could handle any trial life sent my way. I had a renewed sense of gratitude, a greater appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy and often take for granted, and a better understanding of the importance of maintaining hope and faith during trying times.

These were such very young children struggling to survive. The book is sad, funny, and inspiring. Thank you all for taking the time to write this book- it will be passed thru our family.

THEY POURED FIRE ON US FROM THE SKY is the vivid description of the war in southern Sudan as seen through the eyes of three little boys, Benson, Benjamin and Alephonsion - who suddenly became homeless orphans and were forced to trek across Sudan to Kenya and Ethiopia without food or water. No longer having a father to frighten away the animals or a mother to prepare food, these five-year-old boys had to figure out how to survive. In addition to the horrors brought on by nature in the form of heat, no water, no food, hunting animals, biting snakes and insects, they soon discovered that people were not very nice to boys traveling alone. Frequently their food, clothing and blankets were taken from them or they were beaten and driven away. Even their own soldiers mistreated them and they found that after surviving so much and traveling so far, they were not exactly welcome in Kenya or Ethiopia. But survive they did to come to the United States to begin life anew.This gut-wrenching book is a real page-turner and I found myself unable to put it down, even when the stories brought tears and indescribable anger. It was a real eye-opener to read of United Nations aid gone astray as locals took the best for themselves and left the refugees starving. There were, of course, the good people who helped the refugees with food and transportation and even lost their jobs because of it. If you never believed that war could change ordinary people into selfish monsters, then this is the book for you. The book is well written, flows well, and the transitions are so smooth that sometimes I found myself going back to the beginning of the chapter to see which lost boy was telling this particular portion of the story. There were amusing sections such as when the boys were preparing to go the US and they were attempting to learn about flushing toilets. One of them didn't remember what the book instructions said and managed to flood the restroom at the airport terminal. The things we take for granted get a new life when viewed through these boys' eyes. I recommend this book for everyone in America.Reviewed by alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This is a book that I was afraid would be too painful to read.

These children did not grow up watching Sesame Street.The richness of the language, and the sensitiivity with which these boys describe how they survived experiences that would break an adult, just blows me away. And having had the privilege to follow their careers since arriving in America, I am astounded by how far they have come and the wonderful things that they are doing with the precious gift of life they have managed to escape with.I think that any book club interested in a truly powerful novel should pick this book.

I hope my students will see themselves in these heroic boys.Readers who are willing to open themselves to the experiences of this book will find their views of themselves, war, and Africa deepened.

I've read a few other books to better understand the plight of the Sudanese, and this has been the best one, with \\"Slave\\" a close second. If you like this book, you will also like \\"Slave\\" by Mende Nazer."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"When combined with personal life stories, war is impossible to ignore.

It gives one a better appreciation for the freedoms we have here in America. It is a story of faith having been tried by fire.I tells in gripping detail about the lives of 3 young boys escaping from the civil war in Sudan and all of the horrifying things they had to face on their escape southern Sudan to Ethiopia, and back and then to Kenya.They had to cross dangerous rivers and desserts, live in and out of refugee camps. Despite everything, they had to endure they managed to hang on to their humanity, sacrificing and helping others.The story even sheds some light on the unfortunate amount of corruption that prevents a lot of humanitarian aid from reaching those in need.After reading this one simply cannot help being so impressed with the boys' courage and perseverance in the face of everything happening to them."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"This book contains an amazing story- one ALL older children should read and adults as well. Seeing what these LITTLE boys as well as all the other Sudanese people went through will shock you and hopefully change the way you think about things. We complain about so many little things like the crack in our iPhone screen, or gas prices, or the fact that they are out of our favorite ice cream. These boys were surrounded by death, fear, poverty, and terrible conditions during a time of unspeakable terror for many people. They endured hardships and came out the other end and are creating a better life for themselves. The way they wrote their stories makes the book an easy read although it may bring tears to your eyes!! I have rotated it between each of my teenage children- knowing they need to see what life can be like for some many others. READ this ... It will be a story that will stay with you forever..."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"Reviewed By Lisa Panetta-Sawaya,MA, Michigan, USAThis book is the true life story of three boys forced to leave their homes in the Sudan because of the tragic civil war that began in 1983. It is the story of what happens to these children, who later become known as, \\"the lost boys of Sudan,\\" as they escape to the forest, the desert, traveling one thousand miles across the country of Sudan into Ethiopia, until they reach refugee camps and eventually come to the United States. At the beginning of the book, there is an African Proverb that reads: \\"When two elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled.\\" The three authors express that it is them- the children- that are the grass and were trampled, while the adults were as the elephants, fighting the war. \\"The name lost Boys came to be when our village was attacked by fierce Arab horsemen. We, little boys, spewed out of the blazing village like a colony of ants disturbed in their nest. We ran in different directions not knowing where we are going. We gathered some fruits for our breakfast and lunch. We, little boys, were so messy, all chaos and cries filling the dark, fiercely lightless night.\\" The book is an effort to record; the history of the authors beginnings in a small Sudanese village, the tragic civil war that forced them into a daily fight for survival, and finally, a means for dealing with all of this trauma while transitioning into a new life here in the United States.After resettling in San Diego, CA, USA through The International Rescue Committee, a nationwide resettlement agency, the three authors, meet their mentor, Judy Bernstein. Through this mentoring relationship, Judy learns of the awful experiences and triumphs, these three young men have lived through. One day, she takes them shopping at Walmart and buys them clothes and notebooks. She offers, that they can write down their experiences in the United States. They agree, and add that they will also write stories about being forced to leave their village as little boys. The book is divided into three parts: Part One: The Village of Juaol, Part Two: Like Ants Spewing from the Nest, and Part Three: Lost Boys. Each part contains personal accounts by each of the three authors. Part One recalls the authors lives before the war. They lived as farmers and were called \\"Dinka.\\" They came from the Bahr al Ghazal region of southern Sudan. The recounts are moving and beautiful. Benson tells of his mother being the best cook and a winemaker. \\"...but above all she was the best cook. From the wine to the porridge, the other wives praised her skill. She was known for making different kinds of wine on New Year's Eve... A lot of people came and finished her wine early, which made my mother happy.\\"(5) He also shares the painful and powerful story of his own circumcision. Through out their journey, these boys display deep love for their families, loyalty, wisdom, strength, perseverance, courage, faith and an unwavering hope for the future. \\"...Joseph had saved my life so many times. Now here I was in a safe place, too weak to walk, when he might be on the front lines already. And Benjamin, his leg so bad in that dirty jail. To Benson, I owed my life. He could have escaped with the others but stayed behind to nurse me and now he was stuck...\\"(233)The authors have created this book, in the hopes that it will be a multi-layered legacy; a record of their childhood, a voice for all of those who have experienced the tragedies of Africa's longest ongoing war, and ultimately, a way for them to heal and begin a new and better life. They have succeeded in educating all readers about the huge loss of life, and horrible injustices suffered by innocent children because of this war. This war was waged by governments whose primary goals include power, money, and control over natural resources, while the cost includes the lives of over 2 million human beings. \\"Ignited in 1983, Africa's longest-running war is still going on. North against south, Muslims against animists and Christians, Arabs against blacks. Huge oil reserves in southern Sudan being held by the northern Muslim government fuel the war. Race, religion and riches. The same things people always kill each other over. With no solution in sight, 2 million blacks in the south have already died. More casualties than Angola, Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo, Liberia, the Persian Gulf, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Rwanda combined. Two million dead. Five million displaced and at risk. A holocaust happening today...\\"(xvii)"},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"The raw story of these children, caught amidst forces much greater than themselves, is a compelling one impossible to fathom for those of us living in the safety of life in the US.

They tell it with eloquence yet raw honesty, which demonstrates how they were able to grow and learn under such extreme circumstances. The tone of the writing made me feel almost as if the authors were talking to me. The writing style is heartfelt yet straightfoward. It cuts right to it.Benson, Alepho, and Benjamin share their personal stories, putting faces, names, and feelings to what often is only covered in the news as a brief report. The authors' stories are their own, yet they also echo the stories of the thousands of Lost Boys of Sudan as well as the women, children, and men affected by civil war in any country.This book is educational, touching, sad, and inspirational.

Never could I understand the severity and magnitude of the Sudanese crisis until I read this book. Each boy has a unique way of writing their story, and each one grabbed my heart strings. It was worth every penny and all the time it took to read this true story. It doesn't go into to much detail about the political situation in Sudan, rather a simple view of what it would be like to be a child in the middle of a civil war. This book should be required reading for each high school literature class."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"They Poured Fire On Us From The Sky is the story of three young Sudanese men-\\"Lost Boys\\"-and their story of life as a refugee. The US government defines a refugee as \\"[Someone] who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\\" They Poured Fire On Us From The Sky eloquently offers the human definition of what a refugee is, capturing the true story of three young boys and their struggle to reach safety.They Poured Fired is a unique is both captivating and horrifying as it provides a first hand account of survival through war, hunger, and life in exile. The story is complicated by the fact that the survivors were children--little boys--who fled their homes as orphans and walked more than 1,000 miles before reaching safety.Despite the book's heavy themes and topics, They Poured Fire does not dwell on past pain and things lost.

I consider myself well read. Therefore, when I say this was the most moving book I have ever read, I do not say so lightly. I had the honor of meeting one of the authors, Benjamin Ajak, at a recent conference. While his English is not articulate, his message is gut wrenchingly moving. This book is not for the faint of heart. It is not a summer beach romance. It is the story of the survival of the human spirit at its most base level. It is both appalling and inspiring. It is a must read. If you are not a humanitarian before you read it, you will be after you read it."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"I'm in the middle of reading this book and have to agree it's a great read. I can't imagine a full grown adult going through this experience let alone children. This book really does give a voice to all those lost boys that lived through this turbulent time. It's so sad that so many of them were left orphaned but inspiring that many of them were able to survive through sheer force of will. This book is giving me a renewed appreciation of life and reminding me that were stronger than we think we are. This is an ultimate survival story that I think many people should read. I think this would also be a great read for young people 13 and above. I for one plan on sharting this book with many people in my life."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"After hearing about the story of the Lost Boys of Sudan several years ago, I read this book. This true story, written in their own words, is about three of the Lost Boys who were separated from their families during Sudan's civil war at a young age. They spent months walking across the harsh land of Sudan, fighting wild animals, disease, hunger, thirst and guns. Their story of determination and bravery moved me immensely. They survived things we can't even imagine and they did it without adult supervision, supporting each other as they went. I just reread the book and was moved again by this powerful book.

Some pages will make you want to laugh out loud, while others will make you want to cry. Told as a first-hand account of young boys (5-7 years old at the start) fleeing ethnic warfare, leaving friends and families behind. They travel across southern Sudan in search of refuge, teetering on the verge of starvation. Making it to refugee camps is not always as comforting as they had hoped, and they often escape in search of something better. The authors account their constant search for family, often the only thing that keeps them going. The story finishes with their arrival in the United States and leaves the reader feeling desperate for the situation that has hardly improved in their homeland of South Sudan."},{"Title":"They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan","review":"The colorful writing by the three boys from their time when they were less than 10 in Sudan really held my interest. They had a peaceful life in the beginning of their story. I was impressed by their knowlege of nature acquired through experience passed down from generation to generation, how they lived off the land.Then the invasions started. Their life was never to be the same again. Moms, dads and sisters disappeared and the boys were on the run - for years. The story is riveting, the countless times they were in danger of losing their lives from the Islamic invasion and starvation. A relative few got out alive.I benefitted from reading this. How many times I've complained of circumstances in the USA, nothing compared with what they went through.

This cruel, naked, poignant, impossible story of the Lost Boys journey through hell sounds more like a Hollywood screenplay than the recollections of real little boys. Were it a Hollywood script, no studio would buy it because the story is too horrific and grotesque to be believable.Unfortunately for the book's subjects it was all too true. Fortunately for us, they have chosen to share their memories with us so that we may begin to grasp the severity and horror of their journey. They've done the world a great service in doing so. I can only hope that the sharing in some ways helps their healing.This book is all at once gripping, repulsive and mesmerizing. I often found the content beyond my comprehension. For little boys to be ripped from their families to wander aimlessly, ill and starving, dodging bullets, encountering wild beasts who would have gladly eaten them for dinner, and to be at the mercy of the desert sun--often without water-- is a fate one would not wish on an animal. I imagine few of us have spent even mere moments of our lives knowing the terror that was these boys reality for years.I must admit I was unaware of the extent of the Sudanese holocaust, and for that I am ashamed. I know this book has raised awareness and for that I thank the author, Judy Bernstein, for recognizing the need to tell this story and for the hard work of getting it done.To Benson, Alephonsion and Benjamin, I hope you are still able to love and trust in a world where it would be completely understandable if you were not.

But each time I saw it in the book store it was calling me to pick it up. They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky... what an unusual name for a book. I wondered what it meant. And what is the significance of the red shorts? The book is so well written and powerful with just the perfect tone that even middle school children on up should read it.
