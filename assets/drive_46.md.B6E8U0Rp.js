In lyrical prose, Lee's extraordinary story begins in the 1950s when his parents fled China's political turmoil for Indonesia. Along with many other Chinese members of the population, his family was persecuted under President Sukarno. Falsely accused and charged for crimes against the state, his father spent a year and a half in jail as a political prisoner, half of that time in a leper colony. While his entire family was being transported to a prison colony, they escaped and fled to Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and back to Hong Kong where his father rose to prominence as an evangelical preacher. Eventually, the family sought asylum in the United States in 1962. When the author was six, they emigrated to a small town in western Pennsylvania where his father became a Presbyterian minister. This reissued edition contains a new foreword by the author and never-before-seen photos of the family from different stages of their journey. Li-Young Lee is the author of four critically acclaimed books of poetry that have garnered such awards as the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award from New York University; the 1990 Lamont Poetry Selection; the Writer's Award from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation; and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Lannan Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sixaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Lady","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Play Learn- Touch and Feel Colors (Ages 2+)","description":"?

The book is a collection of several original research papers written by well-known authors and experts in the field of the expertise from different countries on very important and emergin topics in international accounting. An important topic covered in the book is adopting and implementing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Transition Economies. This topic is particularly important for countries that do not have financial and technical resources to establish their own accounting and reporting standards. So, it is of critical importance for such countries to have a model to use for their financial reporting. Due to the International Accounting (IAS) Regulation being adopted by the European Parliament in 2002 (NO 1606/2002), listed companies in the EU capital markets were required to adopt IAS by 2005. This regulation is a revolutionary one, and thereofre, there is a need for a research that focus on lobbying activities towards the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). This book has an extensive chapter that focuses on the content analysis of the common letters received by the IASB. Fair Value Accounting has gained some special interest in recent years.

While she is no small success at the trade, she leaps at a new job opportunity for herself and Fru Schleswig, as cleaning ladies for the wealthy widow Krak. But mysteries abound at Fru Krak's dark old mansion. The basement appears to be haunted, townspeople claim to have seen the dead Professor Krak walking the streets as a ghost, and there are stories of desperate souls who paid the professor a visit and never emerged. In fact, as Charlotte will discover, there is a simple explanation for all this: the basement is home to a time machine. When their cunning investigations land them in trouble, Charlotte and Fru Schleswig find themselves catapulted through time and space to modern-day London, and there their adventures truly begin. With the minxy, intrepid Charlotte, Liz Jensen introduces a heroine every bit as memorable as Louis Drax. And with My Dirty Little Book of Stolen Time, she delivers yet another outlandishly entertaining novel, in which the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of spacetime proves no match for human ingenuity and earthly passion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t8YO5902Ib0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Stories of Prague: King Bohush and The Siblings","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pipeline Construction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Night flight to Hanoi;: War diary with 11 poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u7miyQEACAAJ&dq=Night+flight+to+Hanoi%3B:+War+diary+with+11+poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zagreb Croatian Spring","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Black tiger at Indianapolis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PC04YgEACAAJ&dq=Black+tiger+at+Indianapolis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon: Man of War, Man of Peace","description":"Napoleon as a man of war was perhaps the cause of more men's deaths than any other warleader before him. The full story of the disruption caused by almost 20 years of warfare will never be told in all its harrowing detail. Across Europe villages were razed by fire and cities destroyed by cannon, monasteries closed and thousands turned into refugees. There were revolts in Ireland, possibly pro-French, and those in Southern Italy, clearly anti-French, all savagely repressed, and the loss of many small states that had dotted the map of Central Europe for centuries. Yet the terrible destruction of wartime does not tell the whole story. The men who eventually brought Napoleon down, chief among them Castlereagh and Metternich, failed to grasp that one of Napoleon's most remarkable gifts was his ability to bring about significant social change that would outlive his own defeat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=99lnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Napoleon:+Man+of+War,+Man+of+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","description":"From the national bestselling author of Whistling in the Dark.

Such a state of affairs of course also denies the testimony of the church's Scriptures regarding the key role women played in Jesus' own ministry and that of the early church. It denies or deliberately overlooks the significant role of women in the life of the church throughout the church's history, down to and including the present day. In recent years such denial of the significant place of women in Christian history of course has been addressed. But nowhere is there available a more comprehensive bibliography than the present one compiled by Carolyn Blevins. The reach of Blevins's bibliography is wide, from the earliest church to present times, across every ethnic and national boundary, and throughout virtually every segment of the church, Catholic and Protestant and stripes in between or beyond.

This small, oil-rich country in the southern Caucasus, on the southwestern shore of the Caspian Sea, only made its way on to the contemporary world map after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. As the world shrinks and competition for precious resources intensifies, the direction this strategically and economically important country takes will affect us all. The historically tolerant and pluralist Azeri people have an ancient history and a rich culture. Azerbaijan lay on the route of the Great Silk Road, the trade network that connected China with Europe, and its people have lived through centuries of conquests by different imperial powers. It was also situated in the heart of the Great Game, the struggle for control of Central Asia played out between Russia and the West at the turn on the nineteenth century, which seems to be going through a modern remake. Azerbaijan has been called  the quintessential borderland, many times over: between Europe and Asia, Islam and Christianity, Russia and the Middle East, Turks and Iranians, Shi a and Sunni Islam.  Azerbaijan was briefly independent after the First World War, when it was the first Muslim state to adopt progressive Western values.

So much has changed. One visit to a Sunday morning service and you will know that this is not the church you grew up with. Churn and frustration are at an all-time high as many have voted with their feet and no longer attend worship service. CHURCH - her thirst to be accepted by the world and possess what it has to offer has negatively impacted her preaching and influence on society. Silent, she has no response to the moral decay of our time, yet she takes in more money than most will earn in two life-times. Product pitches from the pulpit and product tables in the lobby are normal and a guaranteed scriptural reference to paying Tithes is inevitable.Laboring over souls on the altar is a thing of the past as many ministries look for ways to be more profitable. Being about My Fathers Business has taken on a whole new meaning as the North American Church struggles to hold to the code of Divine Ethics that was once delivered to the saints by those who once valued the concept of no compromise.

Born \\"chronically ugly and cross as a briar\\" into a poor, rural homestead in 1920s Ireland, Maura faced adversity from birth. She grew up in the bogs of the Irish countryside and left school at fourteen for Dublin, working in service there until her marriage to a hardworking but hard-drinking womanizer. Poverty stricken and hoping to find a better life for her five young children, she left Ireland with her family for 1950s Birmingham, England. But life doesn't always change when places do, and Maura's fear that she'd be \\"waked\\" at Doyles bar upon her death is funny but dead serious. Her voice is feisty and fearless, and she needed to be all those things to survive an extraordinary series of privations and abuses. And now, seventy-five and having survived her childhood, recovered from cancer, and left her marriage of fifty years, Maura has finally recorded the story of her life. Don't Wake Me at Doyles is the compelling account of a life set against by bad odds and worse luck: a memoir of survival and success in the face of the limits of class, education, nationality, religion, gender, and even health. A fearlessly honest writer, Maura invites us into her world, through her destructive marriage, and the birth of her nine children, and towards a life-or-death choice that would change her forever. Told with biting wit, Don't Wake Me at Doyles is a personal story of one woman's endurance, and the remarkable memoir of an ordinary woman's extraordinary life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=beEKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebraic Complexity Theory (Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften)","description":"The algorithmic solution of problems has always been one of the major concerns of mathematics. For a long time such solutions were based on an intuitive notion of algorithm. It is only in this century that metamathematical problems have led to the intensive search for a precise and sufficiently general formalization of the notions of computability and algorithm. In the 1930s, a number of quite different concepts for this purpose were pro posed, such as Turing machines, WHILE-programs, recursive functions, Markov algorithms, and Thue systems. All these concepts turned out to be equivalent, a fact summarized in Church's thesis, which says that the resulting definitions form an adequate formalization of the intuitive notion of computability. This had and continues to have an enormous effect. First of all, with these notions it has been possible to prove that various problems are algorithmically unsolvable. Among of group these undecidable problems are the halting problem, the word problem theory, the Post correspondence problem, and Hilbert's tenth problem. Secondly, concepts like Turing machines and WHILE-programs had a strong influence on the development of the first computers and programming languages. In the era of digital computers, the question of finding efficient solutions to algorithmically solvable problems has become increasingly important. In addition, the fact that some problems can be solved very efficiently, while others seem to defy all attempts to find an efficient solution, has called for a deeper under standing of the intrinsic computational difficulty of problems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9QXtCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lost eagles","description":"A young Roman Patrician fulfills a vow to Caesar Augustus, to recover the standards of three crack Legions annihilated by German tribes on the Rhine, in one of Romes greatest military disasters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FP4EAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+lost+eagles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virginia Bedfellows","description":"Gay men put their lives on the line for passion, pleasure, and each other in Colonial Virginia Banished from England and forced to work as indentured servants in Colonial Virginia, Lance Morley and Adam Bradley share a secret that couldcost them their lives.

Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zoY_pMA6ea0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Routing in the Internet","description":"Intended for organisations needing to build an efficient and reliable enterprise network linked to the Internet, this second edition explains the current Internet architecture and shows how to evaluate service providers dealing with connection issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jRBVxBZY7fwC&dq=Routing+in+the+Internet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exurbanites, The (complete and unabridged)","description":"A tautly paced investigation of one the 20th century's most audacious art frauds, which generated hundreds of forgeries-many of them still hanging in prominent museums and private collections today Provenance is the extraordinary narrative of one of the most far-reaching and elaborate deceptions in art history. Investigative reporters Laney Salisbury and Aly Sujo brilliantly recount the tale of a great con man and unforgettable villain, John Drewe, and his sometimes unwitting accomplices. Chief among those was the struggling artist John Myatt, a vulnerable single father who was manipulated by Drewe into becoming a prolific art forger. Once Myatt had painted the pieces, the real fraud began. Drewe managed to infiltrate the archives of the upper echelons of the British art world in order to fake the provenance of Myatt's forged pieces, hoping to irrevocably legitimize the fakes while effectively rewriting art history. The story stretches from London to Paris to New York, from tony Manhattan art galleries to the esteemed Giacometti and Dubuffet associations, to the archives at the Tate Gallery. This enormous swindle resulted in the introduction of at least two hundred forged paintings, some of them breathtakingly good and most of them selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of these fakes are still out in the world, considered genuine and hung prominently in private houses, large galleries, and prestigious museums. And the sacred archives, undermined by John Drewe, remain tainted to this day. Provenance reads like a well-plotted thriller, filled with unforgettable characters and told at a breakneck pace. But this is most certainly not fiction; Provenance is the meticulously researched and captivating account of one of the greatest cons in the history of art forgery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q4x6DVA3lygC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roger's Performance Pb (Viz)","description":"When the First Edition of this book was written in 1951, the gas turbine was just becoming established as a powerplant for military aircraft. It took another decade before the gas turbine was introduced to civil aircraft, and this market developed so rapidly that the passenger liner was rendered obsolete. Other markets like naval propulsion, pipeline compression and electrical power applications grew steadily. In recent years the gas turbine, in combination with the steam turbine, has played an ever-increasing role in power generation. Despite the rapid advances in both output and efficiency, the basic theory of the gas turbine has remained unchanged. The layout of this new edition is broadly similar to the original, but greatly expanded and updated, comprising an outline of the basic theory, aerodynamic design of individual components, and the prediction of off-design performance. The addition of a chapter devoted to the mechanical design of gas turbines greatly enhances the scope of the book. Descriptions of engine developments and current markets make this book useful to both students and practising engineers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hvEmDwAAQBAJ&dq=Roger%27s+Performance+Pb+(Viz)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Good Conscience (Sarah)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Middlemarch 6d (Classic Fiction)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The common fossils of Missouri (Missouri handbook)","description":"The Missouri Handbooks are intended to bring the products of extensive research to the general public in nontechnical yet scholarly terms and in a convenient paperback format.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ij4EsrAruIAC&dq=The+common+fossils+of+Missouri+(Missouri+handbook)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morning Coffee","description":"Looking for Inspiration?Are you wondering if there's more to this life than the next Netflix special?Well...you're in the right place.Because I wrote this book for you.This is a 30 day devotional.

Shi is, who support the Prophet Mohammad s progeny as his successors in opposition to the Sunni caliphate tradition, make up 10 to 15 percent of the world s Muslim population, roughly half of whom live in Iran. Throughout the early history of the Islamic Middle East, the Sunnis have been associated with the state and the ruling elite, while Shi is have most often represented the political opposition and have had broad appeal among the masses. Moharram symbols and rituals commemorate the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, in which the Prophet Mohammad s grandson Hoseyn and most of his family and supporters were massacred by the troops of the Umayyad caliph Yazid. Moharram symbols and rituals are among the most pervasive and popular aspects of Iranian culture and society. This book traces patterns of continuity and change of Moharran symbols and rituals in three aspects of Iranian life: the importance of these rituals in promoting social bonds, status, identities, and ideals; ways in which the three major successive regimes (Qujars, Pahlavis, and the Islamic Republic), have either used these rituals to promote their legitimacy, or have suppressed them because they viewed them as a potential political threat; and the uses of Moharram symbolism by opposition groups interested in overthrowing the regime. While the patterns of government patronage have been radically discontinuous over the past two centuries, the roles of these rituals in popular society and culture have been relatively continuous or have evolved independently of the state. The political uses of modern-day rituals and the enduring symbolism of the Karbala narratives continue today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=egGgUM_YdL8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exceptions to Silence: A Trial Lawyer's Confessions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"True Believer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5KKdvAEACAAJ&dq=True+Believer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Found Atlantis","description":"Atlantis: for centuries the magic of that name has haunted man's imagination.

Horrified by what she's done and fearing for her life, she flees north, out of Provincial jurisdiction and into the frigid land of exiles and thieves, known as The Wilds. There, Sable lives in hiding, burdened by guilt, and survives as a healer. But now, ten years later, someone--or something--is hunting her. On the run again, Sable's best chance for survival is Jos, a lethal man from the Five Provinces, who claims to need her skills as a healer to save his dying father, and she needs the large sum of money he's offered. There's something about him Sable doesn't trust, but she doesn't have many options. A spirit of the dead is hunting her, summoned by a mysterious necromancer, and it's getting closer. Sable soon discovers she's just the start of the necromancer's plan to take over the Five Provinces, and she's the only one with the power to stop it.

The publisher, Diethnes Vima, also distributes eight other Pathfinder titles they have translated and published in Greek, including U.S. Imperialism Has Lost the Cold War, by Jack Barnes; The Truth About Yugoslavia, by Argiris Malapanis; Problems of Women?s Liberation, by Evelyn Reed; The Second Declaration of Havana; and Communism and the Fight for a Popular Revolutionary Government: 1848 to Today by Mary-Alice Waters. Imperialism?s March toward Fascism and War by Barnes was first published in issue no. 10 of New International, a magazine of Marxist politics and theory distributed by Pathfinder Press. The first edition of the Greek translation was issued by Diethnes Vima in 1995. The preface is copyright ? Pathfinder Press 2004. Reprinted by permission. *****BY BOBBIS MISAILIDES As this second edition of ?Imperialism?s March toward Fascism and War? goes to press, the capitalist rulers of the United States, Europe, and Japan are being driven by intensifying competition and sharpening interimperialist conflict common to the opening stages of a world economic and financial crisis. As a result, the ruling classes of these rival powers are pressing attacks on workers and farmers at home?on the toilers? wages, their working conditions, their social wage, and broader conquests. And increasingly, on their political rights as well, more and more in the name of carrying out the ?global war on terrorism.? This book is based on a 1994 talk by Jack Barnes, national secretary of the Socialist Workers Party of the United States, given to regional educational conferences in several U.S. cities. Since that talk was presented almost a decade ago, U.S. imperialism has codified in the so-called Dayton Agreement of 1995 its ?belated? intervention in the Yugoslav crisis discussed in these pages. In the process of that military campaign and its subsequent stages in Kosova and repercussions throughout the Balkans, Washington dealt blows to its imperialist rivals in Europe. At the same time, now acting as the major ?European power,? the U.S. government imposed its interests on the Yugoslav victims of what is presented as a ?humanitarian mission.? These events and their political consequences are of particular significance to working people and youth in Greece, since Athens, one of the weaker members of NATO and the European Union, has sought throughout to enhance the relative profits and power of Greek finance capital by increasing its ?sphere of influence? in the Balkans and throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. Through Washington?s lethal lightning assault on Iraq in 2003, and its continuing imperial occupation of that country, the U.S. rulers are dealing further blows to competitors in ?Old Europe??primarily France and Germany?who are not accepting the U.S. government?s lead rapidly enough. With a ?New Europe?-based ?coalition of the willing? now behind it, Washington is increasing its blackmail through intensifying military pressures against Iran, north Korea, Syria, Libya, and other countries. ?You?re next!??that?s the brutal message of the ?war on terrorism.? At the same time, the imperialists in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere, regardless of other ups and downs, are maintaining their decades-long hostility and punitive policies toward the people of Cuba and their socialist revolution. And they are preparing to intervene anywhere in the Americas, beginning in Venezuela, where the toilers resist attempts by the imperialists and local propertied classes to turn back the clock. Toward the end of the 1990s, with the exception of Japan, the long-term retreat of the labor movement bottomed out across the imperialist world. This sea change in working-class politics opens modest but genuine and ongoing opportunities for the communist movement worldwide to integrate itself within, and to respond to, resistance by workers, trade unionists, and other toilers. And as Barnes demonstrates in these pages, U.S. imperialism is far from all-powerful. To the contrary, he stresses the historic decline of that power and points out the line of march of the toilers toward overturning capitalist rule, establishing a government of the workers and farmers, and joining in the world-wide struggle for socialism. Working people across the imperialist world, including in Greece, confront these same historic tasks.

Davis tells the story of a regional opera company that won international recognition with dazzling productions during its first season and sustained the attention of opera lovers around the world for nearly two decades. In the late 1950s in Dallas, Texas, general manager Lawrence Kelly and artistic director Nicola Rescigno envisioned gorgeous music for the eye and ear. Their intent was to breathe new life into the traditional Italian and French repertory and to spice it with offerings of American premieres of lesser-known works. Although the fledgling company's seasons were short, they were \\"production for production\\" of a quality to match those staged in the finest opera houses in the world. In 1958, Maria Callas, the company's first prima donna, gave a towering performance as Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata and that same year, in her only American performances of Medea, gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides. The Dallas Opera's roster of American debuts in its initial decades includes Joan Sutherland, Jon Vickers, Teresa Berganza, Placido Domingo, and Montserrat Caball . In addition to recruiting the best singers from around the globe, Kelly and Rescigno imported an upcoming generation of European stage designers and directors, among them such now recognized giants as Franco Zeffirelli and Peter Hall. Long before most opera management gave much attention to lighting a stage creatively, they scouted the contemporary Broadway theater to enlist the talents of such lighting designers as Jean Rosenthal and Tharon Musser. Supported by a small group of civic-minded business leaders, the Dallas Opera during its early seasons was perhaps as close as the United States has ever come to having court opera, a modern extension of the jewel-box operas performed in the palaces of Louis XIV and Catherine the Great. Rather than imitate what patrons could see at the Metropolitan in New York, Kelly and Rescigno looked to Europe, and especially to Italy and its singers and artists from the world-renowned opera house in Milan. With their visionary fervor and meticulously crafted productions, Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno launched \\"La Scala West,\\" a regional opera company that set the standard for many companies in the decades to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6EcXAQAAIAAJ&dq=La+Scala+West:+The+Dallas+Opera+under+Kelly+and+Rescigno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventure Travel Activity and Coloring Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thus Saith The Lord: How to know when God is speaking to you through another (Inner Strength)","description":"Do you question what takes place when your loved ones die?

Many people suffer from an unhealthy need for affirmation. They are not capable of feeling good about themselves. For some the quest for approval becomes an actual addiction, as they seek self-worth from the outside world because they can't find it within themselves.

God provides all the security anyone needs. Her goal is to provide a pathway toward freedom from the approval addiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bmgEHL8-4V8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Practical Use of Fracture Mechanics","description":"This book is about the use of fracture mechanics for the solution of practical problems; academic rigor is not at issue and dealt with only in as far as it improves insight and understanding; it often concerns secondary errors in engineering. Knowledge of (ignorance of) such basic input as loads and stresses in practical cases may cause errors far overshadowing those introduced by shortcomings of fracture mechanics and necessary approximations; this is amply demonstrated in the text. I have presented more than three dozen 40-hour courses on fracture mechanics and damage tolerance analysis, so that I have probably more experience in teaching the subject than anyone else. I learned more than the students, and became cognizant of difficulties and of the real concerns in applications. In particular I found, how a subject should be explained to appeal to the practicing engineer to demonstrate that his practical problem can indeed be solved with engineering methods. This experience is reflected in the presenta tions in this book. Sufficient background is provided for an understanding of the issues, but pragamatism prevails. Mathematics cannot be avoided, but they are presented in a way that appeals to insight and intuition, in lieu of formal derivations which would show but the mathematical skill of the writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BKbwhGA0rRMC&dq=The+Practical+Use+of+Fracture+Mechanics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organic Living","description":"This ecodirectory and visual sourcebook aims to be a blueprint for organic living, which looks at the benefits of going organic in every sphere of our daily lives.

These doctrines crystallized over the gradual abandonment of the exclusive authority of the Bible in the life of the Church by the establishment of doctrines based on human tradition. There is much pressure today by the Roman Catholic Church on Protestant Evangelicals of all persuasions, to set aside doctrinal differences and evangelize together so that the world will see a united Church. Yet the Bible clearly teaches that the Church of Jesus Christ is to be the pillar and foundation of the truth in the midst of society (1 Timothy 3:15). How can we abandon the truth for the sake of unity and think that we can actually accomplish Gods will for His Church. Does the truth really matter? Ross Thomas Hindman served the Lord as a missionary in France from 1984 to 2006. In the early years he was involved in helping French Christians establish new churches and then later became the director of the Bethany Bible School in the heart of France. He also helped Brazilian missionaries begin a Bethany Bible School in Dakar, Senegal, West Africa. He continues his ministry of teaching in the French-speaking world as well as in the United States while continuing his missionary activities with Bethany International in helping develop mission schools in the least-reached nations. He received the Bachelor of Arts in Bible (Cum Laude) from Asbury College in 1980 and the Master of Divinity in Evangelism and Missions from Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky in 1983.

It seems it's become more important to share some condensed, peanut-sized version of the gospel at the simplest, most juvenile, least thought-provoking level with our culture rather than let people wrestle with the theological difficulties and search out how they might be rectified logically. Author Rick Brownell has had enough. In his book, Recovering Our Lost Theology: The Sovereign Grace of God, Brownell poses the tough questions and challenges readers to reevaluate their theological thinking. How does God loving the world yet destroying a group of its inhabitants work itself out in your theological framework? Is God so detailed and powerful in his sovereign plans that he controls not only the creeping of a single aphid over a rosebud but the flight patterns and boundaries of a billion locusts? If God is so sovereign in the natural world, would he leave the salvation of a lost sinner to his own apostate will and determination in the spiritual world? These are just a few of the questions Brownell addresses so that readers will focus again on God's grace and mercy in the salvation of men. He hopes readers will recapture a biblical perspective on evangelism and abandon the tired advice of many theologians who suggest Christians 'don't get bogged down with profound theological concepts' when sharing the gospel. Recovering Our Lost Theology is a daring and moving challenge to readers to reaffirm their commitment to God's sovereignty in salvation, evangelism, and theology to the glory of God alone. Rick Brownell lives in Aurora, Oregon, with his wife of twenty-seven years, Sheila. He has a bachelor's degree in ornamental horticulture from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a master's degree in exegetical theology from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary. He can frequently be found engaging believers and unbelievers alike in discussions of theology and the sovereignty of God in the Christian faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V0VMZcklzYcC&dq=Justification+By+Faith(Sovereign+Grace+Book+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost Stallion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Your Bridge to a Better Future","description":"Dreams and goals have a great impact on accomplishments.

It can be read as a children's musical mystery, full of suspense and intrigue, or as a modern adult crossover tale of the interplay between music, nature and mankind. The story follows the young hero's thrilling escapades at school and across the planet, as he deals with espionage, kidnap and a terrifying enemy in a desperate race against time before the decisive 'Battle of the Bands'.

While the Western itself may seem simple (it isn't quite), an explanation of its popularity cannot be; for the Western, like any myth, stands between individual human consciousness and society. If a myth is popular, it must somehow appeal to or reinforce the individuals who view it by communicating a symbolic meaning to them. This meaning must, in turn, reflect the particular social institutions and attitudes that have created and continue to nourish the myth. Thus, a myth must tell its viewers about themselves and their society. This study, which takes up the question of the Western as an American myth, will lead us into abstract structural theory as well as economic and political history. Mostly, however, it will take us into the movies, the spectacular and not-so-spectacular sagebrush of the cinema. Unlike most works of social science, the data on which my analysis is based is available to all of my readers, either at the local theater or, more likely, on the late, late show. I hope you will take the opportunity, whenever it is offered, to check my findings and test my interpretations; the effort is small and the rewards are many. And if your wife, husband, mother, or child asks you why you are wasting your time staring at Westerns on TV in the middle of the night, tell them firmly as I often did that you are doing research in social science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SbUwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sixguns+and+Society:+A+Structural+Study+of+the+Western&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis Of Time Series Data (Methodology in the Social Sciences)","description":"This book provides a thorough introduction to methods for detecting and describing cyclic patterns in time-series data. It is written both for researchers and students new to the area and for those who have already collected time-series data but wish to learn new ways of understanding and presenting them. Facilitating the interpretation of observations of behavior, physiology, mood, perceptual threshold, social indicator variables, and other responses, the book focuses on practical applications and requires much less mathematical background than most comparable texts. Using real data sets and currently available software (SPSS for Windows), the author employs extensive examples to clarify key concepts. Topics covered include research design issues, preliminary data screening, identification and description of cycles, summary of results across time series, and assessment of relations between time series. Also considered are theoretical questions, problems of interpretation, and potential sources of artifact.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fzzSwQtC6UoC&dq=Spectral+Analysis+Of+Time+Series+Data+(Methodology+in+the+Social+Sciences)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electrical Properties of Materials (Oxford Science Publications)","description":"An informal and highly accessible writing style, a simple treatment of mathematics, and clear guide to applications, have made this book a classic text in electrical and electronic engineering. Students will find it both readable and comprehensive. The fundamental ideas relevant to the understanding of the electrical properties of materials are emphasized; in addition, topics are selected in order to explain the operation of devices having applications (or possible future applications) in engineering. The mathematics, kept deliberately to a minimum, is well within the grasp of a second-year student. This is achieved by choosing the simplest model that can display the essential properties of a phenomenom, and then examining the difference between the ideal and the actual behaviour. The whole text is designed as an undergraduate course. However most individual sections are self contained and can be used as background reading in graduate courses, and for interested persons who want to explore advances in microelectronics, lasers, nanotechnology and several other topics that impinge on modern life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AiWyp0NQW6UC&dq=Electrical+Properties+of+Materials+(Oxford+Science+Publications)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Music Theory for Electric Bass","description":"This book is designed to help guide a beginning music theory dialogue between instructor and student in private one-on-one lessons.

Here, for the first time between two covers, is the breast in photography: the titillating breast, the maternal breast, the aging breast, and the symbolic breast. In Master Breasts, darkly witty political images of the 1970s jostle for space with Edward Weston's classic nudes; Nan Goldin's friends share pages with Robert Mapplethorpe's gorgeously sculptured models. From Alfred Stieglitz's classic studies of Georgia O'Keeffe to Mary Ellen Mark's vivid documentary portraits, they are all here. Other artists include Cindy Sherman, Imogen Cunningham, and Sally Mann. A witty and reflective Introduction from the acclaimed novelist and essayist Francine Prose further links the images, while a monologue from Karen Finley's recent performance piece American Chestnut, \\"The Detective,\\" reveals a young girl's anguish about breast-inspired catcalls and jokes and then sardonically calls for similar cultural treatment of the male anatomy.

After all these years, they still present a curious challenge: what, exactly, are they? \\"Richter 858\\" explores this question by focusing on one suite of extraordinary pictures painted in 1999, soon after his return to work after a silence caused by a stroke. Both investigation and celebration, this book brings together image, music and text in a uniquely compelling way: contributors include the great guitarist and composer Bill Frisell, two sharp-eyed critics, and a baker's dozen of prominent, award-winning poets. Housed in an aluminum slipcase, this lavish, oversized volume features the largest, most sumptuous, and most accurate reproductions of any Richter work. The eight paintings of the suite are shown at more than half-scale, and also, quite untraditionally, presented unbound on heavy paper in a pocket at the back of the book -- allowing readers to mix, match, and re-present the work for themselves outside the confines of the,printed volume. Forty details from the paintings are also reproduced in large-format, accompanied by the poems and texts. These brilliant passages -- rich in incident and intervention, and ranging from the coolly sublime to the loudly riotous -- make fascinating pictures in their own right. Additionally, a double gatefold opens to show all eight paintings in panoramic view.

First, it presents a normative challenge, describing the gap between philosophical and normative principles of human rights on one side and the overall problems and critical issues of human rights at national and local levels on the other. Second, it considers the political problems in developing and strengthening human rights culture. The political challenge addresses the ability (or inability) of the state to guarantee the rights of certain individuals and minority groups. Third, it examines the sociological challenge of majority-minority group relationships in human rights discourse and practices. This book describes the background of human rights in Indonesia and reviews the previous literature on the issue. It also presents a comprehensive review of the discourses about human rights and political changes in contemporary Indonesia. The analysis focuses on how human rights challenges affect the situation of religious minorities, looking in particular at the Ahmadiyya as a minority group that experiences human rights violations such as discrimination, persecution, and violence. The study fills out its treatment of these issues by examining the involvement of actors both from the state and society, addressing also the politics of human rights protection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MZY9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wind of Promise","description":"From the Newbery Award-winning author of Across Five Aprils and Up a Road Slowly comes a tale of a brave young man s struggle to find his own strength during the Great Depression.

In this volume, Starr covers the crucial postwar period--1950 to 1963--when the California we know today first burst into prominence. Starr brilliantly illuminates the dominant economic, social, and cultural forces in California in these pivotal years. In a powerful blend of telling events, colorful personalities, and insightful analyses, Starr examines such issues as the overnight creation of the postwar California suburb, the rise of Los Angeles as Super City, the reluctant emergence of San Diego as one of the largest cities in the nation, and the decline of political centrism. He explores the Silent Generation and the emergent Boomer youth cult, the Beats and the Hollywood \\"Rat Pack,\\" the pervasive influence of Zen Buddhism and other Asian traditions in art and design, the rise of the University of California and the emergence of California itself as a utopia of higher education, the cooling of West Coast jazz, freeway and water projects of heroic magnitude, outdoor life and the beginnings of the environmental movement. More broadly, he shows how California not only became the most populous state in the Union, but in fact evolved into a mega-state en route to becoming the global commonwealth it is today. Golden Dreams continues an epic series that has been widely recognized for its signal contribution to the history of American culture in California. It is a book that transcends its stated subject to offer a wealth of insight into the growth of the Sun Belt and the West and indeed the dramatic transformation of America itself in these pivotal years following the Second World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gvFyunCAQbMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7mVGDwAAQBAJ&dq=Breastfeeding+and+natural+child+spacing:+How+%22ecological%22+breastfeeding+spaces+babies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nelson Mandela Speaks: Forging a Democratic, Nonracial South Africa","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pierre Bear (Little Golden #212 25c)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jwaUNAEACAAJ&dq=Pierre+Bear+(Little+Golden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's In The Box,bob","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Claude Rains: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference to His Work in Film, Stage, Radio, Television and Recordings","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ELVIS COSTELLO: A Singing Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wFHIzgEACAAJ&dq=ELVIS+COSTELLO:+A+Singing+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter the Great","description":"PULITZER PRIZE WINNER ?

Massie delves deep into his life, chronicling the pivotal events that shaped a boy into a legend including his  incognito  travels in Europe, his unquenchable curiosity about Western ways, his obsession with the sea and establishment of the stupendous Russian navy, his creation of an unbeatable army, his transformation of Russia, and his relationships with those he loved most: Catherine, the robust yet gentle peasant, his loving mistress, wife, and successor; and Menshikov, the charming, bold, unscrupulous prince who rose to wealth and power through Peter s friendship. Impetuous and stubborn, generous and cruel, tender and unforgiving, a man of enormous energy and complexity, Peter the Great is brought fully to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EV4PRpflsKcC&dq=Peter+the+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swiss Ball","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound","description":"Biographical material accompanies reproductions of T.

From rustic post-Civil War days when Camden poet Walt Whitman crossed the Delaware River on a ferry or caroused Market Street \\"eyeing\\" the grocery boys, to the beginnings of ACT UP more than one hundred years later, the gay and lesbian community in Philadelphia has never lost its flair for the dramatic. Gay and Lesbian Philadelphia is a historical look at the neighborhoods, events, and people that have been a part of this community. The 1920s saw the birth of private dance bars on Rittenhouse Square. It was a time when drag shows in straight bars were the order of the day, as was the presence of men in drag during the annual Mummer's Parade on New Year's Day. The pre-Civil Rights era, when segregation was the status quo, saw the proliferation of African American house parties in neighborhoods such as North Philadelphia, where black gays and lesbians formed a community. During the 1950s and 1960s, Rittenhouse Square was the site of informal public gatherings. These gatherings of friends and strangers helped set the stage for the Annual Reminder, the first public protest in support of \\"homosexual equal rights,\\" which took place every Fourth of July at Independence Hall. Throughout all of these eras, members of the community faced challenges, celebrated victories, and continued to try to blend their lives with those of their gay and straight neighbors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R9uGAAAAIAAJ&dq=Gay+and+Lesbian+Philadelphia+(PA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The poems of Thomas Carew","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x19NAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Samaritans and Early Judaism: A Literary Analysis (Library Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","description":"Volume One of the Firebringer Trilogy Jan, the prince of the unicorns, is high-spirited, reckless-and the despair of his mighty father, Korr.

Two men. Thirty years. John Puller's mother, Jackie, vanished thirty years ago from Fort Monroe, Virginia, when Puller was just a boy. Paul Rogers has been in prison for ten years. But twenty years before that, he was at Fort Monroe. One night three decades ago, Puller's and Rogers' worlds collided with devastating results, and the truth has been buried ever since. Until now. Military investigators, armed with a letter from a friend of Jackie's, arrive in the hospital room of Puller's father-a legendary three-star now sinking into dementia-and reveal that Puller Sr. has been accused of murdering his wife. Aided by his brother Robert Puller, an Air Force major, and Veronica Knox, who works for a shadowy U.S. intelligence organization, Puller begins a journey that will take him into his own past, to find the truth about his mother. Paul Rogers' time is running out. With the clock ticking, he begins his own journey, one that will take him across the country to the place where all his troubles began: a mysterious building on the grounds of Fort Monroe.

For nearly five centuries humans have peacefully coexisted with the Neanderthal descendants who they banished to the planet Teconea. But now, the Neanderthals want their home world back. They have amassed a vast armada, well concealed in the ion storms of the Orion system until Danny Stryker, a Federation trader, stumbles upon their secret. Humankind's best hope of survival against the powerful Teconean Empire, the Federation Defense System, is nearly complete. A potent new energy generator in the shape of an obelisk is the last key element needed to complete the FDS. Stryker discovers that the gilded obelisk is lost in time. The only hope for survival is to send someone back to nineteenth century California to retrieve it before the Teconean invasion is launched. An aficionado of the Old West, Stryker eagerly volunteers to make the trip. Fitting into the nineteenth century has its challenges, and to make matters worse, Teconean spies have infiltrated deep into the ranks of the Space Corps.

James J. Kirschke s mortar platoon and then rifle platoon knew the stakes: the Marines are America s military elite, expected to train harder, fight longer, sacrifice more. Kirschke led by example in the hotly contested zone just south of the DMZ and in the dangerous AnHoa region southwest of DaNang. There Kirschke s units, with resources stretched to the limit, saw combat almost daily in some of the fiercest fighting of 1966. Sustained through the toughest firefights and bloodiest ambushes, the men s morale proved a testament to Kirschke s leadership and his dedication to what the U.S. Marines stand for. Those beliefs, and the faith of his men, in turn helped Kirschke through his long recovery after he was wounded by the triple explosion of a box mine rigged to an anti-tank rocket round and a frag grenade. The Marines  legend and reputation are based on the blood, courage, and discipline of warriors like Jim Kirschke. Sparing no one, he has written a powerful chronicle of the deadly war his Marines fought with valor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UegUjyu7Le8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The existential background of human dignity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Harlem Globetrotters","description":"Beginning readers can learn about the science behind basketball in this slam-dunk Level 3 Ready-to-Read that will have everyone cheering.

It was only after years within the education reform movement that Natalie Wexler stumbled across a hidden explanation for our country's frustrating lack of progress when it comes to providing every child with a quality education. The problem wasn't one of the usual scapegoats: lazy teachers, shoddy facilities, lack of accountability. It was something no one was talking about: the elementary school curriculum's intense focus on decontextualized reading comprehension \\"skills\\" at the expense of actual knowledge. In the tradition of Dale Russakoff's The Prize and Dana Goldstein's The Teacher Wars, Wexler brings together history, research, and compelling characters to pull back the curtain on this fundamental flaw in our education system--one that fellow reformers, journalists, and policymakers have long overlooked, and of which the general public, including many parents, remains unaware. But The Knowledge Gap isn't just a story of what schools have gotten so wrong--it also follows innovative educators who are in the process of shedding their deeply ingrained habits, and describes the rewards that have come along: students who are not only excited to learn but are also acquiring the knowledge and vocabulary that will enable them to succeed. If we truly want to fix our education system and unlock the potential of our neediest children, we have no choice but to pay attention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L-bvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Students+Resolving+Conflicts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Tokyo Burned","description":"On the night of March 9, 1945, the U.S. Air Force began its bombing of Japanese cities in an all-out attempt to stop the war in the Pacific.

Held in Nuremberg, the ceremonial birthplace of the Nazi Party, the British, American, French, and Soviet leaders contributed both judges and prosecutors to the series of trials that would prosecute some of the most prominent politicians, military leaders and businessmen in Nazi Germany. This is the definitive history of the Nuremberg crimes trials by one of the key participants, Telford Taylor, the distinguished lawyer who was a member of the American prosecution staff and eventually became chief counsel. In vivid detail, Taylor portrays the unfolding events as he  saw, heard, and otherwise sensed them at the time, and not as a detached historian working from the documents might picture them.  Taylor describes personal vendettas among the Allied representatives and the negotiations that preceded the handing down of sentences. The revelations have not lost their power over the decades: The chamber is reduced to silence when an SS officer recounts impassively that his troops rounded up and killed 90,000 Jews, and panic overcomes the head of the German State Bank as it becomes clear that he knew his institution was receiving jewels and other valuables taken from the bodies of concentration camp inmates. The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials has proven to be a defining piece of World War II literature, an engrossing and reflective eyewitness account of one of the most significant events of our century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9MO8wAEACAAJ&dq=The+Anatomy+of+the+Nuremberg+Trials:+A+Personal+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Accidental Zillionaire : Demystifying Paul Allen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Life on the Rock : A Rebel Returns to His Faith","description":"Jeff Cavins' story is one of the most intriguing and dramatic conversion stories in the Church today - a bittersweet story of an emotional and spiritual search for peace in a chaotic world.

Now revenge is on his mind, and he reaches out to his ex-Soviet associate. Unfortunately, she's just taken a gig with the Seven Demons, the most feared underground assassination squad in the world--and Jack is their next target.

It can take many forms, from godparenting to sponsoring fiestas, holding civic offices, or exchanging agricultural or other kinds of labor. This book examines the ways in which the people of Santa Ana del Valle practice these traditional cooperative and reciprocal relationships and also invent new relationships to respond to global forces of social and economic change at work within their community. Based on fieldwork he conducted in this Zapotec-speaking community between 1992 and 1996, Jeffrey Cohen describes continuities in the Santa?eros' practices of cooperation, as well as changes resulting from transnational migration, tourism, increasing educational opportunities, and improved communications. His nuanced portrayal of the benefits and burdens of cooperation is buttressed by the words of many villagers who explain why and how they participate-or not-in reciprocal family and community networks. This rich ethnographic material offers a working definition of community created in and through cooperative relationships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3SHUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wine Lover Cooks with Wine: Great Recipes for the Essential Ingredient","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"and the shadows took him: A Novel","description":"Moving his family from their barrio neighborhood when he gets a better job, William Molina finds their Latino background proving a challenge in their new community and reacts with a combination of rage and machismo that threatens his family's security.

Younger fought as a guerrilla under William Clarke Quantrill. The fighting in Missouri during the Civil War was largely between pro-Union and pro-Confederate Missourians, though the bushwhackers held special hatred for the Union troops from Kansas who frequently crossed the border and earned a reputation for ruthlessness. Younger joined the Confederate guerrilla leader Quantrill in a raid on August 21, 1863, taking part in the killing of some 200 men and boys at Lawrence, Kansas, which the guerrillas looted and burned. Outlaw Gang It is uncertain when Cole Younger and his brothers joined this gang. The first mention of his involvement came in 1868, when authorities identified him as a member of a gang who robbed Nimrod Long & Co., a bank in Russellville, Kentucky. Former guerrillas, John Jarrett (brother in law of Cole Younger), Arthur McCoy, and George and Oliver Shepard were also implicated. Oliver Shepard was killed resisting arrest and George was imprisoned. Once the more senior members of the gang had been killed, captured, or quit, its core thereafter consisted of the James and Younger brothers. Witnesses repeatedly gave identifications that matched Cole Younger in robberies carried out over the next few years, as the outlaws robbed banks and stagecoaches in Missouri and Kentucky. On July 21, 1873, they turned to train robbery, derailing a locomotive and looting the express car on the Rock Island Railroad in Adair, Iowa. Younger and his brothers were also suspects in hold-ups of stage coaches, banks, and trains in Missouri, Kentucky, Kansas, and West Virginia. Following the robbery of the Iron Mountain Railroad at Gad's Hill, Missouri, in 1874, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency began to pursue the James and Younger brothers. Two agents (Louis J. Lull and John Boyle) engaged John and Jim Younger in a gunfight on a Missouri road on March 17, 1874; Boyle fled the scene, and both John Younger and Lull were killed. Simultaneously, another Pinkerton agent W.J. Whicher [1] who pursued the James brothers was abducted and later found dead alongside a rural road in Jackson County, Missouri. Some Younger families changed their last names to Jungers to avoid a family association with the gangsters. The James and Younger brothers survived capture longer than most Western outlaws because of their strong support among former Confederates. Jesse James became the public face of the gang, appealing to the public in letters to the press (even press releases left behind at robberies), claiming to be the victim of vindictive Radical Republicans. The gang, and Jesse James in particular, became a major electoral campaign issue, as pro-Southern Democrats defended the outlaws and Republicans attacked them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2gXaoQEACAAJ&dq=Younger+Brothers:+Cole,+James,+Bob,+John&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That's Not Stealing (Sarah)","description":"Frank Hammond makes a wintry journey of over two hundred miles to help his brother and look into a job offer he hopes will be the new beginning he is searching for.

At the same time, Sarah struggles for the faith to fulfill her own promise to trust God, and Frank, no matter what the circumstances.

With the same fiercely beautiful prose that won her acclaim for Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, Fuller here recounts her friendship with K. K is, seemingly, a man of contradictions: tattooed, battle scarred, and weathered by farm work, he is a lion of a man, feral and bulletproof. Yet he is also a born-again Christian, given to weeping when he recollects his failed romantic life, and more than anything else welling up inside with memories of battle. For his war, like all wars, was a brutal one, marked by racial strife, jungle battles, unimaginable tortures, and the murdering of innocent civilians and K, like all the veterans of the war, has blood on his hands. Driven by K's memories, Fuller and K decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way by traveling from Zambia through Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. It is a strange journey into the past, one marked at once by somber reflections and odd humor and featuring characters such as Mapenga, a fellow veteran who lives with his pet lion on a little island in the middle of a lake and is known to cope with his personal demons by refusing to speak for days on end. What results from Fuller's journey is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of men who have killed, mutilated, tortured, and scrambled to survive during wartime and who now must attempt to live with their past and live past their sins. In these men, too, we get a glimpse of life in Africa, a land that besets its creatures with pests, plagues, and natural disasters, making the people there at once more hardened and more vulnerable than elsewhere. Scribbling the Cat is an engrossing and haunting look at war, Africa, and the lines of sanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UzHfrJZEGcEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late Marque Spitfire Aces 1942-45","description":"Although the Spitfire is undoubtedly best known for its exploits against the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain, its later war service with Fighter Command on all fronts against the Axis alliance was equally as important.

Who are you when storms come? Most of us have been on the receiving end of rejection, a broken dream, or heartbreak. And while this is not an easy space to go through, when we are grounded in the truth, we can endure the tough times. In this powerful book, Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow passionately shares glimpses of his journey staying grounded in the face of disappointment, criticism, and intense media scrutiny. Following an exceptional college football career with the Florida Gators and a promising playoff run with the Denver Broncos, Tebow was traded to the New York Jets. He was released after one season. In Shaken, named the 2017 Christian Book of the Year, Tebow talks about what he's learned along the way, building confidence in his identity in God, not the world. This moving book also features practical wisdom from Scripture and insights gained from others who have impacted Tebow in life-changing ways. Though traveling hard roads is not easy, it's always worth it Your Circumstances do not Define You, Your Identity Does. What do you do when life takes an unplanned detour? When the unexpected happens? When doubt or negativity tries to rise above your faith? Most of us can relate to these questions. Through a dynamic lens of story and insight, Heisman trophy winner Tim Tebow tells what he's learned during the highs and the lows of his journey in the NFL. Shaken also features practical wisdom from the pages of Scripture and moving narratives of individuals--from celebrities to cancer patients--who have impacted Tebow's life. Their inspiring stories will encourage you also to tackle fear, overcome bitterness, and take on the obstacles life throws at you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jOZFDwAAQBAJ&dq=Shaken&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Andre Kertesz","description":"The first major retrospective of the celebrated photographer offers a complete overview of his life and career, from his early work in Hungary to his later use of \\"distortions,\\" with essays by Laszlo Beke, Dominique Baque, and Jane Livingston.

Of the more than one hundred and fifty short stories he wrote during those twenty years, only about a quarter were collected during his lifetime; a few new ones were put together when Malcolm Cowley's selection was published by Scribner's in 1951. Of Fitzgerald's thirty or forty essays, ten were printed in The Crack-Up, edited by Edmund Wilson. Apart from the fact that this state of affairs leaves a considerable part of the important work of a great writer unavailable, there is the further difficulty that it prevents most readers from seeing clearly how Fitzgerald developed as a writer. Now, Arthur Mizener, author of the highly successful biography of Fitzgerald, The Far Side of Paradise, has taken from this body of Fitzgerald's uncollected work a revealing and eminently enjoyable cross-section of Fitzgerald's art. Afternoon of an Author contains fourteen uncollected short stories and six uncollected essays, evenly distributed over the course of his writing career, beginning with the autobiographical essay called 'Who's Who--and Why, ' which he wrote for The Saturday Evening Post in 1920, and ending with 'News of Paris--Fifteen Years Ago, ' a story found among Fitzgerald's papers, apparently written in 1940, and posthumously published in Furioso. Here, clearly, is a book to be read both for the enjoyment of good writing, and for its illumination of an important figure in American letters. To supplement the reader's own insight into Fitzgerald's art, Arthur Mizener provides a revealing introduction and pertinent notes heading each selection.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kYIGAQAAIAAJ&dq=Afternoon+of+an+Author:+A+Selection+of+Uncollected+Stories+and+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is Paris","description":"Socialite, fashion icon, television and movie star, recording artist and just plain celebrity: Twenty-two year old Paris Hilton is the great granddaughter of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and is estimated to be worth $30 million.

At daybreak, they would be kidnapped at gunpoint by fanatical militants of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which operates out of secret bases in Tajikistan and Afghanistan and is linked to Al Qaeda. The kidnappers, themselves barely out of their teens, intended to use their hostages as human shields and for ransom money as they moved across Kyrgyzstan. They hid the climbers by day and marched them by night through freezing, treacherous mountain terrain, with little food, no clean water, and the constant threat of execution. The four climbers -- the oldest of them only 25 -- would see a fellow hostage, a Kyrgyz soldier, executed before their eyes. And in a remarkable life-and-death crucible over six terrifying days, they would be forced to choose between saving their own lives and committing an act none of them thought they ever could. In Over the Edge, the climbers reveal the complete story of their nightmarish ordeal to journalist and climber Greg Child. With riveting details, Child re-creates the entire hour-by-hour drama, from the first ricocheting bullets to the climatic decision that gains them their freedom. Set in a region rife with narcotics and terrorism, this is a compelling story about loyalty and the will to survive. What continues to make it relevant today, 15 years after the events took place, is the geopolitical context -- the incident happened, eerily, on the eve of 9/11; the fact that at least two of the four climbers continue to be prominent in the sport; and the details incorporated into the story around the media hype and controversy regarding the climbers and their story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pkn2BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The transformations of man","description":"Originally published in 1957, this volume compares the 20th Century transformation of human life to the revolution which swept early man into the first civilized communities.

Maximilien Robespierre originated the role, inspiring such devoted twentieth-century disciples as Lenin who deemed Robespierre a Bolshevik avant la lettre. Although he dominated the Committee for Public Safety only during the last year of his life, Robespierre was the Revolution in flesh and blood. He embodies its ideological essence, its unprecedented extremes, its absolutist virtues and vices; he incarnated a new, completely politicized self to lead a new, wholly regenerated society. Yet as historian David P. Jordan observes, Robespierre has remained an enigma. While his revolutionary career embraced the most crucial years of the Revolutions 1789 to 1794 it was little presaged by the unremarkable course of his early life. The Jacobin leader to whom the revolutionary masses clung is thus both as mysterious as his remote provincial past and as awesome as the world-shaking regicide he inspired. Confronted by these extremes, historians have often contented themselves to caricature Robespierre as an antichrist, a bourgeois manipulator of the rabble, or a canny political tactician. Jordan looks to Robespierre s own self-conception for a true understanding of the man and his Revolution. Indeed, Robespierre wrote about himself often, and at length. Influenced by Enlightenment rationalism and the new literary genre of autobiography, he left behind a voluminous body of speeches, newspaper articles, and pamphlets laced with reflections and revelations about his self-created destiny as living martyr and revolutionary Everyman. From these thoughts and words, Jordan attempts to uncover Robespierre, to reveal what made this unlikely figure onetime provincial lawyer, small-town acad micien, and uninspired versifier the most important in revolutionary France.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9SArAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Woman's Touch","description":"After first faking love for Rebecca Wade to gain the land that modern-day gunfighter Kyle Stockbridge considers his own, he has an uphill battle to convince her that his feelings have become real.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4u8EAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Woman%27s+Touch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Higher Honor: The U.S.S.

S. Eliot","description":"By the time Vivienne Eliot was committed to an asylum for what would be the final nine years of her life, she had been abandoned by her husband T.S. Eliot and shunned by literary London. Yet Vivienne was neither insane nor insignificant. She generously collaborated in her husband s literary efforts, taking dictation, editing his drafts, and writing articles for his magazine, Criterion. Her distinctive voice can be heard in his poetry. And paradoxically, it was the unhappiness of the Eliots  marriage that inspired some of the poet s most distinguished work, from The Family Reunion to The Waste Land. This first biography ever written about Vivienne draws on hundreds of previously unpublished papers, journals and letters to portray a spontaneous, loving, but fragile woman who had an important influence on her husband s work, as well as a great poet whose behavior was hampered by psychological and sexual impulses he could not fully acknowledge. Intriguing and provocative, Painted Shadow gracefully rescues Vivienne Eliot from undeserved obscurity, and is indispensable for anyone wishing to understand T.S. Eliot, Vivienne, or the world in which they traveled.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8kjIGXISK3YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practising Spanish Grammar: A Workbook (Spanish Edition)","description":"Practising Spanish Grammar can be used independently or as the ideal companion to the sixth edition of the widely acclaimed A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish (Butt, Benjamin and Moreira Rodr guez).

As He sat on the Mount of Olives, where in the future His feet shall stand in the day of His manifestation, He prophesied concerning the destruction of the magnificent temple building, and His disciples questioned Him, saying, \\"'Tell us when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the age?\\" (Matt. 24:3, R. V., margin). In answer to their questions, the Lord, looking through the years to the consummation of the age, pointed out certain unmistakable signs by which believers were to know when the age was drawing to a close. He saw kingdom rising against kingdom, and nation against nation. He heard the sound of war and rumors of war. He saw pestilence and earthquake, Bolshevism, Communism, anarchy, lawlessness. He saw a time of trouble, the like of which has not yet been known, a time which He called \\"the great tribulation.\\" He spoke plainly concerning these matters in order that the believers in every age might be fully instructed. Among these conditions and events the Lord warned His disciples concerning the religious conditions that would prevail in the end time. \\"False Christs, and false prophets, shall arise,\\" He declared. So great will be their delusions at that time that \\"if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\\" The Holy Spirit, coming on the day of Pentecost, heralded through Paul, Peter, James, and John, and the other inspired writers, the same warning, making it known that toward the end of the age the great foundational truths of the gospel will be denied. The word \\"Denial\\" will characterize the religious condition of Christendom when those closing days become reality. The days in which you and I are living are days in which Christians need to know their Bibles, for the only way by which we may know whether or not a system of teaching is of God is by viewing the system through the lens of Holy Writ--reading the system in the light of the Bible and not reading the Bible in the light of the system. Because of the crying need of Biblical light on these erroneous teachings, I gave a series of addresses in the Church of the Open Door, on \\"The Cult Kingdom,\\" selecting ten of the most damaging heresies for discussion. When people saw them revealed in the searchlight of God's Word a large number of men and women, held in their grip, were mercifully delivered. This created a wide-spread interest among God's children, culminating in a demand for the printing of these addresses so that others, caught in the meshes of false doctrine, might also find freedom. I was about to comply with this request when I discovered a book compiled by William C. Irvine, called \\"HERESIES EXPOSED.\\" This book completely covers not only the ten cults I exposed, but many others, so instead of publishing my addresses I have arranged with the writer to allow me to print this special edition of his excellent work. By so doing we meet the demand of friends for this material and provide my radio audience with another valuable book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BgE1uQEACAAJ&dq=Heresies+exposed:+A+brief+critical+examination+in+the+light+of+the+Holy+Scriptures+of+some+of+the+prevailing+heresies+and+false+teachings+of+today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endgame Challenge","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History (Theories of Representation and Difference)","description":"Emma P rez discusses the historical methodology which has created Chicano history.

What has come to be known as the Matter of Hannibal inspired two of his most famous books, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and provided the basis for the eleven pieces reprinted here. Most of these selections (eight of them fiction and three of them autobiographical) were never completed, and all were left unpublished. Written between 1868 and 1902, they include a diverse assortment of adventures, satires, and reminiscences in which the characters of his own childhood and of his best-loved fiction, particularly Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, come alive again. The autobiographical recollections culminate in an astounding feat of memory titled \\"Villagers of 1840-3\\" in which the author, writing for himself alone at the age of sixty-one, recalls with humor and pathos the characters of some one hundred and fifty people from his childhood. Accompanied by notes that reflect extensive new research on Mark Twain's early life in Missouri, the selections in this volume offer a revealing view of Mark Twain's varied and repeated attempts to give literary expression to the Matter of Hannibal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6hu1ojjzXYMC&dq=Huck+Finn+and+Tom+Sawyer+among+the+Indians:+And+Other+Unfinished+Stories+(Mark+Twain+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"G Is for Grand Canyon : An Arizona Alphabet (Alphabet Series)","description":"Yes, the magnificent Grand Canyon sprawls across northwestern Arizona.

In a small flat in London, a young man is turning to gold. But before he dies, before his skin and eyes and tongue harden into a golden death mask, he wants to share the amazing story of his life. Born and raised on the barren Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland, his childhood is a brutal one, devoid of tenderness. It is a miracle when he meets Tracy, falls in love, and discovers his true gift: the merest touch of him is enough to induce visions of angels and orchids. The physical heights he is able to reach-and to which he can bring others-go far beyond any normal sensual pleasure. Armed with this inexplicable talent, he makes his way to London, where he falls in with a group of teens forced to make a living on the street. Luke Sutherland's modern-day myth about the power of love veers from stratosphere to gutter, from visions of heaven to the all-too-mortal yearning for even one glimpse of it. With Venus as a Boy Sutherland has written a moving, poetic novel that manages to imbue the harsh realities of life on the street with a mesmerizing and ethereal beauty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z5LdRVSPucYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Four Quartets\\" Rehearsed A Commentary on T.

Charting the cross-cultural reception of many British films, Sarah Street draws on a wide range of sources including studio records, film posters, press books and statistics. While the power of Hollywood made it difficult for films that crossed the Atlantic, Street's research demonstrates that some strategies were more successful than others. She considers which British films made an impact and analyzes conditions that facilitated a positive reception from critics, censors, exhibitors and audiences. Case studies include Nell Gwyn (1926), The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), The Ghost Goes West (1935), Henry V (1946), Black Narcissus (1947), The Red Shoes (1948), Ealing comedies, The Horror of Dracula (1958), Tom Jones (1963), A Hard Day's Night (1964), Goldfinger (1964), The Remains of the Day (1993), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and Trainspotting (1996).

Humanitarian relief workers, writes David Rieff, are the last of the just. And in the Bosnias, the Rwandas, and the Afghanistans of this world, humanitarianism remains the vocation of helping people when they most desperately need help, when they have lost or stand at risk of losing everything they have, including their lives. Although humanitarianism's accomplishments have been tremendous, including saving countless lives, the lesson of the past ten years of civil wars and ethnic cleansing is that it can do only so much to alleviate suffering. Aid workers have discovered that while trying to do good, their efforts may also cause harm. Drawing on firsthand reporting from hot war zones around the world -- Bosnia, Rwanda, Congo, Kosovo, Sudan, and most recently Afghanistan -- Rieff describes how the International Committee of the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, CARE, Oxfam, and other humanitarian organizations have moved from their founding principle of political neutrality, which gave them access to victims of wars, to encouraging the international community to take action to stop civil wars and ethnic cleansing. This advocacy has come at a high price. By calling for intervention -- whether by the United Nations or by \\"coalitions of the willing\\" -- humanitarian organizations risk being seen as taking sides in a conflict and thus jeopardizing their access to victims. And by overreaching, the humanitarian movement has allowed itself to be hijacked by the major powers, at times becoming a fig leaf for actions those powers wish to take for their own interests, or for the major powers' inaction. Rieff concludes that if humanitarian organizations are to do what they do best -- alleviate suffering -- they must reclaim their independence. Except for relief workers themselves, no one has looked at humanitarian action as seriously or as unflinchingly, or has had such unparalleled access to its inner workings, as Rieff, who has traveled and lived with aid workers over many years and four continents. A cogent, hard-hitting report from the front lines, A Bed for the Night shows what international aid organizations must do if they are to continue to care for the victims of humanitarian disasters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0WiIe-xxmnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kali The Mother","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sc5mAAAACAAJ&dq=Kali+The+Mother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EbThbEyAun8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's That Baby?: New-Baby Songs","description":"Short poems and songs reflect the life of a newborn baby, as he or she meets various relatives and learns about the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A1lEke53jQUC&dq=Who%27s+That+Baby%3F:+New-Baby+Songs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Seminars on Transesophageal Echocardiography (Book and 8 Videos--NTSC - US Format)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rebecca West: A Saga of the Century","description":"Three novels in one volume following the artistic and eccentric Aubrey family in the years surrounding the Great War. In The Fountain Overflows,Papa Aubrey s wife and twin daughters, Mary and Rose, are piano prodigies, his young son, Richard Quin, is a lively boy, and his eldest daughter, Cordelia, is a beautiful and driven young woman with musical aspirations. But the talented and eccentric Aubrey family rarely enjoys a moment of harmony, as its members struggle to overcome the effects of their patriarch s spendthrift ways. Now they must move so that their father can find stable employment. Despite the daunting odds, the Aubreys hope that art will save them from the cacophony of a life sliding toward poverty. In The Real Night, a talented musician and her kin ponder what being young women on their own will entail. Abandoned by their feckless father, Rose and her family must move beyond their comfortable drawing room to discover a world of kind patrons, music teachers, and concert hall acclaim, but also domestic strife, anti-Semitism, and social pressure to marry. Set before World War I, Rebecca West s intimate, eloquent family portrait brings to life a time when women recognized their own voices and the joys of living off one s own talents. In Cousin Rosamund, Mary and Rose Aubrey have found success as accomplished pianists in the years after the war. But despite their travels and material rewards, they remain apart from society. When their cherished cousin Rosamund surprises them by marrying a man they feel is beneath her, the sisters must reconsider what love means to them and how they can find a sense of spiritual wellbeing on their own, without the guidance of their family.  Very few writers have managed to be more knowledgeable and profound in their thinking,  said the Los Angeles Times about Rebecca West, and the Saga of the Century is a collection of three absorbing novels inspired partly by her own life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ekI5F18gITcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chaucer's world: A pictorial companion;","description":"An introduction to the landscape, culture, and social structure of Chaucer's England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tkbcwAEACAAJ&dq=Chaucer%27s+world:+A+pictorial+companion%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","description":"1940 Pulitzer Prize winner.

On a quiet suburban street in upstate Greenbury, New York, the brutally beaten body of a young man is discovered in the woods adjacent to an empty vacation home. Twenty-six-year-old Brady Neil a resident of the neighboring town of Hamilton, had no criminal record, few friends, worked full-time, and attended community college. But as Detective Peter Decker learns, the clean-cut kid is linked to the criminal world. When Brady was a baby, his father, Brandon Gratz, was convicted of robbing and killing the owners of a local jewelry store. While Gratz and his partner, Kyle Masterson, admitted to the robbery, they swore they left the owners, Glen and Lydia Levine, very much alive. The experienced detective knows there s more to this homicide case than the records show. As he digs into Gratz s past, Decker begins to suspect that the son s murder may be connected to the father s sins. Before he can put together the pieces, Decker finds out that one of Brady Neil s friends, Joseph Boch aka Boxer has gone missing. Heading to Boch s house with his temporary new partner, Hamilton PD cop Lenora Baccus, they discover a bloodbath. Who would savagely kill two innocent men and why? Finding the answers will require all of Decker s skill and knowledge, the help of his fellow Greenbury detectives, Tyler McAdams and Kevin Butterfield, and information gleaned from his wife Rina s behind the scenes investigation to put all the pieces of this deadly puzzle together . . . and see justice done.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4LRFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vietnam","description":"No single event since World War II has marked this country s foreign policy and national image as deeply as did the war in Vietnam.

The evolutionary game theory developed in this 2005 book provides the tools necessary for understanding many of nature's mysteries, including co-evolution, speciation, extinction and the major biological questions regarding fit of form and function, diversity, procession, and the distribution and abundance of life. Mathematics for the evolutionary game are developed based on Darwin's postulates leading to the concept of a fitness generating function (G-function). G-function is a tool that simplifies notation and plays an important role developing Darwinian dynamics that drive natural selection. Natural selection may result in special outcomes such as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). An ESS maximum principle is formulated and its graphical representation as an adaptive landscape illuminates concepts such as adaptation, Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and the nature of life's evolutionary game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6O40X9o8ELwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging","description":"Blending scientific, philosophical, and religious thought, the author helps readers cut through the mythology surrounding the aging process, explaining the basic biology and psychology of old age and death.

A bold speculative adventure.  (Harold Brighouse, Manchester Guardian) In Graves s unique retelling, Jesus is very much a mortal and the grandson of King Herod the Great. When his father runs afoul of the King s temper and is executed, Jesus is raised in the house of Joseph the Carpenter. The kingdom he is heir to, in this version of the story, is very much a terrestrial one: the Kingdom of Judea. Graves tells of Jesus s rise as a philosopher, scriptural scholar, and charismatic speaker in sharp detail, as well as his arrest and downfall as a victim of pitiless Roman politics. Bringing together his unparalleled narrative skill and in-depth expertise in historical scholarship, renowned classicist and historical novelist Robert Graves brings the story of Jesus Christ to life in a strikingly unorthodox way, making this one of the most hotly contested novels Graves ever wrote and possibly one of the most controversial ever written. It provides a fascinating new twist to a well-known story, one that fans of this historical period are sure to love.  This is not reading for the easily shocked; it definitely presents Jesus as a sage and a poet, if not divine. It moves, as does all Mr. Graves  writing, at a brilliant fast pace, and with a tremendous style.

The chapters on leading contemporary architects have been greatly expanded. There is new material on the later development of Frank Lloyd Wright and the more recent buildings of Walter Gropius, particularly his American Embassy in Athens. In his discussion of Le Corbusier, Mr. Giedion provides detailed analyses of the Carpenter Center at Harvard University, Le Corbusier s only building in the United States, and his Priory of La Tourette near Lyons. There is a section on his relations with his clients and an assessment of his influence on contemporary architecture, including a description of the Le Corbusier Center in Zurich (designed just before his death), which houses his works of art. The chapters on Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto have been brought up to date with examples of their buildings in the sixties. There is an entirely new chapter on the Danish architect J?rn Utzon, whose work, as exemplified in his design for the Sydney Opera House, Mr. Giedion considers representative of postWorld War II architectural concepts. A new essay,  Changing Notions of the City,  traces the evolution of the structure of the city throughout history and examines current attempts to deal with urban growth, as shown in the work of such architects as Jos  Luis Sert, Kenzo Tange, and Fumihiko Maki.

He quickly emerged as the most popular cast member and became a reality television superstar. But a twenty-year affair with steroids led to a life of pissing blood, smuggling drugs, destroying hotel rooms, getting arrested, growing breasts, and lying bloodied in the street after a vicious fight with his best friend. This is Clark's riveting, fiercely candid account of his life, career, and steroid addiction. From an upbringing defined by tragedy and a difficult search for identity to tales of performing center stage at Madison Square Garden and bedding Playboy Bunnies and porn stars, Clark explores the price of fame, the pressure of stardom, and how the whole steroid-fueled fantasy finally imploded.

Let's start now on a twelve-step path that will lead out of the bondage of eating disorders and into the freedom that comes from a closer relationship with God. In the Life Recovery Workbook for Eating Disorders, discover real-life stories of fellow travelers, great questions for individual or group discussion, and a Bible-centered approach to freedom. Twelve beautiful blessings await after our hard work on the journey of recovery from eating disorders. Step 1: Open our hearts to God's power to free us from the grip of food addiction. \\"We now have this light shining in our hearts.\\" (2 Corinthians 4:7) Step 2: Allow God to join us in the powerful emotions behind our eating disorder. \\"Daughter,\\" he said to her, \\"your faith has made you well. Go in peace.\\" (Luke 8:48) Step 3: Rest in God's care for every decision and eating habit. \\"Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.\\" (Matthew 11:28) Step 4: Gain a true picture of how God sees us. \\"At that moment their eyes were opened.\\" (Genesis 3:7) Step 5: Experience the healing that begins with confession. \\"Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.\\" (James 5:16) Step 6: Get ready for repentance from sins expressed in unhealthy eating. \\"You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God.\\" (Psalm 51:17) Step 7: Allow God's Spirit to fix our food addictions. \\"For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\\" (Luke 18:14) Step 8: Create a list of people our eating disorders have affected. \\"Do to others as you would like them to do to you.\\" (Luke 6:31) Step 9: Restore relationships damaged by our sins (when possible) and experience a clean slate. \\"But then they turn from their sins and do what is just and right.\\" (Ezekiel 33:14) Step 10: Review daily the defects in us that hinder healthy life with God and others. \\"Be careful not to fall.\\" (1 Corinthians 10:12) Step 11: Grow closer to God through prayer and meditation. \\"The LORD is good to those who depend on him, to those who search for him.\\" (Lamentations 3:25) Step 12: Bless others with the blessing of healing from eating disorders. \\"Gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path.\\" (Galatians 6:1) STEPHEN ARTERBURN is the founder of New Life Ministries--the nation's largest faith-based broadcast, counseling, and treatment ministry--and host of the nationally syndicated New Life Live! daily radio program.

Ironically, it is the idealization of love that arms it with its destructive power. Popular media consistently remind us that love is all we need, but statistics concerning the rate of depression and suicides after divorce or romantic break up remind us what might happened if \\"all that we need\\" is taken away. This book is about our ideals of love, our experiences, of love, the actual disparity between the two, and the manners of coping with this disparity. A major study case of the book concerns men who have murdered their wives or partners allegedly 'out of love'. It is estimated that over 30% of all female murder victims in the United States die at the hands of a former or present spouse or boyfriend. How can murdering a loved one be associated with the assumed moral and altruistic love? Not only is love intrinsically ambivalent, but it can also give rise to dangerous consequences. Some of the worst evils have been committed in the name of love (as in the name of God). A unique collaboration between a leading philosopher in the field of emotions and a social scientist, In the Name of Love presents fascinating insights into romantic love and its future in modern society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0RRREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (In-formation)","description":"Soviet socialism was based on paradoxes that were revealed by the peculiar experience of its collapse. To the people who lived in that system the collapse seemed both completely unexpected and completely unsurprising. At the moment of collapse it suddenly became obvious that Soviet life had always seemed simultaneously eternal and stagnating, vigorous and ailing, bleak and full of promise. Although these characteristics may appear mutually exclusive, in fact they were mutually constitutive. This book explores the paradoxes of Soviet life during the period of \\"late socialism\\" (1960s-1980s) through the eyes of the last Soviet generation. Focusing on the major transformation of the 1950s at the level of discourse, ideology, language, and ritual, Alexei Yurchak traces the emergence of multiple unanticipated meanings, communities, relations, ideals, and pursuits that this transformation subsequently enabled. His historical, anthropological, and linguistic analysis draws on rich ethnographic material from Late Socialism and the post-Soviet period. The model of Soviet socialism that emerges provides an alternative to binary accounts that describe that system as a dichotomy of official culture and unofficial culture, the state and the people, public self and private self, truth and lie--and ignore the crucial fact that, for many Soviet citizens, the fundamental values, ideals, and realities of socialism were genuinely important, although they routinely transgressed and reinterpreted the norms and rules of the socialist state.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZccAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackson's Valley Campaign (Great Campaigns Series)","description":"Generally regarded as the most important of the Civil War campaigns conducted in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, that of 1864 lasted more than four months and claimed more than 25,000 casualties. The armies of Philip H. Sheridan and Jubal A. Early contended for immense stakes. Beyond the agricultural bounty and the boost in morale a victory would bring, events in the Valley also would affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in the November 1864 presidential canvass. The eleven original essays in this volume reexamine common assumptions about the campaign, its major figures, and its significance. Taking advantage of the most recent scholarship and a wide range of primary sources, contributors examine strategy and tactics, the performances of key commanders on each side, the campaign's political repercussions, and the experiences of civilians caught in the path of the armies. The authors do not always agree with one another, yet, taken together, their essays highlight important connections between the home front and the battlefield, as well as ways in which military affairs, civilian experiences, and politics played off one another during the campaign.

They affect us all far more than seems evidenced in our concern about them. Everyone buys wages, in a sense, with every purchase he makes. And three-fourths of all incomes in the United States represent pay for work done in the employ of another. So nearly every one of us is on both sides of the wage exchange, in one way or another. We all know in a general way that wages have been rising for a long time in this country, but there is evidence aplenty that the economic principles which apply to wage problems are not well understood. Probably they are no better understood now than in the early thirties when measures adopted to combat the depression proved to be such colossal failures. Fearing another depression like that which followed World War I, we now seem enmeshed in chronic and progressive inflation, which Lenin once said was a sure and simple way to destroy the capitalist system. Our  prosperity  now seems to be riding on the horns of a dilemma that will surely end in the destruction of capitalism unless we can resolve this problem which in large measure is a wage problem. I shall deal with the wage problem in a manner that may seem oversimplified. Basic principles always have a way of seeming simple. Yet if they be principles, they can no more be oversimplified than can the law of gravity or the listing of chemical elements be oversimplified. What is needed in our complex society of millions of products sold by millions of business units to over a hundred million traders through billions of transactions each year is to get back to simple economic principles. These are working tools for solving problems that seem more complex than they really are. Two Roadblocks In helping another person to resolve this wage problem, it seems to me that two roadblocks to his understanding may first have to be removed. They obstruct a thorough insight into the wage problem. One roadblock is the difference between money wages and real wages, which results in serious misconceptions. In a period of inflation such as we have long been enduring, or of deflation, a comparison of money wages in two separate years tells you no more about their relative worth than would a comparison of a daily wage in the United States with that of Chile   $10 as compared with 5,000 pesos, for instance. Money wages must first be converted into real wages before we can see their patterns of change. The other roadblock has to do with the effect of unions on wages. If you were to describe an elephant to a person who has never seen one and who had never even seen a picture of one, you probably would not describe a flea and then say that an elephant doesn t look like that. This would not be very helpful unless the person believed that an elephant looked like a flea. In the case of unions, there seems to be a firm and widespread belief about their effect on wages such that this question must be dealt with at the outset. So we shall start there. When speaking of wages and what makes them rise, the meaning will be the over-all level of wages   the general welfare, in that sense. To speak otherwise of wages, such as wage rates for one or a few persons, would involve special situations which are not the object of this discussion. A bank robber might succeed in gaining a high wage for his hour of work; a few persons, through power and special privilege, might likewise gain some short-time advantages at the expense of the others who work. But such gains of some wage earners at the expense of other wage earners are not the aim or meaning of this analysis of why wages rise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mtl1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychological Science","description":"Reflecting the latest APA Guidelines and accompanied by an exciting, new, formative, adaptive online learning tool, Psychological Science, Fifth Edition, will train your students to be savvy, scientific thinkers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WSeCjgEACAAJ&dq=Psychological+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transcontinental Railroad: A Primary Source History of America's First Coast-To-Coast Railroad (Primary Sources in American History)","description":"Describes the people, circumstances, and events surrounding the building of the railway system across the continent in the mid-nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LAfuzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Transcontinental+Railroad:+A+Primary+Source+History+of+America%27s+First+Coast-To-Coast+Railroad+(Primary+Sources+in+American+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lowdown From the Lesson Tee : Correcting 40 of Golf's Most Misunderstood Teaching Tips","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Other People's Marriages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sacred Ground: Music and Window Frequencies for Meditation ('Open the Window to the Core of Your Being')","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7dMSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Sacred+Ground:+Music+and+Window+Frequencies+for+Meditation+(%27Open+the+Window+to+the+Core+of+Your+Being%27)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British Costume from Earliest Times to 1820 (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","description":"Hard-to-find classic provides detailed, authentic coverage of British clothing (civil, royal, and ecclesiastic) from early Saxon era (ca.

Four words appear to sum up the salient features of this mystery of mysteries: the death of Christ was natural, unnatural, preternatural, and supernatural.The death of Christ was natural. By this we mean that it was a real death. It is because we are so familiar with the fact of it that the above statement appears simple and commonplace, yet, what we here touch upon is to the spiritual mind one of the main elements of wonderment.

The emphasis is on the geometric aspects of the theory and on illustrating how these methods can be used to solve optimal control problems. It provides tools and techniques that go well beyond standard procedures and can be used to obtain a full understanding of the global structure of solutions for the underlying problem. The text includes a large number and variety of fully worked out examples that range from the classical problem of minimum surfaces of revolution to cancer treatment for novel therapy approaches. All these examples, in one way or the other, illustrate the power of geometric techniques and methods. The versatile text contains material on different levels ranging from the introductory and elementary to the advanced. Parts of the text can be viewed as a comprehensive textbook for both advanced undergraduate and all level graduate courses on optimal control in both mathematics and engineering departments. The text moves smoothly from the more introductory topics to those parts that are in a monograph style were advanced topics are presented. While the presentation is mathematically rigorous, it is carried out in a tutorial style that makes the text accessible to a wide audience of researchers and students from various fields, including the mathematical sciences and engineering.

The exercises were well chosen, and served to give further examples and developments of the theory. --William Goldman, University of Maryland In this book, Miranda takes the approach that algebraic curves are best encountered for the first time over the complex numbers, where the reader's classical intuition about surfaces, integration, and other concepts can be brought into play. Therefore, many examples of algebraic curves are presented in the first chapters. In this way, the book begins as a primer on Riemann surfaces, with complex charts and meromorphic functions taking center stage. But the main examples come from projective curves, and slowly but surely the text moves toward the algebraic category. Proofs of the Riemann-Roch and Serre Duality Theorems are presented in an algebraic manner, via an adaptation of the adelic proof, expressed completely in terms of solving a Mittag-Leffler problem. Sheaves and cohomology are introduced as a unifying device in the latter chapters, so that their utility and naturalness are immediately obvious. Requiring a background of one semester of complex variable theory and a year of abstract algebra, this is an excellent graduate textbook for a second-semester course in complex variables or a year-long course in algebraic geometry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aN4bfzgHvvkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What a Wonderful World with CDROM","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"French: Start Speaking Today!

It is a riveting work of detective fiction worthy of Raymond Chandler, and at the same time a profound and unsettling existentialist enquiry in the tradition of Kafka or Borges. In each story the search for clues leads to remarkable coincidences in the universe as the simple act of trailing a man ultimately becomes a startling investigation of what it means to be human. The New York Trilogy is the modern novel at its finest: a truly bold and arresting work of fiction with something to transfix and astound every reader. 'Marks a new departure for the American novel.'

She travels the world-- from a beachside compound in Hawaii to a remote village in Brazil-- to meet face-to-face with the most acclaimed healers. She often experiences their work first-hand and reports, with fascinating detail, the story of their real-life miracles and incredible feats. She also writes about the wonder of the \\"placebo effect,\\" which seems to give some people the faith they need to begin healing on their own. You'll meet Katie Engelhardt, a young woman from Tennessee, who is able to intuit and then often heal the ailments of people while in a trancelike state. Sometimes, after entering her trance, goldlike metal flakes appear on her face, neck, back, and hands. In another chapter, \\"Bundji,\\" an Australian man with Aboriginal ancestors, tells how he was led to resurrect the healing methods of his people and now travels the world to heal those in need with \\"love, light, and energy.\\" Dr. Ruth Ziemba, a traditionally trained nurse and chiropractor, explains why her treatments require only the lightest pressure with hands her patients say emanate an intense, healing heat. You'll also meet John of God, the Brazilian with the kitchen knife, who treats as many as 3,000 people at a time, excising tumors, ending blindness, and curing arthritis and cancer at his Casa de San Inacio in a remote Brazilian village. The Brazilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife grants an unprecedented view of this simultaneously ancient and modern phenomenon, and its most compelling practitioners. Sandy Johnson allows you to meet these spiritual magicians so that you can attempt to understand their gifts and motivations, and witness the best and worst of their work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RwllNQAACAAJ&dq=The+Brazilian+Healer+with+the+Kitchen+Knife:+And+Other+Stories+of+Mystics,+Shamans,+and+Miracle+Makers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flower in the Skull: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mouse Butcher","description":"On the still air from the distant fields came o horrible mixture of a roar and a scream with a snarl mixed in, and even at that distance it was so loud that everyone knew one thing for certain.

Before becoming the F hrer of the Third Reich, it is said Adolf Hitler was a failed artist who bummed around at his half-brother s house in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913. Based on the memoir of the future despot s sister-in-law, Bridget Hitler, Young Adolf is a vivid imagining of this alleged visit to the United Kingdom. The story begins with Adolf aboard a ferry, aiming to avoid Austrian military service. He has no luggage, save for a book, and holds a false passport made out in the name of his dead brother, paranoid that the authorities might be tailing him. But what Adolf should be worried about is how he will be received at his destination. At the train station, his brother Alois greets him with outrage. Alois had sent money for their sister Angela to travel to Liverpool, but Adolf stole the funds. Taking refuge on the sofa for days, Adolf makes only one friend: Jewish landlord Mr. Meyer, surprisingly enough. With mutual interests in opera and architecture, the two become close, though Adolf does mention his thoughts on race relations and  contaminated blood.  Eventually, under pressure, Adolf stops loafing and gets a menial job. Most people think he won t ever amount to much, but it s clear that Adolf has bigger aspirations. Originally published in 1978, this was the first foray into historical fiction for award-winning author Beryl Bainbridge, who would become famous for works like Master Georgie and the bestselling Every Man for Himself. Combining dark humor and psychological intrigue, Young Adolf is a portrait of both a man and a city before two World Wars changed everything.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=518pDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Love and Marriage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9VOwvgEACAAJ&dq=The+Mystery+of+Love+and+Marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women of Other Worlds: Excursions Through Science Fiction and Feminism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Writing to Survive: The Private Notebooks of Conrad Richter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFyGPwAACAAJ&dq=Writing+to+Survive:+The+Private+Notebooks+of+Conrad+Richter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bumps Are What You Climb on","description":"We can't prevent crises from happening.

Ma is exhausted from nursing newborn Oscar, and Mariette needs a break. Meanwhile, Mariette s husband, Charley, reminisces about delightful summers spent in Brittany during his youth. It was inexpensive, the food was marvelous, the air was warm and sultry, and they would almost never see a drop of rain. And with that, Ma persuades Pop to take a holiday in France. But when the Larkin clan arrives in the village of St. Pierre le Port, it is vastly different from Charley s memories. It is raining, the food is awful, the hotel is run-down, and the manager is rather nasty. The Larkins normally find joy in the little things in life, but they have never dealt with a vacation like this . . .  Very racy, earthy. Rabelaisian.   The Spectator Praise for the Pop Larkin Chronicles  Hilarious.   The New York Times  Pop Larkin, Ma and their progeny . . . are essentially English of the rich and ribald England of Chaucer and Shakespeare. A superb and timeless comedy.

It is the first and the original book of quantitative questions from finance job interviews. Painstakingly revised over 25 years and 20 editions, Heard on The Street has been shaped by feedback from many hundreds of readers. With well over 60,000 copies in print, its readership is unmatched by any competing book. The revised 20th edition contains over 225 quantitative questions collected from actual job interviews in investment banking, investment management, and options trading. The interviewers use the same questions year-after-year, and here they are with detailed solutions! This edition also includes over 225 non-quantitative actual interview questions, giving a total of more than 450 actual finance job interview questions. There is also a recently revised section on interview technique based on Dr. Crack's experiences interviewing candidates and also based on feedback from interviewers worldwide. The quant questions cover pure quant/logic, financial economics, derivatives, and statistics. They come from all types of interviews (corporate finance, sales and trading, quant research, etc.), and from all levels of interviews (undergraduate, MS, MBA, PhD). The first seven editions of Heard on the Street contained an appendix on option pricing. That appendix was carved out as a standalone book many years ago and it is now available in its revised fourth edition: \\"Basic Black-Scholes\\" (ISBN: 978-0-9941386-8-2). Dr. Crack did PhD coursework at MIT and Harvard, and graduated with a PhD from MIT. He has won many teaching awards, and has publications in the top academic, practitioner, and teaching journals in finance. He has degrees/diplomas in Mathematics/Statistics, Finance, Financial Economics and Accounting/Finance. Dr. Crack taught at the university level for over 25 years including four years as a front line teaching assistant for MBA students at MIT, and four years teaching undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs at Indiana University. He has worked as an independent consultant to the New York Stock Exchange and to a foreign government body investigating wrong doing in the financial markets. His most recent practitioner job was as the head of a quantitative active equity research team at what was the world's largest institutional money manager.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-qUoygEACAAJ&dq=Heard+on+the+street:+Quantitative+questions+from+Wall+Street+job+interviews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building for the lawn and garden","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn","description":"First published in 2003 and subsequently reprinted, Colonel Michael Cobb's two volume atlas of the railways of Great Britain proved to be one of the most remarkable successes in the history of railway publishing. However, it was always recognised that the high price represented a barrier to those who were only interested in part of the country. With an aim to address this, a new series is being launched of which this is the fourth volume.Outlining the fascinating and very diverse railway network of Cheshire and Shropshire, the book explores the many lines found on the border between England and Wales. Although both counties are predominantly rural, the Severn Valley through Ironbridge was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution and a considerable network of lines developed in the county to serve the coal and iron industries. For Cheshire, the route to Ireland via Holyhead was to prove an early impetus to railway development and subsequently its proximity to both Liverpool and Manchester saw the development of a considerable range of passenger services operating to these major centres. Although predominantly controlled by the constituents of the LMS and Great Western, the LNER was also a force in the area. There were also a number of minor narrow gauge lines such as the Shropshire & Montgomery and the Snailbeach adding to the variety of railway interest in the district.A detailed historical sketch outlining the development of this railway network and a beautiful selection of photographs make this book a must have reference guide on Cheshire and Shropshire. It also contains a detailed index and a gazetteer of stations with opening times and, where appropriate, closure dates. It will be an essential reference source for all living in the regions covered and all serious railway historians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cm50AAAAMAAJ&dq=Red+Sabbath:+The+Battle+of+Little+Bighorn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Occupational Therapy Student Primer: A Guide to College Success","description":"The OT Student Primer: A Guide to College Success focuses on advice and tutorials to make a student's journey through OT school more successful and enjoyable.

A single gram of the toxin produced by the skin of the Golden Poison Frog can kill 100,000 people. Male Darwin s Frogs carry their tadpoles in their vocal sacs for sixty days before coughing them out into the world. The Wood Frogs of North America freeze every winter, reanimating in the spring from the glucose and urea that prevent cell collapse. The Book of Frogs commemorates the diversity and magnificence of all of these creatures, and many more. Six hundred of nature s most fascinating frog species are displayed, with each entry including a distribution map, sketches of the frogs, species identification, natural history, and conservation status. Life-size color photos show the frogs at their actual size including the colossal seven-pound Goliath Frog. Accessibly written by expert Tim Halliday and containing the most up-to-date information, The Book of Frogs will captivate both veteran researchers and amateur herpetologists. As frogs increasingly make headlines for their troubling worldwide decline, the importance of these fascinating creatures to their ecosystems remains underappreciated. The Book of Frogs brings readers face to face with six hundred astonishingly unique and irreplaceable species that display a diverse array of adaptations to habitats that are under threat of destruction throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x0SjDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Frogs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not My Thing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"University of San Diego: Off the Record (College Prowler) (College Prowler: University of San Diego Off the Record)","description":"Provides a look at the University of San Diego from the students' viewpoint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6TC8GAAACAAJ&dq=University+of+San+Diego:+Off+the+Record+(College+Prowler)+(College+Prowler:+University+of+San+Diego+Off+the+Record)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradise Lost and Other Poems (Mentor Series)","description":"Presents three major works by the seventeenth-century English poet, including his epic poem \\"Paradise Lost,\\" which depicts the creation, fall, and redemption of humankind and the moral and spiritual dilemmas of God's judgment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8VPONAEACAAJ&dq=Paradise+Lost+and+Other+Poems+(Mentor+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ASH ROAD ( Ivan Southall Library )","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0xOvtwEACAAJ&dq=ASH+ROAD+(+Ivan+Southall+Library+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Act Like Nothing's Wrong: The Montage Art of Winston Smith","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Victorian Christmas Tea: Angel in the Attic/A Daddy for Christmas/Tea for Marie/Going Home (HeartQuest Christmas Anthology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"TEXAS BOUND-VOL IV-TAPE","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QzkV6RZgLToC&dq=TEXAS+BOUND-VOL+IV-TAPE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Ventre De Paris (Folio) (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Traceable Temperatures","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Mathematical Groups (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Son of woman (The life and letters series)","description":"What follows (part dialogue, part monologue, mostly rumination) is a series of letters I wrote to my two children, Chris(topher) Russell and Alex(andra) Sophia, over the course of 24 years.The first letter is one I wrote to my son on his day of birth: November 25, 1991; the last is one I wrote to my daughter leading up to her twenty-first birthday on June 8, 2015. Some letters are missing from this publication: they're either lost to other computers, other hard drives, other floppy discs-or are still in storage in the Bronx. I may or may not be able to recover them ever again.What, then, is-and was, from its genesis-the rationale for these letters? Quite simply, a desire to recall, as accurately as possible, the physical, moral and cognitive development of my two children year by year, and blow by blow, as they grew from infancy to toddlerhood, and from childhood to adolescence. But why? So that if they ever needed to, they could one day look back and understand a large part of what made (and makes) them who they are as adults in all of their scintillating functionality or dysfunctionality.This publication may or may not prove to be a worthy addition-or at least a side note-to the ever-raging debate of Nature vs. Nurture. I'm not a psychologist. I'm a writer ... \\"with a gift [or at least a head] for fiction\\" (David Mamet, State and Main) to boot. And so, I must warn you: caveat lector!That said, these letters are the verbal foundation of a truth I aspired to establish early on with my children. What I conveyed often enough orally to my son from the moment he could understand English-namely, \\"You don't lie to me; I won't lie to you\\"-was never easy for either of us to embrace. And in some sense, at least, I made my part of the bargain easier by concealing lots of difficult truths until his eighteenth birthday (in 2009), when I suspected he'd be better able to handle those truths in written form.He was. And did.On that basis, and once I'd returned to Brooklyn just short of a month ago, I decided to risk the same with Alex, and consequently gave her all of the letters I'd addressed to her and that I could still access.But why should anyone have any interest whatsoever in an otherwise private correspondence between a father and his children? I can't say that anyone will. That said, no one has ever written a series of letters to his or her children over the course of nineteen years (if one includes those children's day of birth). At least, not that I know of. We all think thoughts; forge memories; bond, then break bonds; grow close, then grow apart. But too much of what occurs to a child gets lost in the shuffle-or worse, gets suppressed, only to raise its arrogant head in some other form(s) in adulthood.The events that first kept us together as a family unit-but then blew us apart-were nothing I could've anticipated in my wildest dreams or nightmares. The strategies my children and I have employed to keep us close over the years are ones the children of estranged parents will hardly consider novel. But the words my two children said (and sometimes wrote in e-mails) to me are some of the kindest, most considerate-and yes, most loving-I've ever heard out of the mouth of any child.In that sense, this collection is a gift to all parents for whom it's not already too late. While not everyone has the free time I've had over the years, not to mention a facility with writing candidly about family matters for future reference. I don't know that such a facility is really all that important; I rather think it's the gesture, the consistency, the promise made and kept.The royalties, should there be any, are entirely theirs-as are the responsibilities that come with publishing a book. I will henceforth let them speak for themselves.As of this Father's Day in 2015-just as on other Father's Days in years past-I couldn't be happier with either of them.But that's a father speaking.

Athens (Wisconsin Studies in Classics)","description":"Using material remains, as well as the evidence of contemporary Greek history, rhetoric, and poetry, David Castriota interprets the Athenian monuments as vehicles of an official ideology intended to celebrate and justify the present in terms of the past. Castriota focuses on the strategy of ethical antithesis that asserted Greek moral superiority over the \\"barbaric\\" Persians, whose invasion had been repelled a generation earlier. He examines how, in major public programs of painting and sculpture, the leading artists of the period recast the Persians in the guise of wild and impious mythic antagonists to associate them with the ethical flaws or weaknesses commonly ascribed to women, animals, and foreigners. The Athenians, in contrast, were compared to mythic protagonists representing the excellence and triumph of Hellenic culture. Castriota's study is innovative in emphasizing the ethical implication of mythic precedents, which required substantial alterations to render them more effective as archetypes for the defense of Greek culture against a foreign, morally inferior enemy. The book looks in new ways at how the patrons and planners sought to manipulate viewer response through the selective presentation or repackaging of mythic traditions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&dq=Myth,+Ethos,+and+Actuality:+Official+Art+in+Fifth+Century+B.C.+Athens+(Wisconsin+Studies+in+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","description":"Fruiting Bodies and Other Fungi is a collection of 13 short stories by master of horror Brian Lumley.

In Objectivity, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison chart the emergence of objectivity in the mid-nineteenth-century sciences   and show how the concept differs from alternatives, truth-to-nature and trained judgment. This is a story of lofty epistemic ideals fused with workaday practices in the making of scientific images. From the eighteenth through the early twenty-first centuries, the images that reveal the deepest commitments of the empirical sciences   from anatomy to crystallography   are those featured in scientific atlases: the compendia that teach practitioners of a discipline what is worth looking at and how to look at it. Atlas images define the working objects of the sciences of the eye: snowflakes, galaxies, skeletons, even elementary particles. Galison and Daston use atlas images to uncover a hidden history of scientific objectivity and its rivals. Whether an atlas maker idealizes an image to capture the essentials in the name of truth-to-nature or refuses to erase even the most incidental detail in the name of objectivity or highlights patterns in the name of trained judgment is a decision enforced by an ethos as well as by an epistemology. As Daston and Galison argue, atlases shape the subjects as well as the objects of science. To pursue objectivity   or truth-to-nature or trained judgment   is simultaneously to cultivate a distinctive scientific self wherein knowing and knower converge. Moreover, the very point at which they visibly converge is in the very act of seeing not as a separate individual but as a member of a particular scientific community. Embedded in the atlas image, therefore, are the traces of consequential choices about knowledge, persona, and collective sight. Objectivity is a book addressed to any one interested in the elusive and crucial notion of objectivity   and in what it means to peer into the world scientifically.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtsPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE'S COOKING FUN","description":"Presents recipes for fancy food, including zoo food, whizzer fizzers, roll-up sandwiches, custard and pupcake cookies, and a crackerwitch castle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ufBuAAAACAAJ&dq=STRAWBERRY+SHORTCAKE%27S+COOKING+FUN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Antique Tools & Machinery: Covers More Than 50 Collectible Categories","description":"Featuring more than 60 categories, including adzes, carpenter tools, drills, plumbing and wood cutting tools, this comprehensive guide covers the tools and machinery of yesteryear.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=64cMAAAACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Antique+Tools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"New American Book of the Dead","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How the Forest Grew","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Looking Book","description":"In THE LOOKING BOOK, beloved author P.

The two singers come from separate worlds: one the Brooklyn projects, the other the Baptist, rural South. One has a God-given voice and the ambition to be a star, the other a more subtle gift and a handful of hazy fantasies. But both learn the destructive consequences of following their hearts. They find sanctuary together under Honeybee's tender guidance, struggling to find the balancing point where music doesn't overpower love.

Involving widespread unrest, the removal of a governor, a state of emergency and commision of enquiry from London, these were some of the most stormy episodes in the story of the end of empire. This biography, based on original sources, including the Glyn Jones papers to which the author had first and exclusive access, reveals Jones' relationship with Hastings Banda in a new and controversial light. Jones' appointment was the pinnacle of a distinguished career in the colonial service, which began in Northern Rhodesia as an administrative cadet in 1931. In 1960, as the demand for early constitutional advance in the northern territories of the Central Africa Federation and secession from that federation became more insistent, Jones moved from Northern Rhodesia to neighbouring Nyasaland, where he stayed for the most critical years of his colonial service career. These years saw Jones's promotion to Governor and Governor-General. This revealing account is the third volume of Baker's biographical studies of the last three governors of Nyasaland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KotAzAEACAAJ&dq=Sir+Glyn+Jones:+A+Proconsul+in+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Upgrade Your PC In a Weekend , Revised Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to iPods, iTunes, and Music Online 3 (Rough Guide Reference)","description":"This essential guide is the ultimate companion to iPods, the defining gadget of the digital music era.

This book offers valuable answers and practical strategies for doing just that.

It provides practical insights for creating and leading teams that are highly diverse and, perhaps, geographically dispersed. A must read!\\"- Julie O'Mara, O'Mara Past President, American Society for Training and Development \\"Terrific! World Class Teams is user friendly, practical, experience-based and comprehensive . . . [it is] a veritable toolkit for both team leaders and consultants.\\" -Donna McNamara, Director, Global Education & Training, Colgate-Palmolive Company To compete successfully in today's global marketplace, companies have to be lean, flexible, and responsive to their customers. They must also be creative, quick, and customized so they can adapt to new market opportunities. To achieve this, more and more organizations are rejecting their hierarchical, functionally driven pyramid structures in favor of a flatter, team-based approach that brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds and specializations who can pool their expertise. As many in the business arena are realizing, the concept of teamwork is quickly becoming a key global competitive strategy for developing and delivering innovative products and services in a faster, more efficient manner. In World Class Teams, Lynda McDermott and her coauthors draw heavily from their experience with such international firms as Pfizer, Colgate, AT&T, Coopers & Lybrand, and Motorola to give managers, executive training organizations, team leaders, and HR and OD specialists a hands-on guide that will help them develop, launch, lead, and evaluate world class teams. An ASTD award winner for her work in the field, McDermott addresses the major issues surrounding the creation and management of cross-functional global teams. Although organizations are rushing to form teams, few invest the time and resources necessary to help lay the groundwork for productive cross-functional/cross-cultural team success. Offering real-world answers and practical strategies, this broad-based fieldbook provides specific guidelines on how teams can become \\"world class\\" performers. Each topically organized chapter answers a wide range of key issues, including: * Selecting and developing world class team leaders * Methods for measuring and rewarding performance * Team-based goal setting * Leveraging today's technology for maximum team performance * Managing the functional and cultural borders of world class teams Written in accessible terms, World Class Teams can help anybody involved with team building manage such essentials as internal team processes, competition among teams for resources and recognition, individuals who don't want to function as interdependent team members, and compensation systems that reward teams as opposed to solo performances. Packed with individual and team exercises, as well as useful toolkits filled with techniques, models, and sample documents, this is must reading for anyone looking to build and maintain a strong world class team.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zI-AQgAACAAJ&dq=World+Class+Teams:+Working+Across+Borders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DARK GHOSTS RISING","description":"Two best friends, Chelsea and Bethany, are learning about some of life's most difficult trials facing teens today.

Leading us chapter by chapter through its most important stories--from the Creation and the Tree of Knowledge through the Exodus from Egypt and the journey to the Promised Land--James Kugel shows how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. Was the snake in the Garden of Eden the devil, or the Garden itself \\"paradise\\"? Did Abraham discover monotheism, and was his son Isaac a willing martyr? Not until the ancient interpreters set to work. Poring over every little detail in the Bible's stories, prophecies, and laws, they let their own theological and imaginative inclinations radically transform the Bible's very nature. Their sometimes surprising interpretations soon became the generally accepted meaning. These interpretations, and not the mere words of the text, became the Bible in the time of Jesus and Paul or the rabbis of the Talmud. Drawing on such sources as the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish apocrypha, Hellenistic writings, long-lost retellings of Bible stories, and prayers and sermons of the early church and synagogue, Kugel reconstructs the theory and methods of interpretation at the time when the Bible was becoming the bedrock of Judaism and Christianity. Here, for the first time, we can witness all the major transformations of the text and recreate the development of the Bible \\"As It Was\\" at the start of the Common era--the Bible as we know it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hyEwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FIST OF GOD, THE(LARGE PRINT) (Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte Press Large Print Collection)","description":"With mandatory retirement looming on the horizon, longtime British Intelligence operative Sam McCready must allow his remarkable history of service--involving intrigue, deception, and murder--to decide his fate","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1DLEQwAACAAJ&dq=FIST+OF+GOD,+THE(LARGE+PRINT)+(Bantam/Doubleday/Delacorte+Press+Large+Print+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Esther Waters","description":"Esther Waters (1894) was one of the first English novels to defeat Victorian moral censorship.

Edward Evans, Library Journal \\"This thoroughly interesting book is based on fourteen months of field work among the Jivaro Indians of Eastern Ecuador. . . .

In a series of major advances, central problems once considered intractable were solved, and a rich theory emerged. Although progress continues, the time seems ripe for a full and unified account of the subject, weaving the old and new results together. This thorough exposition provides just that. The subject of Bergman spaces is a masterful blend of complex function theory with functional analysis and operator theory. It has much in common with Hardy spaces, but involves new elements such as hyperbolic geometry, reproducing kernels, and biharmonic Green functions. In this book, the authors develop background material and provide a self-contained introduction to a broad range of topics, including recent advances on interpolation and sampling, contractive zero-divisors, and invariant subspaces. The book is accessible to researchers and advanced graduate students who have studied basic complex function theory, measure theory, and functional analysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DOjxBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Crusaders (Deadlands: Hell on Earth, PEG6008)","description":"The world is in ruins and the Reckoners are walking the earth, but that won't stop your hero.

Thanks to the increasing numbers of moviegoers and domestic films produced, South Korea has become one of the world s major film markets. In 2001, the South Korean film industry became the first in recent history to reclaim its domestic market from Hollywood and continues to maintain around a 50 percent market share today. High-quality South Korean films are increasingly entering global film markets and connecting with international audiences in commercial cinemas and art theatres, and at major international film festivals. Despite this growing recognition of the films themselves, Korean cinema s rich heritage has not heretofore received significant scholarly attention in English-language publications. This groundbreaking collection of thirty-five essays by a wide range of academic specialists situates current scholarship on Korean cinema within the ongoing theoretical debates in contemporary global film studies. Chapters explore key films of Korean cinema, from Sweet Dream, Madame Freedom, The Housemaid, and The March of Fools to Oldboy, The Host, and Train to Busan, as well as major directors such as Shin Sang-ok, Kim Ki-young, Im Kwon-taek, Bong Joon-ho, Hong Sang-soo, Park Chan-wook, and Lee Chang-dong. While the chapters provide in-depth analyses of particular films, together they cohere into a detailed and multidimensional presentation of Korean cinema s cumulative history and broader significance. With its historical and critical scope, abundance of new research, and detailed discussion of important individual films, Rediscovering Korean Cinema is at once an accessible classroom text and a deeply informative compendium for scholars of Korean and East Asian studies, cinema and media studies, and communications. It will also be an essential resource for film industry professionals and anyone interested in international cinema.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MsG9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Korean+Cinema.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stagestruck","description":"Tommy is so excited.

By the time Weisman met Sinatra in 1976, he was already the Voice, a man who held sway over popular music and pop culture for forty years, who had risen to the greatest heights of fame and plumbed the depths of failure, all the while surviving with the trademark swagger that women pined for and men wanted to emulate. Passionate and generous on his best days, sullen and unpredictable on his worst, Sinatra invited Weisman into his inner circle, an honor that the budding celebrity manager never took for granted. Even when he was caught up in a legal net designed to snare Sinatra, Weisman went to prison rather than being coerced into telling prosecutors what they wanted to hear. With Weisman's help, Sinatra orchestrated in his final decades some of the most memorable moments of his career. There was the Duets album, which was Sinatra's top seller, the massive tours, such as Together Again, which featured a short-lived reunion of the Rat Pack--until Dean Martin, having little interest in reliving the glory days, couldn't handle it anymore--and the Ultimate Event Tour, which brought Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr. on board and refreshed the much-needed lining of both their pocketbooks. Weisman also worked with many other acts, including Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, and an ungrateful Don Rickles, whom Weisman helped get out from under the mob's thumb. Over their years together, Weisman became a confidant to the man who trusted few, and he came to know Sinatra's world intimately: his wife, Barbara, who socialized with princesses and presidents and tried to close Sinatra off from his rough and tough friends such as Jilly Rizzo; Nancy Jr., who was closest to her dad; Tina, who aggressively battled for her and her siblings' rights to the Sinatra legacy and was most like her father; and Frank Jr., the child with the most fraught relationship with the legendary entertainer. Ultimately Weisman, who had become the executor of Sinatra's estate, was left alone to navigate the infighting and hatred between those born to the name and the wife who acquired it, when a mystery woman showed up and threatened to throw the family's future into jeopardy. Laden with surprising, moving, and revealing stories, The Way It Was also shows a side of Sinatra few knew. As a lion in winter, he was struggling with the challenges that come with old age, as well as memory loss, depression, and antidepressents. Weisman was by his side through it all, witness to a man who had towering confidence, staggering fearlessness, and a rarely seen vulnerability that became more apparent as his final days approached.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r14RDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Portuguese Grammar","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Another Sort of Learning","description":"Noting the widespread concern about the quality of education in our schools, Schall examines what is taught and read (and not read) in these schools.

This amendment was immediately challenged in the courts as a denial of equal protection of the laws under the United States Constitution. This litigation ultimately led to a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court invalidating the Colorado ballot initiative. Suzanne Goldberg, an attorney involved in the case from the beginning on behalf of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Lisa Keen, a journalist who covered the initiative campaign and litigation, tell the story of this case, providing an inside view of this complex and important litigation. Starting with the background of the initiative, the authors tell us about the debates over strategy, the court proceedings, and the impact of each stage of the litigation on the parties involved. The authors explore the meaning of legal protection for gay people and the arguments for and against the Colorado initiative. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the development of civil rights protections for gay people and the evolution of what it means to be gay in contemporary American society and politics. In addition, it is a rich story well told, and will be of interest to the general reader and scholars working on issues of civil rights, majority-minority relations, and the meaning of equal rights in a democratic society.

Now, at twenty-nine, thanks to a life change, she's got a whole lot of catching up to do, and a whole lot of bad girl to let loose. It's just a question of finding the right man. At first glance, Mac Hollister would appear to be just that man. The tall, rugged rancher practically oozes testosterone while his indolent posture, easy confidence and raw masculinity just screams \\"bad boy\\". He's the kind of man women spin dark fantasies around. The kind of man she's looking for.The minute the honey-blonde sets her dainty foot on the sidewalk in Round The Bend, Mac knows he's in trouble. From the top of her head, with its long French braid, to the tips of her toes, with their delicate pink polish, this woman defines elegance. Not the kind of woman he prefers, but no amount of logic can dissuade his interest once he sees Jessie's smile. He's always been a sucker for a sense of humor. Especially when it comes packaged with a killer body and an equally killer wit.Mac expects their affair to be short, sweet and safe, but he soon discovers that beneath that delicate image lurks a woman who can handle all the \\"bad boy\\" he can throw at her. She's everything he never expected to find, and what started out as short-term soon becomes a relationship that will demand a compromise he's not sure he can make in order to keep the one woman he can't imagine living without.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wnOItAEACAAJ&dq=Mac%27s+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friendly Persuasion (Blaze, Book 93)","description":"Where is the infamous Doctor Nite when she needs him?

So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), \\"Bartelby the Scrivener\\" (1853), \\"Benito Cerino\\" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RFpSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astronomy: A Self-Teaching Guide, Fourth Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Impacting Business: A Simple Model of IT Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Surprise Party (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dancing with Your Dark Horse: How Horse Sense Helps Us Find Balance, Strength and Wisdom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"These entertaining people","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of Tears We Cannot Stop \\"Entertaining Race is a splendid way to spend quality time reading one of the most remarkable thinkers in America today.\\"  Speaker Nancy Pelosi \\"To read Entertaining Race is to encounter the life-long vocation of a teacher who preaches, a preacher who teaches and an activist who cannot rest until all are set free.\\"  Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock For more than thirty years, Michael Eric Dyson has played a prominent role in the nation as a public intellectual, university professor, cultural critic, social activist and ordained Baptist minister. He has presented a rich and resourceful set of ideas about American history and culture. Now for the first time he brings together the various components of his multihued identity and eclectic pursuits. Entertaining Race is a testament to Dyson s consistent celebration of the outsized impact of African American culture and politics on this country. Black people were forced to entertain white people in slavery, have been forced to entertain the idea of race from the start, and must find entertaining ways to make race an object of national conversation. Dyson s career embodies these and other ways of performing Blackness, and in these pages, ranging from 1991 to the present, he entertains race with his pen, voice and body, and occasionally, alongside luminaries like Cornel West, David Blight, Ibram X. Kendi, Master P, MC Lyte, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Alicia Garza, John McWhorter, and Jordan Peterson. Most of this work will be new to readers, a fresh light for many of his long-time fans and an inspiring introduction for newcomers. Entertaining Race offers a compelling vision from the mind and heart of one of America s most important and enduring voices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aRsQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creators of the Jewish Experience in the Modern World","description":"The distinguished historian of the Jewish people, Howard M. Sachar, gives us a comprehensive and enthralling chronicle of the achievements and traumas of the Jews over the last four hundred years. Tracking their fate from Western Europe s age of mercantilism in the seventeenth century to the post-Soviet and post-imperialist Islamic upheavals of the twenty-first century, Sachar applies his renowned narrative skill to the central role of the Jews in many of the most impressive achievements of modern civilization: whether in the rise of economic capitalism or of political socialism; in the discoveries of theoretical physics or applied medicine; in  higher  literary criticism or mass communication and popular entertainment. As his account unfolds and moves from epoch to epoch, from continent to continent, from Europe to the Americas and the Middle East, Sachar evaluates communities that, until lately, have been underestimated in the perspective of Jewish and world history among them, Jews of Sephardic provenance, of the Moslem regions, and of Africa. By the same token, Sachar applies a master s hand in describing and deciphering the Jews  unique exposure and functional usefulness to totalitarian movements fascist, Nazi, and Stalinist. In the process, he shines an unsparing light on the often widely dissimilar behavior of separate European peoples, and on separate Jewish populations, during the Holocaust. A distillation of the author s lifetime of scholarly research and teaching experience, A History of the Jews in the Modern World provides a source of unsurpassed intellectual richness for university students and educated laypersons alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TLxA9W7q74sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rusty Wallace : The Decision to Win","description":"In a sport teeming with aggressive competitors, Rusty Wallace's commitment and drive are legendary.

Their term arakun roughly translates to  he who scratches with his hands.  Anyone who has found a raccoon rummaging around in a once securely closed trash container can attest to how skillful raccoons are with their front paws. In fact, they have four times as many sensory receptors in their forepaw skin as they do in their hindpaws, a ratio similar to that of human hands and feet. Samuel Zeveloff explores this trait and much more in his accessible natural history of raccoons. Written with the general reader in mind, Raccoons presents detailed information on raccoon evolution, physical characteristics, social behavior, habitats, food habits, reproduction, and conservation, as well as their relationship with humans and many other topics. The section on distribution and subspecies focuses on the raccoon s current range expansion, and the material on their cultural significance demonstrates this mammal s unique status in different North American cultures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2KNqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Radicals Behind the American Revolution: Six Who Spoke for Freedom","description":"It is an inspirational book, living hope and direction for a purposeful life.

Until recently, however, these translations remained largely neglected by Biblical scholars and historians. In telling the story of the Bible in Arabic, this book casts light on a crucial transition in the cultural and religious life of Jews and Christians in Arabic-speaking lands. In pre-Islamic times, Jewish and Christian scriptures circulated orally in the Arabic-speaking milieu. After the rise of Islam--and the Qur'an's appearance as a scripture in its own right--Jews and Christians translated the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament into Arabic for their own use and as a response to the Qur'an's retelling of Biblical narratives. From the ninth century onward, a steady stream of Jewish and Christian translations of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament crossed communal borders to influence the Islamic world. The Bible in Arabic offers a new frame of reference for the pivotal place of Arabic Bible translations in the religious and cultural interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K22YDwAAQBAJ&dq=Arabic+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The authority of the believer: Principles set forth in the epistle to the Ephesians","description":"There are few subjects relating to the Christian life concerning which there is so little exact knowledge as that of the Authority of the Believer.

The core distinctions between what currently exists and what is being created are communicated in this book through the compelling metaphor of Ants, Galileo, and Gandhi. This collection, developed from The Natural Step's conference on Sustainability and Innovation in 2002, provides radical ideas for generating a new perspective on the dynamics of business systems. \\"Ants\\" symbolise the lessons to be learned from nature and the dependence of individual beings on broader, complex systems. \\"Galileo\\" embodies brilliance in perceiving and proving that the current paradigm is flawed. 'Gandhi' exemplifies exceptional compassion in fighting for fundamental change. All of these attributes are increasingly relevant in a world where, globally, we are experiencing both a steady decline in life-supporting resources and rising demands. Recognition of these challenges is sparking innovation within the private sector where the first glimmers of systemic change can be seen. The book examines the emergence of 21st-century enterprises that recognise their reliance on broad social and ecological systems (\\"ants\\"), incorporate sparks of genius rooted in rigorous analyses (\\"Galileo\\"), and acknowledge the importance of compassion and determination within any endeavour (\\"Gandhi\\").

Yet language proficiency mediates test performance, so ELLs typically receive scores far below those of other students. This book explores how tests have become de facto language policy in schools, shaping what is taught in school, how it is taught, and in what language(s) it is taught. In New York City, while most schools responded to testing by increasing the amount of English instruction offered to ELLs, a few schools have preserved native language instruction instead. Moreover, this research documents how tests are a defining force in the daily lives of ELLs and the educators who serve them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2MnNDieFZRsC&dq=Leaving+No+Child+Behind:+My+First+Year+Teaching+in+New+York+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels All Over Town","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Last Rogue","description":"When a Guardian Angel's lapse in judgement changes the destiny of one family; a band of unlikely heroes find themselves in the center of the ultimate battle between good and evil.

After fleeing his native Vienna when the Nazis took power, he arrived in Chicago, where he spent the rest of his life. He became the most creative figure in the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, and is now remembered as the founder of 'self psychology,' whose emphasis on empathy sought to make Freudian psychoanalysis less neutral. Kohut's life invited complexity. He obfuscated his identity as a Jew, negotiated a protean sexuality, and could be surprisingly secretive about his health and other matters. In this biography, Charles Strozier shows Kohut as a paradigmatic figure in American intellectual life: a charismatic man whose ideas embodied the hope and confusions of a country still in turmoil. Inherent in his life and formulated in his work were the core issues of modern America. The years after World War II were the halcyon days of American psychoanalysis, which thrived as one analyst after another expanded upon Freud's insights. The gradual erosion of the discipline's humanism, however, began to trouble clinicians and patients alike. Heinz Kohut took the lead in the creation of the first authentically home-grown psychoanalytic movement. It took an emigre be so distinctly American. Strozier brings to his telling of Kohut's life all the tools of a skillful analyst: intelligence, erudition, empathy, contrary insight, and a willingness to look far below the surface.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YNH0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dogen's Formative Years in China: An Historical Study and Annotated Translation of the Hokyo-ki","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ravenburn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fveYGwAACAAJ&dq=Ravenburn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilgrims","description":"The story of the Pilgrim's first year is presented, from the dangerous voyage across the Atlantic to a harrowing first winter and the promise of the first Thanksgiving feast","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A0bWQhQU60gC&dq=Pilgrims&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Technique & Practice of Psychoanalysis V. 1","description":"A Tribe Called Quest ?

Wu-Tang Clan ? and twenty-five more hip-hop immortals It s a sad fact: hip-hop album liners have always been reduced to a list of producer and sample credits, a publicity photo or two, and some hastily composed shout-outs. That s a damn shame, because few outside the game know about the true creative forces behind influential masterpieces like PE s It Takes a Nation of Millions. . ., De La s 3 Feet High and Rising, and Wu-Tang s Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). A longtime scribe for the hip-hop nation, Brian Coleman fills this void, and delivers a thrilling, knockout oral history of the albums that define this dynamic and iconoclastic art form.

Studio craft and street smarts, sonic inspiration and skate ramps, triumph, tragedy, and take-out foodall played their part in creating these essential albums of the hip-hop canon.

This program has produced significant, lasting improvements in the school districts where it has already been implemented. Drawing on the results of a landmark study of 223 schools in six cities, a project that Ouchi supervised and that was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, Making Schools Work shows that a school's educational performance may be most directly affected by how the school is managed. Ouchi's 2001-2002 study examined innovative school systems in Edmonton (Canada), Seattle, and Houston, and compared them with the three largest traditional school systems: New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Researchers discovered that the schools that consistently performed best also had the most decentralized management systems, in which autonomous principals -- not administrators in a central office -- controlled school budgets and personnel hiring policies. They were fully responsible and fully accountable for the performance of their schools. With greater freedom and flexibility to shape their educational programs, hire specialists as needed, and generally determine the direction of their school, the best principals will act as entrepreneurs, says Ouchi. Those who do poorly are placed under the supervision of successful principals, who assume responsibility for the failing schools. An essential component of this management approach is the Weighted Student Formula, a budgetary tool whereby every student is evaluated and assessed a certain dollar value in educational services (a non-English-speaking or autistic student, or one from a low-income family, for example, would receive a higher dollar value than a middle-class student with no special needs). Families have the freedom to choose among public schools, and when schools must compete for students, good schools flourish while those that do poorly literally go out of business. Such accountability has long worked for religious and independent schools, where parents pay a premium for educational performance. Making Schools Work shows how the same approach can be adapted to public schools. The book also provides guidelines for parents on how to evaluate a school and make sure their child is getting the best education possible. Revolutionary yet practical, Making Schools Work shows that positive educational reform is within reach and, indeed, already happening in schools across the country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHmQMQ2jYWgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl Scout Handbook","description":"Handbook, award and group activities for Brownie Girl Scouts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZleMZwEACAAJ&dq=Girl+Scout+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"L'tranger","description":"With the intrigue of a psychological thriller, Camus's masterpiece gives us the story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on an Algerian beach.

These essays reflect the present-day reality of the indigenous people of the island of Guam. This book is framed in the context of an island that exists amidst the many conflicts and contradictions of being \\"freed from colonialism\\" by another colonial power in 1898 and \\"liberated from wartime aggression\\" by a country that put in under a Naval Administration until the 1960s and who worked to eliminate the culture of the local people through forced assimilation and nominal citizenship. It is written to articulate the reality of the Chamoru people of Guam as an indigenous Pacific Island culture, an American minority group, and an island people threatened by the encroachment of globalization into their lives. These essays will cause the reader to think critically on the subjects of globalization, sustainable development, sustainable governance, cultural reclamation, and self-determination on Guam, amongst the indigenous and colonized peoples in the world, question the value of democracy if it is involuntarily imposed on a people. This book is especially relevant for the present state of the world. Just Left is included in an academic series that we publish, 'The 1898 Consciousness Studies Series'. This series is a varied collection of essays on consciousness today in areas affected by the Spanish-American War and consequent possession by the U.S. These include The Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. Praise for Just Left of the Setting Sun \\"Fierce and compassionate, bold and resolute, Just Left of the Setting Sun is at once a coming into consciousness as it is a conch-shell blare for action by and for a new generation of Chamorros, the indigenous people of an island and archipelago long colonized by Spain, Japan and the United States of America. As critical towards fellow Chamorros who aid and abet the colonizer as he is of the colonizers themselves, Aguon also importantly situates the need for Native Struggles for Political and Cultural Self-Determination and Sovereignty within Feminist/Womanist critiques and global struggles for economic, social, and environmental justice, thereby providing a glimpse into the possibilities for local struggle informed and articulated to global movements beyond pan-indigenous movements per se, and for keeping global movements and political theory grounded in Indigenous traditions.\\" Vicente M. Diaz Associate Professor of American Culture University of Michigan, Ann Arbor \\"Aguon re-introduces us to the principles of international law as a guiding framework to the resolution of the dilemma brought about by the present non self-governing arrangements which provide the trappings of democratic governance, but in reality are rather democratically deficient by any objective examination. Indeed, an important component of new millennium colonialism is the existence, but not the recognition, of this democratic deficit... ...\\"Just Left of the Setting Sun\\" should be required reading for the people in the remaining territories, young and old, who need to discover/re-discover the fire within, that they might further move the process forward, if only by a few steps further along the continuum. In a very real sense, as Aguon observes, \\"inside the heart of the Chamoru is still an ocean of latent potentialities waiting to surge.\\" Dr. Carlyle Corbin Advisor on Governance and Political Development St. Croix, Virgin Islands","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=771ppORz1-YC&dq=Just+Left+of+the+Setting+Sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-knowledge and self-discipline","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pHY9AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alien ALert","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scientific Conversations: Interviews on Science from The New York Times","description":"In these thirty-eight interviews, originally published in the weekly Science Times section of The New York Times, Claudia Dreifus brings all of her colorful personality to bear on her subjects, as well as an arsenal of philosophy, literature, and current events, and an unmistakable curiosity.

Dreifus's outsider status in the world of science is perhaps one of her greatest interviewing strengths. A political journalist for much of her career, she stumbled into a position at the Science Times section. With little more scientific background than the average person, she scrambled to prepare for her meetings with some of the greatest minds in a broad range of disciplines-from astronomy to geology, from biology and medicine to computer science and mathematics. She soon found herself in a refreshingly candid environment, so unlike the one she had known on the political beat.

The Eucharistic Christ and the New Evangelization","description":"Many Christians think that the Christian tradition of communion is the same as the Catholic tradition of the Eucharist. But this is not so. The Eucharist (i.e., Transubstantiation), is a Catholic term for communion when the bread and the wine actually become the very body and blood of Jesus Christ, thus when taken the partaker supposedly experiences the presence of God. These transformed elements are placed in what is called a monstrance and can then be worshipped as if worshipping God Himself. The implications are tied in with salvation. With the Eucharist, salvation becomes sacramental (participation in a ritual) as opposed to justification by faith in Christ alone. While this mystical experience called the Eucharist cannot be upheld through Scripture, there appears to be an increase of interest by evangelical Christians towards this practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c-LPGAAACAAJ&dq=Another+Jesus%3F+The+Eucharistic+Christ+and+the+New+Evangelization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Way to Pentecost","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"New Insights into Astrology: Sex Is a T-Square Number Symbolism Harmonics Aspects Asteroids Research","description":"\\"New Insights into Astrology\\" covers extensive highly technical topics ranging from number symbology to the Uranian planets.

But is quantum physics really so unknowable? Is reality really so strange? And just how can cats be half-alive and half-dead at the same time? Our journey into the quantum begins with nature's own conjuring trick, in which we discover that atoms -- contrary to the rules of everyday experience -- can exist in two locations at once. To understand this we travel back to the dawn of the twentieth century and witness the birth of quantum theory, which over the next one hundred years was to overthrow so many of our deeply held notions about the nature of our universe.

Although unique, this deck is similar to and feels like a standard Tarot; it can work with any divinatory spread you like. To make divination with this deck easier, it comes with a 180-page mini-book that features meanings for each card when used in a reading plus 15 different layouts you can use. The book also describes the symbolic and mythological meanings of the cards. The imagery of the cards will carry you to another world. Combined with the information about them in the book, this set becomes a virtual training system in the Faery Wicca faith. Use them to steep yourself in the Faery tradition. The Faery Wicca tradition is based upon ancient Irish myth and legend. It brings to life the ancient gods and goddesses who can guide, comfort and imbue you with spirituality and power.

Ancient Greek and Roman society had many gods and an addiction to astrology and divination. This introduction to the period traces the process by which Christianity changed this and so provided a foundation for the modern world: the teaching of Jesus created a lasting community, which grew to command the allegiance of the Roman emperor. Christianity is discussed in relation to how it appeared to both Jews and pagans, and how its Christian doctrine and practice were shaped in relation to Graeco-Roman culture and the Jewish matrix. Among the major figures discussed are Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, Julian the Apostate, Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine. Following a chronological approach, Henry Chadwick's clear exposition of important texts and theological debates in their historical context is unrivalled in detail. In particular, theological and ecclesial texts are examined in relation to the behaviour and beliefs of people who attended churches and synagogues. Christians did not find agreement and unity easy and the author displays a distinctive concern for the factors - theological, personal, and political - which caused division in the church and prevented reconciliation. The emperors, however, began to foster unity for political reasons and to choose monotheism. Finally, the Church captured the society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s4aBJWNCDNkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Student Bible Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook of Leadership Training Activities: 50 One-Hour Designs","description":"Save hours of tedious preparation time with this tired-and-true collection of expert-developed and ready-to-use activities that teach visioning, coaching, team leadership, customer focus, managing change, empowering and motivating employees, managing processes and project management skills!

They can also be studied privately prior to the labs being developed in the classes. You will see the power and flexibility of VEE Pro in action in special labs of increasing complexity based around the monitoring and control of a virtual vehicle radiator. The process begins with the simple simulation of a thermometer and ends with the statistical logging of tests. Exceeding test limits will trigger audio and visual warnings. The six appendixes are valuable tools for reference. They explain how to navigate within the programs, collate related data, technical term explanations, and cross-referenced partial programming sequences and outcomes. If you are a student taking classes in VEE Pro, this book will make your life easier and the learning process more straightforward.

It exposes how and why the interests of people today and those of future generations are often in conflict and what can be done. It rebuts critical concepts such as Parfits' non-identity paradox and Beckerman's denial of any possibility of intergenerational justice. The core of the book is the lucid application of a veil of ignorance to derive principles of intergenerational justice which show that our duties to posterity are stronger than is often supposed. Tremmel's approach demands that each generation both consider and improve the well-being of future generations. To measure the well-being of future generations Tremmel employs the Human Development Index rather than the metrics of utilitarian subjective happiness. The book thus answers in detailed, concrete terms the two most important questions of every theory of intergenerational justice: what to sustain? and how much to sustain?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e3G2xpfEg0QC&dq=Best+Short+Stories+of+Jack+London+(Perma+Books+P41)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated Children's Bible","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Healing Intelligence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xxG_QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Healing+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Female biography: Or, Memoirs of illustrious and celebrated women of all ages and countries.

Tracing Milton s literary, intellectual, and political development with unprecedented depth and understanding, Poet of Revolution is an unmatched biographical account of the formation of the mind that would go on to create Paradise Lost but would first justify the killing of a king. Biographers of Milton have always struggled to explain how the young poet became a notorious defender of regicide and other radical ideas such as freedom of the press, religious toleration, and republicanism. In this groundbreaking intellectual biography of Milton s formative years, Nicholas McDowell draws on recent archival discoveries to reconcile at last the poet and polemicist. He charts Milton s development from his earliest days as a London schoolboy, through his university life and travels in Italy, to his emergence as a public writer during the English Civil War. At the same time, McDowell presents fresh, richly contextual readings of Milton s best-known works from this period, including the  Nativity Ode,   L Allegro  and  Il Penseroso,  Comus, and  Lycidas.  Challenging biographers who claim that Milton was always a secret radical, Poet of Revolution shows how the events that provoked civil war in England combined with Milton s astonishing programme of self-education to instil the beliefs that would shape not only his political prose but also his later epic masterpiece.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Su3eDwAAQBAJ&dq=John+Milton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Change and Transition","description":"Harvard Business Essentials are comprehensive, solution-oriented paperbacks for business readers of all levels of experience.

Each new strategy or invention by the Allies or Central Powers quickly brought a deadly response from the other. Each innovation was tested in the air by combat pilots who were gambling with their lives. At times with a life expectancy of only 21 flying days, the pilots became the most enduring legend of the War.Eric and Jane Lawson present a unique treatment of the air actions of World War I as a single grand campaign, with the balance of power shifting back and forth with each new weapon or tactic.World War I broke out in August 1914, only 11 years after the Wright brothers' first airplane flight. The warring nations assembled makeshift air forces of civilian aircraft flown by amateur pilots, largely for reconnaissance purposes.By the end of 1915 haphazard observation, hand-dropped bombs, and pilots occasionally shooting at each other with carbines and begun to give way to specialized air squadrons, specially designed aircraft, bomb racks, aerial cameras and mounted machine guns.By war's end long-range bombing, rudimentary aircraft carriers, rocket - and cannon - armed planes, radios, ground-attach tactics, and other features of modern warfare had made an appearance. Eric and Jane Lawson maintain focus on the human dimension of the conflict. The most important commanders and pilots are examined, as well as groundbreaking coverage of the first African-American combat pilot, the first women to fly military missions, and Fiorello LaGuardia's days as an Italian bombardier. Billy Mitchell's image as an advocate of air power is balanced with a detailed account of his role in the St. Mihiel offensive, in which he assembled the war's largest air armada, made up of American, British, French, and even Italian aircraft. The First Air Campaign features a fast paced narrative supplemented by detailed information on unit organization and aircraft performance and innovated new maps illustrating the first attempts to apply the principles of war to aerial maneuver. Also included are unique war-time photographs, some not seen in 75 years, and specially-prepared charts, available nowhere else, graphically portraying the ever-changing balance of air power throughout the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E8OUAQAACAAJ&dq=First+Air+Campaign+(Great+Campaigns)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","description":"\\"Much more than a page-turner. It s the first essential work of cultural history of the new decade.\\"  Charles Kaiser, The Guardian One of The Washington Post's 50 best nonfiction books of 2021 | A Publishers Weekly best book of 2021 The Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist and New York Timesbestselling author of the behind-the-scenes explorations of the classic American Westerns High Noon and The Searchers now reveals the history of the controversial 1969 Oscar-winning film that signaled a dramatic shift in American popular culture. Director John Schlesinger s Darling was nominated for five Academy Awards, and introduced the world to the transcendently talented Julie Christie. Suddenly the toast of Hollywood, Schlesinger used his newfound clout to film an expensive, Panavision adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd. Expectations were huge, making the movie s complete critical and commercial failure even more devastating, and Schlesinger suddenly found himself persona non grata in the Hollywood circles he had hoped to conquer. Given his recent travails, Schlesinger s next project seemed doubly daring, bordering on foolish. James Leo Herlihy s novel Midnight Cowboy, about a Texas hustler trying to survive on the mean streets of 1960 s New York, was dark and transgressive. Perhaps something about the book s unsparing portrait of cultural alienation resonated with him. His decision to film it began one of the unlikelier convergences in cinematic history, centered around a city that seemed, at first glance, as unwelcoming as Herlihy s novel itself. Glenn Frankel s Shooting Midnight Cowboy tells the story of a modern classic that, by all accounts, should never have become one in the first place. The film s boundary-pushing subject matter homosexuality, prostitution, sexual assault earned it an X rating when it first appeared in cinemas in 1969. For Midnight Cowboy, Schlesinger who had never made a film in the United States enlisted Jerome Hellman, a producer coming off his own recent flop and smarting from a failed marriage, and Waldo Salt, a formerly blacklisted screenwriter with a tortured past. The decision to shoot on location in New York, at a time when the city was approaching its gritty nadir, backfired when a sanitation strike filled Manhattan with garbage fires and fears of dysentery. Much more than a history of Schlesinger s film, Shooting Midnight Cowboy is an arresting glimpse into the world from which it emerged: a troubled city that nurtured the talents and ambitions of the pioneering Polish cinematographer Adam Holender and legendary casting director Marion Dougherty, who discovered both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and supported them for the roles of  Ratso  Rizzo and Joe Buck leading to one of the most intensely moving joint performances ever to appear on screen. We follow Herlihy himself as he moves from the experimental confines of Black Mountain College to the theatres of Broadway, influenced by close relationships with Tennessee Williams and Ana?s Nin, and yet unable to find lasting literary success. By turns madcap and serious, and enriched by interviews with Hoffman, Voight, and others, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic is not only the definitive account of the film that unleashed a new wave of innovation in American cinema, but also the story of a country and an industry beginning to break free from decades of cultural and sexual repression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5bniDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Production Operations Management","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zbSKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yesterdays with authors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=evRPtgEACAAJ&dq=Yesterdays+with+authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virginia Woolf","description":"Traces the life of the British novelist and discusses her major works","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZW4KVeQM6CoC&dq=Virginia+Woolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piggins and the Royal Wedding","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","description":"Her life would never be the same once she ventured...

Was the nation becoming greedy, selfish, vulgar, and cruel? Was there such a thing as too much prosperity? At the same time, the United States felt the influence of the rise of popular mass-circulation newspapers and magazines and the surge in American book publishing. Concern over living correctly as well as prosperously was commonly discussed by leading authors and journalists, who were now writing for ever-expanding regional and national audiences. Women became more important as authors and editors, giving advice and building huge markets for women readers, with the magazine Godey's Lady's Book and with e expressing women's views about the troubled state of society. Best-selling male writers--including novelist George Lippard, historian George Bancroft, and travel writer Bayard Taylor--were among those adding their voices to concerns about prosperity and morality and about America's place in the world. Writers and publishers discovered that a high moral tone could be exceedingly good for business. The authors of this book examine how popular writers and widely read newspapers, magazines, and books expressed social tensions between prosperity and morality. This study draws on that nationwide conversation through leading mass media, including circulation-leading newspapers, the New York Herald and the New York Tribune, plus prominent newspapers from the South and West, the Richmond Enquirer and the Cincinnati Enquirer. Best-selling magazines aimed at middle-class tastes, Harper's Magazine and the Southern Literary Messenger, added their voices, as did two leading business magazines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4RS1DmfAxK4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Poker: Play Longer with Less Risk","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Wildwoods in Vintage Postcards (NJ) (Postcard History Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Chewing-Gum Rescue and Other Stories","description":"A collection of short stories by the noted New Zealand author, including \\"The Giant's Bath\\", \\"The Pumpkins of Witch Ginger\\", and \\"The Devil and the Corner Grocer\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hpe4wkmalpoC&dq=The+Chewing-Gum+Rescue+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Call to Arms: A Civil War Tale of Trauma, Tragedy, Triumph and True Love","description":"Is Call To Arms destined to be a movie? It was 1860, that year before the war, when Johnny, a thirty-year-old eligible bachelor from Ohio, traveled to South Carolina to help his uncle run a small plantation and fell in love with Molly, a Southern belle from Charleston. Their plans to marry are abruptly interrupted by her jealous former fiance at the outbreak of the Civil War. Their struggle to return to each others arms is filled with action, adventure, terror, charm, compassion, intrigue, suspense, and unceasing desire.

And No Bird Sang and A Whale for the Killing are the first books in a new Douglas & McIntyre library of handsomely redesigned paperback editions of Farley Mowat's work. Turned away from the Royal Canadian Air Force for his apparent youth and frailty, Farley Mowat joined the infantry in 1940. The young second lieutenant soon earned the trust of the soldiers under his command, and was known to bend army rules to secure a stout drink, or find warm -- if non-regulation -- clothing. But when Mowat and his regiment engaged with elite German forces in the mountains of Sicily, the optimism of their early days as soldiers was replaced by despair. With a naturalist's eyes and ears, Mowat takes in the full dark depths of war -- and his moving account of military service, and the friends he left behind, is also a plea for peace. It is one of the most searing and unforgettable World War II memoirs from any Canadian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEaWBQAAQBAJ&dq=And+No+Birds+Sang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wisdom from the Monastery: A Program of Spiritual Healing","description":"For almost two millennia, Christian men and women have banded together to live in devotion to God and humanity.

Michael Connelly, The New York Times Book Review (Editors  Choice) Caleb Carr, the author of The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, returns with a contemporary, edge-of-your-seat thriller featuring the brilliant but unconventional criminal psychologist Dr. Trajan Jones. In the small town of Surrender in upstate New York, Dr. Jones, a psychological profiler, and Dr. Michael Li, a trace evidence expert, teach online courses in profiling and forensic science from Jones s family farm. Once famed advisors to the New York City Police Department, Trajan and Li now work in exile, having made enemies of those in power. Protected only by farmhands and Jones s unusual  pet,  the outcast pair is unexpectedly called in to consult on a disturbing case. In rural Burgoyne County, a pattern of strange deaths has emerged: adolescent boys and girls are found murdered in gruesome fashion. Senior law enforcement officials are quick to blame a serial killer, yet their efforts to apprehend this criminal are peculiarly ineffective. Jones and Li soon discover that the victims are all  throwaway children,  a new state classification of young people who are neither orphans, runaways, nor homeless, but who are abandoned by their families and left to fend for themselves. Two of these throwaways, Lucas Kurtz and his older sister, Ambyr, cross paths with Jones and Li, offering information that could blow the case wide open. As the stakes grow higher, Jones and Li must not only unravel the mystery of how the throwaways died but also defend themselves and the Kurtz siblings against shadowy agents who don t want the truth to get out. Jones believes the real story leads back to the city where both he and Dr. Kreizler did their greatest work. But will Jones and Li be able to trace the case to New York before they fall victim to the murderous forces that stalk them?

Twenty-three essays reflect the breadth of disciplinary competence and the standards of scholarly rigor that Stuever instilled in her students and demonstrates in her scholarship. The book is organized around three divisional areas of inquiry: Renaissance Humanism, Histories of Art, and Rhetorics, Philosophies, and Histories. The first part includes studies on Shakespeare and Ariosto; essays on Machiavelli, Caterina da Siena, and Lorenzo Valla; and Manetti on the library of Nicholas V. The section on histories of art contains contributions on L.B. Alberti, on early modern spectacle and the performance of images, and on rhetoric and art. The third section continues with discussions of rhetoric, history, and literature from a more theoretical viewpoint. The book concludes with a bibliography of Stuever's works. Authors include: Marvin Becker, Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle, Salvatore Camporeale, F. Edward Cranz, Elizabeth Cropper, Marc Fumaroli, Thomas M. Greene, Michael Ann Holly, J. G. A. Pocock, Charles Trinkaus, and Hayden White. Joseph Marino is an independent scholar and is with Current Analysis in Virginia.

Wrecking Crew -- a highly unusual chronicle of recovery and redemption -- documents the transformation of a group of musicians, struggling screenwriters, and wannabe actors into a competitive band of hardballers. For over a decade, it seemed to be enough: the narcotics, gambling, whores, and aimless rebellion. But as they stumbled into their thirties, the blithe pursuit of self-destruction had simply become exhausting to these battle-scarred denizens of the L.A. counterculture. The romantic squalor of being perpetually broken-down, periodically drug-addled, and irresponsible began to lose its charm. The idea of fielding a baseball team to compete in a hard-knocks amateur league seemed merely the latest in a string of half-hearted stabs at restoring order to their ragged lives. But this escapade was different. When these men donned their team uniforms, the old obsessions started to fade and something incredible began to happen. This is the unforgettable story of the Griffith Park Pirates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GBouFeqVB6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolute Friends","description":"Follows the fates of fellow ex-spies Ted Mundy and Sasha, as they attempt to change their lives and the world in which they live, chronicling their exploits from West Berlin, through the politics of Cold War Europe, to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s4Om8mkRY1wC&dq=Absolute+Friends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexuality, Obscenity, And Community: Women, Muslims, and the Hindu Public in Colonial India","description":"Through analysis of an impressive array of 'low' and 'high' Hindu literatures, particularly pamphlets, tracts, newspapers, and archival data, Gupta explores the emerging discourse of gender and sexuality, which was essential to the development of notions of Hindu communitality and nationalism in the colonial period.

While evidence is lacking that this pattern came from Ireland, it has been suggested that the Irish Chain pattern may have been inspired by a similar Irish weaving pattern. Whatever the origin, the Irish Chain is a timeless pattern that continues to delight quilters today. The original Irish Chain in a Day was first published in 1986 in a black and white format. While this book remains a best seller, Eleanor wanted to update her book and add balance to the quilt. Irish Chain in a Day contains two complete quilt patterns, The Single Irish Chain, and the Double Irish Chain. Geared toward the beginner quilter, the Single Irish Chain is easy and fun to make. It guides a novice step by step through every phase of starting and finishing the quilt. The Double Irish Chain is more complex and offers the seasoned quilter a degree of challenge. With 112 full color pages, Irish Chain in a Day provides yardage and cutting charts for six quilt sizes, assistance in color variations with a paste up sheet, and border treatments. In addition to detailed written instructions, illustrations are provided for marking, pinning, quilting and binding the project.
