That is so true. It is entertaining in the beginning when you read of the over-the-top behavior of Miranda, but it does become repetitive. Andrea whines and complains constantly of exhaustion and humiliation, but does little to help herself. Surely, it became clear to her early on that this job would not help her land a job at the New Yorker.Andrea does not exactly come off well either as she abandons friends and family for the sake of the job. Especially, during the trip to Paris when she really needs to return to New York, she rationalizes staying. I guess Miranda rubbed off on her didn't she?Unless you have the time to waste, don't bother. The reviews say it all. Get the book at the library, sit down and thumb through a few pages and get an idea of Miranda's ridiculous requests, get up and put the book back on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have no idea why people are saying this book is whiny because it's not. If you've ever had a boss that asked you to do the most insane things or was just a complete [pain] you can relate to this book. Yes there were some parts that were kind of lame and seemed a bit overstated but overall this book made me laugh! I finally felt validated and I don't even work in the fashion industry, but I do know what it feels like to feel so crazy at work and have no one else outside of work understand what you have to deal with day in and day out..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Please do not confuse the book with the movie.In the movie Andy is smart, beautiful, preoccupied with liberal ideas. She has graduated from decent university (I think Penn state) majoring in journalism, published articles in the university newspaper about the current social issues.Andy in the book can be described in two words - mediocre and lazy.She is a spoiled middle class parents' daughter who used to be the most beautiful and rich at her little Midwestern town's high school. She has graduated from Brown - a prestigious liberal arts university for daughters of wealthy parents (parents sent her there for connections). Even there she was up to study just the English literature (bottom pool for people with no talents).At the university she has mostly partied and gossiped. She was not accepted at any sorority. Her only girlfriend is a loser and drunkard.In short, Andy graduated with mediocre grades without useful connections for carrier advancement. After graduation Andy and girlfriend arrived in NY and partied until her parents got fed up with her spending their money and canceled credit card.She had to start looking for a job. Being lazy, and not used to work, she went for the first available job without doing any research, just for designer clothes incentive.On the first day her coworkers showed her their contempt. Instead of trying to follow their advice on how to improve herself, she took offense and sabotaged as much as she could. They almost had to force her to dress and style her hair properly (at the movie she had to beg Nigel, very cute), funny considering that designer outfits and makeover were free of charge as part of required appearance.She ate fat pea soup and onion bagels while considering herself as being slim (size 6!) and beautiful (yeah, right, while smoking like a chimney, we know what it does to your skin).Miranda saw through her and tried to get rid of her by sending Andy on fool's errands. Amazingly, she still did not fire her when Andy could not get it right. Maybe Miranda had too much fun watching Andy being frantic and hysterical instead of composing herself to solve the problem. It seems that Andy is not very keen on problem solutions. She was made much smarter in the movie, by the way. In the book, she is so proud of figuring out how to get coffee ahead of the crowd, WOW.A good example is the story about the newspaper's restaurant reference when Andy was running for a week and could not find it. It was all because of her laziness and lack of intelligence. From the very beginning she was made to memorize what periodicals Miranda reads every morning. All she had to do each morning is browse through the headlines so she could easily catch Miranda's references without much explanation.I just feel sorry for Miranda: she could not trust anybody, had to explain every little detail to these stupid girls. When left alone they will just stuff themselves and gossip. You cannot drag them to the gym even when it's free and in the same building. They are full of ambitions but no substance.Miranda did not go to the exclusive school, she did not read fancy books, have never been spoiled by rich parents. She educated herself just by being smart and determined. She had to work on her Brooklyn accent and her appearance. She does not hold any respect for these lazy foolish girls who had everything. I am sure she ordered a steak just to make fun of her assistant - she does not eat it because she knows better then anyone that steaks do not make you look beautiful.The author wrote a vicious little book of gossip. The book itself is mediocre but became popular perhaps because it was hinted that Miranda's character was written after Anna Wintour.Incidentally, nothing but names is left from the book for the movie. The author failed to make readers, who look at the facts,not emotions, hate Miranda, so the script was completely rewritten to make assistant very likable.I like the way Emily, brilliantly played by Emily Blunt, had been made into even bigger nasty person then Miranda."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The movie is better! I really struggled through this one. I hate to buy a book that is not only terrible, but painful to read..... The author descriptions of characters, clothing, ..and basically throwing names of designers, and the descriptions of the attire was not chic, it was tacky. Totally not believable. ugh! How upsetting."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed the style of writing and how light and quick this was to read, however, there were many things that bothered me.I didn't honestly think it was that awful to have to do several coffee runs a day, order breakfast a few times a day, set up dinner reservations, research restaurants or whatever, and run errands. Every single thing Andy had to do was at NO COST to her whatsoever. EVERYTHING was comped and thus she was actually making GREAT money to do what she did.I kept hoping that she would grow up throughout it all... Stop being so whiny and ungrateful and start realizing that she really did have a pretty great job, especially considering her lack of experience. Her best friend annoyed me and her boyfriend was awful...In the end, Andy was blamed for her friend's alcoholism (and what, pray tell, could she have honestly done if she hadn't had a life of her own?? She even tried to bring it up a few times and Lily brushed her off) and for her goody-two shoes boyfriend losing interest. Andy says she used to call him every single day, yet he whines that he had been trying to talk to her for a year??Writing crap for Seventeen magazine is a considerable step DOWN since Seventeen is the teenage equivalent of Runway! It was absurd that Andy worked so hard for so long and then her idiot friends convinced her to quit and fly home because THEY were irresponsible. The ending was highly disappointing.Andy didn't change at all, beginning to end. She was still as immature as ever, just like her \\"I don't know what to do, so I'll just travel Europe until I'm broke\\" at the beginning of the book! Is it honestly THAT hard to get an entry-level job?Andy wasn't very likeable and the whole thing seemed exaggerated. I never rooted for her to fly back home, I was angry at her \\"loved ones\\" and even more angry when she told Miranda off. I also don't see how exactly it was a problem doing the work she did to begin with. Say she needed a night off, was there NOBODY she could have had deliver The Book? Not even a messenger service she could pay $100 to deliver it? Could she not have told Miranda that something wasn't possible?? Or that she needed more information? Those who catered to her enabled her to be as controlling as she was, so they could only blame themselves. Not to mention that all of these \\"impossible\\" things like getting a book pre-release and finding a restaurant were entirely possible because of the respect the woman had earned all over.Not bad for a fluff novel, but disappointing on many levels."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I watched the movie before reading the book. I thought the movie was great because of a meryl streep and anne hathaway. I thought the book would be better. It was okay. I expected more from Miranda, Nigel, Emily. I expected to see more of Christian in the book and less of Lily. The book had its funny moments and I am glad I bought it but the movie was much better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book made it to where it is because she was the first to get this idea published. The mere story line is worthy and would instantly sell to millions. Consider the fact that millions of people live in New York City and hundreds of thousands of women from 15 to 55 - just in NYC and not counting the entire US - would be interested in this story.I can see why it was made into a movie in that respect. LUCKY for Lauren Weisberger and her publisher! They found something that could sell. It's something to dream about as a writer.But the writing itself? Not so good. I was SO bored. I read it because I'd purchased it and because I wanted to see why it had so much hype. I really thought it was going to be a good read like Jennifer Weiner and it just WASN'T.There isn't much else to say. I just wish a better writer/editor team had worked on this so I could be happy about my purchase and add it to my forever faves. But as it is now, I can't even really give the book away. Everyone's already read it and didn't like it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book before I knew there was going to be a movie based on it. I completely disliked it. I think the part that pissed me off the most was the end. I expected more from Andy when she quit, not just a simple \\"f*** you\\". Any normal person would have gone through a tirade after enduring what she did or at least say something witty to make your boss feel like a complete idiot. Better yet she should have just stuck with the job and completed the year. She only had less than a month to go. The movie of course was a complete joke. They removed the meager amount of subtleness and humanity from the book (for example Andy's best friend's alcoholism) and demolished it with Hollywood glitter. Watch the movie before you read the book; maybe you might end up appreciating the book more. Or do what I wish I could have done and completely avoid both."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to admit that I was shocked by how poorly written this book was. It is full of cringe-worthy clich&eacute;s and confusing sentence structure. Furthermore, the author often \\"tells\\" when she should be \\"showing.\\" For example, a scenario might end with the following statement: \\"After I asked, she was cruel and insulting.\\" The author, instead, should have relayed the scene so the reader can visualize it. I found the fact that the writing was so bad strange and a little disturbing, as the main character wants to be a writer. The book also appears to glamorize the very beauty culture that it repudiates. I think the book is more of a great advertisement for the fashion industry than a warning. Yet, even worse is the fact that I found myself sometimes empathizing with the \\"devil\\" and thinking what a spoiled brat the main character was. Yes, Miranda Priestly was over-the-top and her actions were outrageous and unacceptable, but some of Andrea's whining was defensive and childish. Her complaints about her job weren't all about Miranda: she often complained about being \\"too good\\" to do the work put before her, which made her complaints about Miranda less credible. On the plus side, it does read fast, and is the perfect \\"beach\\" or vacation read because it's so mindless. It's a little like reading the National Enquirer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read Everyone Worth Knowing first, and passed it onto a cousin. I truly enjoyed this book as well. She wrote so you could understand the main character and empathize with her in dealing with her boss and trying to balance her boyfriend and family. Very entertaining! I want to read more written by her!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I should have known better. I read this book with the hope that it would, at one point, make up for its poor writing, character development, and sweet valley high dialogue. Needless to say I was quite disturbed when that never happened. I am almost curious to read her next book, just to see if it can get any worse."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The title was the best part of this novel. Though very eager to read, i was not impressed with this book. The first 50 pages and last 50 were the only worth while pages of the entire book, and were only second rate compared with the title. If you want to read a book about a terrible boss read the Nanny Diaries, similar plot but a much better book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, it just wasn't that good. I, like some of the other reviewers, read the whole thing but just to see how she finally quit. I wanted to like it but it was so boring. It was missing wit and humor. The Nanny Diaries was similar but so much better. This book was missing the laugh out loud humor like Girls Poker Night. It was an insight into the fashion world but nothing I already didn't know from watching the movie Intern."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Sadly, I have worked for people who in some ways remind me of the awful Miranda Priestly -- totally self-absorbed and who think that because they are important and demand something immediately, it MUST be possible. You have to work in that kind of environment to understand how quickly it can be difficult to leave -- as character Andrea comments, it's like the Stockholm Syndrome, where captives develop an identification with their captors. Or battered wives who have a million reasons why they can't leave, but it has something to do with loss of self-esteem and self-confidence -- these abusers are very good at keeping people from leaving, one way or another.I expected Andrea to be unsympathetic, based on other reviews, but I kind of liked her, despite her obsession with celebrity and designer clothes. I understood how she got sucked into that crazy world -- especially when you're working very long hours, everything else kind of seems unreal in comparison, and you're so tired all you can do is keep going -- changing direction or making life decisions takes more energy than you possess. But you're hoping Andrea will manage to somehow break away from the evil spell of Miranda. Yes, Miranda is a parody, but there are bosses who are about that bad in terms of abusiveness, particularly people at the top of the ladder. I enjoyed reading about that whole world. I think it's all ridiculous and I always enjoying a visit to a strange and different world, even if I wouldn't want to live there -- or even visit in person.THere were some very funny lines in this book, that made me laugh out loud -- like when one character is described as looking like a frightened hamster.My chief complaint is that there was that typical East Coast condescension of any place not East Coast -- Texas, South Carolina -- these people are unsophisticated hicks who don't know how to dress, etc. I also was amused that what Andrea considered just plain folk stuff is beyond the means of a whole lot of people (like dinner at Benihana or clothes from the Gap). Someone who can afford these on a regular basis is probably doing OK, not just scraping by, as so many in this country do. Somehow I think Andrea (and the author) believed that independent of Runway magazine and Miranda -- and that's very sad and ignorant."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Are the kinds of things the protagonist talks and worries about in this novel typical of average young women everywhere? If the average woman is condescending, self-righteous, and vain, not to mention patently racist (Andrea Sach's character refers offhandedly to some young asian women she observes as \\"Jappies,\\" and to her middle-eastern roommates in a way that casts them in a terribly stereotypical fashion) then I suppose I don't want to know any average girls.I read this book during one long plane flight, and it actually made the fourteen hour flight seem longer. I'm no expert on theme or symbolism or allegory or any 'ism or 'gory for that matter, but it seems Weisberger's central theme is that the protagonist, after a lifetime of wealth, privelege, and educational opportunity most young women only dream of, she finally has to work (at a major magazine, no less) and, boo-hoo, her boss is a total hag of a woman, and we're supposed to feel sorry for the hero because the real world is finally sticking it to her.This entire novel smacks of the phonecall you get from some whiny friend late at night who just got dumped or fired or had a bad day and now they want to vent to you, and you politely listen and try to see their point of view, but no matter how good of a friend you are you're still a bit annoyed because you see that your friend is actually the one who's wrong. Nevertheless you keep your private opinion to yourself and try to be supportive.Unfortunately, comiserating with your friend or avoiding giving them useful advice really isn't helping them. I think people ought to tell Laura Weisberger that she's a terrible writer. At least then she'll make better decisions in the future, hopefully one of which will be never to attempt writing another book.Oh and by the way, the ending of the book? If you're looking to roll your eyes, go ahead and read it. Geez.... what a hack."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Having worked as a veteran in the fashion and media industries, I had expected to enjoy this book as a witty skewering of the characters we have all known or had the experience to work with. Instead, I had the misfortune to read a badly written, whining account of some hick who can't take paying her dues like everyone else. It's so sad that some privelaged, undeserving lucky-break candidate can make this amount of press and sales simply for implying that the book might spill good dirt on people. Shame on the idiot media-types who bought into this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is one of the most amusing books I have read in quite some time. The story of a recent Cornell graduate, \\"Andrea Sachs\\"... a.k.a. the author, Lauren Weisberger, who goes to work at \\"Runway\\" magazine for \\"Miranda Priestley\\"... the editor and chief of the magazine... anyone with even half a brain realizes that this is the story of her brief stint at Vogue magazine, as assistant to editor Anna Wintour. Needless to say, her time at the magazine was above and beyond unpleasant, as the boss is horrifically nasty, and generally scary.I've read so many reviews of this book both online, and in print, and I must say that I disagree with most of what has been said of this, Lauren Weisberger's first book. In my opinion, so many book reviewers and editors have lambasted this novel, not because of it's content, but because of the absolute power that Wintour holds in the publishing world. Others weren't gutsy enough to even go near it, with the exception of one review, which stated that Lauren Weisberger has guts. Yes, I agree that getting to work at 7:30 in the morning isn't the worst thing, and I definitely wouldn't call Amnesty International over it, but the amount of psychological torture that this young girl was put under, is to say the least, absurd.For those of you who love the gossip columns, and love to hear the insider dish of the fashion world, I recommend this book whole-heartedly... although to some, it may hit close to home. It's not as if Anna Wintour holds any mystique. She's simply a miserable human being who makes those around her miserable as well.In conclusion I would like to add that all the money, prestige and style in the world cannot buy class. Ms. Wintour, you should be ashamed, and the people that enable this behavior should hang their heads as well."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think it hilarious that people in the fashion world are so outraged by this book. The general theme they cite is &quot;how dare she bite the hand that fed her?&quot; Well, if this is based on Anna Wintour, and if she is even half the monster of the boss in this book, then I have no sympathy whatsoever, and say &quot;well done!&quot; for Lauren for having the guts to write this. Considering this is her first book too, I think she has done a superb job. It won't win any literary awards, but it is well written for the most part, and really draws you in. I read bits and pieces on my lunch break, and then finally caved and bought the book. I wanted to know what happened next...and isn't that the goal of any story? This is just a fun book, a peek inside a world that most of us know nothing about. It is at its best when focusing on the job, rather than the relationships outside of work, but overall, it's a great escape, and I predict will be seen on beaches everywhere this summer. I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I was forced to finish it was because it was being passed around the office, and those who read it before me raved about it, and someone else was waiting to read it. I kept reading on to try to understand why anyone thought this book was so great. I think the 20-something girls who were passing it around and who loved it so much are big fans of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. I can't stomach the writing in that magazine either. The book gave me some insight into the day-to-day life of a self-centered, spoiled brat. You might think that's interesting but it isn't. The biggest puzzle to me from the very beginning was that the heroine wanted desperately to work for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, and yet there was never a reference that I can recall to the fact that she ever actually read the magazine. As a proud subscriber to the &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for decades, I can't even understand why this ditz heroine would be so enamored of the magazine. The excellent writing and whole concept of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; seem to be way beyond the heroine's comprehension, intelligence, and sensibility. It still disturbs me that the girls in my office thought such a trivial and poorly written book was so fabulous, but that may be a sad commentary on this younger generation's infatuation with the superficial."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you hated your boss and your job and wrote a bestselling tell all novel about the nightmare you lived for almost a year, making your job seem almost as bad as Oliver Stone's time in Vietnam, would you do as Lauren Weisberger did, and come out and admit that you, as well as your nightmare boss, were completely self involved and whiny?Lauren did.She whines, and she whines, and she whines for like five hundred pages. I wanted to enjoy this book, but it is badly written, moves at a snail's pace and spends time describing the fashion and name dropping, acts that \\"Andy Sachs\\" is supposededly above.The main character is unlikable, but not because she could have quit the job at any time. She's unlikeable because of her arrogance, and not just about her pretentions about being above fashion. For God's sake, there's a war going on, and she writes about Prada shoes.No sweety, you aren't Tolstoy. You aren't even Sophia Kinsella."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I looked forward to this book as an avid reader of magazines such as Allure, In Style, and Vogue.

Even the guilty book pleasures of summer should be better than this."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I manage to get through 300 pages of absolute boredom-for the book to get momentarily exciting only to have it fall once again at the end; leaving everything pretty much unfinished. Would not recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, probably because I'd never spoken with anyone who had read it. I knew I wanted to read it before I saw the movie that was based on it... (Compare/Contrast)Ugh, what a tedious read this thing was, but I'm getting ahead of myself...I have no doubt that at this point you've heard all kinds of buzz about this book and the movie of the same name and you probably know why this book was supposed to be such a \\"devilish delight\\"... The book's author Lauren Weisberger spent some time as an assistant to Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue magazine. She clearly thought it was a nightmare and decided to chronicle this in a book.Now, of course she couldn't come right out and write a tell-all about her time at Vogue, but as thinly veiled as this puppy is, she might as well have. Anna, I mean Miranda, is a big ol' meanie to those beneath her and since we're informed that she thinks everyone is beneath her, it's not surprising that everyone suffers. Especially Andrea, a recent Brown college graduate who wants more than anything to write for The New Yorker and decides that the fastest way to get there is to spend a year working for the most loved and hated woman in fashion at Vogue, I mean Runway.From the moment this thing starts to the moment this thing ends, and let me be honest with you I thought it never would, we get treated to Andrea whining, complaining, hating, b*tching, moaning and consistently insinuating that she's above this yet beneath it. She'd like to quit but simply cannot, no really she'd love to quit, she reminds you of this fifty times or so but she doesn't. She just keeps complaining. I suppose it could just be that I'm not the type of person who would ever sacrifice her personal happiness for a job she doesn't enjoy or it could be that I wouldn't find it shocking that a woman who works in fashion would eat, sleep and breathe fashion. It could also be that after reading story after story about how evil Anna, I mean Miranda was (she doesn't hang up her coat, she never says thank you, she wants errands run, the horror the horror) I was waiting for it to pick up the pace and get exciting or interesting... It never did and then I just wanted it to end. On the upside, when it did I was thrilled.Now, don't get me wrong it's not that this is a terrible book. In fact, I'm sure the right person would devour it and find it fascinating. But for me and this is just speaking as someone who reads every gossip and fashion magazine/website out there learning that Anna, I mean Miranda is a force to be dealt with wasn't exactly scintillating. I was expecting a whole lot more than this book delivered.(PS: It's not even like I like Anna either, I loath her stance on fur... That still didn't help.)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The premise behind this novel is that poor put-upon Andy Sachs has to suffer through a full year working for the boss from hell, \\"a job a million girls would kill for\\", while putting at risk her dignity, her boyfriend and her closest friends and family. I beg to differ.The Andy Sachs of the book I just read may be the most dishonest narrator since \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\".When we first meet Andy, she is fresh out of college and at loose ends, with nowhere to call home but the bedroom her parents provide under their own rules in suburban Connecticut. She is in fact hungover on the couch of her friend Lily in Harlem (because God forbid her boyfriend who lives in Brooklyn would lend her his bed), barely able to put it together to go for a job interview at the only magazine publisher who bothered to call her in for one.By the end of the book, less than a year later, Andy is a responsible woman, capable of meeting near impossible challenges in her job. She has built up a huge network of fellow sufferers at the hands of her impossible boss, Miranda Priestly, and sufficiently impressed Miranda that she is willing to pull strings to help Andy get a job at The New Yorker. Her co-workers, although they unfairly tease her for her eating choices and quite properly tease her for her taste in clothes (they work in fashion, so they have every bit as much right to consider fashion important as anyone else has about their own job), are almost without exception friendly and supportive, taking hours out of their days to help her prepare a wardrobe for her Paris trip. She has earned considerable self-respect, has never missed a day of work, and is given more and more responsible things to do. She has also learned and accepted graft from the petty (using company funds to buy homeless people Starbucks) to the large (selling an entire wardrobe of designer clothes and accessories for the mid-five figures).Yes, her boss may be the psychobitch from hell, but she is also an accomplished editor and works every bit as hard as Andy, if not harder.On the other side, there is her boyfriend, who seems to schedule voluntary school meetings whenever Andy is free, but can't forgive her for not calling during her workday when he knows that her time is not her own. And there is her friend Lily, who combines a conscious taste for promiscuity with a descent into alcoholism, which not surprisingly puts her own life at risk. And her parents, whose support seems limited to Scrabble sets and salt bagels. All of them, when confronted with the news that Andy has been unexpectedly called to Paris (Paris!) on a business trip, object to her going. None of them is in a position to provide her with one step along the yellow brick road of the writing career Andy craves, but all would have her quit the job rather than inconvenience themselves because she has a business trip to go on.So Andy goes on the business trip, Lily almost dies, Alex breaks up with her because she wouldn't come back from Paris for exactly half a day after he demanded that she do so, and she quits her job anyway. And then she embarks on a writing career based in large part on the fact that (a) she bases her fiction on what happened while working for Miranda, somewhat more disguised than Lauren Weisberger did her own career at Vogue with Anna Wintour; and (b) the editor is sympathetic to how awful her job must have been.The fact is, it is Andy's friends and family who wanted her to live the life they chose for her, without providing her any support to do so, and it was her magazine friends who helped her to cope and taught her how."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this up on a recent vacation as I was looking for something fun, sassy and light that I could quickly sink my teeth into - and this fit the ticket. I finished in 2 days but was left with a feeling of \\"so what.\\" The characters were all pretty much a cliche and a parody of themselves. Perhaps the most annoying part was that Miranda Priestly had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I felt rather beat over the head by the depictions of her evilness ... 50, 100, 200 pages in, I get it already!

That said, this book is a wonderful experience. Yes, it's a little too \\"insider\\" for some; yes, the editor is hard to take as a real character -- a bit too static. Yes, the protagonist is perhaps too good to be true.Yet somehow the reader finds herself totally captivated by this story. She did WHAT? And then she said WHAT?

We are dying to see what happens, dying to see MP get her come-uppance.For those who want a quick summer read, a book full of dishing dirt, this is a terrific choice. No, it's not great literature. But does it claim to be? It's like having a big ol' ice cream sundae -- totally decadent, and you know you won't have much to show for it afterwards. But all the same, it's completely enjoyable. So why not?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked this book. Judging it as if it were Shakespear isn't fair. It is a great read for your morning commute or hanging out at the beach. Not mindless, yet not obnoxiously dumb. It takes you (probably not a fashionista) into the most absurd world of trendiness and misdirected importance through the eyes of someone who also thinks the whole idea is rediculous.The book is very plot based...so if you, as a reader, care more about a character's motive than action...this probably isn't the book for you.In all i liked it and it made a few days on the morning train a bit more enjoyable:)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Chicklit Comedy and black humour spill out in oodles with this razor sharp wit tale of working with those at the top.

My friend told me it wasn't great, but it was an easy summer read. And if that's all that you expect from it, then you won't be disappointed.The author is kind of whiny, I didn't really feel much sympathy for her and her \\"terrible\\" job. I think that the intended effect is a \\"you go girl!\\" by the end of the book, but I didn't feel that way at all. The author was actually quite annoying, which obviously hurts the book.Frankly, the movie looks ten times better, if only because Meryl Streep is involved. Like I said, if you don't expect anything from the book, you won't be disappointed.

Like most people with such a level of support, she decides that what she really wants to be is a doormat to an abusive, psychotic boss so she takes a job in the fashion industry to do just that. Predictably, she isn't happy. The rest of the book is a blow by blow account of all the indignities she must suffer. Are they really that outrageous? Well, no. Most of us have gotten our boss coffee or lunch at some point in our careers or had to work overtime. Most of us learn, too, that we are easily replaceable and unappreciated and that we should stop whining and do our jobs already because we are there to earn a salary not have our egos massaged. If our boss is truly abusive, then yes, maybe we should leave. The protagonist, who has no family to support, contacts in the field she wants to break into, and no debt, does not earn our sympathy because she seems free to quit at any time.The great part comes at the end where she writes a piece in just an hour and voila, has it published off the bat. Talk about the Wizard of Oz. \\"Yes, Andrea, you had the power to be a magazine writer all along.

Maybe you just thought you were working for the devil..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The problem with this book, although it is entertaining, is that it could just about be cut in half. We didn't need quite that many chapters to agree with how horrible the boss is to everyone. Any other aspect of the main character's life was so outnumbered by the Miranda stories that it didn't have much depth. Which, left the ending to seem succinct and missing something. I'm glad I read \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" first because it was pretty much the same scene but more entertaining. I doubt I'll read Weisberger again- I'm just not into the pretentious, high society fluff. I'd much rather read wittier, more down-to-earth entertainment from the likes of Whitney Gaskell or Janet Evanovich."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I give this book a lot of points because it is a great depiction of the world that i live in. This IS the way the world of design works, and as someone doing my first couple of hell years in the industry I can say that those of you who found it unbelievable are clearly not on the inside of our world.OK. Having said that. The main character is so snotty. I mean I know the fashion world can suck, but she holds herself in such high regards with no respect or thought towards the creative aspect of fashion. Additionally she is incredibly one dimensional in her attempts to be a good person in a big bad world. blech.And the ending was horrendous."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you stand in line at the supermarket and read magazines you would never allow in your house you might enjoy this book. No question, this is not great literature or even great writing. It is more like a celebrity gossip piece expanded to novella length. The fun part is seeing the inside of the fashion world and being able to feel morally superior because it really is as shallow, fickle and ridiculous as you thought.The book made me sorry I did not write about some of the crummy entry level jobs I had when I was starting out in the working world. (Silly me, I thought one had to be a good writer to write a book!) But, not execting more than fluff, I enjoyed it.One serving from this \\"20 something complaining about the unfairness of her job\\" genre is enough for me. A fun, fluffy, and ultimately forgettable read for the beach or a plane, it does not even come close to Bridget Jones' Diary but is far better than The Nanny Diaries."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Let me preface by saying that I wolf books down like chocolate cake after Lent, and after I finished inhaling this one I felt just as physically nauseated. Here's my chance to purge: What a colossal waste of time (and $7)! Those 10 hours would have been more productively spent staring with glazed eyes at infomercials. As many other reviewers have stated, this book is ridiculously redundant, self-absorbed, closed-minded, and downright pathetic (a term which also characterizes the \\"writing style\\" and \\"heroine\\").It's true that writers should only write about what they know (good enough for Austen, good enough for me), but it's also true that if all they know is a skewed world of humorless and ignorant bitchiness, self-centeredness, and melodrama, they should never be published and thus allowed to inflict themselves on innocent bystanders who were lured in by a catchy title and a regrettable urge for escapism. Breathe. Sure, the author can name-drop like nobody's business, but you can't leave this novel without realizing that she has nothing else to offer. Who can sympathize with Andrea/author (hey, it is quasi-autobiographical, right?) when she all too easily learns to scorn everything that is not uber-fashionable, expensive, and located in New York? She's way too quick to pick up the characteristics of her environs and I was honestly rooting for her to stay in Paris at the end just so we could see her transformation completed. This narrow vision leads to some laughable errors (who ever heard of an apparently brilliant grad student paying their own way through a PhD at Columbia?) and general cluelessness. But I'm getting bogged down in the details. The crux is this: the author isn't fooling anyone by trying to pretend (through Andrea) that she's above all the superficial nonsense around her; she/they clearly revel in it and manage to pull in not a few readers as well, a truly lamentable fact considering the lack of authenticity in, well, everything these days. It's that, and not the lack of plot and poor writing, that truly made me run for the Pepto."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This novel is all hype, no quality. The story revolved around our narrator, Andrea Sachs a young woman fresh out of college who through uncanny (and implausible) luck winds up a dream job as an assistant to the editor of a prestigous fashion magazine. And, in the tradition of The Nanny Diaries (another undeserving overhyped and utterly meanspirited novel), Andrea proceeds to reveal the seamy underside of this \\"fabulous\\" editor. She's demanding, she's ridiculous, she's mean. Surprise, surprise. There are plenty of these bosses throughout the offices of Manhattan, be they in fashion, publishing, law, you name it those bosses are there. Weisberger of course exaggerates to get her point across, but it's not really funny, just pathetic. There is also no plot to this novel. Young woman gets job, hates boss, wants to quit. Sorry, but that just doesn't add much. The only positive thing I can say about this novel is the Weisberger does have talent as a writer, she just needs to get a little more creative in her stories."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Even considering I'm not in the fashion world, the descriptions and writing sucked me in immediately. Very interesting watching the evolution a person in the industry."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I've already destroyed two paper copies of this book with bathtime reading as the razor sharp satire of the fashion industry is right up my street. I don't know Prada from primark, but we all know a Miranda Priestly. I howled with laughter as I rooted for Andy and the book reached it's sublime conclusion. Fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this because I heard that it was not the same as the movie. And it is not. The movie was wonderful. I enjoyed the book for very different reasons. It was a little hard at first to change the visualized characters from those of the movie into those of the book. Some of them are very different, and the sub plots are also different. I love Meryl Streep.. but Miranda is a much better bitch in the book. So if you want to hear more about the bitch and you aren't too attached to the characters in the movie then enjoy this book. I know I enjoyed them both for very different reasons."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I normally read the books before I watch the movies (then feel totally critical of what was left out or added extra) but this is one story in which I acted backwards and I was not dissapointed. The story is totally different from what was seen at movie but equally as entertaining and fashionable. Its a \\"feel-good\\" story in the end to make you appreciate how friends and family are always there for you, even when you turn into a different person, due to proffesional and personal reasons, but inside you are still the same old you with bad hair and cheap clothes... it left me wanting more...."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book, so of course I compared the two throughout my whole time listening to The Devil Wears Prada.The book is quite different from the movie, which I loved. I know that book-lovers hate it when their favorite book gets a make-over when turned to film, but my experience was backwards. Reading a book after watching a faithful movie representation bothers me a little. I feel like it's a waste of time, because I already know the characters and what happens. In this novel, the premise and most of the plot are the same, but the characters are distinctly different. The story isn't as light-hearted as the movie, which I found to be the most striking difference. Miranda isn't humanized at all, Emily is less mean (and therefore less funny), but she's definitely a more interesting, complex character than what the movie shows, and there's a lot more going on with Andrea's friends and family in the novel.Obviously, there are events the movie cut out due to time constraint and flow. These were fun to hear about and gave a much clearer picture on what Andrea was dealing with not only in regards to her job, but with her family and friends as well.I'm really glad I listened to this on audiobook. The narrator, Bernadette Dunne, makes the characters come alive. I got a good feel for their personalities and I could picture them a lot better than I would have been able to if I had just simply read this novel.Overall, The Devil Wears Prada is entertaining and funny. I also like that it has a good message, but I wasn't beaten over the head with it. I would definitely recommend this, even to those who have seen the movie. Just be prepared for it to be different."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I must say I enjoyed this book but not more than the movie. I think we needed a talented actress like Meryl Streep to portray Miranda Priestly, editor of the most respected fashion mag this side of planet earth as more than the one dimensional character we meet in Lauren Weisberger's book. This book is surely a fun read. It's a romp of impossible tasks, sarcasm and under the breath smoldering from a young woman fresh out of college with the boss 3 degrees below hell. \\"You don't know how lucky you are and how many millions of people would kill for this job\\" becomes her oft repeated mantra.The only issue I really had was Andrea Sachs as an Ivy League graduate really had so many positives going for her even before she accepted the position as Ms. Priestly's assistant. She had well to do parents, a loving boyfriend, intelligence, youth and good looks. Her struggle to remain cool and composed each time Miranda presented an impossible task was to me, not a struggle. A stuggle is when a person doesn't have Andrea's plusses who is forced to work for a \\"Miranda Priestly\\" because they have no other options. All in all, good book, never boring, witty and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Honestly, this is one of the rare occasions where I liked the movie better. There were some plot twists that weren't in the movie that I actually liked, but otherwise I found this to be kind of monotonous and predictable. Now I just want to watch the movie!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As a heterosexual American male whose idea of high fashion is J.Crew, I'm an unlikely reader of a piece of chick-lit like \\"the Devil Wears Prada.\\" I owe the fact that I wound up reading it to the fact that I saw and enjoyed the movie...largely due to a great performance by Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly and a good one by Ann Hathaway as Andrea Sachs.I think I liked the book because it offered a behind the scenes peek at a world that most people only ever see through the carefully filtered lens of television or a magazine like Vogue. I also found myself enthralled by the outrageous demands Miranda Priestly would make of Andy and the other unfortunate employees at the fictional magazine. One thing that helped in a big way is that while the protagonist \\"Ahn-dree-ah Sacks\\" has a boyfriend and is pursued by an oh-so-eligible/handsome/charming writer she worshiped while in college, the book does not have a huge amount of hearts and flowers and angst in it.&lt;spoilers...although if you read anything about the book, the spoilers are pretty screamingly obvious>About the only weakness of the book is the way Andrea Sacks winds up leaving Miranda Priestly's employ. After putting up for 11 months of unbelievable demands and getting to the brink of a job at the New Yorker, I found it hard to believe that she'd chuck it all away because one particular demand gets to her. And I found it hard to believe that her family and friends would tell her to come back from Paris to be by her best friend's bedside (who injured herself in a DUI but not fatally) despite knowing that would mean throwing all of her career aspirations and hard work away. It would be one thing to do that for a family member especially if they were going to die or could die, it would be another thing to do it for someone whose irresponsible behavior got them in trouble.Frankly, I think the book would have been better if Andrea had stuck it out for her year as Miranda's employee and then moved on (or maybe decided to stay on in a bigger job at Runway). I don't think her doing that would have been selling out and it might have been more real.Finally, I'm not kidding about welcoming a sequel (I notice that \\"the Nanny Diaries\\" author has written one). Obviously, Andy wouldn't be coming back to work for Miranda as her assistant but it might be interesting to have her working in a journalistic role at Runway or at the very least get to interact with Miranda again while doing a major story on her for wherever she presently works. I hope the author considers it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's always a problem when it takes 150 pages into a book before it gets entertaining. The writing got a bit better, too. The book seemed like a rough draft with subplots like Andreas best friend Lily, boyfriend Alex, and writer Christian thrown in for good measure. The book could have easily been 200 pages. There is an obscene amount of redundency, and it is beyond wordy. I don't understand what editors get paid to do anymore. Publishers have a responsibility to correct grammar and punctuation. Ms. Weisberger should get a new editor for future ventures. I did relate to working for an insane boss. Miranda Priestley was believable and the best drawn character. I am sure Ms.Weisberger has some talent and could be a great writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I perused this book when it first came out but didn't find it very interesting. Then when I saw Meryl Streep in the movie preview, I thought I'd give the book a try. Well, my initial instincts were correct. I struggled through the first 50 pages, all the while hoping the movie would be better. It's just not very well written."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this book up at the airport two days ago and read it obsessively until it was finished. It was like eating MacDonalds or watching a marathon session of The Real World. You know it's bad, you know it's not enriching, but you can't help yourself. Because it's so bad, it's kind of fantastic.This is a thinly veiled account of the author's 1 year tenure working as Anna Wintour's assistant at Vogue. The book lacks the narrative structure of fiction because it ISN'T fiction. It's a memoir with made up names. As in life, characters come and go unnannounced and are introduced to us for no apparent reason. Chance events happen that don't really add much to the major themes that this book explores - working for a maniac, being young and ambitious in Manhattan, and growing up.The author's writing has been vilified, and that seems pretty fair. Half that attack should be leveraged on her editor, however. This is a book about the fashion industry, and noone checked the correct spelling of the makeup artist Bobbi Brown's name? On the plus side, I think the author did a great job capturing what it feels like to be out of college, in your first apartment in a big city. It created nostalgic feelings for this reader.The main problem is the narrator is herself quite unlikeable. Yes, Anna (Miranda) is evil and psychotic. Surprise. The narrator isn't much better. One can't help agree with her coworker Emily that she is sarcastic and condescending. And a major bigot. The book is full of appallingly snide references to JAPS (!), meek Indian roomates who are indistinguishable from each other and smell like curry(I'm not kidding), and homeless people who are \\"filthy and smelly\\" (and whom the author, fancying herself a real humanitarian, supplies free coffees to, which she pays for by stealing from her company). She also doles out judgment to homosexuals (admonishing one bad gay for having sex since we live in tha \\"Age of Aids\\"), people with tattoos and piercings, and immigrants. What this girl is doing in New York City at all, I have NO idea."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I couldn't wait to pick it up and then couldn't wait to put it down. There were so many opportunities for humor and clever insight and they were almost all missed. The writing is flat and the characters never really come off the page. I used to think the Nanny Diaries was just okay but if this is this year's version of that book then I'm starting to think Nanny Diaries was fantastic. And finally, the dish just isn't that great."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK, we get it. Andrea Sachs has the worst boss ever. That's about all you need to know about Lauren Weisberger's novel \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"True, the title is great, and so the subject matter could have been. Instead, though, the book is a seemingly endless litany of all of the insane things fashion editor Miranda Priestly does or demands her peon assistant to do or get for her, and the gag grows old. Undoubtedly, Priestly is pathetic, unable (or just unwilling) to do even the simplest task for herself, while demanding others do the impossible. (It's a thinly veiled secret that Priestly is based on Anna Wintour, the famously icy editor of Vogue, and the fictional Elias-Clark Company is of course Conde Nast.) Weisberger has some fun mocking the Manolo-clad fashion assistants she calls \\"Clackers,\\" as well as the fabulous, excessive Conde Nast cafeteria. And Miranda's craziness is a scream, but that's where the fun ends.The problem lies with the protagonist herself. She doesn't have to be likeable, but she could at least be interesting. Instead, Andrea Sachs is a whiny, spoiled brat who thinks the world should just fall at her feet. She makes no attempt to hide the fact that she thinks working at a fashion magazine is completely insignificant and beneath her. We may be able to identify with having a hellish job, but the thing is, that doesn't make us sympathize with her. Everyone, unless they come from extreme privilege or just have damn good luck, has had a horrendous first job or a terrible boss, so we don't exactly feel sorry for her when she must deal with Miranda's antics. In fact, Andrea has such a sense of entitlement, such a ridiculous superiority complex, that we almost smile when she must search block after block for an antique store Miranda remembers seeing once. It's as if no one ever had a bad job or a crazy boss until Andrea did, and of course, hers is the worst of the worst. The ironic thing is that just as her boss is completely wrapped up in herself, so too is Andrea. She may not get to order assistants around, but her inability to see beyond her own nose makes her just as insufferable.And her personal life? Wish I could tell you, but I skipped those chapters. They weren't particularly interesting or enlightening. (Yes, we know the housing market in New York is ridiculous. And gee, it's awful, isn't it, when an attractive, wealthy, amazing writer for the New Yorker pursues you?) Besides this, her constant moaning that no one understands just how horrendous her job is and that no one has a job worse than hers wears thin almost immediately. Sachs doesn't even appear to learn anything from her whole ordeal and doesn't seem to be aware of her spoiled behavior, which is perhaps the most obnoxious and annoying thing about the character.Andrea wants to work at the New Yorker, the sterling example of good writing. But if Weisberger's writing is any indication, the New Yorker won't come calling anytime soon. Boring and repetitive by the halfway mark, the novel reads like a first or second draft, not a polished, finished product. The dialogue is stilted and wooden, and the prose is so ungrammatical, I found myself having to reread or just skip passages altogether. Granted, it's not intended to be Tolstoy, but there is an art to comedic writing, as evidenced by Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones books and even, \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" whose \\"expose your boss\\" style the book emulates.Unfortunately, Weisberger falls short of both, leaving us to wonder what the novel would have been in the hands of a better or more perceptive writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is delightfully fun due to the transparent insider info the author provides about what it's really like to work for Vogue magazine. I worked for a woman who was a lot like the Anna Wintour -- oops, Miranda Priestly character in the book, so I could relate to a lot of the stories (our receptionist used to call ahead to warn us of my boss' imminent arrival, just like the Vogue/Runway receptionist in the book). However, despite Lauren Weissberger's efforts to cast herself/the protagonist as the victim and \\"Miranda Priestly\\" as the devil, the book doesn't work out that way. It would be one thing if Andrea (the protagonist) was throwing herself into her job full-bore and then putting up with relentless abuse, but Andrea makes it clear from the beginning that she is only in the gig for one year and she couldn't care less about fashion, her coworkers, or her boss. At one point Miranda points out to Andrea that her attitude is poor and she's noticed all of the pulled faces and huffy sighs Andrea's been doling out for the past eight months when she's asked to do something. Miranda has a point there -- I think if you're going to do a job, do it well, not grudgingly, and if you do do it grudgingly, then don't complain about how you're not given any respect. Andrea's boyfriend in the book is a petulant, egotistical brat who pouts when she can't call him in the exact half-hour time frame he designates. Hasn't this guy ever heard of a busy day? Sometimes it's hard to grab five spare minutes on a bad day to go to the bathroom, much less call your whiny boyfriend. All in all, a very entertaining book but not anything that's going to win the Pulitzer. If Weisberger's ambition -- like Andrea's -- is to write for the New Yorker, she's got some professional development to undergo before that becomes at all possible. This is a great book for a plane trip or a beach vacation, but it definitely won't enlighten you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book started out as snarky fun. I enjoyed imagining I was reading an insider's scoop. The boss, Miranda Priestly, was over-the-top hell-on-heels. After a while, though, she was one-dimensional, as was the narrator and main character, Andrea Sachs. I think the author did herself a disservice by writing in first-person - it might have given her a little distance to write in third person and at least pretend these characters were made up. As it was, it seemed like reading a journal where someone had done a search-and-replace, changing real names into fictional ones. In the end, I actually felt some sympathy for Miranda when she said she had noted Andrea's frequent eye-rolling and sighs.I also found it kind of silly that while Andrea claimed to want to be a writer for the New Yorker, she didn't write very well. And while she seemed to regard herself as an intellectual, here she was, living in New York City, and the only time she went to the Met is when she was forced to attend a function held there."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought it would be fun to read this book before the movie comes out this summer. While I admit that I read it in just three days, it was not all that exciting or entertaining. To be fair, I must state that I read mainly mysteries and thrillers and perhaps I was expecting a little adventure and suspense when clearly, this book is a \\"Coming of Age\\" type.Andrea, the main character, has very little personality and spends too much time puffing on cigarettes and swearing for my taste. When the story finally wrapped up, I was left feeling unfulfilled at the lack of revenge heaped on the 'villain'. I hope the movie will be better.If you are into fashion and accessories, have been a personal assistant to someone, or worked for a self-absorbed, evil woman, you will probably enjoy this book.REVIEW UPDATE: The movie is merely \\"based\\" on the book and takes a different direction.

Also, are copy editors extinct?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is the latest in a genre that spawned such books as 'The Nanny Diaries,' which reads like Shakespeare compared with this book. The Devil Wears Prada could be fun and gossipy, but the protagonist is so unlikeable that it's just impossible to care about or be interested in her character. She wants to be a serious writer, yet she takes a job at a fashion magazine, hates it, whines about it, yet somehow buys into it at the same time--without a hint of irony. She claims to hate the cattiness and the backstabbing, yet behaves just as badly, if not worse (complete with references to 'that wretched Harry Potter series' and a weird jab at her foreign roommates, who look 'exactly alike'). She also claims to feel 'fat' because she's 5'10 and a hefty 115 pounds. Oh please. But lest we think she's entirely shallow, she does find time to sneak away from her desk to distribute Starbucks coffee to the homeless (while chatting to her friends on her cell phone and smoking, of course). I mean, what a multi-dimensional character! Yawn...The evil Miranda (based on Anna Wintour, supposedly), had the potential to be an interesting villian, but instead of fully developing the character and unearthing what motivates her to behave so horribly, all we get are canned sound bytes in which she yowls demands for special china and boxes of Hermes scarves. The 'civilian' characters in the book, such as the boyfriend and the best friend, come across like last-minute ditch efforts to humanize the main character. Their plotlines are so thin that it's worth skipping their chapters entirely.The great irony is that the harrowed heroine desperately wants to work at The New Yorker; hopefully the fictional protagonist's writing abilities are superior to Weisberger's cliched prose. Just like the world of fashion, the best part of this book is on the surface--the title is great-- but unfortunately there's nothing much on the inside."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a great escape and a thoroughly entertaining read with one of a kind characters and dishy insight into the fashion industry.

By the way, the \\"reader\\" who wrote the one star \\"hackneyed, boring and ungrammatical\\" review obviously didn't bother to actually read the book because the heroine's name is Andrea, not Alex.

Why did she feel obliged to wipe greasy hands all over her boss's expensive clothes?

Picking up this book was the worst decision of my life. It was so aimless that I could not even finish it. It is nothing but an outlet for the Yankee author to express her hatred of Southerners. The choppy prose is so hard to follow, I got a headache from attempting to read it. It skips around from present to past and follows no logical order. I have nothing good to say about it and will not be waiting in anticipation for her next novel. This author needs to find another occupation."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I normally read thrillers but this was on the bestsellers list so I took a chance. I liked it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My favorite quote was when Andrea is talking about her friends and their jobs 'They whined about the long days, coworkers, office politics, but more than anything else they complained bitterly about the boredom...the tasks required of them..were fit for a chimp.' This decribes many jobs not just those right out of college. I found the main character innocent, likable and funny. The swearing was appropriate given the ridiculousness of what she endured. I worked for a woman who was similiar and it was amazing what she got away with and what I put up with because I needed the job. The movie version is delicious with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not a book that you can relate to if you don't live in New York and aren't in the fashion industry. It is fiction. The book is well written and the story keeps flowing.Definitely a page turner. A good fantasy book about glitz, glamour, greed and egos."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Catchy title--but if you're looking for something more, keep looking. Andrea is the main character--a twentysomething single who is fresh out of college. Her passion is writing and her goal in life is to work for the New Yorker. But the New Yorker is not calling and Andrea needs a job. So she goes to work for Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine, and apparently the high priestess of the fashion industry. After being assured by everyone at the magazine during her interview that &quot;this is a job a million girls would die for,&quot; and that most of Miranda's assistants can work anywhere after being in her employ for a year, Andy accepts the position.What follows is 300+ pages of what is simply a litany of unreasonable and unbelievable requests by a boss that is most certainly some sort of devil incarnate. Andy's personal life, as a result of her demanding employer takes a beating--Alex, her longtime boyfriend, begins to feel neglected and Lily, her best friend, sinks to an all-time personal low.I might have liked this book--if there was something else to it, but it is truly all about Andy's unbelievably horrible boss. In terms of character development...well, I might have liked Alex, if I felt like I new something about him, or about he and Andy's relationship. Best friend Lily is nothing more than a promiscuous lush.....and you're left wondering about a character (Andy) who could call this girl her best friend.The most appalling thing about the book was its tales of excess and waste. Very sad in a world where many people do without. All in all, I was left shocked that this book was the runaway bestseller that it is/was.....!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ok, folks, lighten up! Lauren Weisberger never claimed to be Tolstoy. This book delivers on just what it is: a light, fun, dishy story about the mostly unknown inner workings of the fashion world.

Look forward to more."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was really dissapointed in this book. I really enjoyed the film and thouhgt it was funny and somewhat real to our society. Then I read the book and who it was diffrent from the movie and not as good. Maybe I did not like the book as much becouse I seen the movie before I finished the book. The book was boring and I found it really abnoying. I did not like the main charactor she was selfish and anoying where in the movie she was inocent and loving. Someparts where good but not enough to make it a good movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As we all could guess, the esteem a book holds to a given individual has at least something to do with how the circumstances of a story relate to the circumstances of your life.So let me say: I am a Gen-Xer, a man, and having spent some 23 years in schooling of one kind or another, look for the deeper meaning of the stuff I read. Thus my title for the review... ah yes now it makes sense.I suppose if you've never been to NYC (as many 8th graders have not) the descriptions of downtown are cool. And I suppose the way materialistic megalomaniacs treat their subbordinates may intrigue a junior high-schooler, yet unaccustomed to the ways of the world. I suppose Vogue holds some appeal for women of all ages, thank God; yes we all admire beautifull women. They are fun to look at, but, often, not to analyse, which this book seemingly attempts to do. Trouble with such subject matter: not much there to delve into.I knew there was trouble, when, during the first few pages, the main character started listing the prices of the various garments she was wearing. Ridiculous amounts of money of course per item. Who would care how much a Gucci handbag costs? Those of us who don't know don't care. And those of us who do know don't need reminding. Thus, the author is writing for the sake of seeing words on the page: there is no deeper meaning to what whe describes. Expensive clothes, mean bosses, snobby women. These are depicted without analysis, but worse yet, with no tidbits for the reader to form any sort of analysis for himself.I know what you are thinking: this guy is not smart enough to figure out the deeper meaing of the story, and so he gripes...Well, be my guest and use a few hours of your time reading that book, so you too agree with this essay.Now, let's go through the books we've read and think about one with perhaps more substance... and style. A story about young people, young men and young women, who face the moral ambiguities of the day, juggling their 'careers' so to speak, dealing with love and relationships, and where the ending is not as happy as or as concise as one might like. I tell you what comes to mind: Corelli's Mandolin, which interestingly takes up less room on the bookshelf. Now that my young Chick-lits, is something worth reading!But, as usual, not if you've seen the movie already, which will, if you have seen it, spoil for you one of the finest books around, and will leaving you cursing Hollywood, and henceforth watching IFC."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I NEVER KNEW THAT ONE DAY I WILL FIND A BOOK THAT SPELLS MY WORKING LIFE EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS.

If that's true, then the book is nothing more than a nasty, mean-spirited, tattle tale. I cannot believe anyone would bother to publish it much less make a movie of it.If this novel is supposed to be amusing, it FAILS miserably. If this novel is supposed to impart a moral, forget it.The book has a frustrating (not amusing) beginning. I continued to read only because I believed the book would get better. It didn't! Little did I know the main character does nothing more than go on and on and on and on and on nauseatingly complaining, bitching, griping, whining, crying and bemoaning her job and her boss and her co-workers. It NEVER STOPPED!The main character is too stupid to live. She (Andrea) can't drive a stick shift but frustratingly (not amusingly) continues to drive in NYC rush hour traffic -- despite the fact there is a professional driver following her around town in a limo. They could have switched cars for goodness sake! I'm sure he knows how to drive a standard transmission.Another example -- she spends 2 days calling around looking for a published article (restaurant review) when all she has to do is skim the 5 or 6 newspapers her boss reads every day --one of which has to contain the review! Andrea is not portrayed as a timid person, but then the author wants us to believe she lacks the guts to even ask her boss for clarification of the details of an assignment.And then there is the \\"love angle\\" with a handsome, rich, smart, writer. The romantic interest begins well but the author fails to develop it except to have the guy reappear at particularly opportune but unlikely moments.There's not much of a plot and the characters are forgettable.I kept waiting for the funny part to begin -- but the joke was on me -- there is none!I would not recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Sometimes I find chick lit to lack substance, but this had a good plot and great character development"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I hadn't read an actual book for years.

The plot of this book turns out to be a diary of Andrea Sach's daily rituals...the problem is, they are pretty much the same, every day: fetching coffee, answering the phone, delivering the book. The only variances were that some days it was rainy, and some days it was snowing. Same ol' same ol' page after page, for almost 400 pages!Anyone who moved to New York right out of college will appreciate the humor in the absurdity of a boss' requests or expectations. Anyone in the real world will relate to having to launch their careers at the bottom of the ladder and having to pull 14 hour days.Nothing that will blow your hair back."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With all the hype, I was expecting something different - as in a well written, interesting book. Instead, it was so boring I had to stop before I even read 75 pages. How many times can you read, &quot;I want to work for the New Yorker&quot; and page after page of &quot;horrible&quot; things her boss does. Where's the story? Where's the character depth and something beyond the obvious? I love chic lit, so it's not like I wanted War and Peace, but the people in the book aren't characters, they're charicatures, kinda like a bad sit com. It's her first book, so I don't really hold it against the author, but the publisher and editor should have known better. This was just such a weak effort, you've gotta wonder what the heck they were thinking."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was just a plain disappointment. The first few chapters were very funny, but then it was the same thing over, and over, and OVER again. I can't even understand how Andrea got hired as Miranda's junior assistant in the first place. By the description of what she wore on her interview, she should have been screened out as soon as she walked through the door. And what was the deal with the creepy guy in the lobby who made her sing to get into the building? Scary! And, OK, we get that your boss is a witch. Move on and tell us something we don't know. This book had a lot of repetition, no plot, and a truly horrible ending!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is essentially the same as \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" but not as well written. Without giving away the plot, I can say I found it implausible that she woulda.) stay in a job where she is abused daily.b.) think spending one year as the assistant to the assistant to the editor of a fashion magazine would get her to her goal of writing for the New Yorker.At least in \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" Nanny has a good reason for staying with her obnoxious boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I did enjoy this book, simply because I happened to be jetlagged when I read it and my brain could not concentrate on anything. The story could be improved, as could the writing, but apart from that it is entertaining for those moments when you feel completely brainless."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm flabbergasted that this book is on the bestseller list. It is poorly written and edited. I had no empathy with the protagonist, and it was depressing to read about someone who cuts herself off from her family and friends because she thinks it will lead to a job at The New Yorker! Please! Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While an entertaining idea, this book needed some serious editing. Too many dull passages, too much repetition. Not very believable in many respects."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book-jacket description makes the book sound 10 times better than what it turns out to be. I was hoping for a somewhat interesting account of Andrea's stint as Miranda's lackey. Funny wasn't anywhere in the picture either. I couldnt even find Miranda's constant bitchiness & outright game playing amusing. Maybe it was just the bland style of delivery from the author. It seemed like wordy whining. You could almost predict what fit Miranda would throw after Andrea would spend all her morning on an errand, phone call, food-run, etc for her boss. If she made a date with friends or her boyfriend, you knew her boss would ruin it like she did in the previous 10 chapters. What I found most interesting is that no one could speak up for themselves. I was amazed at these spineless assistants. I can imagine it happens in the real world, but it makes for a boring book to constantly read about the main character getting shredded at every turn. The book would have been alot more interesting if more of these women callenged their boss and had a voice. Andrea's co-worker Emily is pretty pathetic. The redundancy got boring real fast."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book, I would consider pretty entertaining but the plot was easily predictable and also the conclusion. It's a good quick summer read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Were it not for author Lauren Weisberger's well-touted credentials, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA probably would not be the hit that it has become. Weisberger makes no secret of the fact that she was the assistant of VOGUE editor Anna Wintour.Thus, reading this novel about the assistant to the editor of the world's most influential fashion magazine becomes a guessing game in where the line between fact and fiction has been drawn. Weisberger says in interviews that Anna was a delight while Miranda, her fictional counterpart, is the Devil in Prada.Thus, for those of us who have not worked in fashion, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is an intriguing peek into a private world. Insofar as DEVIL is accurate, it is informative and entertaining as well.Yet there's another quibble: Weisberger's heroine spends much of her time bemoaning the fact that the demands of her position leave her no time for the writing of serious prose. It was jarring, therefore, to notice the many glitches in grammar that this novel contains. Shouldn't a former VOGUE editor and her own book editor have been able to join together in putting out a book that was written more correctly?In a word, this book is cute, no more and no less."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger's &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; is probably one of the most alluring book titles in years. If only the actual content of the book were half so interesting. Alas, it's mostly whiny, poorly written and makes rather feeble grabs for sympathy and understanding, but doesn't actually get either.Andrea Sachs wants to be a writer for the New Yorker. But for any chance at that, she has to work as a personal assistant for Miranda Priestly, chief editor of the prestigious fashion magazine Runway. She doesn't like fashion (despite an overriding concern with top-notch brand names) but is willing to do it to move up the ladder of success.Soon she discovers that Miranda is, in fact, a boss from hell. Lunch demands, business trips, and phone calls are all given a manic twist as Miranda makes demands that no human being should have to put up with. Is it going to get worse? And just how far into Hades can Miranda take Andrea before enough is enough?Only fashionistas and wannabe-fashionistas will find this book a compelling read. It's not even a good beach read -- even beach reads are supposed to have some semblance of a plot, or likable characters. This thinly-veiled roman &agrave; clef seems only to be a chance for the author to portray her ex-boss Anna Wintour as evil incarnate (get it? &quot;Devil Wears Prada&quot; -- how deviously subtle!). Worst of all, we're supposed to pity a woman who is working at a Vogue-like mag as a first job, getting prestigious resume material, and is making a mint to boot. Cry me a river, you lucky dog.The writing is quite unbalanced. Despite Andrea's supposed apathy towards fashion, the designer tag of every dress, jacket and shoe is put forward. Weisberger's writing has a certain fluffy charm, but it lacks in zest. Perhaps in time it will balance itself out and be genuinely engaging. At the moment, it's just moderately interesting, with some typos that made me blink in disbelief. (&quot;Heroine-chic&quot; was a joke, right?)The only characters who you'll remember as you flip the last page are Andrea and Miranda; the others are thin paper dolls. Andrea is pretty thin herself (and I'm not talking about her weight). Her whiny, petty, self-centered behavior has the occasional good deed thrown in, but it isn't enough to make her likable. On the other hand, Miranda's over-the-top evil behavior is funnier than it is evil.Like wearing an ill-fitting miniskirt, this book is unpleasant and kind of embarrassing. Roman &agrave; clef novels are rarely good, but this one is worse than most. The devil who wears Prada is the only truly interesting thing about this flimsy novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With a catchy title containing the words &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;prada,&quot; as well as a comparison (not glowing, however) to &quot;The Nanny Diaries,&quot; this book caught the attention of many readers. Thus, a top ranking on the best-seller list for many, many months. However, lacking any type of textual flow, over-use of flowery and unnecessary adjectives, and extreme drama over issues that the typical person would consider ridiculous, this book should be considered a waste of time. The tantalizing New York fashion gossip aside, it lacks any depth and most readers will likely find it difficult to empathize with, sympathize with, or even hate the central character of the story. Simply put, Lauren, it's no &quot;War and Peace.&quot; She could have ended the book saying &quot;HA, I helped you waste money, since this book is like reading high school gossip!&quot; Because, for the first time in a lifetime of reading, I put a book down without finishing it. Readers are better served elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am still trying to figure out how a book with no plot can be on the bestseller list. This was the most ridiculous book I have read in years. Weisberger repeated banal details so often that I have to wonder if she thinks her readers are brain dead. This sophomoric attempt at a book should have been significantly altered during the editing process. Someone should tell Ms. Weisberger that in order to write a book, you must have an idea for a plot. Shallow characters living in New York do not constitute a storyline. I felt that this was an incredibly poor attempt to copy the book, The Nanny Diaries. As a busy professional, I felt that this was a waste of valuable time. The only reason I bothered to finish reading this horrific book was due to the fact that my book club had chosen to read it. I warn all book clubs and individuals considering this book to stay away."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had the chance to read an advance galley copy of this book while snowbound in NYC on President's Day. I think the only reason I finished it was the utter lack of anything else to do. I cringed at not only the errors others have mentioned (spelling, grammar, etc.) but also simple facts. For example: Although the book takes place over 1 year, Miranda's twin daughters are described as 8 years old, then 13 years old, and then 8 again. That's not the only thing I disliked. All of the characters are shallow and underdeveloped and I felt no sympathy for them. I might have taken pity on Andrea (the main character) for putting up with her hellish boss, except much of the book is her bitching and moaning about everything. The rest of it consists of: 1) Weisberger pummeling the reader with one name-drop after the other of today's fashion stars. 2) Miranda's strange requests and resulting temper tantrums, which sadly didn't even escalate as the book went on. If this was certified chick lit Weisberger should have at least crafted an iota of tension between Andrea and the hot single writer Christian. Not only was that missing, but there is no true conflict between Andrea and the other characters. Sure, they get [mad] at her for being at work so much, but just like with the characters themselves,it's hard to care. Even if you have the fashion bug (like me!) I suggest you avoid this book. Go buy Vogue in solidarity against Lauren Weisberger!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"i love a good chick book, especially one about ivy league girls trying to make it in manhattan, but this was pathetic. the only upside was that it is a very quick read, so you could find out what happens to the ridiculous protagonist with a minimal time investment.the characters are dreadful, ex. our \\"hero\\" andrea gets quiet revenge on Runway by stealing from the company (buying macchiatos for the homeless, leaving extravagent tips). the do-gooder boyfriend character becomes unbearably self-righteous. and the book couldn't deal with alcohol and sex addiction in a more flippant way. it all ends up making the \\"Devil\\" look good - focused, demanding, over-the-top, but delivering on all promises and totally predictable.if you've ever had a demanding boss, worked in a remotely glamorous industry, lived in a big city, or had to work your way up a corporate ladder, you will find this book trite and foolish. i will be very surprised if i ever see the author's writings anywhere near the New Yorker."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In a weird coincidence, both this book (on CD) and The Nanny Diaries (in print) arrived for me on hold at our local library the same day. It was like having two copies of the same book, both of which were boring and annoying. After reading (or listening to) about the first quarter of each book, I skipped to the last chapter or two, just to make sure that I wouldn't miss any strange and sudden surprises. I didn't. While listening to this book, I was put off by several elements: the reference to &quot;Jappy&quot; college colleagues, the narrator's inability to tell her two Indian roommates apart after living with them for a year, her repeated use of the ear-grating phrase &quot;as best as.&quot; What is supposed to be so compelling about characters who have the boss from hell and are too stupid to quit?

Bridget Jones has ruined it for us as publishers churn out this kind of garbage just because it sells well and we continue to buy it. I can't bring myself to purchase anymore stories about women that just graduated from college and their day-to-day stories about life, love and living in the big city. This book is like a cheesy Cosmopolitan fiction excerpt only much longer. This story is not shocking, I don't find any of the tales surprising and to top it off, the writing style is horrible.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the content of this novel. First of all, I found various inconsistencies in Weisberger's writing. The course of the story took some abrupt turns from one chapter to the next. Also, despite the fact that the author developed a rather believable character in Miranda, the development of secondary characters was missing. I had difficulty remembering who was who most of the time. I give the The Devil Wears Prada three stars because, structural errors aside, Weisberger grasped the protagonist's frustrations as she endured menial labor with unflinching accuracy. Having once worked as a personal assistant for a faux celebrity not unlike Miranda Priestly, I know the aforementioned frustrations quite well. All and all, The Devil Wears Prada is a mediocre read. I wouldn't discourage others from reading it, but I hope to have offered some insight on what to expect from this book..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked The Devil Wears Prada in the airport for a light read while travelling on business.

As a result, when my library sold off its \\"overstock,\\" I picked up the hardback of this book for a buck. I'm glad I didn't spend more.It's not that the novel is bad. It's that the movie captures EVERYthing appealing about the book, and none of its weaknesses. In the movie, I could suspend my disbelief and accept the boss-from-hell as deliciously evil. While reading the novel, I kept thinking about the alternatives that the protagonist didn't consider, from small items like, \\"Why don't you actually ASK her what she wants, emphasizing that you want to do a superlative job to support her?\\" to \\"Maybe there ARE better jobs out there, you doofus?\\" It gave me too much time to think, perhaps. Or maybe the movie's top-notch acting made me believe in the story.Anyway, if you enjoyed the movie as I did, and hoped that the book was even better (because really, it usually is) -- don't expect too much."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I finally read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" thinking it would be better than the film, which, in my opinion was marginal except for the performances of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci who have done much better work.I am sorry to say that I have found one of the few books where the movie was actually better.Many other reviews in this very long thread have discussed the book's merits and flaws in great detail, and I cannot add anything more to what has already been said. And many people loved it. But my \\"two cents\\" is that this is a book crammed full of the most two-dimensional, annoying characters I have ever read about, almost utterly unsympathetic and vapid in every conceivable way. I suppose a very superficial industry may tend to produce superficial people for whom being catty is some personality substitute, one of the \\"points\\" the author was trying to make, I think. But, as is, I didn't even DISLIKE the characters of this book enough to care about them, even the protagonist who, with a little more development, could have been very interesting as a counter-point to superficiality, an awakening that does not come until the very end which reads like the intro of Marlo Thomas' old show, \\"That Girl.\\" Just a crashing endless litany of meaningless dialogue that ends with the reader rolling his eyes and shrugging his shoulders, the only emotional currency this still-born rougues' gallery of stock-in-trade harpies, male and female, seems to know. Flat as a desert and twice as barren. It's all been done before, and better.If you want a very fine read about New York high society, may I recommend the novel \\"The First Wives' Club?\\" It's not like the (quite funny) film. Although it can be very funny, and spot-on from what I hear, it's also quite deadly serious in parts, all with wonderful characterizations. \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\" is likewise worth the time and money.But \\"The Devil Wears Prada?\\" Back to remainder table and bargain bin hell where it so richly belongs."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Having seen the movie first, I expected a novel far more interesting than what I read.

Read by Rachel Leigh Cook, The Devil Wears Prada kept my long hours in the car lively enough that I didn't mind the amount of time behind the wheel that is putting a serious dent in my wallet.Andrea Sachs is an aspiring writer fresh out of Northwestern University looking for some type of big break in New York City that will result in a job at The New Yorker. After very few positive responses, Elias Clark Publishing hires Andrea for a job as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of prestigious fashion magazine Runway, Miranda Priestly. Landing a job that a million girls would kill for, Andrea finds it's not as glamorous as her co-workers are forcing themselves to believe. After a week of intense training with first assistant Emily, Andrea thinks she has everything under control until Miranda comes back to town and Andrea's life, as she knows it, is changed. She is running impossible errands on demanding timelines, which causes her to alienate her family and friends for the job, resulting in strain on her relationship with English teacher boyfriend Alex (me?) and almost missing that her graduate student roommate Lily is gradually becoming an alcoholic. Andrea becomes enwrapped in the fashion industry she previously had no interest in to reach her goal. One year at Runway with Miranda and she could pretty much have her pick of any job, including her spot at The New Yorker. But how much was it worth? Andrea is running errands, fetching clothes and Starbucks, picking up Miranda's dog from the groomer's and even locating a pre-published version of the latest Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters. One year, it's just one year. Or will this job have more of an effect than Andrea originally plans?It's impossible for me not to compare this book to the movie. Personally, and maybe because I saw it before the audio book, I like the movie better. Granted, Anne Hathaway is a major factor in this comparison, but there are minute plot and character differences between the book and movie that I think work better in the movie version (not to mention that the movie includes the Stanley Tucci character missing from the book). In the book, Emily is more of a helping figure for Andrea and Miranda is simply mean on purpose (making Andrea get an impossible lunch, knowing that she already has lunch plans elsewhere, calling people by the wrong names, and leaving out details over the phone just to make her assistants work harder). I think that Andrea in the book is less of a dynamic character than Andrea in the movie. I never really saw a character shift in the book. Andrea at the beginning seems to be Andrea at the end, the only difference being that when she finally is given an impossible task, she seems to quit because it's too hard when she was previously able to accomplish everything. In the movie, Andrea's character is changing. She is good at her job and her priorities are changing, but when she realizes that she could end up as Miranda, this is not how she wants to lead her life and chooses to leave. Also, in the movie, Miranda ends up being okay and giving a reference for Andrea's new job for a newspaper, while in the book Andrea is hired because of a common link with someone who hates Miranda as much as she does. Not that impressive. I know it's not really fair, but I'd rather watch the movie.Rachel Leigh Cook does a good job at reading Weisberg's novel, which is possibly based off of some real life experiences as a personal assistant. Cook does some voices in a good way that adds variety without being obnoxiously theatrical. She was a good reader and I can recommend her version of the audio book for those of us who are constantly driving back and forth and need something to fill the time constantly driving by mile markers that tick by like seconds. It's nice to reach your destination and feel some sense of accomplishment rather than just whining about leg cramps and poor air conditioning.\\"The habit of reading is the only enjoyment in which there is no alloy; it lasts when all other pleasures fade.\\"- Anthony Trollope"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"i'm rating this book zero stars. I was so looking forward to reading it after having watched the movie a million times and loved it. the movie makes you smile. makes you laugh. makes you root for andy and everyone else in her life. this book makes you cringe. makes you want to throw it against a wall and never pick it back up again (in my case, actually happened). how anyone contrived to get a plot out of this useless dribble and turn it into a great movie deserves a star on the hollywood walk of fame. The book sucks. and the whinniness of the main character unbearable. with the added bonus of so many bigot remarks, and foul language this was a no-brainer for me: toss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I guess by now everyone knows the story and has seen the movie. Fresh out of college, Andrea gets a job as a junior assistant to the devil herself, Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway Magazine. Read as Andrea jumps through hoops and over hurdles to satisfy the outlandish requirements of Miranda, while her relationships with friends and family suffer. The writing was realistic and funny in spots. I could see the frazzled Andrea clicking down the street, juggling coffee, magazines, and cell phone, giving half-hearted renditions of 80s pop songs to Eduardo in order to enter the building, and shaking in her boots when dealing with Miranda. A solid 3 star and yes, the movie is better than the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just finished reading the book The Devil Wears Prada.I thought it was a very good book. The characters were wonderful and entertaining to read. If you want a good read I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"Devil Wears Prada\\" is quite an enjoyable book, if you have all time in the world in your hand. Very realistic and hilarious. Very good for learning about fashion and the glamour world.Now about the subject matter, well, if this person Miranda Priestly actually exists in real life (in a different name of course), as claimed, I wonder what she thinks about looking at her own true self in public mirror. She is unfair, unkind, mean, vile, domineering and tyrannical. She never even pours herself a glass of water, and her slaves wait her on hands and knees. In 432 pages of the book, Miranda Priestly violated at least 400 basic human rights. However, the big question is, where her fame plus existence would be, if hundreds of Runway employees didn't support. So why none of them ever bothered reporting her to the Human Rights Commission. Why did they let her have her way like this and let it go on for so long? Is this the idea of capitalism? And particularly, why somebody who wants to write as a profession would take a job as a personal slave? What kind of a boss forbids her assistants to eat or use the toilet and get away with it? Even in USA?Throughout the book, these personal slaves arranged her trips, fetched her food, served her demands, took her car to garage, picked up her dirty laundry, ordered for her desired goodies, her designer dress and makeup and accessories; but wait a minute, I'm confused, Miranda Priestly is an editor, right? She is not a fashion model herself. A fashion magazine is supposed to work on the fashion models, right? She is an icon in the fashion world, but does not pose herself on magazine covers, right? They are supposed to care for what models wear and use, right? So why does everybody work their butt off to cover this editor in diamonds?And what's with this materialistic concept of life-style? Since when painting face in 20 layers of make-up or 6 different shades of mascara or having more supplies+instructions than a NASA scientist needs or brand names written all over the body is a huge achievement in life or maybe the ultimate goal of life for these privileged people? These makeup Gestapos and fashion Nazis. Hmmm, think of the remote regions in the third world where obtaining little bit of food or medicine only once a week is a regular way of life.To be honest, no matter what the author's intention was, I COULDN'T really bring myself to feel empathy for Andrea. She gets her personal chauffer and limo ride anywhere she goes, she doesn't even need to use public transportations. If one thinks her life is arduous, try to live and work in Bangladesh or Pakistan or India, you will see what an \\"arduous everyday life\\" means.Every time she is out on the street running an important errand for Miranda (especially she knows very well how Miranda gets impatient and pissed), still she (Andrea) is either taking time smoking cigarettes or talking on the phone with her boyfriend or girlfriend! Are those absolutely \\"life-and-death\\" necessity during working hours? Not to mention her home-front, her family and boyfriend and girlfriend, who tried to jeopardize her career and kill her ambitions and bring her down to their trailer-trash level in every opportunity they got.In my opinion the author babbled way too much constantly and unnecessarily. Here is an example, Miranda asked Andrea to come to the party at 4pm on page 305. Party starts at 7pm the same evening. Page 320, 321, 322...... we are still not at the party! Party finally starts on page 325! Imagine! 3 hours, 20 pages! Furthermore, she wasted plenty of pages on this Lily the whorish alcoholic troublemaker fiasco, as if it is Lily's biography! That was an annoying distraction from the main focus of the story line. She is a screw-up and drowned in booze and no match for Andrea's level, so why going on and on about Lily and fattening the book? Especially, the book should have ended at page 412. Chapters 18 and 19 (page 413-432) were completely useless, pointless and ridiculous. Those pages seemed like somebody else added them later, or the author doesn't know where to stop.Ultimately what came out of this whole thing? Has Andy learned something out of it? This entire ordeal ended up in nothing. She eventually went back to her trailer-trash life, to become a fat Jewish mom in dirty clothes and having a half-blind wet-blanket husband and a bunch of screaming snotty babies. Maybe that's good enough for her."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Very poorly written first novel. A self-righteous brat finds the kind of employment she deserves, but whines, cries and snivels about it--all the way to the bank, evidently! I don't know how assisting the editor of 'Vogue' (er, 'Runway') will segue into work at 'The New Yorker', but our protagonist believes that it will. Therefore, instead of just quitting this thankless, stupid job, she keeps at it. I wanted to kick her ass all the way through the novel. I'm not sure why I finished this book.

To say the least, I was disappointed! The premise was interesting, and the beginning rather funny. Andrea, after having an extreme fever gets a job at Runway Magazine. Her heartless cold witch of a boss makes impossible demands of her employees. Now the trouble begins- The boss Miranda is never developed as a character, and I never understood why she was so mean, or why the characters put up with it. I kept waiting for the boss to have some deep dark secret, but basically, she was a robot. And the main character! She's spineless throughout the whole novel, and acts as a well dressed doormat. She ditches her friend and boyfriend for her (not paying well) job. This made no sense to me. And then there was the mysterious stranger. I quote, \\"His arrogance was attractive, and I couldn't turn away.\\" Well, face it, the guy's a jerk, and he just sticks around as the love interest. Although the Nanny Diaries was not exactly a masterpiece, it was so much more engaging then this novel. What kept me holding on in this novel was hoping, just HOPING, that by the end, Andrea would stand up to her boss. Well, what did I get? A simple, unimaginative, $#%& you. Well, come on, I mean, Andrea puts up with a years worth of torture, and that's all she can say? The ending was entirely pathetic, unimaginative, and falls flat. This novel is as plastic as the editors at Runway. It was a waste of good trees."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It will probably be to some degree entertaining to most readers. I on the other hand enjoyed it since fashion is one my interests. Many names would probably be unfamiliar to those not really interested in fashion or who at least read Vogue.The story is not excellent but not exactly bad, the novel is more of the descriptive type. However if you're a girly-girl you're sure to enjoy the adventures of Andrea Sachs and her run-ins with her boss Miranda."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This was an okay book.

Andrea takes the job, knowing nothing about fashion, because she sees it as a fantastic high-paying position which she hopes will later land her on the prestigious literary review, the New Yorker, which is much more down her alley of expertise. Andrea's inept attempts to carry out her duties and errands to please her boss result in some hilarious moments.

Andrea (\\"Ahn-dre-a/Andy\\") Sachs works as an underpaid, overworked personal assistant/slave to Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly of \\"Runway\\" magazine. Yet, she receives $38,000 worth of Louis Vuitton luggage and haute couture fashion, professional hair and make-up and massages at the Ritz in Paris, the opportunity to \\"borrow\\" exorbitantly expensive clothing (Gucci, Oscar de la Renta, Prada, etc.) that the average American woman can only read about in magazines.I'm not a big fan of Andy as protagonist. I think the book could've been improved if the story came from Andrea's senior colleague Emily's point of view. At least Emily had a passion for fashion. I'd probably sympathize more with Emily who made an effort towards a job well done. Andy just came off as arrogant, and self-centered- a result of attending some fancy \\"Ivy League\\" college so little tasks like fetching, faxing, and finding are beneath her. I'm surprised Andy couldn't \\"get it\\" in the end that she is like her boss. She demands the world to revolve around her. Andy never worked at a real job, whereas Miranda worked most her life to get into a position as the most powerful woman in publishing. I saw no real growth in the protagonist, which was disappointing. Andy should've made the best of her position and learned something.

The reader warning is this: if you like good writing (strongly written characters, strong plotline, things like that), get another book. To be honest, I think the author should have stuck with stories about her experience at work (much more fun to read about a ridiculously demanding boss, free designer clothes and running around in Jimmy Choo heels all day than supposed character development tangents involving increasingly strained relationships with her boyfriend and troubled best friend). In short, I think she should have focused on the job; it was hilarious to read about the world of high fashion and the people who inhabit it--but there was too much focus on the main character's personal life and motivations. A fun, mindless read nevertheless--a step up from watching reruns on TV, if you will."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I got this book on CD to be a light \\"read\\" on my 1 hour commute to work each day. If there were ever a scenario where I was going to be generous, it is when I have absolutely nothing better to do than let the book entertain me, like say, while driving.Despite what should have been a light, entertaining jaunt through the fashion world and into the life of an ambitious assistant, I found myself feeling angrier and more annoyed to the point I was practically yelling at the CD. Now, you might think that Miranda (the boss) was the problem, but actually, I found Andy (the main character) to be idiotic, incompetent, and obnoxious! As far as Brown grads go, she's got to be one of the dullest they've let in (or out for that matter!). She's lazy about getting a job, doesn't bother to do any research or legwork whatsoever but expects that through a lucky break she magically lands a special job that, with fairly minimal effort, will catapault her to any dream job in the writing world she wants. This nifty job is so special that in only a year of work, she will (apparently) be eligible to do what others had to spend 3 years working towards at much worse jobs... is she stupid?? Does she have 1 ounce of common sense? I guess not... What about a sense of professional integrity and a desire to work for what she gets in the world? Nope... Is she, at the very least, a halfway decent assistant?? NOT REALLY! She couldn't even follow 2 step instructions! It was absolutely ridiculous. What's worse, she's a hypocrite, at one moment criticizing the fashion industry, glamour, and the like, and the next swooning over celebrities. Give me a break!I found this book so unpleasant that I finally gave up part way through. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Some truly funny moments but, overall, a very sad account of a woman who gives up everything that's important to her for the sake of a thankless job and an evil boss. Though she does choose her life rather than her career at the end, she's already lost a great deal. This book is really quite thought-provoking when one considers today's work centered society. What are we giving up when our career becomes our be all and end all? Really well-written with a truly hateful character in Miranda, the boss from the fiery pits of hell."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I actually enjoyed this book. It is not my favorite type of novel, but it is well written, witty and genuine enough to laugh and feel for the main protagonist, Andrea Sachs, who recalls her misery as the junior assistant of Miranda Priestly, the main editor of the top fashion magazine, Runway (in reality - Anna Wintour of Vogue).Andrea, the alter ego of the author, and an aspiring writer freshly out of college, suffers while performing the tasks given her by her boss. She has too much sense not to see the absurdity of her actions, is sensitive, but at the same time ambitious and held at her job by the promise of being given any job she wants in publishing (her dream is to work for the New Yorker, galaxies from Runway...) after one year of working for Miranda. So - she sacrifices a lot. Too much, in fact... She gets alienated from her family, best friend Lily and from her boyfriend Alex.While reading, I was waiting for an obvious climax, Andrea being fired. It happens, of course, at the very end (the novel is constructed in a quite predictable way, nothing surprising), but the events leading to it are hilarious and the book is never boring. It is remarkably authentic, great weekend reading, and the author deserved the bestseller. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"First of all you have to hand it to the author, or her editor, or the publishing company for coming up with this most memorable title in years. I think the title had a tremendous amount to do with the success of the book. That being said, I have to be fair and reveal that I came to the book afer seeing the movie. I thought the movie was charming and entertaining. And it was reconstructed into a modern Cinderella story where everyone, even the \\"moster boss\\" has a dash of humanity. The book is very inferior. The characters are much more cardboard, the in-between-office chapters are long and boring, and the main character is whiney and unlikable (no one wants to hear someone with a dream job with lots of perks and a promising future complain because she has to work hard and put up with a difficult boss!) But it was a clever idea to get the real life job just long enough to gather information to write the tell-all book. What a publicity coup. What a stunt. And isn't that what it's about? So she earned her movie deal and big profits. Who are we to complain? Her timing in life brought her to a dream job. She took notes. She left. She wrote The Devil Wears Prada..and we didn't"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ok, we have all had the boss from hell. If you haven't, consider yourself lucky. Those of us who have, dealt with the situation and moved on. I really wanted to like Andrea. I really wanted to sympathize with her. This is the reason I have read the book 5 times. However, I am unable to do so. She considers herself so \\"above\\" all things Runway and is a total reverse snob. She thinks that a fashion magazine is ridiculous and beneath her...so why did she jump at the opportunity to take the job? Because she wants a free ride to get her dream job with the New Yorker. So many of the problems she encounters are her own doing, such as taking such a long time getting Miranda's coffee and lunch because she's busy talking on her cell phone and smoking. Or cancelling her dinners with her boyfriend because she's \\"just so exhausted\\". Even when she screws up the Harry Potter book fetching, it was all her own doing. She complains that she has to wake up at 5:00 AM everyday...honey, that's called a job. Even when she was being harrassed by the security guard who insists that Andy sing before he allows her upstairs, I couldn't feel for her. Andy refuses to understand or learn the rules of Runway. She just wants to get her one year over & then get her free ride on to The New Yorker. I was completely disgusted with the ending. Andrea is supposed to be the heroine of this story but I just didn't like her. I actually felt sorry for Emily, the senior assistant, who truely wanted to help Miranda and had to put up with Andy's blantant disregard for procedure. In the end, Andy refused to take responsibility for her own choices and decisions. If this character is supposed to be a representation of Lauren Weisberger, she is not someone I would like to know.That being said, I did enjoy the book for the simple fact that it was a fast read and didn't wander too much from the original plot. If you need rainy-day-curl-up-on-the-couch-and-drink-hot-cocoa reading material, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The novel was nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed the insider glimpse of fashion paranoia presented therein. I thought if Andrea (the main character) could stop smoking and think for a minute instead of constantly being surprised by her boss's requests, then she might make something of herself. Instead of anticipating, she worries and moans about the dream job 'a million girls would die for,' a phrase I hated by the end of the novel. I was able to think of easy solutions for a great deal of her dilemmas, such as scheduling agenda leeway for late flights, expensing an old-style non microwave food warmer, and hiring a taxi cab driver for the day. If you have a practically unlimited expense account, use your imagination, girl, and stop the whines."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book, The Devil Wears Prada, was very disappointing. First, the main character, Andrea, is running around New York running crazy errands for her boss. This is the subject of the first chapter. After reading this, about the next five are completely and totally dreadful. There are no special events or anything leading to the climax. Why? Because Andrea's boss is in Europe for some reason or another. I fell asleep about every two minutes.Andrea's character seemed to be well developed: a small-town girl thrown into the big city to work for a crazy lady. Andrea was initially naive in the whole fashion business, and you seemed to like her just fine. But as the book progresses and Andrea is exposed to the magazine even more, she becomes less relatable and more bratty. At the climax of the story, which happens in about the last fifteen pages, I could barely stand Andrea anymore! However, I will say that her relationships with her family and friends were right on, because everybody has trouble with relationships now and again. But her father seemed a little like he wanted to date her... but that's just my impression.I think that if you read the book before you see the movie you'll enjoy it a lot more. I, on the other hand, saw the movie before reading the book. The movie had an awesome ending, while the book was a disappointment. But don't take my word on that because I saw the movie first. I seriously think you'd like it better. :)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Fresh out of college, Andrea Sachs unexpectedly finds employment immediately in a job that \\"millions of girls would die for\\" as a personal assistant to the most powerful woman in publishing, Miranda Priestly. Andrea is convinced that if she can make it through a year as Miranda's assistant the she will be rewarded with a top-notch recommendation at her dream job, working for \\"The New Yorker\\". However, with the constant and relentless demands of the job and Andrea's personal life beginning to fall apart, she becomes less and less convinced she will finish out the year and all her efforts will go to waste . . .The novel is quite tedious in the beginning and picks up speed in the second half, which certainly outshines the first part. The novel could have benefited from additional cuts during editing. Also, the character development is questionable, although Weisberger does a adequate job at making the reader hate the antagonist (Miranda). However, the protagonist lacks a connection with the reader and definitely had major personality flaws and inconsistencies. The ending is very clich&eacute; and quite predictable and Weisberger left out a satisfactory conclusion to the character Christian Collinsworth, who plays a major role in the events of the novel but seems to disappear during the finale.In addition to the book, there is a movie by the same title that is quite good (The Devil Wears Prada, 2006), which I recommend to readers as well as those who skip the book. Also, the story is meant to satirize the fashion industry, but a better (albeit darker) satire of fashion and high society is in \\"American Psycho\\" by Bret Easton Ellis."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did.

But its highly predictable, and you feel as if you're just reading complaint after complaint and frankly, starts getting irritating."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was easy to read and fairly well written. It gives an interesting, voyeuristic view of the fashion industry. Parts of it were laugh-out-loud funny, but this single theme book grows a tad tedious. I kept hoping for the protagonist, Andrea, to give her boss the comeuppance, but it never materialized. Instead it takes a very long time and a contrived tragedy to make Andrea have her obligatory light bulb moment. This book was overwrought and too long yet somehow fairly entertaining. 2 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is one of those rare circumstances where the MOVIE is so much better than the book. The book is poorly written and whiny. The screenplay for the movie took the basic premise of the book and turned it into what the book should have been -- a story with two sides and a lesson instead of an epic \\"feel sorry for me because I had to work hard\\" memoir."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this book up at my sister-in-law's house and read the first two or three chapters; I promptly went out the next day and bought it, partially because I wanted to see how it ended, and partially because I'd always rather read the book before seeing the movie. It only took a few sittings to finish it, and although I wasn't too impressed with the book as a whole, it was still fun. The plot was definitely lacking, as was the character development - I thought Andrea was a bit too naive and uppity, attending Brown and all then whining about how ridiculous her job was. Yes, her duties were ridiculous, but as I tell my associates at my job - if you hate it, no one's making you stay. Plus that type of job should be expected to be ridiculous. The boyfriend and best friend were easily forgettable, and the whole thing with the character of Christian was just left hanging in the air; I still don't understand why his character was even in the book, as it went nowhere. The ending kind of flopped, and after finishing it, I felt like I actually had just read a teenager's poorly constructed story from Seventeen magazine, just like Andrea wrote at the end of the book. This felt like something I would've picked out from the library at 13 years old, sans all the swearing. Not for nothing however, I did enjoy reading it, as it went quickly and had its funny moments. It could've been much better with a more developed plot and more complexity to the characters. I say check it out from the library if you're interested, don't buy it yourself."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just got home from a beach vacation, and I read the whole book very quickly. Despite my 3 and 5 year old's distractions, I managed to pay attention to this book quite easily. That's no easy feat! So, I gave the book 4 stars for entertaining me quite well.I thought the voice of the novel sounded exactly the way a 20-some-odd year old would sound right out of college. Although many exceptions to grammatical rules were taken, the vernacular was pretty much right in line with real world conversations. I thought Andrea was entirely believable as a character.The problem for me was that I did not particularly care for Andrea, and I did not really think her boss was mean enough. Granted, I could not have handled being an assistant to \\"Miranda,\\" but there were many times that Miranda's only crime was simple aloofness. Of course, it's enough to drive Andrea crazy, but not crazy enough to leave her job when her entire life is falling apart because of her \\"career.\\" (And the career part of this book was a joke - she was a gopher, and that's it.) I think we were supposed to root for Andrea, but I felt sad for her from the beginning. She just didn't have the gumption to stand up for herself in 11 months of employment. I had a hard time understanding why her dream of writing for the New Yorker depended entirely on working at Vogue...ooops, I mean Runway...for 12 months. Why couldn't Andrea see that she wasn't writing or learning any useful skills?Of course, the job provided the fodder for a great book deal for Ms. Weisberger, and look where she is now. The reader can assume that Andrea made off with a similar deal, and that is the obvious happy ending. Still, I just can't shake the notion that Andrea was a sell-out from the beginning. I wish this book had spent time on a more respectable character.The bottom line on this book for me was that it held my attention (over the uproar in my crazy vacation home) and provided me with a read I always looked forward to coming back to when I had a free moment. So what if I just hated the protagonist? I enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a breezy read of a book that you'll enjoy if you've ever 1) lived in New York in your 20's 2) been an assistant in a glamour industry 3) wanted to do either of the above. It doesn't stand up to a long-winded review but not everything that's worth reading has to. Great for the beach or the plane."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this was a great novel. Andrea, the protagonist, goes to work for a self-absorbed, semi-sadistic editor of a fashion magazine. I don't know enough about the world of fashion to know how realistic it was (aside from the fact that most bosses are probably not as outrageous as Andrea's -- at least I hope they're not), but it was an entertaining read. We watch Andrea struggle to succeed because as much as she hates her job, she's really hoping it will help get her onto the staff of The New Yorker. Even when Andrea begins to let down her friends and family because all of her time is consumed by work, and objectively we know she's doing something wrong, we can still sympathize with her because we have seen how she got to that point. The author has created realistic, three-dimensional characters that really lead readers to become involved in the novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"&quot;THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA&quot; seems to be a love it or leave it book.

I couldn't put it down. The author is great and I wonder what her next books will be like. (As much as I used to like Candace Bushnell for \\"Sex and the City\\", I didn't like her books at all.) You don't always have to put much thought into a book you're reading, some books are just so great to relax with... \\"The devil wears prada\\" is one of those girlie type of books you can simply enjoy and relax with."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"&lt;u>The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/u> is a fabulous book if you enjoy looking in on the life of one of the many slaves of the fashion industry.\\"Ahn-dre-ah\\" is a typical woman fresh out of college with aspirations of writing for The New Yorker. You see her drastically transform from grounded to fashion-conscious after she is assured a job as Miranda Priestly's assistant at Runway magazine will ultimately get her what she wants.It's no literary masterpiece but it's a fun romp worth reading in your spare time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In reading over the reviews posted here, it seems that people are very bothered by the shallow, materialistic protagonist. I didn't necessarily get that impression and besides, if every character was likeable and exuding righteousness, we'd never have had some of the great literary heroes and heroines. That being said, Andrea Sachs doesn't fall into that category and the book itself was largely a disappointment. I had no expectation of lofty intellectual reading, but some semblance of plot would have been nice. Every aspect of the story was completely predictable and the characters were rather poorly developed. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this was a waste of money, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea gets a dream job at a fashion magazine, but gets the boss-from-hell. Actually her dream involved writing for the New Yorker but fetching coffee and dry cleaning for the boss seems unlikely to train her for that. She plugs away as the job becomes all consuming and the demands from her boss grate more and more on her nerves.As her relationships dwindle under the stress of the job, the conflict with the boss becomes more personalized. Andrea becomes more and more paranoid as sleep deprivation and lack of social support turn her into a whining, unpleasant person herself.Fascinating insider view of the fashion industry and working in the high-pressure NYC jobs. Often funny, a bit romantic and eventually somewhat depressing as Andrea is dragged further and further down by the job and the horror that is her boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed reading this book more than I thought I would. Initially, I thought it would be a vapid, self-indulgent tale of the 'Boss from Hell' but the book's genuine warmth, wit, and humor quickly won me over. Reading it, I shudder to think that the author based this book on her actual real-life experience as a fashion assistant. Parts of the novel really resonated with me, such as Andrea's aspirations to become a writer and her post-collegiate lifestyle. However, there were times when I found Andrea to be too spineless for her own good. Why does she tolerate so much psychological abuse from Miranda? Why did it take her so long to finally stand up for herself? The conflicts also seemed to be resolved a little too quickly. Miranda, as was to be expected, was typically detestable and inhuman as a boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Weisberger's novel about a recent college graduate from an ivy league who is trying to make her way up the corporate ladder in order to finally have a job that requires more skills and intelligence that the 50 brain cells it takes to pick up a Starbucks frap and jot down messages from important callers will ring true to everyone who has had to do his/her fair share of bitch work. Any intern or recent college graduate who is simply forced to do busy work unaffiliated in any way with his or her major or expertise will find the story endearing, for I bet each and every reader is familiar with \\"the boss from hell.\\" Surprisingly, there are a lot of those out there. However, although the concept is familiar to many, Weisberger's writing fails to elicit the desired response from the reader. Although one is expected to feel frustration, anger, and even pity for the Andy, the poor intern who landed a job far from her expectations, Weisberger is unable to properly convey the feelings to the reader, and one can find themselves associating with the main character only if they have previously been in a similar situation, not through the feelings and situations depicted in the writing.Furthermore, although Andy's character undergoes through several changes as the reader turns the pages, the changes in her personality are not accurately described and are often illustrated in a very humdrum style. In addition, the ending proves to be a bit anti-climatic, and the main point that Weisberger was getting to need to be elucidated, for though it seems that the author tries to convey a message about standing up for oneself and following your career goals despite the obstacles in the way, that message is lost among the plethora of product placements, catchy one-liners, and secondary stories about Andy's boyfriend and best friend."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is an easy read, but that's the best thing I can say about it. If you liked The Nanny Diaries, you'll like this book. If you've never read The Nanny Diaries, ask yourself this question: would I enjoy reading a book about a super-powerful, self-centered New Yorker who treats her young assistant horribly? If the answer is yes, go ahead and order this book. If not, good for you! Now order something worth your while, like The Secret Life of Bees."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's certainly not literary fiction, but The Devil Wears Prada is a light, easy read for a stress-free vacation and a surprising addition to a professional's business library. The book tackles such issues in business as management, employee satisfaction, and the deadline-driven world of the publishing field. As readers follow Andrea Sachs through her first job and first year at a popular fashion magazine in New York, NY, they are invited to share in the ups and downs of working for a demanding boss in a position of low pay and virtually non-existent status. Along the way, Andrea realizes what it takes to be successful and what unquestionable abuse one can yield upon employees when their boss is one of the most respected and feared professionals in their field. Andrea also learns to prioritize. In coming to understand her personal work limits, she also begins to develop a healthy work/life balance, something many professionals -- men and women alike -- find themselves struggling with day after day.Andrea represents what most people are like when they take on their first job or what many become after years of unsuccessful attempts at getting ahead the old-fashioned way. They're caught up in the myth that hard work and perseverance are what get people promoted. Yet after a few years of brown nosing, these same people begin to realize that the true road to success actually lies elsewhere, that to succeed, they must indeed be very good at their chosen profession, but to rely on it as the sole means of advancing their career would be naive.The Devil Wears Prada should be a staple among business books. There are lessons about dealing with bosses, navigating through business culture, and more all illustrated in its pages. The lessons one might learn from reading some of today's greatest business books are found together in The Devil Wears Prada. It is a perfect learning tool for professionals who like to learn by example and through reading about other people's mistakes.Aspiring professionals in publishing will also benefit from reading this book. Even those readers with other interests will still find the book appropriately amusing, touching, and perhaps even all too real to be just fiction."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just loved this book!

Fresh out of college, Andi lands a job \\"a million girls would die for\\" as a personal secretary to the most powerful woman in fashion, Miranda Priestly. Believing a recommendation from such a distinguished individual would guarantee her life's dream job as a writer for The New Yorker, Andi busts her butt for endless days by seeing to Miranda's every need and want. However, as the months of hard work pile up the line between her personal and work life vanishes and Andi begins to lose sight of her boyfriend, her best friends, her family, and even herself for the sake of her job.Conclusion...Overrated! It was simply not worth all the hype. Lauren Weisberger's, style, although fast-paced, quickly becomes tedious, boring, and repetitive. It may be fast-paced but it leads nowhere, and it drags on far longer than necessary. Supposedly, the movie based on this novel is far better than the book itself. But reading the novel left me with no desire to even watch it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Weisberger has a good eye for personal foible and the details of every day life. When you combine that eye with a smooth prose style and a fashion magazine setting, then you have an enjoyable reading experience.Unfortunately, Weisberger does not have the same feel for plot or character development as she does for observation. The Devil Wears Prada could have been something more than fun if she had just paid a little bit more attention to Andrea as a character. Her motivations are never clear, and her decision to stay in the job is opaque. Lily seems like she exists as a cautionary tale, and Alex is too good to be true.A talented writer, I think. This may be the perfect book for you if you want something for the airplane or summer beach reading. Bonus if you know anything about the fashion publishing world or the celebrity gossip about the people who work within its hallowed halls."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed the book, some parts were really funny, like when Eduardo made Andrea sing and dance to enter the bldg!All in all a very enjoyable read, bordering on fluff, but still with a very good ending!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is just the book that I needed after reading some dark, heavy novels.

Both books are semi-satirical and set in \\"big, bad\\" New York City, but that's where the similarity ends. The plot for THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA revolves around Andrea Sachs, who graduates from Brown and gets a job that \\"a million girls would die for.\\" She is the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Ironically, Andrea doesn't even want the job -- she has only accepted it because she thinks it will help her land her personal dream job: working as a writer for the New Yorker. That just the tip of the iceberg, but it only gets better.

Ms. Weisberger captures the essence of sheer horror clothed in the guise of Miranda Priestly. One wonders, as Ms. Weisberger did work for the top fashion magazine, are the editors and employees of such publications that brazen, cut-throat and cruel? How much of this is based on her personal interactions at Vogue?At one time or another, most of us have encountered a boss that reveals some aspect of the devil incarnate in his/her management style. As one reads, one cannot help but think of ways to retaliate on the character of Ms. Priestly and that makes reading this book fun. It is great entertainment, not rocket science.

Not overhyped fluff by any stretch of the imagination."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I laughed out load so many times while reading The Devil Wears Prada. I thought it was what a good fiction book should be: funny, laugh-out-loud, simple, a page-turner, and good escapism. I also thought it would make a great new sitcom or movie. Lauren Weisberger's story flowed, kept me interested, and I enjoyed the anticipation of learning what the main character's next impossible task would be. I believe the additional story lines concerning the best friend and boyfriend were necessary and realistic without taking over the story of Andrea and her boss. I wouldn't hesistate to read the author's next story."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was not by any means a literary masterpiece, but entertaining, absolutely.

I eagerly read to find out what Miranda Priestly would do next. However, I often wondered why the assistants didn't just ask for help when they didn't understand a request.

Overall, it was a fun book that made me appreciate my boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The hype--good and bad--around DWP goes far, far beyond its literary merits (which are minimal--this is entertainment, not literature). I really don't care whether Lauren Weisberger was fair to Anna Wintour or not, or whether she sold out her old boss, I just care about whether the book will keep me entertained for a few hours, and it did. The book is moderately entertaining and very gossipy, although some of the plot devices were awkwardly handled (such as her saintly boyfriend and the hot writer she's attracted to).I liked it better than the Nanny Diaries, which I found somewhat disturbing--these characters are pretty cartoonish, and anyone who vividly remembers how much their first job sucks may sympathize with Andrea.Btw, I read that the book has been opted for a movie...who would play Miranda Priestly?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am a student and at times just need a fun read.

Written in the vein of The Nanny Diaries, it is an insider's look at the stress-filled, not-so-glamourous world of fashion magazines. The protagonist, Andrea, is an aspiring writer who dreams of working at The New Yorker and is willing to give up a year of her life to tortuous servitude for the supremely self-involved editor of fictional Runway magazine, Miranda Priestly.She becomes the junior assistant to Miranda and soon finds that her life will be lived for this lunatic for the next 12 months.She is at her beck and call 24 hours a day for the most mundane and twisted things you can think of. In the meantime, she begins to neglect her family, burgeoning alcoholic best friend, Lily, and too-perfect boyfriend, Alex.Like The Nanny Diaries, you won't believe the things that Andrea is required to do for her boss in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. It's a fun summer read with a predictable ending, however you will still find yourself rooting for Andrea and cheering when she finally stands up for herself."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I guess you have to be a New Yorker. It's not that funny to me. There's a lot of hype about this book, and I thought it was going to be funny like David Sedaris' books.There are more entertaining books out there, like Hasket's DUNCAN DELANEY'S CADILLAC OF DOOM, OR Sedaris' NAKED, OR Orozco's DELANO."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved reading this book. It was funny and unbeleivable. It reminded me of The Nanny Diaries, only a lot more enjoyable. If this book is only partly true about the woman that Ms. Weisberger used to be an assistant for, she should be embarrased and ashamed. For anyone who is remotely interested in fashion, it will entertain."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK - so it's not \\"War and Peace\\". OK - it's not \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". BUT, I personally don't think \\"The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger was supposed to be. It was meant to be a fun (possibly tongue-in-cheek) portrayal of a young women's entrance into the world of fashion magazine publishing. Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of Runway magazine. And, Ms. Priestly is in a word. A b*tch. There's no doubt that this is a stab at author Lauren Weisberger's tenure as assistant to well known Vogue editor Anna Wintour and is very familiar to bestseller \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" but it's unfair to group them together as the same book. They are differnt and have enough power in themselves to hold their own.I think the previous reviews of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" were unnecessarily harsh and a bit unfair. I really enjoyed this easy to read and fun to savor bit of New York gossip."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book made me smile as well as empathize with Andrea, because I too am suffering through my first job out of college. The author is flawlessly up to date on the trends, names and places of the real fashion world, causing the book to seem even more plausable. The main character is humorous with a dry wit that makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously. The portrayal of the [unkind] boss as a [bad person] is hilarious, and ultimately forces the reader to acknowledge similar extremes in their own life. As most books, the ending does lead you to see what should be the priorities in our own lives, and at the very least, gives hope to those of us who have had our high hopes of the real world shattered to the tune of emails, excel spreadsheets and office politics."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So Lauren Weisbecker was on the Today Show and they asked if this was a real life account seeing as she worked for a &quot;tough lady&quot; at a fashion mag. She skirted the issue and insinuated that it was not based on her former job as an assistant, but she didn't do it gracefully enough to make me believe her, and after reading the book i'm definitely convinced that she drew heavily if not verbatum from her real life experiences. I love the book for it's real feel. I feel like the protagonist is telling me the true story of what happens to her everyday. This is the perfect beach read but doesn't feel contrived. Everything is not tied up in a neat little package, you don't always get what you want from the plot but that's what makes it unpredictable and original. I literally couldn't put it down. This was a great break from my typical grouping of Ballinger, Coehlo, Palahniuk, etc. Refreshing and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have resisted buying this book because it looked cheesy and sleazy and then I heard Meryl Streep was starring in the movie and figured it couldn't be all bad and I always like to read a book before I see the movie so I picked it up today at Seattle Tacoma International Airport and read it for four hours straight.I took it to dinner with me tonight -- at a really nice restaurant -- and I'm sure people looked at me with pity.I'm now in my hotel room at the Westin and determined to finish it before I go to sleep tonight. AND I have a huge presentation tomorrow.

Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Andy was not truly characteristic of the book's Andy. Book Andy was a stronger character and even flippant at times (which to me were the funniest parts).

The world of the fashionistas is its own parody, and \\"Runway\\" editor Miranda Priestly, the Boss from Hell, is an easy target.Weisberger's character, Andy Sachs, struggles to keep her balance as she is swept up into the narrow, self-absorbed confines of haute couture. (Although Priestly subsribes to nearly a dozen newspapers and magazines, she reads only the gossip and fashion sections.) Andi is soon exhausted from being ever at Priestly's beck and call, and finds herself with no time for family or friends. She endures Priestly's cold sarcasm and utter disregard for everyone; she learns to respond to \\"Emily\\" since her boss can't be bothered always to remember her name. Andy's determined to put in an apprentice year at Runway, hoping to get a good reference toward her ultimate goal, a job with the New Yorker.\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is adequately written; a little more time may bring to Weisberger the maturity, wit and wisdom eventually to reach her dream job."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Not exactly Tolstoy, but who reads this sort of thing for the art of writing, it just a fun quick read. The story makes me think of Mommie Dearest in that it's Andrea that comes off as a sort of an ingrate, when the whole book is Weisberger's revenge on the great Wintour, I mean she get's this dream job and does it poorly at first and feels sorry for herself, when we all know she could quit at any time and three hundred thousand people would gladly take her place, she then does it well and then quits because, well fashion is beneanth her and well she has higher ideal's after all she went to Northwestern, uh ok, well Wintour gets the last laugh having the great Streep play her in the movie and makes her look fabulous..and Weisberger wish's she looked like Anne Hathaway, ah Hollywood you gotta love it. But don't feel sorry for Weisberger I'm sure she is laughing all the way to the bank and let's hope she has kept her learned fashion taste, since she now has the money to actually buy some of it, I have a feeling she would not be welcome at Vogue for feebee's."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Even if the book is referred to fashion a couple years back, it still is quite good at reminding the horror of a first job when your own just ot of college image and outlook is not the one required.

I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it didn't. No one would have stayed in that kind of job. I ended up skipping to the end to where Miranda got her come-uppance. THAT was the best part of the whole book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" written by Lauren Weisberger was an exciting novel, of which I just couldn't put down. One reason I found this novel so enthralling was because it was a semi-true piece of literature. Since the novel was based on Weisberger's own experience with an internship at \\"Vogue Magazine\\" this novel interest me and caught my attention.Over this summer \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was made into a major motion picture starring Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. This is yet another reason I was so anxious to read this novel. In the novel I loved how every single thing that Andrea(the main character) did was so drawn out and painted such a picture in my mind. While reading this novel, I was always sitting at the edge of my seat waiting to see what crazy thing Miranda Priestly (Andreas boss) or Emily (Andreas co-worker) would make her do next. I loved how Andrea was always complaining about her job, this made the story humourous. I also loved how determined Andrea was to work at the New Yorker that she put up with all Miranda's petty little problems.All of Miranda's problems were never solved by Miranda, they we always solved by Andrea and the rest of the world that had wanted anything to do with fashion. I found this funny that everyone in the fashion industry was kissing up to her like there was no tomorrow. Andrea always had the biggest attitude with Miranda and it was just hilarious. Andrea had so many problems with her best friend Lily and her boyfriend Alex, it gave the story some more decent everyday drama.This novel would have not been the same if all the characters weren't in it. Since the novel takes place at a fashion magazine, you have to have the stereotypical gay fashion guy, the skinny size 00 girls that look at you weird if you eat a cup of soup, and even the people on the streets that Andrea would spend \\"Runways\\" money on buying them Starbucks.As a result to reading this novel, I did not go and see the movie.

It was a book that kept moving, which I appreciated in that it never \\"bogged down\\" at any one point in the story. I love fashion, and this was a great learning tool about what happens in the fashion world, and what some people will go thru. for the sake of fashion!Wonderful story, great book! If you know a young woman who loves fashion that hasn't read this yet, put it in her hands! She's bound to love it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Funny, witty, and everything that an easy summer read should be!Thanks to this book I even found myself slightly interested in fashion which is a huge accomplishment! Bravo.This is, obviously, not a book to sit and analyse- just read it and enjoy the mishaps and suffering of another human being which is, this time- not you.

I only finished is out of sheer spite!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"On the surface there were a couple of amusing moments but this was a depressingly cliched and formualic piece of fiction . What really disappointed me was the lack of rythmn vibrancy and energy in the novel ,the author never fully caputuring the mood and atmosphere of a busy Fashion House . At best this was a stilted memoir of a Fashion Intern desperate to be something more . None of the characters are fully explored and there are weaknesses in plot structure and narrative . An endless array of mind numbing vacuosity none of which is glossed with salacious gossip or anything you can chew on . Another piece of mediocrity falling victim to its own hype ."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Saw the movie version of this about a year ago and found it to be sappy and disappointing. I thought I'd give the book a go, as usually the books have much more depth and interest than the movies they spawn. Sadly, this was not the case for the Devil Wears Prada. As I read the book, I felt like I knew it all already (even though I have heard the book has a different ending to the movie...?) and since I didn't find the movie particularly interesting, I was not finding the book to be either. Couldn't justify continuing on with it when I have so many other great looking books waiting for me!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Even if there was no movie to set my standards, I would've found this book to be a let-down. My love for the movie is probably the only reason I finished the book, considering it took awhile for things to get moving. Anyway, I know most people who saw the movie first and then read the book didn't like it, but I wanted to give it a try! Booo - so sorely disappointed! The characters in the book are by far less developed and likable. I thought Andrea in the film was whiny and annoying but yikes, book Andrea makes her look great in comparison. I also found Miranda's evilness so two-dimensional - we didn't get to see more of her to understand why she's this unbearable, which would've made for a much more interesting villain instead of a flat, predictable one. And the (kind of) worst part is that the writing style is baffling - it felt amateurish and got wordy and repetitive a lot of times. :( I didn't have very high expectations but geez, they still weren't met!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you like fashion, think all models suck, and are glad you don't have to subsist on lettuce, this is a light funny book that you can easily pick up and put down. I have always thought myself a bit above the fashion industry and all of its nonsense (a bit like the heroine of his novel - I use the terms &#34;heroine&#34; and &#34;novel&#34; lightly). Therefore, I definitely identified with the main character. Would I have behaved much differently in the same situation? I wonder..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is Lauren Weisberger's first book, and details the experiences of Brown graduate, Andrea Sachs in her first job as personal assistant to the high-profile, fabulously successful Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine. The book is said to be based on Weisberger's time at Vogue, working for Anna Wintour. This book is pretty funny and is probably quite an accurate picture of the fashion industry, especially the ostentation and the obscene waste of money. Literature, it isn't; it is, basically, a litany of the progressively more outrageous demands made on her staff by the editor of a top fashion magazine and a tedious catalogue of brand names. The editor is painted as a cold-hearted, demanding, unreasonable monster; her staff are portrayed as anorexic image-obsessed minions without personality. This book confirms for me why I care nothing for the superficial world of fashion."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears PradaBy Lauren WeisbergerAndrea Sachs has recently graduated college and is trying to find a job that will someday lead her to working for The New Yorker, when she is hired by the most exasperating and demanding woman on the face of the planet, Miranda Priestly. Throughout the novel Andrea is forced day after day to do increasingly demeaning tasks and sacrifice her relationships with everyone around her, when she begins to change into someone unrecognizable even to herself she decides enough is enough.The entire book is a satirical look at having a demanding boss which I am sure everyone can appreciate in one form or another. It's witty and well written the only fault I have with it is that Lauren Weisberger seems to have some problem with southern people and describes them as tasteless, the main character even belittles the fact that her sister and brother in law live in Houston and have started to speak with southern accents. I am not quite sure why she finds this necessary but coming from Texas, I didn't enjoy it whatsoever. It is completely unlike the movie which is a good thing I didn't particularly enjoy the movie, the ending of the book was very lacking however it almost feels as though it didn't end at all she just decided to quit writing. This is definitely a book you will have to read for yourself to see if you like it or not as for me it had its good points and it's bad so I am not even sure if I did.As always if you have any requests or recommendations email me at:"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book is entertaining but not great. I watched the movie before hearing this audio book and for the most part I like the movie better. It definitely plays well on the big screen particularly with the high fashion.I did not like the narrator's way of reading the book aloud. Many times she got the inflections wrong thereby changing the way the story was heard. It was just plain inaccurate."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think the movie was better than the book, although the book wasn't too bad. I thought the writting was creative (better than some of the other popular books) and it was entertaining. An easy read for a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read the book after seeing the film and enjoyed it, especially the details about Miranda's life choices and the fashion industry. I kept thinking, 'Are there really people out there this arrogant?'The film is a nicer ending - the book is, shudder to think - an embarrassment in that Andi does exactly what Miranda figures she'll do - and with absolutely no class. All I could do was feel disappointed.I'm sure Miranda ( Anna Wintour ) didn't blink an eye when Lauren W. quit her job - she couldn't care less about anyone who doesn't worship her.I suggest if you enjoyed the film to read 3/4 of the book. Then fill in the ending with the movie ending."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was excited to see that this book had finally been released on paperback so I picked it up immediately. However, it was very disappointing. The book is a 400-page rant from a selfish, boring character that we've seen millions of times before (think blonde, blue eyed, naive, small-town girl..) The author writes as though she is an expert in her field dishing the dirt - meanwhile the info in this book is common knowledge and there are even some things I find incorrect. Also, it is not particularly well-written or articulate. The author tends to go into such detail about daily trips to Starbucks but briefly mulls over entire months of the protagonist's life.It may be a cute read for younger women or those who are really curious about the fashion industry."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I must say that this book was a VERY easy and QUICK read...it is easy to get entrapped in Andrea's world and be eager to find out what exactly Miranda will make her do next without even noticing you have read 50 or more pages. However, I was VERY disappointed by the ending-all the things that made the book interesting and kept me turning the pages were suddenly just dropped and never mentioned again...in an exceptionally substandard ending."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The reason I picked up this book is because I, myself, am tired of the conspicuous consumption that is taking over the fashion industry and the wardrobes of my peers. I picked it up because I was curious to read someone else's commentary on the entire fashion industry, expecting a sarcastic narrative by someone who was a little more in the niche than I was, but just as sadistic.This presumption was exactly what I received. I identified with the author on several levels including my ever present need to create a career for myself and present an image that somehow shows everyone who examines my outfit how capable I am. Andrea, the main character, deals with everything that I too am going through as a recent graduate of college. The author picks up, rather astutely may i am, on the emotions she goes through.I tend to be a rather critical reader starting books and getting bored and putting them down but this book was not like that. It impressed me and kept me interested up until the very last page.I wouldn't say it is my favorite book, but it was amusing and insightful for what it was."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this book was great! The author, Lauren Weisberger has great character descriptions...and really portrays the &quot;Boss from Hell&quot; that most of us can find a little something we can relate to. Andrea, a fresh out of college 20 something- is trendy, witty and subjected to a cruel stint working as an Assistant to a big Fashion Editor, Miranda Priestley- who is demanding, picky and snotty.The book had me from the first page...and continued to entertain me with Andrea's adventures and Miranda's outrageous requests.:) Definitely a great summer read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought I would really love this book - the first five or so chapters really caught my attention and then I kept putting this book down and coming back to it. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun, mindless book for an entertaining read, however, it probably could have been about 100 pages shorter. It's a great book if you are travelling or laying on the beach."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Very light and humorous read...even though at times you can actually feel Andrea's pain and exhaustion. I would recommend this book for a fun vacation or beach read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm giving this four stars, after reading a lot of the bad reviews. Is this great literature? No. Will it be out of date in a few years? Yes. Is it fun to read? Yes. It's lightweight fluff, undoubtedly, along the lines of Shopaholic, Bridget Jones and High Maintenance, but sometimes that's just what I need. What did people expect? The Forsyte Saga? Anna Karenina? I think it was probably very realistic, and by the way, it does a good job of showing how much time and money goes into trivial nonsense in this world; shopping, fashion, Martha Stewart living. At least Andrea does a reality check once in awhile--a $40,000 dress? The annual income for a family of four? Face it, it's not a highly intellectual, constructive or creative world we're living in. People with the means to really accomplish something can't be bothered. Miranda thinks the Met is a place to entertain out of towners at a dinner party. Anyway, I thought the book was a funny look at the artificial worlds that have been created. I dont agree that this was bad writing, for a first novel. Ms. Weisberger was obviously writing what she knew. I was grateful to have her during a nightmare layover in the Chicago airport this week."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a really stupid book. I bought it after thinking about what I wanted to read this summer (I always make lists of books I want to read over the summer before it begins). I decided it might be fun in get into more chick-lit(ish) type of books, because they are charectorized as being light, fun and airy, and sounded like perfect summer reads. This would be the first of its kind I would read. I would be dissapointed. I, like the many other people who read this book,was snagged by the tite and idea that we'd find out what it was like to be behind the scenes of a chic,top-selling fashion magazine. What I got was a array of complaints and an EXTREMEly annoying charector. The narrator Andrea is soppoused to be smart and sarcastically witty, but I just found her annoying. The errands her boss sends her on are not as over-the-top as the book jacket suggests. She has to get her coffe, drop off some clothes, and call a few people. Now, im not saying that I wouldint mind having to do these same things day after day, but it's really not enough to complain in a whole BOOK about. Also, this book is just plain CORNY at times. Esp. when her boy-freind Alex is involved. I must admit that I couldin't read the whole book; not only because it was so boring, but also because I litterally had an allegric reaction to the pages it was printed on, so I don't know if im fully qualified to review this book. I only got to chapter 11, but from what I read, I wouldin't reccomend this book. I WOULD reccomend &quot;The Nannie Diaries&quot;, which is somewhat similar in the way it's about working for the rich, but is MUCH better. I just finished it tonight, and was very happy with it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Think you have a horrible boss? Try working for Miranda Priestly who is the infamous owner of Runway Magazine. She is always constantly ordering her assistants around to do what seem to be useless tasks. For Andrea Sachs, her brand new job working at Runway will be her first class ticket to a great writing position at the Prestigious New Yorker. Or, at least she hopes so. Upon being hired for the job Andrea is told, &quot; This job is glamorous and a million girls would die to do it.&quot; (Page 18) Andrea soon finds out that this is far from the truth.Overall, I enjoyed this novel. I think Lauren Weisenberger the author of this novel, did a great job creating a visual of the fashion world through words. She also did a good job of developing her characters. For example Miranda Priestly. Throughout the entire novel you as the reader will love to hate this character. &quot;You think there aren't a million girls who want your job and who understand couture just as well as you?&quot; &quot;She took a step back, slowly moved her eyes up and down each of their bodies, lingering just long enough to make each feel fat, ugly, and inappropriately clad, and commanded them all to return to their desks.&quot; (Page 249) Lauren also does well with creating tension between Andrea and Miranda. It's almost as if you can feel Andrea's frustration towards her irritating boss.However, one weak aspect of this novel would have to be the plot. At the beginning of the novel, it seems cute and quite comical. As the book progresses, there doesn't seem to be much variety in the plot. The problem of Andrea and her co-workers constantly messing up and Miranda reprimanding them, happens over and over. It gets to be very redundant.Another thing that became annoying throughout this novel would be that Andrea would never stand up for herself. It was also frustrating that Andrea constantly complained about her job, but would never do anything about it. &quot; I think I got pretty lucky. Who else gets to drive around in a chauffeured car on their first day? I mean, so yeah I think I'm ready.&quot; &quot;Jill rolled her eyes and shot me a look as if to say Cut the crap Andy: We all know you're probably working for a psycho surrounded by anorexic fashionistas and are trying to paint this really rosy picture because you're worried you're in over your head.&quot; (Page 74)However despite these downfalls, if you are interested in the world of fashion, and can relate to a horrible, annoying, rude boss, then The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisenberger will definitely be an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I picked up this book to read for a book club, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was immediately drawn into the fast-paced plot. The journalist in me reveled at the workings of a fashion magazine, reminding me why I got out of the business. :-p I saw a lot of myself in Andrea, the main character, a never-failing people pleaser determined to stick out the job from hell. A quick and engaging read, I couldn't put it down and immediately passed it on to a friend. Super summer (or anytime!) reading. :-)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm also talking about the audio version of the Devil Wears Prada which makes the story come alive. It's entertaining and welcomes the reader into the inside world of fashion.Light and funny. And if you like the movie, I suggest reading the novel and get to know more about the characters."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this book was a fun read. It's not the kind of book that will change anyone's life, but if you're in the mood for something light that doesn't require a lot of thought, this more than fits the bill. It's so very different from the movie, though. Other than the names of some of the characters and a handful of basic plot points, they might as well be different stories. It drags in a few places, but for the most part it's good mind candy."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a great pool-side read. It's fun and trendy and easy to pick up and put down. Much of it is intentionally superficial, but it has a nice message in the end. Ms. Weisberger also has a nice gift for turning phrases and seems to have sharp insights into the minds and challenges of young professionals who want it all."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was an excellent and enjoyable read. It flowed smoothly and was an unchallenging, pleasant and humourous read. I read it and then watched the movie. My advice would be to read the book and not bother with the novie; it has been seriously dumbed down for the sake of giving Meryl Streep more lines. The movie also loses much of the integrity displayed in the book which is quite thought-provoking on the subject of human behaviour in many areas, despite being light and airy in its approach. It does make you marvel at how materialistic and detached from reality some high-flying business persons really are. I felt happy to be ordinary when I had read it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"You probably already know this, because the movie is out, but Andy, ink still wet on her Journalism degree, gets hired on as an assistant to the most famous fashion magazine editor in the world, Miranda Priestly of Runway. The author really was an assistant to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintours, so scandal abounds because what if it's true? Anyway, Andy transitions into New York life, wearing coutoure, groveling to all of the super weird and annoying requests of Priestly, and is hilarious while doing it. I laughed a lot at her snarky remarks and hilarious observations. It's not going to change your life, but it's a good read, and it's so fun to watch a movie after you read the book, or vice versa. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"And believe me, this happens in more fields than one thinks. Secretaries and support staff are typically treated in a way that's \\"less than\\" simply because the expectation is there to do so."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you've seen the movie of the same name, you might be a little surprised by this book. The character of Andrea has much more sass in the novel than Anne Hathaway's character exhibits in the film. Still, I found both about equally enjoyable. Here, Andrea provides sarcastic commentary on virtually everything that her nightmare boss does and says. In many ways, Andrea is just as tough as Miranda. If you've ever thought you landed your dream job only to realize it was a nightmare, you'll enjoy this book. It's a quick, easy read that'll leave you laughing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a very amusing book, some parts true, others to be read with tongue in cheek.It does have a message, which I liked: no matter what your path might be, sometimes you have to take a longer road, which might not be the most pleasant one. But at the end you will get closer to your dreams."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Absolutely loved \\"Ah-dreah's\\" sense of humor. Her mental tirades are just hilarious. Excellent description of the world of high-fashion. It's definitely a world that is alien to most of us. I was a little disappointed with the ending though. It seems a little too abrupt considering all the rage that a reader would likely build up against this crazy woman. Still, it was much better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" written by Lauren Weisberger was an exciting novel, of which I just couldn't put down. One reason I found this novel so enthralling was because it was a semi-true piece of literature. Since the novel was based on Weisberger's own experience with an internship at \\"Vogue Magazine\\" this novel interest me and caught my attention.Over this summer \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was made into a major motion picture starring Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. This is yet another reason I was so anxious to read this novel. In the novel I loved how every single thing that Andrea(the main character) did was so drawn out and painted such a picture in my mind. While reading this novel, I was always sitting at the edge of my seat waiting to see what crazy thing Miranda Priestly (Andreas boss) or Emily (Andreas co-worker) would make her do next. I loved how Andrea was always complaining about her job, this made the story humourous. I also loved how determined Andrea was to work at the New Yorker that she put up with all Miranda's petty little problems.All of Miranda's problems were never solved by Miranda, they we always solved by Andrea and the rest of the world that had wanted anything to do with fashion. I found this funny that everyone in the fashion industry was kissing up to her like there was no tomorrow. Andrea always had the biggest attitude with Miranda and it was just hilarious. Andrea had so many problems with her best friend Lily and her boyfriend Alex, it gave the story some more decent everyday drama.This novel would have not been the same if all the characters weren't in it. Since the novel takes place at a fashion magazine, you have to have the stereotypical [...] fashion guy, the skinny size 00 girls that look at you weird if you eat a cup of soup, and even the people on the streets that Andrea would spend \\"Runways\\" money on buying them Starbucks.As a result to reading this novel, I did not go and see the movie. Which is pretty funny considering I only wanted to read it because I wanted to see the movie, but I figured it would just ruin the excitement that the book brings to it. My copy of the book was published by Anchor Books in 2003."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have been in constant anticipation since I heard about this novel a year ago. So needless-to-say I was psyched when summer rolled around and I was able to pick it up and devour it.The book began well but that's it. 100 pages in I was still waiting for character development and a tangible plot. The entire book was one huge rant about how bitchy Andrea's boss was. I felt like saying, &quot;OK, we know this - now please move on.&quot;Unfortunately, the scenes (and demands from the boss) were unbelievable (even by chick-lit standards).However, it was funny (maybe because the bitchy demands from the boss were sooo over the top). It is something to read if you have nothing else to read, but this book does not live up to it's NYTimes Best Seller List push.This book should not be compared to Nanny Diaries. I've read Nanny and I loved it ten times more than Prada."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I heard this book was really good, so when it came out in paperback, I bought it. It is a funny book, but the ending was anticlimactic. And ultimately, I could not relate to main character. I could relate to how Andrea feels as a 23 year old right out of college because I had some crazy bosses like Miranda. But since I've been working as an assistant for years, I could relate more to Emily and Miranda. By the end of the book, I thought Andrea was a spoiled brat with a bad attitude and bad manners and could learn a lot from her managers about professionalism. How lucky that her parents will let her take a year to &quot;find herself&quot; in Europe and Asia. How lucky that her parents only &quot;want her to be happy&quot; and will let her quit her job and move back home. I didn't have that option, so I learned to deal with frustration, learned to be patient, and learned how to gain my managers' trust and respect. If you roll your eyes or make a face every time your boss asks you to do something inane, they're not going to give you the more interesting work. They can't trust you to give your full attention and seriousness the more important work warrants. And why doesn't she just take the high road for the sake of her own pride? Anyways, the book is a quick, easy read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a book for the beach. But I would never hire Andrea Sachs as my assistant."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"For the most part I found reading the book enjoyable and found this &quot;other&quot; world fascinating - although the Miranda stuff tends to get on your nerves. The geat disappointment came at the end - there's such a build up throughout the book, but it just drops the ball at the end, very disappointing. I hesitate to tell anyone to read this book - because of the frustrating ending."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love this book and have recommended it to all my friends. It's smart, sassy, funny - all the things you look for in a light summer read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Like many others, I picked up this book hoping that it would be as enjoyable of a read as &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; ... and I wasn't too disappointed.While the characters of this book are a little less developed than in &quot;Nanny Diaries,&quot; like Nan, the main character, Andrea, finds herself having to do many insane tasks for her unpredictable, completely arrogant and insensitive boss. Although this scenario provides for many outrageous situations, it also gets slightly old by about two-thirds of the way through the book.The subplots were also less than perfect. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend was a story we've seen before. Despite the fact that the author was trying to get across the point that Andrea was losing her relationship with her best friend, her boyfriend, and her family, I would have to say that these subplots were a bit annoying since I don't think that it's necessary that one person be responsible for the health and well-being of her best friend, nor should her boyfriend and family be so disrespectful of her job. The point that the author was trying to convey got across, but the subplots could have been more interesting.Some loose ends were never tied up at the end: what happened to pretty-boy Christian? Or even Andrea's relationship with Alex? The book ended on a fairly open-ended tone, no solid conclusion. It also never got back to the opening events of the first chapter. The end was okay, but it was almost as if the author ran out of ideas of what to do with everyone.One more gripe... I didn't realize that Weisberger had worked for Vogue editor Anna Wintour when I first bought the book. (I found out when I was about halfway through reading it.) Despite the fact that this claims to be a work of fiction, I still couldn't help but wonder how much Andrea's boss is like Wintour. I'm not too crazy about the idea of writing about one's ex-boss... even if the person was inspired by their experience and not necessarily writing exactly what happened... no matter how horrible the boss was. I could be wrong, but it almost seems like she was trying to get back at her ex-boss and did it in a gossipy way, although I suppose that's why a lot of people have read this book.Despite these few small complaints, for the most part, this was an enjoyable read. I wish I hadn't finished it so soon so I could enjoy it a bit longer, which I suppose means it was a fairly good book! Overall I'm giving it four stars for entertainment value. It was light reading and perfect for a summer reading list."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'd give it more 2.5 stars....Andrea Sachs is fresh out of college and lands a &quot;dream job&quot; at RUNWAY magazine. The usual boss from hell story should follow....but Andrea's whiney, self important, do-gooder attitude had me disliking HER more than her boss, Miranda Priestly. I agree with others who bemoan the lack of beginning or end. Characters just disappear, and loose ends are left untied. This is an okay 'beach read', but I would borrow a copy or check out the library first."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If nothing else, this book will make your own awful job look a whole lot better. What made the book funny was the fact that these characters were based on real people. It's hard to imagine someone so crazy could really rise to the post of editor in chief of an internationally known magazine. This is not great literature by any stretch but it is entertaining and full of crazy, funny people and situations. I thought I had the job from hell in a prior life but this poor girl truly had the worst job on earth. I think this job will appeal to all fashionistas and wannabee's as well as anyone who is now or ever has been an administrative assistant. Your own psycho boss will seem a lot more sane after you read this book. Oh and just for the record, I cracked up when I opened the June issue of Vogue magazine and saw that the editor in chief's favorite place to vacation was Oscar de la Renta's home in the Dominican Republic and included a picture of a skirt she wore for dinner. Hmmmmmmmm."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this book was a fun read, very entertaining. It's a great beach book--doesn't require a lot of concentration or deep thought. It is very similar to The Nanny Diaries in tone--that sort of put upon I'm-above-all-this tone, but witty. It worked better in The Nanny Diaries because you could tell the main character really cared about Grayer, the child she was taking care of, whereas Andrea clearly doesn't give a hoot about fashion (really, why would you?) or anyone she works with, either. It made me really, really glad that I do not work in fashion. Everything is wrapped up a bit too neatly at the end, but it definitely holds your attention."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Written in a deliciously racy style that is supremely witty and tongue-in-cheek \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is trendy, sassy and gossipy. Through her refreshingly breathless and feisty narration, Weisberger provides the ultimate behind-the-scenes-look at the world of fashion journalism.The amazing action-packed and ordeal-filled odyssey begins when 23-year-old Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl, fresh out of college, drops off her r&eacute;sum&eacute; at one of the most famed addresses in high-fashion publication - the stately Elias-Clarke building, Madison Avenue, New York City - without expecting even so much as a callback!To her huge, huge surprise, she gets hired to be the assistant to the planet's most fashionable fashion editor - Miranda Priestly - in the world's most prestigious fashion magazine.The book takes the reader up-close to the epicenter of haute-couture where the most dazzling soirees, suave gay hair colorists, $10,000 designer handbags, Prada shoes, mink furs (and the list is never ending, of course), blend into an intoxicating m&eacute;lange. But it is also a reminder that all that glitters is not gold.From the day she sets foot on the dripping-with-Versace-and-Dior sovereign soil of the Runway magazine, Andrea never has a turmoil-free, trouble-free and fear-free moment in her life. Through a narration which is at all times feisty, and which at some of the times, even has sardonic humor, she describes what it's like to work for the bitchiest boss ever.The icy-cold, ceaselessly condescending and ruthlessly demanding Priestly treats her army of employees like slaves, with the utmost feudal attitude not seen since the days of the Greek City States. With just a steely look and a clipped, British-accent, she has metamorphosed many a full-fledged editors into mere minions, all at her beck and call. Andrea is no exception. Her highly sought-after job is in fact, a living nightmare, a travesty of a job!What makes this book so unique is that it gives a decidedly mundane theme - employer-employee interaction at the workplace - such an exciting twist."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren/Andrea seems to have great contempt for the magazine she works for, the people she works with, and the fashion industry herself (\\"why do I care?\\" is asked often in this book), but she seems perfectly happy to wear/adopt the designer clothes and shoes that are given to her, and, for someone who doesn't care about fashion, she introduces all new characters (even the doorman) by what they're wearing. On top of this, she is ungrateful for her position (who takes that many personal calls?) and doesn't have the insight to understand why she should care: her boss, Anna Wintour/Miranda Priestly, is one of the most important and influential businesswomen in the world today-how can that escape the narrator? If Andrea were really an aspiring writer she would be taking the networking opportunities much more seriously: she completely misses an opportunity with Christian's editor, for example. And the ending is indeed a letdown-the Nanny Diaries did a much better job of vindication."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Both &quot;The Devil Wears Parada&quot; and &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; draw on our fascination with the lifesstyles of the rich (and sometimes famous) of Manhattan.Nan (of the &quot;Diaries&quot;) and Andrea (of the &quot;Prada&quot;) are more or less the same character - early 20's, college educated, middle class girls. But Nan acts her age, and is able to show empathy and sympathy when needed, even if the lifestyle and people involved are unfimiliar and disagreeable to her. Andrea, on the other hand, is the ever - suffering spoiled and whiny brat. Her boss is just w-a-y too demanding because when Andrea goes out on an errand, she is expected to be back on time, and not waste time talking on her cell phone or smoking (no matter how silly Andrea finds the errand to be). Ignoring the office dress code is also a good thing, because obviously - being into fashion is an unforgivable sin. Anyone who actually plays by the rules - i.e. dresses properly, respects the boss, has any ambitions in the field of fashion, etc. - just has to be a mindless drone who just begs to be looked down on by our &quot;tragic&quot; heroine. While there were many situations where Miranda Priestly's demands were over the top, Andrea's rotten attitude towards everything (including many legitimate situations) just takes the edge off the outrageous parts.The ending is equally outrageous. Having had to travel overseas for business, friends &amp; family understood my responsibility towards my workplace. Just like Andrea can't understand what points really are over the top, and which are just normal demands of a workplace, her family and friends can't seem to respect the responsibilities of her job (after all, it's just fashion, right? Nothing important!), so they feel they must demand her early return from her trip.While I'm not into fashion myself, I didn't enjoy the &quot;fashion is useless therefore anyone who takes this seriously must be a moron&quot; attitude of the book. Please read the &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"...is the fact that Lauren Weisberger perpetuates some openly racist stereotypes in the book. Was anyone else offended by her portrayal of the two Indian girl roommates, who sleep in twin bunk beds, have no personalities or lives to speak of, and (I can't believe she actually says this!) smell like curry? Weisberger, who considers herself to be too intellectual to care about fashion, even makes fun of their business suits. WTF?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"how fast must this book have been pushed through editing? sweet fancy moses. there's an interesting story to be told here, but it's all told so woodenly that i can't imagine anyone getting very excited over it. i'm in publishing, so of course i was curious about the book; but it only takes about 3 hours to read. for this kind of &quot;inside scoop,&quot; the nanny diaries was really much better.it didn't make sense that the heroine was supposed to be so &quot;fashion clueless&quot; and yet was able to name-drop (Bungalow 8, Nobu) right from the get-go. how did she get this job again? for pete's sake, even i know how to pronouce Givenchy, and i'm from Cleveland.the non-&quot;Runway&quot; stuff was so incidental to the story that i mostly skimmed over it. i think this book would be fine on the plane or the beach, but otherwise...not memorable."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Though this book arguably has some meaty content, Andrea's character does not get developed enough for readers to care very much about what happens to her. From the very outset, she seems flat and uninteresting, much like the loafers she cluelessly wears her first day on the job. The only real jewel in this novel is the \\"Devil\\" herself. Miranda's outrageous character and her equally outlandish antics are the glue that holds this messily written book together, and once Andrea storms out of her bitchy boss's life, the novel no longer interests or stirs or even seems worth continuing. A nice effort, and a certainly phenomenal level of success for a first-time writer of questionable talent... however, Weisberger would do herself a favor by honing her writing skills a little bit and coming up with original material next time, rather than a nasty tell-all gossip-fest about the very visible fashionista we all know this book is REALLY about."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago. There are a lot of people writing that this book is somewhat unbelievable and ridiculous scenarios but you truly have to be in the situation to understand that these type of things DO happen. I worked at company where there is someone exactly like the character of Miranda. Many of the assistants in my company had read the book. This person is so much like the character of Miranda that we would always use Miranda as a code name whenever we would speak about her in either our conversations or instant messages. The book is RIGHT ON. Good for all of you who never have to experience this type of boss. Especially the part in the book where Miranda comes in and throws her coat on the assistants desk. The woman at my job used to do EXACTLY that - coat, box, anything she didn't care what you were in the middle of working on. Beleive it or not people, some people are just THAT rude. Great Book! Can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked this book and found it fast and enjoyable to read. But at the end of the day it doesn't really add up to a lot. Andrea Sachs, an aspiring magazine writer, lands a job as personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high profile editor of &quot;Runway&quot; magazine. Andrea quickly finds that the job involves numerous mundane and tedious chores, long hours, incessant demands and enormous personal sacrifices. The fact that author Lauren Weisberger wrote this book after working as Personal Assistant to Anna Wintour from Vogue adds a lot of credibility to the environment and story.One of the flaws with this book is that the job really does sound like it would be glamorous and (at least sometimes) fun. Although Miranda does come across as being the Boss From Hell, you still feel that Andrea is just a whinging and ungrateful employee, who performs her job with little grace. I'm a stay at home Mom, and all I can say is that if it's too much to deal with someone who refuses to eat the food you've bought for them, changes their mind irrationally and makes petulant demands of you, then Lauren Weisberger should never have children! At least Andrea got to dress in designer clothes, attend Parisian fashion shows and go home at the end of the day.The other problem with this book is that you never really care about Andrea. In the end she has to make a decision between a job that she hates and a boyfriend and best friend whom I had come to dislike intensely. It wasn't a dilemma that invoked much sympathy from me.I did enjoy reading this book, but I suspect that I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My wife and I read this book to each other, and I have to admit that it was a page-turner. It was never difficult to decide to turn to the book, and it was easy to get through. Nevertheless, the book left me disappointed.In the book, recent college graduate Andrea dreams of a job in the New Yorker, and decides to get a foot in the door by getting a job in magazine publishing. After dropping her resume all over, she is interviewed and hired to be an assistant to the editor-in-chief of a fashion magazine. The job is hard work, her boss demands the impossible, gives orders that are often unintelligible, or at least inexplicable, and Andrea works long hours.I know what you must be thinking, gee, sounds like the rest of us. Of course, as an assistant to a fashion magazine editor, Andrea also has access to a seemingly limitless supply of free clothes and accessories. Plus, it seems that her boss really will be able to get her closer to her dream job. Now it seems that her job is really better than everybody else's job.But Andrea's boss is truly inhuman to her, in a way similar to Nanny's boss in the Nanny Diaries. It is interesting, in a guilty sort of way, to read what her boss will do to Andrea next. But unlike in the Nanny Diaries, Andrea's boss's actions will not affect an innocent child. Also, Andrea is a much less sympathetic and multi-dimensional character than Nanny is.To sum up my conflicted feelings about this book, you probably will have a fun time reading this book, but at the end, you will not feel much for Andrea and might wish that the author had written the book with a bit more care and thought."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think other reviewers who didn't like this book have already pretty much summed up my viewpoint, so I won't get into many specifics.What bothered me most about this book, though, was the fact that the protagonist (Andrea Sachs) kept describing herself as physically inadequate and or unattractive (and yet she describes herself as 5'10\\" and 120 lbs, size 5, and other characters comment positively on her appearance). This gave me the impression that the protagonist was going into that whole \\"fishing for compliments\\" thing that shallow people sometimes do, when they know perfectly well that there's nothing wrong with them but they just have to get attention and positive affirmation whenever they can to make themselves feel worthwhile as a human being.For a character who wants to write for the New Yorker, Sachs does nothing in this long book to convince anyone why she deserves a job as a writer. She does, however, plenty of things to convince the reader that she deserves to work for \\"Runway\\" because she's so superficial and overly image-conscious.Another thing that jarred me as inaccurate (one of many minor things that added up to an unsatisfying whole) was her description of the model Gisele Bundschen as \\"short.\\"Last time I checked, Gisele is 5'11\\" which makes her much taller than average. The only way Andrea Sachs could consider such a woman \\"short\\" is if she is floating so high on her sense of condescencion and superiority that she can't help but look down on everyone. This is one of the few actually believably things in this ridiculous book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Please....who would have ever put up with the kind of abuse that Andy did! I kept waiting for her to grow a backbone and stand up to this Devil! She kept repeating that she was willing to take the abuse all for an alleged referral in publishing but then meets Christian, the already-published wonder boy of the literary world, and doesn't ask him for advice or any connections. Andy was at the beck and call of this crazy woman night and day and didn't think Christian might be a way out??? Her sister has a baby, her boyfriend plans a perfect romantic getaway and her best friend is in the hospital but still Andy won't leave her job....all because of a possible referral at the end of working for the Devil for one year. When Andy finally does stand up to her it's so quickly and anti-climatically done that you almost miss it. I waited through this book page after page waiting for the ending climax which was a huge letdown. I wanted more of a confrontation with the Devil or at least some small sort of revenge."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After all the hype about this book and its impending movie, I finally picked it up. I was so disappointed. The prose is way too stilted, heavy and lifeless for such a light-hearted topic. It should have been a breezy, funny and fun read. Yet, the only humor was in the acknowledgements page.Instead, this book reads like an annoying \\"get it off my chest\\" letter that should have been squirreled away in a drawer or read to a therapist. Or, perhaps, kept as notes for a better novel. It's just so angry, which is so far from entertaining.Bear in mind, I'm no Anna Wintour fan, upon whom the editor of this book is allegedly based. But in the book, the author, who writes about her real-life experience working for said editor, comes off as a whiny, ungrateful and inexperienced recent college grad who mistakenly believes that all bosses are nice--especially when you're on the bottom rung of the ladder of a highly competitive field. She reminds me of my right-out-of-college sister-in-law who landed a plum job with the biggest celebrity pr guru in the U.S. She also spent her days whining and complaining about her boss rather than deciding to suck it up for a year and use the experience to launch a successful career.Just as with my sister-in-law, I hate to break it to this author, but most people have difficult and demanding bosses, especially right out of college. It's the price you sometimes have to pay for gaining valuable experience in your field. And, let's face it, the opportunity given to this author was pretty priceless, considering she didn't have any other qualifications for her budding magazine writing career.If only the author had more fun with the topic. But the lack of humor and her residual anger makes me not even interested in the dishy gossip about the world's most famous fashion editor. At least in Bridget Jones Diary, which is the same genre of woman-overcoming-difficult-situations scenario, the heroine was likeable and vulnerable and self-effacing and funny. You don't even end up rooting for the main character/author here. Instead, I was hoping the Miranda character (the thinly-veiled Anna Wintour) demanded even more from her.This book will, however, be an interesting read to fashionistas or those who think they're mentioned in this book.For better dishy books on real-life experiences that are super-fun to read, I recommend The Nanny Diaries and The Ivy Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed this book. At times it was slow, but overall an enjoyable read. Look forward to seeing the movie and how close it follows the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am a male ex-New Yorker and my girlfriend (a Florida native) suggested this book.I did laugh at the New York jokes and enjoyed the pot-shots at the phonies in the fashion business.It wasn't great writing, but certainly entertaining...SPOILER:I am still curious if AN-DRE-AH didn't get a little anonymous help at the end."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Recent college grad, Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs has wanted to be a writer for the illustrious NEW YORKER ever since she could remember. And, being a lover of all things words - including the childish Scrabble - she thinks that she has a chance to make it to the Big Apple's namesake. However, when she emerges a fresh graduate from Brown, she realizes that nothing is going to just fall into her lap, and she sure as heck isn't going to be offered a job at THE NEW YORKER. At least not anytime soon. So she takes the first available position she's offered - working as tres chic RUNWAY editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly's, junior assistant. Andy believes that, after a year as Miranda's personal assistant, she'll be offered the job of her dreams, and can kiss slave work behind. However, being Miranda's assistant is much more complicated than she ever imagined. Sure, she's doing small, mundane things such as fetching over-priced coffee from the local Starbuck's, and scheduling facials for the demanding diva; but she's also being forced to do not-so-natural things, such as find a restaurant review in one of the daily newspapers with no trace of evidence as to where it appeared, or when. Sure, Andy may be the \\"lowest paid but most highly perked assistant in the free world,\\" but her cooperation is leaving her tearing out her hair in frustration, and destroying all traces of the dignity that she has developed over the years. Not to mention ruining every relationship she has - be it with her family, best friend, or boyfriend. Now Andy must make the ultimate sacrifice - decide whether she should stick it out, or dropkick Miranda Priestly into a pile of next-season's Prada handbags.I guess it was the fact that Anne Hathaway will be playing the lead character in the major motion picture of this novel that intrigued me enough to pick it up and give it a go. While I am certainly not the fashion maven that the Devil - Miranda Priestly - is, I have certainly found that the fashion world is much more...killer than I originally thought it. Andy is a fun, whiny yet realistic character whose anti-fashion-someone-save-me self is relatable and enjoyable from the first page to the last. While Weisberger's portrayals of the various snooty fashion magazine characters are well thought out, and described, leaving nothing for the reader to do but laugh out loud at their ridiculous, sometimes demeaning antics. Weisberger has struck gold with THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA creating a gossipy novel about the fashion world that will make your jaw drop. No outfit is complete without a copy of this book.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm almost ashamed of myself, given the bad reviews posted here, but I enjoyed this book. Perhaps I can identify because I've worked for a real nut--no matter what I did, I simply COULD NOT please this woman, although I must admit she was no Miranda Priestly. Could Anna Win--umm, the person upon this was supposedly based, really be that bad? If so, how is she still in the business? Anyway, while the book certainly isn't great literature, it is a decent beach read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although, light and entertaining, this book, like its characters, have no substance. Core questions brought up by the book are never vetted out. For example, why should someone like Miranda, the evil boss, be given so much power? People only have power over you if you let them. It is not clear why so many people caved in to her. Why doesn't Miranda have anyone close enough to her who can tell her she is over the top? The author hints at Miranda's sadness or loneliness, but needed to explore this further. Instead, Miranda, who could have been a complex, tragic hero with the potential to have a life-changing experience that would haved truly moved the reader, is a one-dimensional stereotype.The author does a fair job at showing the excesses of fashion: the eating disorders and the outrageous price tags, but the fashion world is foreign to everyone but the jet set. I found my self having little or no connection with these characters and no empathy for their situations. I kept asking myself, \\"Who would be stupid enough to spend that much on women's clothing?\\"The repetitiveness of the story became annoying. Everytime I encounter the phrase \\"the job a million girls would die for\\" I wanted to scream. The many anecdotes of how horrible her boss was, while entertaining, kept the story from progressing. The plot was predictable and the ending trite. Also the option of quitting cames up much too late in the book. The main character's inability to consider this sooner makes her unbelievable. The dielectic of career versus one's health and well-being is only skimmed over.This book is fluff, but it could have been much better using the triviality and superficiality of the world of fashion to address more profound questions of power, loneliness, and the personal angst of making career decisions."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I could have cared less about the wants, needs, and desires of a fashion magazine editor who is so vain, shallow, and self centered that I could vomit. I felt nothing but pity for poor Andrea - the main character and my stomach would clinch up in anxiety with every absurd and ridiculous task that was put before her. This is not a relaxing, funny, good read. The whole time I was reading it all I could think was \\"Is this really worth it?\\" Surely Andrea could have found a different way of achieving her goal to work for \\"The New Yorker\\"! This was far too much like \\"The Nanny Diaries: A Novel\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It is becoming painful. The title seems interesting, but the detailed writing about fashion is really a torture, no plot, just descriptions after descriptions about shallow peoples (anorexic models). I regret the purchase of this book, I am trying to make my wasted money valuable, but the reading is becoming a torture."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have a sneaking suspicion that readers who didn't like this book never had a boss that came close to Miranda. Trust me, they're out there. There must be a cosmic law that says that spectacularly brilliant people are completely lacking in common sense and simple human decency. I ROARED when Miranda called her assistants in Manhattan so *they* could find her chauffeur...in Paris...a few yards away from Miranda!So 'The Devil Wears Prada' isn't great literature. It's funny, and I liked it. And I don't care a whit for fashion."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am so eternally grateful that I do not have a job like Andrea Sachs in this book. All that hours catering to a fashion editor's job and having to hear &quot;Millions of girls would die to have a job just like yours!&quot; 24/7 ~~ no thanks! I'll pass up on the Guccis and Pradas and meeting celebrities at parties and everything that passes for entertainment in the fashion world.Ok, I know this book isn't the classic novel that people seem to be expecting ~~ I expected it to be an entertaining and fun read and Weisberger didn't disappoint me here! Full of witty remarks (and catty ones to!) and heavy on the sarcasm, I really enjoyed reading this book about Andrea Sachs who got hired just out of college to work at Runway, one of the fashion world's premier magazines. And not only was she hired there, she was also hired to work for Miranda Priestly, the fashion world's &quot;it&quot; woman, who is the fashion editor of Runway. Andrea heard that if she survived one year at that grueling indentureship, Miranda will see to it that she will get any job that she wants. Any job and there is nothing more that Andrea wants in the world other than to work for The New Yorker. So Andrea agreed to work for her for a year. Little did she know what that year entailed.Andrea was literally on call 24/7 as her boss' junior assistant. She was ordered to fetch coffee, newspapers and magazines every day like a latch-key. She had to field requests from everyone that wants to meet with Miranda. And she also has to anticipate every demand that Miranda might have ~~ as well as sorting through her dirty clothes to ready for dry-cleaning. Trying to keep her sense of humor, and trying to keep her relationships with her family, boyfriend and best friend ~~ Andrea begins to wonder if this is worth all the aggravation.It is, like I mentioned, a highly entertaining read. It's actually nicer to read about someone else's problems with their boss. Weisenberger does it with grace and humor. This is one of the funnest reads I've had this fall. If you're not expecting it to be a serious tome on the fashion world, this book is for you.9-28-03"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After reading so many negative reviews, I bought the book anyway.

Yep.While her friends were either dragging their asses every morning to look for jobs or to work at some boring jobs, she landed a job with a fashion magazine called Runway, a place where girls walk around in high heels and designer clothes all day and everyone is size-zero. Andrea was the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the top executive of the hottest fashion magazine. After Andrea realized that Miranda is the true devil that wears Prada, she turned totally neurotic and went on and on about how she was ill-treated.She desperately distinguishes herself from the crowd of twiggy, starvation-wracked, obnoxious and name-brand-worshipping girls that she encounters at work so much that her sarcasm and her criticism almost becomes an annoyance in the book. Admit it - every girl is a little devil when it comes to glamour. No one is perfect. Not even an angel can avoid the sweet temptation of superficiality.So Andrea Sachs, what is your problem?Is it so bad that your boss tells you NOT to wear those less fashionable Ann Taylor loafers to the office and gives you a pair of expensive designer stilettos? I don't think so.Is it so bad that your boss tells you to get her coffee every morning, and you CAN use her name to jump to the front of the line? I don't think so.Is it so bad that the hottest hairstylist tells you that you can call him anytime for a hair treatment and that the most popular agent gives you his card and tells you that he is eager to read your writing? I don't think soIs it so bad that you have to get up 5:30am in the morning to go to work while riding the company's Town Car that can be reached within 5 minutes of a call? I don't think so.Is it so bad that you can use your boss's name to make VIP reservations for yourself at Manhattan trendiest night clubs and restaurants? I don't' think so.Is it so bad that you have to change your entire wardrobe to Prada, Chanel, Versace, Gucci and etc without spilling a penny from your wallet? I don't think so.So, Andrea Sachs, what are you whining about?Don't be so uptight and pretentious. Nobody is completely void of superficiality, so I don't believe a word when you say you do not enjoy your life doing what you do. It is a job that millions of girls would die for, after your book and whining, it is still a job that millions of girls would die for.So step aside. Let someone else wear the Prada, you can go back to your Old Navy gears now.Oh by the way, I have one word to describe the Lauren Weisberger's writing: blah, absolutely blah.

I now feel very silly in paying money for this terrible story. It seems like the kind of long-winded narrative some junior high or high school student would write, and the teacher would hand it back with the grade \\"C\\" written on it in red ink, with the comment that it is about two hundred pages longer than it needs to be. No real plot, boring (and annoyingly predictable) subplots and secondary characters, idiotic dialog and a loathesome protagonist.I found the constant dropping of names -- expensive clothes names, famous fashion designers and actors, expensive cars, etc., extremely irritating and unnecessary. This is the kind of book you might read a dozen or so pages into and you've already decided that it is pure crud, but you want to finish it off in the masochistic desire to see if it really is as awful as you think it is.I felt a little bit sorry for Andrea Sachs at first because I really did think she was surrounded by shallow people, but then she is condescending toward her \\"meek\\" Indian roommates and calls Japanese women \\"Jappies.\\" Absolutely unforgivable snobbery. Also, I don't really know what gives her character the idea that she is qualified to write for The New Yorker, since she's so in love with herself and her superiority over \\"fake people\\" that I don't think it's likely that she is really the intellectual she would have to be in order to write for that magazine.The main character's obsession over peoples' weight and appearance reveals a lot of what the author probably really thinks about things. The character claims not to care about brands and famous people but the author obviously does care enough about brands and famous people to obsess over them.I have one suggestion for Andrea Sachs/Weisberger -- work retail, be a mom, or become a teacher in a public school, or become a fireman. Then she'll know what real work is.It's a pity that doggerel like this gets printed and pushed in stores, while so many other good books never get printed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea is truly shallow. I thought perhaps in the end she would notice that she was the devil herself. Was there ANYTHING she did not complain about? Is there ANYONE she actually knew and liked? When you find something wrong with everyone; it's usually not them, it is YOU. Although she appears to be one not concerned with fashion; I found it ironic that she describes those below the Mason-Dixon as hicks who do not know how to dress; or speak (as she dislikes anyone with an accent). If Andrea does a job as poorly as this is written; perhaps that 'devil' was frustrated with her stupidity. The only part of the book that shows any character having a hint of intelligence, is when Miranda reprimands several of the staff: she knows each person's job -- which is more than one can say for Andrea who\`s idea of intelligence is being able to get a Scrabble high score. This girl was an overpaid messenger (in addition to her regular salary, stole clothing & sold it on ebay)? I agree with the review that said the book was choppy & included too many details -- here's what the appointment book looks like: 9.00 read book; 10.00 put it down. Skip the book & see the movie on this one. I'll be rooting for Streep!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer who described the book as a drag because it felt like the same scenario was being replayed over and over throughout the book. It seems a bit implausible that someone would put up with so much mistreatment from their boss for a whole year simply to get a recommendation. If the main character had the charm, wit, or likability of Bridget Jones, this might have worked. But the main character is not especially endearing (in fact, she's fairly pathetic)and everyone in the novel is so vapid and bitchy, the story simply wears thin after awhile. I read most of it and then just couldn't take another miserable anecdote, so I skimmed through the last chapters and read the end so I could at least enjoy the final payback. I hope the movie inserts some sweetness, humor, and romance to balance the bitter. Otherwise, it will be a dreary 2 hour experience. This book will definitely hit the resell pile at my house."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this book up because I'd heard so much buzz about it plus the movie is on its way to theaters so I thought I would give it a look. I fininshed it and although it was mildly entertaining as an avid reader I found the writing to be amateurish. I found the characters underdeveloped and devoid and the story itself kind of drag. I felt like it was 400+ pages of the SAME thing........Andrea goes to work, deals with cranky boss, has a meltdown, goes home, and starts again. It was kind of boring, not a page turner at all. In fact, I'm hesitant to see the movie because I fear it will be very boring. I've read many of the so called \\"chick books\\" out there and this one just didn't deliver for me. I would've liked a more solid, interesting plot and more developed characters who possessed even one redeeming quality. Again, it was mildly entertaining but there are better books out there. Would I recommend it????.....not really but since it's so devoid it won't require much brain power to get through so I guess in that sense it's an easy read. :)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The writing in this novel isn't great, let's just get that out of the way. It doesn't flow well, isn't imaginative, and is manic to the point where I wondered whether the author wasn't on as much caffeine as her antagonist, Miranda.Much of the novel is the same thing repeated over and over: protagonist, Andrea (&quot;Ahn-dre-ah&quot;) gets impossible assignment from her hyper-high-maintenance boss Miranda, spends the next couple pages scrambling to figure out how to make the assignment happen amidst long descriptions of what clothes Andrea's wearing, and then Miranda changes her mind, nullifying the hyperactivity Ahn-dre-ah just went through. Then Ahn-dre-ah would go home and call her boyfriend to apologize for standing him up again.The end &quot;climax&quot; feels very contrived and unoriginal, which is unfortunate because I felt the author could have done a lot more it. She introduced some interesting characters, such as Andrea's nutty, free-spirited roommate, and Andrea's super-sweet if cardboard-cut-out, 2-dimensional boyfriend. The book would have been a lot more interesting and &quot;fatter&quot; had the author developed the tension between Andrea and these two characters more. Instead, these characters just flit in and out of the endless descriptions of Jimmy Choos and Dolce & Gabbana. The ending felt contrived, instead of being a vehicle to express just how serious a conflict Andrea has actually gotten into. One never really starts caring about the peripheral characters because the relationship was never fully developed, and a result, Andrea's reaction doesn't come as any big surprise or something I even said &quot;good for you!&quot; to. Just &quot;oh well.&quot;Oddly, I started liking Miranda at the end, because she becomes the most believable character. I can see someone like that in that position in that industry. She doesn't show up much, her employees know nothing about her, and because she is so high-maintenance and finicky, she comes across as a super-witch. I can believe employees knowing Miranda on a very shallow, business level, which is exactly how the reader gets to know her. One starts thinking, &quot;There obviously must be more to this woman, but we're just not in the position to.&quot;All that being said, the book was an interesting insight into the world of fashion, especially for someone like me who knows next-to-nothing about fashion. There was definitely potential for future novels from this author. She has the storylines and the characters. If she would just calm down, cut out twenty or thirty clothing descriptions, and work more on developing relationships and characters, I can see her future work being great and entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I don't really understand all of the negative reviews on this website...I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun, light read. Nothing more, nothing less. I think the characters were believable & the main character Andy, was refreshing in contrast to all of the \\"clackers\\" and, of course the devil herself, Miranda. I had bosses like Miranda so I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! While this book was similar to Nanny Diaries in the respect of a wildly eccentic & evil boss, I felt this book was A LOT better than Nanny Diaries & much more well written.Maybe all of the negative reviews were from fashionistas lashing out--see the book has me paranoid ;)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book and was very disappointed when I finished it. First off, I strongly suspect this is Ms. Weisberger's first efforts at writing a novel (meaning she has no &quot;trunk&quot; novels) and unfortunately it shows. There's repetition that should have been winnowed out (characters give too many &quot;withering&quot; looks; everyone &quot;shrugs&quot; into coats and jackets.) Then there's moments in the book that completely baffled me. (How could Lilly be putting on Andrea's make up one minute and then be passed out on the bed the next? I looked for a transistion but couldn't find it.) Additionally, the efforts to make Andrea seem &quot;likeable&quot; are awkward.(Sending clothes to that pre-teen girl, buying lattes for homeless people) I feel like they were inserted during a re-write.Her humor and metaphors are clunky (she first compares a character to a platiiff on Judge Judy, than she switches to a defendant, and the comparison falls flat due to over-explanation.) Nor did I have a clear fix on any of the people in Andrea's life. They seemed like cut-out characters. The most disappointing character was Miranda. I read this book hoping for a little dish on Anna Wintour and what I got was the this mean, one-note character who was predictable and boring. There was no insight offered as to why she was such a pain. But the main flaw in this book is the complete lack of plot. There's a little stir of forced excitement at the end, but other than than, the reading of this prose is as plodding and tedious as Andrea's year at Runway magazine. Even though this book's obviously made a pot of money, it shouldn't have been published in this condition. It's a disservice to the readers and the author (an obvious newbie who should have been properly edited.)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Satire has a long and distinguished history, and everybody, deep in their heart of hearts, probably enjoys seeing nasty, arrogant megalomaniacs get their comeuppance. But it only works if the person doing the satirizing has 1) SOME kind of moral authority, 2) A razor-sharp wit, and 3) the ability to see him- or herself somewhat objectively. Weisberger displays none of the above in this lame bit of opportunism. I found myself rooting for Miranda. Not a good sign.Prose that would be dripping red in a decent Freshman comp. course, cardboard characterization, a storyline that goes nowhere. Luckily I got my copy free from a friend who warned me not to waste my time reading it--if only I had listened. I would recommend you not make the same mistake I did, or compound the mistake by actually paying money for it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Can somebody please explain to me why so many other customers are fawning over this novel. The writing just doesn't work, and in some cases doesn't make sense. I expected clearer writing from an Ivy League grad, something other than the fillet-o-cliches Weisberger dishes out. Plus I'm sorry, but I can't sympathize with the winy, annoying narator (make her stand in line for government cheese, shop at a Wal-Mart, something that tells me she's been struggling!) She works in the fashion magazine industry, for a TYPICAL, no nonsense boss. Whoop-de-doo! The part where she has to drive that $80k sports car, while wearing that Prada outfit, girl I just wept for Andrea. Right.The Dirty Girls Social Club is a much better and funnier read, by, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Weisberger, a much clearer and more experienced writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"At first, The Devil Wear Prada might remind you of The Nanny Diaries and The Shopaholic Takes Manhattan. It has that fast, fun, delightfully wicked vibe that many books have when they're set in the shopping Mecca of New York City. The scenarios are funny and entertaining and have the ability to capture your attention. But about mid-way, for whatever reason, Andrea's narration starts to sound repetitive, like the plot doesn't really know where to go, so it starts running around in circles. But because you're curious and pulled in, you keep reading just to see what happens. But admittedly, the level of intensity declines and you may grow a little frustrated. Yet, there are so many beginnings chapters that are eye-opening in terms of the fashion industry, that the book is worth taking a look.I am curious to see what other readers have to say about The Devil Wears Prada."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought this book, simply, because the title caught my eye. A lover of fashion, but not a slave to it, it was quite interesting to get a glimpse into the world of high fashion and what really goes on behind the scenes. Overall, the book started out okay, but it went totally flat in the end.In otherwords, I was looking for something really juicy and got nothing in return. No need to re-hash what all the majority reviewers, thought. If I had to say one thing, I'm in total agreement with the folks that caught all of the grammatical errors in the book. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.Highly suspicious from a Cornell Grad!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK - this book starts out with the girl not knowing how to drive a stick shift makes her sound whiny and spoiled. Throughout the book this attitude prevails. Women are portrayed as weak, all having eating disorders, and they can't dress."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was looking for something kinda fluffy and funny. Well, I found myself finding the protaganist whiny, unrealistic, whiny, self-righteous, whiny, self-centered, and did I mention whiny?A college grad with a high profile job has to do some scut-work - boo hoo. She's lived a life of privilege, and seems to suffer the typical compensating for feeling inadequete by sneering at the haute couture world.Yes, Miranda is unreasonable. So are lots of other talented prima-donnas in every profession. Yet again - Boo hoo.The resolution was drivel. The implication that our protaganist has found what truly matters, and that standing up for her principals has served her is trite and difficult to swallow. The ending reads rather pompous and self-congratulatory. Oh wait, I believe that would describe the tone of the entire novel.This one is going to my local used book store, because it sure isn't a keeper."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book had a lot of promise. Like many others, I eagerly anticipated it's arrival, the first couple chapters certainly drew me in as I have friends who work for Conde Naste (aka Condescending and Nasty) and I know what they go through. But the problem is by the end of the book I found myself skipping paragraphs of Andrea's constant whining, it became very stale very quickly...other than that it's amusing reading. I'm surprised Anna Wintour isn't suing the author!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book never would have gotten published if not for the dishy promise: Former assistant to a high-profile fashion editor writes \\"fiction\\" about....an assistant to a high-profile fashion editor. I only bought the book because I used to work for a big women's magazine and I was curious to hear her take on that world. As far as the dish goes, that part's pretty entertaining--and I don't doubt that the author culls from her actual experience, because all the parts that don't concern Andrea's dealings with Miranda are laughably lame and two-dimensional. I enjoy light beach-reading as much as anyone, but I believe a book can be fluffy and fun yet still smart and clever (like Bridget Jones' Diary)--and this isn't."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Each year there are must have books that spring on the best seller lists and have library waiting lists longer than opening night at a Matrix sequel. With the hype and gossip, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is certainly one of the It Books of 2003.\\"Devil\\" follows the roughly year long stint Connecticut college grad/NEW YORKER writer wanna-be Andrea Sachs spends at RUNWAY as general dogsbody (actually second assistant) the Goddess of High Fashion, Miranda Priestly (think Anna \\"Nuclear\\" Wintour). It's a job Andrea is reminded regularly that millions of girls would kill for in a heartbeat. Andrea starts off as a young woman who wouldn't know Tom Ford from a Ford Focus. RUNWAY gives her a quick education in matters of high fashion.Given the sheer hype, when I saw \\"Devil\\" sitting on the library shelf, it was snatched away with glee.However a few days later when I had a moment to crack open the covers and began reading, the glee faded. I was fully able to close the covers, get ready for work on time and not pick \\"Devil\\" up again until the evening. I had the distinct feeling I had read this story before. And this tale of young woman goes to work for a maniac who thinks she owns her young employee body and soul before said employee has revelation family and friends come before work didn't charm me.If you loved \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" or the recent American Au-Pair novel, pick up \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\". Otherwise, considering saving your hard-earned cash for something better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In this \\"novel\\" Lauren Weinberger trashes her boss, \\"Vogue\\" editor (and fashion diva extraordinare) Anna Wintour while trying to convince us the readers that she is poor innocent in this mess of a novel known as \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" Although entertaining at times it often gets boring and VERY choppy in content and direction.

It was...ok. But I have to admit, I kind of liked the devil, because Andrea's (main character) continuous uh, um, uh stuttering and wimpiness made me want to scream at her too. But a fun read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was a complete hoot. If you liked \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" you'll love this book. It's got the same insightful commentary on a rarified social group in NYC (fashionistas replacing the park avenue mothers) with an even wittier edge. Lauren Weisberger's eye for detail and the absurd creates a story that's hard to put down. In fact, I couldn't - just spent the entire day engrossed in this novel, rooting for Andrea to triumph over the wretched Miranda. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lured in by the catchy title and the humorous picture on the book jacket, it took only a few chapters to get involved in the book's characters despite the fact the subplot(s) were occasionally weak. (I confess I stayed up rather late several nights in a row to finish the book.)The portrayal of Andrea's coworkers is perhaps the most disturbing because it's true to everyday life in New York City. This book excellently depicts the harsh, backstabbing environment found in every office of The City, whether it be in publishing, public relations, or brokering.The heinous editor character, Miranda Priestly, isn't as much an exaggeration as most people would hope; it's the self-important attitude exhibited by an entire class of spoiled rich people weekending in the Hamptons. It may, however, seem a little excessive to people who don't have to witness spoiled adults throwing temper tantrums on a daily basis.The subplot(s) of the story do little to move the reader, other than to emphasize the superhuman expectations of Andrea's boss and the tolls that meeting these expectations (or trying to meet them) takes upon her relationships.The inevitable confrontation is but a brief victory, leaving the reader wondering, &quot;That's it? Is there more? Is she sure that's all?&quot; However, unlike the Nanny Diaries, the ending is somewhat satisfying for those of us seeking revenge for all injustices.This book seems more about a journey toward self-discovery (and just how much garbage one person can and will put up with) than it is about airing dirty laundry. Sure, it's obviously written in the spirit of revenge but not to the point of being libelous. It should be required reading for anyone planning to move to and seek employment in New York City, for the atmosphere of said city was accurately captured."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"You'd THINK that a novel about being a personal assistant to the world's most prominent fashion editor would be dishy, fascinating, and fun - but it's not. This novel is dull as dirt.Much has been made of the fact that author Lauren Weisberger used to work at Vogue magazine for editor Anna Wintour, and that this first novel is likely based on true life experiences. Perhaps that's true, but in this case, real life does not prove to be more interesting than fantasy. The details of her everyday routine and work demands, no matter how bizarre, simply are not that interesting. The most suspense-filled pages relate Andrea's (the main character) need to deliver a piping hot latte from Starbucks back to her boss's office. Will the coffee still be hot when she gets there? Pul-lease...who cares...Weisberger tries to paint Andrea as a young woman more interested in working for the \\"New Yorker\\" magazine than a frivolous fashion mag. Yet editorial oversights make it unbelievable that Andrea (or Lauren?) truly has that kind of literary talent. (For example: breast implants were made of silicone, not silicon; basil is an herb, not a spice.) Yeah, maybe I'm picking nits, but these errors really cut into my respect for this book.The premise is interesting, the title is cute, and there are a few gossipy details inside the pages. But this book is simply not living up to the hype. I can only hope that Weisberger has used this book to achieve a catharsis of her pent up frustrations and anger, and that her next publication will be of a higher caliber."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is both thin (emaciated, in fact) on plot and horribly written. I guess Ms. Weisberger learned nothing more at Cornell than how to string together one cliche after another. The characters are uninteresting, her commentary on life in New York inaccurate (since when are the streets empty at 7AM?!?--a detail she repeatedly makes throughout the book), and her observations about humanity shallow and trite. Skip this book. I literally threw mine in the garbage."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Weisberger creates us a little tale of how the professional life consumes the character of Andy completely. What Weisberger failed to do was to make Andy empathetic. She created a great character if this was a story about a Jewish Princess. But she failed to capture the drive and energy of a young professional who may have sold their soul to the devil to reach their goals. I had very little concern about Andy and what became of her. As soon as she started working, her attitude was poor. She felt the magazine was below her. She felt she was better than her coworkers. She barely did the job that was asked of her (stopping for cigarette breaks and personal phone calls when sent on a 5 minute errand). It was very frustrating to read a story like this, since almost everyone who has ever held a full time job has worked with a person like Andy. What really bugged me about the character was how she openly billed fraudulent charges back to her company (A dinner for her friend, a latte for the homeless guy, etc.). I'm sure this was meant to demonstrate that at the young age of 23, Andy had become so cynical that she was just interested in causing pain to \\"The Man\\". Instead, it made the character seem like a whiner and not trustworthy. Sure, the boss sucked, as did the job, but suck it up, sister! You are not in the unique position of having a nasty job! 12 months! Seriously, not that long!The boyfriend Alex bothered me too. We were told that he was a super-cool, supportive boyfriend, but we never saw any of that. We see him complaining that she is never around, that she forgot to call, that she missed a date. Yes, that can be annoying. But I've worked 100+ hours a week myself in a job. My husband didn't enjoy it, but he knew I had set lofty goals, and to obtain those goals required some hard work on my part. So he didn't whine or nag me, and he surely didn't leave me once I got out of my demanding job with a snotty little \\"too late, I've been trying for too long\\". Weisberger never developed Alex's character into something that resembled supportive. She told us he was and we were expected to accept it. As a result, he came across as holier-than-thou. Whatever, Alex. Andy, despite all of her faults, is better off without a self-righteous boyfriend.Finally, the job was described to sound like hell. Off the charts. The problem was it sounded a little too much hellish to me. Miranda was practically a comic, she was made so cartoony. I think she was described wonderfully as someone who was heartless, ruthless, and self-centered. That is believable. But some of the demands should have been scaled back. Whenever we get a story of Andy chasing down something for her, we know pretty early on how it's going to end. The boss is going to request something entirely different than what was originally asked and Andy is going to feel the heat for not telepathically expecting this. How many tales of screwed up lunches, location of furniture stores, reviews from the newspaper, etc. do we need to be subjected to for this point to come across?All in all, save your money."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Maybe I expected too much due to all the hype, but I found this book disappointing. I didn't hate it or throw it down in disgust, but, really, what's the big deal? I recommend skipping this one."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Loved it for the references to glamour and put-upon fashion, but is Lauren so confident that Anna won't squelch her pen in the future? She'd better be careful because Anna didn't get where she is by being a pussycat. However, loved Lauren's telling of Anna's psychoses! Would totally recommend to fellow fashionistas!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"...Probably because it is every girl's dream to get a wonderful job as the assistant to a celebrity. Don't worry, the author/narrator of the book doesn't let you forget how lucky the spoiled main character is for landing the job.The main character literally scores this dream job while unshowered, in rumpled clothing, and hungover. Well wonders never cease. Tales of her woe ensue. The book is over 300 pages of garbage. The writing style is mediocre, it's poorly edited, and the story isn't even resolved. It's a poorly crafted story, and it needs a lot of work. I have no idea how it even got published with all those typos, spelling and gramatical errors.I am a fan of the &quot;chick lit&quot; genre, and I don't mind a fair share of fluff reading, I really don't. This book is just way out there, it's unrealistic and SOOO CLICHED. The main characted of the book is &quot;too busy&quot; for her friends and family, so we are supposed to believe that it's the main character's fault for her best friend's downward spiral due to excessive drinking. And don't get me started on the boyfriend/family issues.All in all, the book is 360 some odd pages of the main character's job as the assistant to a woman who sounds a whole lot like the current editor of Vogue. Oh, about 20 pages before the ending of the book, a hasty climax is written and then concluded.Save yourself the time and leave this book alone. Don't buy it...but if you want to read it...just get it at the library."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As much as I would like to stand up for Lauren and say, &quot;No, this was a well written novel!&quot; I just can't. The simple reason is that it isn't. It was initially entertaining but so incredibly inconsistent throughout. Andrea's character had no depth, you did not find yourself feeling for her or becoming connected to her in any way. Anyone who tolerates this type of abuse, in my opinion, deserves it. I am not quite sure how Ms. Weisberger wanted you to feel about her main character. I did finish the book but I feel bad for the author because I think she does show promise but may not be able to recoup from this poor attempt at a novel (one that was highly anticipated as well!)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was a great dissapointment. What I wanted was a light, funny read. What I got was a semi-depressing bore. I had never heard of this book, or of the hype others had mentioned. I was bored and needed a book, ran to my nearest warehouse club and bought this. I think back and I bought it because it seemed similar to The Nanny Diaries which I found interesting and very funny.Andrea is NOT a believable character. She is saccharin sweet and a bore. We are lead to believe that she is a saint and doesnt deserve such abuse. Well QUIT!!! That is what I kept thinking through the whole book! QUIT, QUIT, QUIT!! And she should have followed the old addage \\"If it is too good to be true, it probably is\\" referring to her interview and job.Also, the whole looking at the woman and the fashion world down her nose with disdain,but, managing to \\"score\\" high priced items was so annoying to me. I just felt the \\"saint\\" Andrea was a hypocrite and was begging to be a doormat."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is great for a semi-trashy summer read. However, don't expect anything more profound than some whining and attempted sympathy grabbing.This book is about &quot;Andrea&quot;, the assistant to &quot;Miranda Priestly&quot; the editor in chief of &quot;Runway&quot; magazine. It is a well known fact that the author (Lauren) was the assistant to Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue. While the author claims that the book is a work of pure fiction, it is not a hard stretch of the imagination to figure out that by &quot;fiction&quot; she must been first hand reporting. The most interesting thing about this book is that it gives someone NOT in fashion a glimpse into this insane world of size 00s, free designer clothes and over the top expense accounts. It describes, in detail, the insane whims of &quot;Miranda Priestly&quot;, such as having a private jet fly a copy of the new Harry Potter book to Paris just so her daughters could have it ONE day before all of their friends.That is the most interesting thing. The subplot of &quot;Andrea&quot;'s personal relationships and her ambition of writing for the New Yorker really seems almost trivial in the novel since the subplot is not very well developed. Her friend (singular) and boyfriend both get increasingly discouraged with her because she works 12 hours days and does not have an inordinate amount of time to be with them. Her best friend develops a major addiction and her boyfriend (who is a teacher) basically turns into a colossal whiner who has no regard for her career. Throw into the mix her flirtation with a &quot;famous young writer&quot; and the subplot attempts to overwhelm the actual main storyline.This book, while entertaining, should have stuck to its main purpose: to discuss her career in fashion and her crazy boss, not to try to push her personal life into the foreground. The whole POINT of the book was that as a result of her job, she had no personal life, hence the plot development problems. I just feel that for someone who went to an Ivy League school and aspires to write for the New Yorker, this novel could have been written much better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you're at all familiar with Ms. Weisberger's background (as a former assistant to Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the apparent \\"Devil\\" in question of the book's title), then you might figure her work as just the latest of the Revenge-Lit novels that often come from first-time novelists.The book has all the makings of one, despite the author's evasions on the subject: young, green Andrea Sachs, fresh out of college, realizes that she'll need to get a job. She literally stumbles upon a job opening at the fictional Runway magazine and by her description is practically forced into employment as the assistant to the highly demanding, British-accented Miranda Priestly. She claims to have literary aspirations and zero interest in fashion, so immediately she sets her self apart from (above, actually) her new colleagues. Thus, Andrea is terrorized, humiliated, dehumanized and demoralized on a regular basis. She gets sucked further and further into the void of non-stop cell phones, lattes, designer clothes, equally-terrified-yet-still-superior co-workers, while at the same time she's slowly drifting away from her family, loyal boyfriend and unstable roomie, all of whom seem to depend solely upon her for their survival. Andrea endures the tug-of-war between the two sides in the hope that a year of servitude under Ms. Priestly will lead to a job at the New Yorker (!).Weisberger paints her narrator as a rebel who resists the lure of the fashion world as long as she can, until it begins to permeate her sub conscious (against her will, of course), but it doesn't ring true. She wants to fit in. She enjoys the thousands of dollars in designer clothes tossed her way, the on-demand car service, the access to New York's most exclusive restaurants and to her new, rarefied world in general.The book's biggest weakness is that Andrea never admits it. The simultaneous attraction/revulsion to the thing that's slowly driving her crazy is perhaps the one thing a reader might relate to most easily. She complains about her forced trip to Paris with Miranda, then doesn't understand why her family isn't more 'excited' for her. She suffers a particularly brutal tongue-lashing from her boss and only moments later, her hands still shaking from the assault, she peers out the window of her limo and enjoys the sight of all the exclusive designer boutiques lining the streets of Paris. \\"I could get used to this,\\" she thinks to herself. Bizarre, yes, but who hasn't believed they could focus on the perks involved in a loathed job, in order to minimize the misery?There's very little perspective at all in this book, no real feeling that Andrea can look back at either herself or her tormentors with any sort of objectivity. She's the victim, Miranda's the victimizer and both of them (along with every other character in the novel) are about as realized as paper dolls.So as Revenge-Lit, the book comes up short. For it to work, you'd need to be on Andrea's side, to recognize her suffering as something similar to your own. Instead, you'll just end up wondering why she didn't quit."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"....unless you enjoy absolutely simpleton-type books.I borowed this book from the library. I expected it to be an easy read (it certainly is) but still an enjoyable one. I knew beforehand that it is the type of book you read on the weekend to kill time, or the type of book that you bring to the beach.I was six chapters in the book (95 pages) when I realixed that STILL nothing had happened. All you read about is how the main character's job is \\"so incredible,\\" and how the boss is \\"so difficult,\\" and how she works \\"so hard [at many menial tasks].\\" This book needs a plot, one other than how the main character chases down various items that her oh-so-difficult boss requires. B-o-r-i-n-g.I enjoy cheap and easy fiction as well as the next person. But this is certainly one of the worst books I have ever read that falls into this genre. I'm glad I didn't pay for it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I grabbed this book in an airport while in the mood for some light reading on the plane. I wasn't expecting great writing and I didn't get it. I was expecting some amusing stories about life in the fashion world. I got a few, but they were so poorly written and the narrator so annoying that it wasn't worth it. I don't know, or care to know, anything about the fashion icons mentioned in the book. However, I have worked for more than one boss from hell in my life, so I thought I'd empathize with the narrator. Instead, I was annoyed at the self righteous tone and her complete lack of understanding that there are people in the world with real problems at work -- single mothers with no benefits, men and women working in unsafe conditions, not to mention people who have been fired when they've become sick or, god forbid, gotten old. This book could have been a fun read if it had been a well-written account of a new college graduate paying her dues. Instead, the author simultaneously looks down on the fashion world while dropping every name she can. She also fails to realize that there are many bosses from hell and many of the people working for these bosses do not have the perks or prestige that come with working at Vogue. She also fails to realize just how many highly-educated people out there are struggling. I temped for almost two years after receiving a very prestigious graduate degree. During that time I met men and women with masters, Ph.D's, musicians with degrees from Julliard, etc. who were all temping -- being treated as non-human while receiving no benefits -- just to pay the rent. I almost guffawed out loud when she had the audacity to complain that her mommy and daddy had cut off her credit card -- temporarily of course. Let her try a few years working temp jobs, barely able to pay the rent, knowing that any condition requiring medical treatment could mean bankruptcy. Let her talk to a few single parents before she complains about having to wear Prada (for which she did not pay) to work every day. This book could have been funny if written in an appropriate tone. It's poorly written and downright offensive."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have never in my life written a review on Amazon.com nor anything else. But The Devil Wears Prada was so craptacular I had to complain about it. How this garbage could have even stayed on the best-seller list for more than a DAY frightens me.Where do I begin? Well, when I started the book I thought it might be a nice, light read. That changed after the first paragraph. But I mean this was just awful. AWFUL.Andrea Sachs, a girl from a small town basically goes to the big city and works for some \\"horrid\\" boss. Shock and awe! A story like THIS has never been told.Spoiled Andrea was the most unpleasant, rude, nasty, racist, stupid, lazy, (insert 40,000 other insulting adjectives here) main character I have ever known existed!By the time I got to the part where Andrea whines again about how horrible it is to get up at 5:30AM I wanted to smack her upside her head. People, including myself, get up that time and EARLIER every day! Oh poor her. Someone pass the hankie.Personally, the only character I liked was Miranda (the \\"devil\\")! She was the *least* annoying! Lazy little Andrea (who has a big head because she thinks some stupid-just-out-of-school-brat like her could land a job at The New Yorker. Double HA!) also has to take a smoke before she can even function.-deep breath- Okay, I could go on and on about how horrible she is, but lets focus on the BOOK and let me just say it is a WASTE OF TIME. It's not even a good train-wreck-type read! It's just horribly boring. The writing is NOT funny. Lauren Weisberger puts that little blurb in the front of the book about how her publisher edited out all the funny stuff. Ha, yeah right! That probably means WORDS like \\"a, the, it, person\\". There was nothing funnier that could've possibly been edited out. The book wasn't funny now or before \\"editing\\".This is just Weisberger's spiteful book about Vogue editor Anna Wintour told through the eyes of a self-absorbed whining twenty-something for 300+ pages. Pointless and way too long.Now, thanks to false hype and undeserving \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" title, Weisberger is laughing all the way to the bank. Thanks. Thanks a whole lot."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had high hopes for this novel. Picking it up and reading the back of the book, I thought it would be a gossipy, exciting, Sex-and-the-City-esque look into working in the world of fashion and life in New York City. Instead, it turned out to be terribly written, with utterly unbelievable characters and an increasingly dull plotline.First off, Andrea, the main character, is not someone that I found likeable at all. She seemed completely contrived. Considering her goody-two-shoes narration I had trouble believing that she smoked or even went out partying in college as she said she did. I especially had trouble believing that she even got the job to work at the glamorous fashion magazine, Runway. Andrea's emotional dilemma vascillated between two things, \\"I don't fit in here and I hate my boss.\\" \\"I have to sacrifice everything even though I'm a whiny, annoying little OOH SO HUGE SIZE SIX!!! girl and do everything for my boss because I want to work at the New Yorker. Because I'm such a great writer, you know.\\" If I were to take the evidence of Weisberger's prose as \\"Andrea's writing,\\" I'd say, \\"Working at the New Yorker? MAYBE IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE!!\\"I don't think anyone who read this book could actually believe that someone would put up with such a terrible job and a terrible boss, that they complained about incessantly, which apparently drove them to the breaking point. Obviously, Andrea liked wearing designer clothes. Or did she? Or was the job just changing her? Frankly, who cares? I couldn't care. I couldn't believe or like the main character at all. She was boring and moronic, and even contemplated staying with her job in another country while her supposed \\"best friend\\" was in a coma. Yikes. Unlike Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City, who I loved even as she had an affair with her married ex-boyfriend, I simply hated Andrea for even existing on the printed page.The other characters were not much better. Andrea's boss, Miranda Priestly, certainly asked for absurd things. Any other person with a spine would have told the woman to go screw herself after at least the first few outrageous demands, no matter how bright the light at the end of the tunnel. Strong women, they do not put up with that kind of thing. Strong women find other ways to make it to the top. Personally, I couldn't really believe Miranda was that evil because Andrea simply kept putting up with her. Even when Andrea finally told Miranda off and quit at the end of the book, I really didn't believe that Andrea was taking much of a stand. She had been walked all over the entire length of the novel. And Weisberger insisted that she always had to say, \\"Ahn-dre-ah!!\\" which got really, really annoying.Lily, Emily, Alex, and Christian - all boring supporting roles in the novel. Her relationship with Alex, her boyfriend, was as moronic as you can get, and consisted of her abusing and neglecting him for the better part of a year. Emily was unbelievable as she couldn't decided whether or not to be snarky or nice. Lily was the pathetic drunk friend, and Andrea was stupid enough to not say anything about the drinking until she got herself knocked into a coma, which, miraculously, she came out of as soon and Andrea came to see her - like that ever happens in real life. Christian was the hot, tempting, stylish boy, and only further demonstrated what a shallow, lifeless character Andrea was, because she was actually interested in him.The dialogue was completely unbelievable and contrived, a la Dawson's Creek. If you don't believe me, try acting out some of the scenes with a friend. You will cringe in your skin. People don't talk like that. The happy, hopeful storybook ironic ending was just annoying. While I'm not in anyway proclaiming to be a fantastic writer, I just have to say that I absolutely abhorred Weisberger's writing. This stuff might fly in a high school creative writing class, but I can't believe she actually got published. I think that the terrible writing is at the absolute center of why this book is so horrid. It could have been an interesting book. But with such a terrible writer, such contrived and boring characters, and such a dull, lackluster plotline completely lacking in rising action/climax... the book crashed before it even saw the runway.The fashion name-dropping even got annoying after a while. I think Weisberger should have written a story about the ready-to-wear fashions of Spring 2001 or whatever instead of horrifying millions with this monstrosity of a novel.In short - leave your credit cards and library cards in your Chanel wallet, don't take one step on your Manolos or Jimmy Choos to go out and buy this book. You will regret having spent hours of your life reading it.I can't believe I read the whole thing!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book has gotten a ton of press and I thought I would really like it. But it's terrible! The book is not well written and the content is fluffy at best. It goes on much too long with almost nothing new to say. Don't waste your time or money on this book! Go see the movie; I heard it was much better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book has interesting subject matter and I found it entertaining, but the main character/narrator is so unpleasant that it's hard to really like the book. If she were supposed to be unpleasant, that would be one thing, but I'm pretty certain that author Lauren Weisberger meant for the character of Andrea Sachs (her alter ego) to be a sort of everywoman heroine, and that she most definitely is not. Andy eviscerates her boss, Miranda Priestly, for being an awful, demanding snob, when Andy herself is unbelievably snobby. She thinks people who like fashion are worthless morons (while working for Runway, a fictional Vogue), and she thinks anyone from the South is a trashy redneck (she refers to Houston as a third world country and every time her Southern brother-in-law speaks, she cringes and refers his \\"redneck drawl\\", says he sounds like \\"hick\\" and that he grins too openly and often. Smiling = bad, I guess?)Basically it's OK for Andy to be a snob to people she considers beneath her, but not Miranda. (For the record, I think snobbery in all forms sucks.) Andy also calls Japanese women \\"Jappy girls\\" and cannot tell the difference between her two Indian roommates, because they're both Indian, and apparently all Indians look the same. All of this is presented like it's cute and charming, rather than bigoted and awful.Miranda IS an awful, demanding snob, but it's really hard to have any sympathy for Andy, who has a terrible work ethic. She wants to make personal calls and smoke cigarettes all day, and it really pisses her off when Miranda or the senior assistant, Emily, want her to, oh, you know, do work at work. Yep- outrageous! They actually expect her to do the job she is paid for! Again, she is constantly criticizing Miranda for being a terrible person, yet she herself steals from the company, is a completely two faced, fudges expense reports constantly and considers assistant work to be very, very far beneath her, because she is college educated. The fashion world is also very, very far beneath her, because she wants to be a writer for the New Yorker. Andy is borderline openly hostile to her boss and peers, and frequently uses passive aggressive sarcasm to show her superiority to those around her- she just seems like a truly terrible person to be around.Beyond how obnoxious, whiny and condescending Andy is, her friends and family are nearly just as awful, making it difficult to really root for anyone in the book. Her boyfriend is supposed to be this saint-like inner city teacher, but to me he comes across as self-righteous and passive aggressive. For instance, he emails Andy one WEEKDAY morning asking her to call him at 3:00 that day, because he need to \\"talk\\". She ends up getting swamped at work and isn't able to call him til she gets off, and by then he is really upset with her for not calling at 3:00 like he asked. This is presented as if he is totally in the right. What? I often can't make personal calls at work either, and it would really bug me if my boyfriend got mad at me for that. Andy's best friend also gets furious at her for not being able to talk on the phone at work, and for not being able to leave suddenly mid-day to go look at apartments. Andy's friends and family accuse her of not having her priorities straight. In what world is your job not a priority?Andrea also finds a way to mention that she's 5'10'', 115 lbs, and a size 6 multiple times. But she doesn't care about looks at all! She says that Gisele is \\"downright short\\" as if short now means repulsive- but again, she's not superficial in the least.Lauren Weisberger was really young when she wrote this and that might have a lot to do with these issues. Regardless, her heroine is actually more unlikable than her villain, which I doubt was her goal."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Like everybody else I was hoping for some good chick lit to pass the time. This book is so poorly written its a chore to get through it! Where were the editors?! Who does she know, that this book was even published in the first place? The writing is straight out of a high school creative writing class. At one point a character \\"groans audibly\\" - is there any other way to groan? Another character inexplicably appears every now and then and speaks entirely in CAPITALS! The characters don't know what they're supposed to be. Andrea is ostensibly a talented writer, but nothing whatsoever in the story supports any kind of intellectual ability or writing ability or interest. Its embarrassing that this was even published, let alone a best seller. Great concept, but so, so poorly developed. Not worth your time unless you like to laugh at terrible writing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Okay, so I was just looking for something to read during my lunch hour, and it seemed to fit the bill. Thing is, most of the action is just the main character running errands for her mean boss; there really isn't much of a plot. The storyline is predictable, and nothing surprising really happens. I think I was just as bored as the main character seems to be.Besides the story itself, I just hate that the author uses negative stereotypes of Southerners. First of all, she doesn't even get the accent right; her description in chapter six of Mr. Tomlinson's secretary's \\"deep southern drawl\\" reads like this: \\"How mah I hep ya tuhday?\\" (97). I don't know what kind of accent that's supposed to be, but it's not southern. Secondly, she thinks all Southerners are \\"rednecks.\\" The three main examples come from Chapter 14: \\" 'I guess you're right,' I sighed, still refusing to accept that my Friday night was to be spent in a formal gown at the Met, greeting wealthy-but-still-rednecks from Georgia and North and South Carolina...\\" (306); \\" 'I want my Andy to look just as sophisticated as all the big-money Carolina rednecks she'll be serving tonight like a common waitress' \\"(315); \\"I knew it wasn't going to be a trendy New York crowd, but I was expecting them to look like something out of 'Dallas'; instead, they looked like a dressier version of the cast from 'Deliverance' \\" (325). Why the need to make every person who lives in the southern United States into a \\"redneck\\"? And why is every other accent in the book (English, Australian, French) charming but a southern accent means you're out of \\"Deliverance\\"? Thumbs down, Weisberger. You need a real-world education; start by traveling outside of New York!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Miranda Priestly, as shallow a character as she was, was infinitely preferable to the ridiculous Andrea, who was also about as deep as a raindrop in her own snotty way. The whole novel was based on Andrea's whining (both interiorly and exteriorly) about how she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't.If I typed that sentence five million times instead of three, that woud give you the idea upon which this novel was based.I thought it would be a good book to read while sitting by the pool, but I was wrong. It just wasn't all that interesting. I suppose if I really cared about the real-life world of Anna Wintour and Prada and Hermes and blah and blah and blahblahblah, it would have made more of an impression on me."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book had a strange effect on me. I was quite bored for the first 7 chapters or so but then all of a sudden, I was taken into the life of Andrea and felt like I was living her nightmare. I felt that the writing hit home with the type of story I like to read. It was light, yet brought you away from reality (at least my own). On the other hand, it made me realize, it could be kind of cool to experience something like that. To work so hard to get what you really want. I also think that if this story was changed a bit it could make a rather fun and interesting romantic comedy feature film. The one thing I had wished for throughout the book was that Andrea would have ended up with Christian. Bottom line, there was not much of a plot but the story about this girl's experience was really good and fund to read. You need to like that kind of book to like it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada was a great, hilarious book!

I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book- I could hardly put it down. It wasn't too predictable, (as so many novels are these days) which I enjoyed.

Even though the story is interesting, it felt like the book would never end."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While I enjoy fashion and try hard not to love all the books based on women's obessesions with clothing and that strange, fascinating world, this book left me yearning to read a book about someone I actually could relate with and feel for...like Bridgette Jones or Shopaholic. The book was a slow read, especially since the author skipped around so much and many times dragged on when describing for instance her friend's makeup suitcase. I didn't pity the main character Andrea once, and couldnt understand why she stuck out the job as long as she did. She had no solid proof she would be working at the New Yorker after one year. When I forced myself to finish the book, I thought the same thing as a previous reviewer said...I was looking for more of an ending, for some gaps to be filled, and was left with a blank page."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a great book if you read it for what is---fun reading for the beach and similar venues, plus some insight into the fashion world. I read this book on a raft while sipping a frozen margarita, and it really fit the bill. Deep reading this book is not, but the story is highly entertaining. For those of you who live and read in saner parts of the country, Lauren Weisberger really hit the mark on this one. It was fun mentally comparing notes as I read and laughed through the book. I have known other Mirandas (female and male) in other fields, and in a past life lived in a ritzy DC suburb where some of them also lived. There really ARE Mirandas who make these types of demands on their help without any regard or kindness in return, folks.

The ultimate boss from hell, rightfully named \\"The Devil Who Wears Prada.\\" Meet Miranda Priestly, a sadistic tyrant who just happens to be the Editor in Chief of a high-fashion magazine \\"Runway.\\" Miranda is so evil, she ranks right up there with the most wicked female Disney villains. She takes pleasure in beating down her helpless assistants with brutal insults, and impossible tasks. Unlike the remaining cast of forgettable characters, the infamous Miranda Priestly almost makes this book worth reading. Unfortunately, the main character (Andrea Sachs) is as bland as flat soda. There's nothing there, no life, no spunk, just a boring, one-dimensional creation. This lifeless, puppet begrudgingly goes through the motions as her sadistic boss dictates her every move. The reader is supposed to feel sympathetic for this unfortunate soul; but, it's easy to grow tired of Andrea's sarcasm, and self-serving attitude. The plot (or lack there of) is stagnant, it's just a cluster of scenes where Andrea leaps from one disaster to another. There were a couple of instances in this book that didn't sit well with me: Weisberger's snide remarks about Texas, and people with southern accents, and her nonchalant attitude towards drinking and driving. Being a fan of the \\"chick lit\\" genre, I didn't expect to read a literary masterpiece; I just wanted something fun and light to read. This book; however, proved to be a little too light, and brainless. I've read young adult books with more captivating characters and storylines. To all the fashionistas out there, this book may be worth reading. Considering that author, Lauren Weisberger once worked for a real-life Miranda Priestly during her employment at Vogue, she's able to gives the readers an inside look at what it's like to work in the high-fashion industry. The movie version of this book is due to come out sometime this year, starring Anne Hathaway (as Andrea Sachs), and Meryl Streep (as Miranda Priestly). Hopefully the movie will prove to be more entertaining than the book. To the readers that aren't solely interested in fashion and designer duds, don't waste your time with this book. With a cast of characters that you're likely to forget, a plot-less series of redundant misadventures, and a ho-hum ending, this book is a chick-lit miss.-Jessica T."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked this book despite myself -- it's an easy and quick read and fun as long as you don't have high expections for something with great literary depth.

This book is not meant to be taken too seriously! I was entertained by Miranda and Andrea BECAUSE they were on such extreme sides of the scale. That is what makes this book so entertaining. I also found myself smiling at the mannerisms of fashion know-alls James and Nichol, and the author also incorporates the attitudes of the doormen, nannies and drivers which I thought was a nice touch. Some reading should just be fun, entertaining, and relaxing, and this book is exactly that."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a perfect summer beach book, but all throughout it I kept thinking, \\"This could have been better written.\\" There are some priceless anecdotes, though. And it will make a great TV movie ..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not meant to be an intellectual read. It is also definitely not lighthearted, especially if one can identify with any of the characters! Anyone who has ever had a horrid boss or work situation, or knows someone who has, will identify with the characters in the book. The fact that all of this happens in the fashion world helps make the book more fun to read, for people who like fashion.I have read that the book is based on the author's experience with Vogue's editor-in-chief. That would make sense, because this book reads like the tale of an abused employee. Some of this stuff is so out there that it's almost impossible to make up!You will like this book if you enjoy fashion, or if you have ever had an intolerable work situation (or someone close to you has)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was very entertaining and very addictive - I finished it in less than 48 hours on my vacation! Of course it's not life changing literature but it's a very fun read and I highly recommend it, especially if you love fashion and gossip. Don't give up if you get frustrated with Andrea's actions and her crazy boss, the ending makes it all worth it! This is a great light and fun read, ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is perfect for a lighthearted, fun, summertime read! Just when you think Miranda's demands can't possibly get any more ridiculous or absurd, they do. Adrea's nicknames for the different characters she encounters kept me chuckling through the whole book. I agree with the other reviewer who said this book is not meant to be an intellectual read and those who read it for that purpose will be disappointed. Its just meant to be fun."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I expected this book to be witty and entertaining. Instead it was a tedious slog through awful writing and a banal story. Who cares if Anna Wintour is a nasty boss? There are lots of nasty bosses. The heroine is so oblivious that she doesn't bother to learn to tell her two roommates apart. She claims to want to write for the New Yorker, but she should count herself lucky to get hired by the local Pennysaver.Could I finish this book? No."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book started off well enough but after awhile I began to empathize with poor Miranda Priestly. I mean, here's a hard driving, high-powered, highly successful woman who obviously got where she was not by making friends with her many assistants, all of whom see her as a stepping stone to greater things anyway. And she knows it. And who wouldn't get impatient with a prying personal assistant who knows nothing about fashion, could care less, and who lets the boss' lunches get cold and keeps her waiting for coffee because she needs to have a smoke or call her boyfriend and best friend, both of whom are losers? Although I tried desperately to be sympathetic to Andrea, her great drive to be \\"liked\\" made her, in my view, extremely unprofessional and excrutiatingly annoying. She was complaining and f-ing up on the job all the time and should have been fired immediately."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I expected this book to be light entertainment. However, I still expect storyline consistency. First of all, the boyfriend cannot have a 6 year old child in his 4th grade class. There are more \\"minor\\" errors, but hasn't anyone noticed the most glaring? At the end, the roomate is in two places due to storyline problems. First, the roomate was there, next shes still drunk, passed out in bed. This drives me nuts!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is completely based on the author's experience w/ the Editor in Chief of Vogue. After Lauren Weisberger (author) graduates, she has no job, so goes job searching. Coming from a small town, she has no clue about real city working life and is completely overwhelmed at the amount of work she has to do working as an assistant for Anna Wintour (Vogue Editor in Chief) &lt;-- aka 'devil' in this book.So, after working for the 'devil' for a couple of years, she says 'f*** you' to her boss (the 'devil') and stalks off, praising her own ability to speak her mind. (completely evident in the book)Then she writes Devil Wears Prada...which is pretty much a list of (justified??? or so she thinks...) reasons why she hated her job and why Anna is such a bee-yatch.I'll give an example.She complains and questions why she has to pick up her boss' laundry, and why her boss can't do it herself...Well, she IS the assistant isn't she? And, being the Editor In Chief, her boss DOES have more important things to do like flying here and there and organising the magazine etc. Besides, how hard is it to pick up laundry???Sure... if you DO wanna read about life in the fashion industry, or working for the Editor In Chief of Vogue, then you'd probably be interested by this.But to be fair, she writes very well... yet then again, there are a lot of other well-written books worth reading, because this, in essence, is just an over-rated rant about one of her own personal experiences."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ok, I knew this wasn't going to be a classic piece of literature, but for a piece of work that obviously semi-autobiographical, this is a bitter, poorly written and poorly edited piece of work. It comes off as a whiny piece of middle-class co-ed entitlement. Moreover, there are several parts in which the narrator contradicts herself--as if the author and editors didn't bother to proofread for continuity. Anyway, main character Andrea takes a job at a top fashion magazine, as a PERSONAL ASSISTANT, and expects to be treated like a human being? To NOT work outrageous hours? She whines about having to wear designer clothes (for free, I might add, as the other departments are constantly giving them to her) as a job requirement--well, duh! She IS representing the company!! I do sympathize with the main character, having had lousy and sadistic bosses myself, and the dishiness is what kept me interested. However, the main character comes off as whiny and snotty. What does she expect? She's looking down her nose at everyone around her while seeming to say that she should be handed a job at The New Yorker. The author's writing skills are so poor, I hope she didn't actually get a job as a writer there."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Now, why in the world would anyone pick up a book titled &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; and expect anything more than a fun read? What part of that title implies something else?? I just don't understand the reviews that bombed this book out.This book is a very light and entertaining story about a college grad that gets stuck in a nightmare job- working for that Prada wearing devil, no doubt. It is quite funny and will have you chuckling as you read it. There is a lot of detail given to the inter workings of the fashion industry, designers, clothes and accessories. This also seemed to turn off some of the other reviewers, but the story is about a girl working in the fashion industry. It would be an entirely different story if that were not the focus.I simply cannot think of a bad thing to tell you about this book. It even comes with a &quot;feel good&quot; ending and a moral to the story that wraps it up for the reader. Just bear in mind that it is a &quot;just for fun&quot; book and you will be very happy with it. Please don't let any of the bad reviews dissuade you from reading it. It is a strong &quot;4 Stars&quot;."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With everyone falling on the \\"chick-lit\\" bandwagon, some real clinkers are going to get published and heavily promoted--and even become best sellers. Well, this is one of them. This book fails on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin; it's essentially a dumbed-down cross between Thackeray's Vanity Fair and Goethe's Faust, with a little coming-of-age story thrown in for good measure.The novel is based on the author's real-life experience working for Anna Wintour at Vogue magazine. Andrea takes the position for one reason; she wants to get a toe-hold in publishing so that she can become a writer. At the onset, this strains credulity. Andrea has no experience in publishing, and she admits to having zero interest in fashion. It's difficult to believe that she would make it past the first round of job interviews, let alone become the personal assistant to the best -known fashion editor in the world.As in Vanity Fair, none of the characters in The Devil Wears Prada is particularly likable. Andrea is a cypher, and her boyfriend might as well be a Ken doll. We gain precious few insights into the novel's slightly more intriguing characters, Lily and Christian. The novel's only truly interesting character is Miranda Priestly, the \\"devil\\" of the title. I wondered more about Priestly than any other character. Ultimately, we are left frustrated by the utter lack of insight into Miranda Priestly.If the book were a satire, the dearth of likable or even interesting characters wouldn't be a problem, because the book's message would be of paramount importance Since this book's message appears to be \\"Grow up!!!\\" the lack of likeable characters is much more of a problem, and seems to result not from any satirical point of view, but from authorial ineptness.The ineptness continues in the book's plot, which unfolds with all the excitement and unpredictability of an episode of Beverly Hills 90210. Andrea's big Epiphany finally occurs! Andrea grows up! She discovers that instead of truckling to Miranda Priestly in order to get a job at The New Yorker, she can actually become a writer by [gasp!] *writing*.Ironically, at the end of the novel, Weisberger's protagonist is writing fiction that she admits is only a thinly disguised version of her real life experiences. Weisberger's novel mercifully ends therefore as the difference between herself and her fictional protagonist is reduced to almost nothing at all. In Weisberger's novel, we are assured that Andrea is a pomising and talented writer. Would that we could say the same of Lauren Weisberger."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This was not a very good book. After hearing that it was a best seller I knew I had to read it. First of I knew not to really take this book seriously as it was written in a humorous manner. Now, even though we all feel for the Andreah because no one wants an evil boss. But, in the real world she would have been canned the first time Miranda realized that she was not &quot;Cut&quot; out for the job. Also, there is no way that they would have let her keep those clothes. This book was just all about clothes, make up and &quot;Clackers&quot;. Save your money it's not worth it. I give this book a serious thumbs down. All three of the &quot;Shop-o-holic&quot; books were better than this one book combined."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisen-whatever cannot write. Period. She has zero technique. Five pages into this pulp and I knew I had a labor on my hands. I only deigned to read it because the movie was tolerable. The book is not. And that's because she CANNOT write. Cannot. The proof is in the pudding, folks: she's the only author I've ever seen who does not pass what I call \\"The Amazon Test\\" (this occurs when a book has multiple reviews; there are always, ALWAYS more five-star reviews for that book than any other star rating, usually combined). With all the five-star reviews on Amazon, you'd think every book ever written was A Farewell To Arms or something.Anyway, I digress. This is the only author I've ever seen whose books do not have a five-star review majority. It's not even good for chick-lit, which itself is a watery genre. I've got nothing else to say, so in the words of Meryl Streep: \\"that's all.\\""},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"That basically says it all. The only reason this novel became successful is that humans enjoy trashing other humans, particularly famous women, and enjoy reading trash about other humans, particularly women, too. If you want to learn about Vogue, see \\"The September Issue.\\" If you want to read about a whiny, primadonna, by all means read this novel -- but the primadonna is not the \\"boss,\\" it is the author herself."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea's tale is one we all can relate to: bright eyed and just graduated from college in search of the career launching first job. in a bright beautiful city. Sounds great until you add the boss. Weisberger paints a brutal but honest tale of what everyone on the outside sees as a great job but in reality is not all that it is cracked up to be.Excellent writing and attention grabbing though I really think that the ending is rather abrupt. It was a fun read and I could relate to the characters and their turmoil as my job takes the me out of me very often. Good beach book or rainy day book. Relatively quick read and laughs along the way."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved all the fashion references and behind the scenes kind of details of one of my favorite magazines. I love all things fashion, so if you are like me, then you will love this book! For a first time effort, Ms. Weisberger does a pretty good job. Long before the end of the story, I too wanted to tell her boss to F--K off and never would have endured the things that Andrea did. Since I know it's based on the author's own experiences with the Editor-in-Chief at one of my favorite fashion magazines, I think of this story everytime I look at it now, you can't help that! Hopefully this book has helped lighten the ways of that EIC for her future assistants. I actually listened to it on CD and it's a very short pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was just ok... nothing special but good if you're looking for an easy-to-read novel to take up your free time. It was rather funny in parts, but too much \\"telling\\" really makes you feel as if you are trudging through most of the narrative. Nothing special, very repetitive and I'm surprised that it was a bestseller for so long."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Gratuitous use of the \\"F word\\"Really disappointing ending...but what might be worse is by the time I got to it (they could've trimmed up the middle for sure), I could only care so much."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Don't get me wrong. The Devil Wears Prada is the perfect beach read. The main character of the book, Andrea Sachs, lands the job that \\"a million girls would die for,\\" working under fashion guru Miranda Priestly for Runway magazine. Andrea learns fairly quickly that the job a million girls would die for may actually kill her. Miranda Priestly is the biggest you-know-what in existence- she subjects Andrea to endless ridicule, criticizes her for the smallest infractions, and makes her run endless, menial errands. Andrea tolerates Miranda's ridiculous behavior only to further her aspiring writing career. As Andrea's life spins out of control, she drifts from her best friend, boyfriend, and family. Andrea must decide whether this dream job is worth the dream.As I said, the book is perfect for lounging by the pool on a lazy summer afternoon. Weisberger writes in a funny, engaging fashion and keeps the reader interested. Her characters are quirky and witty and the novel is edgy and sophisticated. However, the book is quite lengthy and after awhile I felt that Weisberger was starting to beat a dead horse. Like okay, we get the point, Andrea's boss is the spawn of Satan. The book became redundant and trite- Miranda continued to abuse Andrea in increasingly ridiculous ways, but nothing ever really changed. It was also kind of predictable. Obviously the job of a lifetime is going to come with strings attached, in this case less time for Andrea's loved ones. I don't know. It was a fun read but it's not like it made me a better person. I doubt I'll remember this book in a few years. I liked Weisberger' honest, fresh writing style, but the novel was just entirely too long. To sum it up, The Devil Wears Prada is a worthwhile read if you have nothing more pressing to do. That may be harsh, but it is the truth."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I positively loved this book even more than The Nanny Diaries. Andrea seems like a real person - even though she's 5'9\\" and weighs 115 pounds. She's warm, funny, smart and a little off-beat. Some of my favorite passages came from Andrea's difficulty in locating a vintage dresser for Miranda with only one clue: the street name or when Andrea had to find the newest Harry Potter book even before it was released. When she had to fly it over to Paris and messed up (she only sent one copy), I began to feel like I was reading about a high operation military maneuver. As I was reading the climax of the story, I literally was going 60 mph trying to get the conclusion (I had an inkling of what was going to happen). I don't want to spoil it because this book, no matter what age you are or where you live or your occupation, takes the reader right into the heart of a working place h*** and everybody will relate to that. The book grabs the reader right from the beginning (brings you back to driver's education) and never lets go. I got this book right when it was released and it's one of my favorites. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"However, a fun quick read. Purchased in airport read on a 2 hr flight, almost finished it. The story was fun and funny, I think most of us have had a boss we hated and although Miranda was over the top I saw some comparisons with bosses I have had. All in all I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading her next on."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you love reading the fashion rags, you won't be able to put this book down. It is clearly taken from real life, and though that makes it somewhat lacking in structure and plotlines, it is also the very reason you will be spellbound. Who wouldn't want to hear about all the nasty personality traits and weird habits that lie behind the perfectly made-up faces and rake thin bodies we enviously pore over every time we open up one of those super styled magazines? We're addicted to the dream, yet it's such a relief to read that the designer clad superwomen of our time are not perfect by far. The novel's creamy sauce of fashion glitter, over the top diva behaviour, wealth, power and nauseatingly squandering VIP habits, blends in well with the more substantial elements of humiliation and loss of personal perspective caused by professional ambition and working 24/7. Anyone who's ever worked too hard to get ahead at a job will recognise the signs. This is not great literature, but it is a very attractive and amusing look behind the scenes of the fashion magazine world; it puts the whole beauty thing back into perspective."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I used to work for a major fashion house in the early 1990s and this book reminds me so much of a couple of my bosses. I laughed and laughed throughout the book. Scheming, maniacal, people who totally lose it during Fashion Week every year, regardless of whether you are currently in Paris, Milan, or New York.You don't need to have worked in fashion to love this book. Anyone who has had an insanely obsessive-compulsive boss will relate to it. I loaned it to several co-workers and they all agreed that it was a fun, quick read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book! It kept my attention and was def. interesting. Yes, she could've expanded on her main character's love for writing and the ending could've been thought out a little more, but all-in-all this is a great read and hopefully an inspiration to everyone that has a less-than-desirable boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was enough to hold my interest to read the whole thing, but I didn't love it.It's a story about a college grad who starts her career at a fashion magazine as an assistant and has the meanest, most inconsiderate boss ever.The storyline was okay, but I felt like it was a continual gripe session about how horrible her boss was, how she was always hungry, tired and wearing uncomfortable shoes. The book would have been fine and much shorter without all of that.The character was somewhat likeable, but not developed enough for you to care about, as was the case with most of the characters. The idea of the story was pretty good, but there were so many possible things that could have happened that would have made it way more interesting. The largest crisis' were finding a Hary Potter book and a car accident.I walked away from this book feeling a bit unsatisfied. Seemed like there were still many loose ends. I listened to the audio version and she was quite good, which was probably what I liked most about this story.I am not sure I would recommend this book, but I didn't hate it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After having seen the movie about 100 times, (don't know why I liked it so much!!)I decided to read the book. I think the movie left me wanting MORE. I have to agree with one of the reviewers previously, when they stated that the ficticious book was mostly about the author. The nastiness regarding her boss, Miranda, was too far and few between for me, esp. since in a world such as hers I'm sure there was plenty to write about. I really would have enjoyed reading more about how Miranda was such a witch of a boss, and all the dirt and gossip, of which there probably was plenty. All in all, it took me 2 days to read, and left me wanting more nastiness from her boss.The Devil Wears Prada"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"There were definite changes in the movie that weren't in the book. Great \\"memoir of a devil-boss\\". Just make sure you read the book all the way through before seeing it on the big screen. You'll appreciate Meryl Streep's stellar portrayal and better understand this cold-hearted boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw the movie (Meryl Streep, Anna Hathaway) before I read the book. The movie was fantastic. The book: not so much. As I walked out of the theater I felt repulsed by high-fashion fabulousness -- at the same time that I wanted to head to Nordstom for a new outfit. But I found the book annoying. Meryl Streep brought the Miranda Priestly character to life more than I could do in my own imagination, and the Andy Sachs character in the book was more of a weeny than I could tolerate. My recommendation: rent the move from Netflix."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The dilemma of \\"Do I alter things about myself in order to please my superiors?\\" is not only a question for females. In fact, I tend to think that males are more likely to take the \\"I'm going to wear what I want and I don't care what anyone else thinks\\" approach to attire, and thus are more in need of pondering the initial question. I am not necessarily advocating that they should make changes, only that they think about it, and that they think about the potential benefits and consequences. This is not just a fun, funny read. It can impact your persona at work, and thus your relationships at work. Even if you're a male.I know this because I am, in fact, a male. Except on Tuesday evenings. Just kidding."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love chic lit. Bridget Jones and Shopaholic (esp. the first book in each series) were very good. Even though the characters in those books behaved rather ridiculously, they seemed somewhat believable for their characters. And the scenarios they were involved in were entertaining. I think that was missing from this book.I somewhat enjoyed reading about the extremes in the fashion industry with respect to eating, wearing the \\"right\\" clothes, and spending money extravagantly (as I am not in the fashion industry). I don't know if these are typical or are simply hyperbole in a fiction novel. Either way, entertaining to a point. Hence the 2 stars.The character's inner monologue was VERY repetitive. \\"Oh I hate this situation. Oh, but I can't quit.\\" Again and again. I was like, just quit already. Same with relationships with family and friends. The same sort of situations and dialog over and over.I also felt like something was just missing. After reading a few other reviews, I think it is the characters (other than the Devil herself) don't have much personality. Even Miranda Priestly is just sort of a cardboard cut out. What is the bitchiest way a person could handle situation X? That's what Miranda does. There was only one scene in a limo near the end of the book that surprised me.I only finished the book because I wanted to see how it would end (I almost always have to know). Ending was fairly cliched. Might as well have said, \\"And the moral is....\\" and used a short story format, rather than a novel, to do it.After the hype, I was interested in reading it. But, I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think this is your average, light \\"chick\\" read. It was just what I needed. I've been reading a lot of classical literature lately and I wanted something fluffy to take it easy while reading. This book was perfect for just that. It was an easy read. I was burning through it! It was enjoyable. It had me giggling. It also made me really want to go shopping for things that I could never afford. (What can I say, I'd love to own a Louis Vuitton or a Gucci, but probably never will!)Overall, it was good fun. I'll probably hold onto my copy and read it whenever I want something light for a rainy day. :)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Some have said that this book is rather choppy or not very well written. I agree that it is not a masterpiece but I do find it amusing and worth buying. Perhaps this is true since for me, fashion people seem to be from outer space; and so a book showing the machinations of a fashion goddess like Miranda fascinates me.Who could believe that any boss, even a spoiled brat fashion-guru, could be so devil-like? By the nature of the book, it is episodic since it adds one anecdote to another in describing Andrea Sachs', a sweet young girl's, encounter with hell.The Devil Wears Prada reminds me of a superior book, Tom Wolfe's excellent I Am Charlotte Simmons, in which a brilliant young woman from the mountains of N. Carolina arrives at a high-powered university resembling Duke or Stanford or Rice. There she has to deal with people just as alien to her experience, frat boys and jocks, as is the fashion world to Andrea Sachs.Perhaps I prefer Charlotte Simmons since she has the back bone and wit and wisdom to combat effectively the enemy forces while Andrea just takes it and puts others at risk by, for example, driving around in a stick shift car while talking on the phone and feeling terrified that she may crash any moment. Perhaps that is supposed to be funny but I just find it disturbing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"On hearing about the movie that was made from this book, I put it totally from my mind as worth watching or reading. But as life often does, it surprised me. The book was a birthday present for my 13 year old daughter, and after watching the movie (it was her turn to pick the rental for our Friday night!), I wanted to read the book.I have to say, I prefer the changes they made in the movie, but that aside what saves this book is Andy's decision at the end. Otherwise, it would have been just a fun book to read.The story introduces a world that is so far away from mine that it might as well be on Jupiter. I make sure my clothes are clean, match according to my tastes and appropriate for the situation. Catering to \\"fashionistas\\" isn't for me. I dated a man that thought I should dress better. We were listening to Madelaine Albright speak at the Wolfson when he looked around and said \\"All these women dress like you!\\" as if he'd thought to that day that I had coined some unique personal style. \\"Yes,\\" I said. \\"These are women that read!\\" That's not to say that intelligent women can't enjoy designer clothes if they want to, of course. Intelligent women can do anything! :) Personally, I'd rather spend my money on books.This is a good book for young women to learn that you have to \\"pay your dues\\" before getting the job you want.All in all, I learned something new and enjoyed a good story. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"One clarification: I read this book without seeing the movie. I do actually *have* the DVD, but I like to get through the book first so I do not have any preconceived notions on characters.The polt revolves around Andrea Sachs (who also narrates the book), a recent college graduates who \\"lucks\\" into a job as the junior personal assistant for the editor of Runway magazine, Miranda Priestly. As the lowest gofer on the business totem pole Andrea gets do to the lowest of the jobs, dropping off cleaning, getting food and coffee, answering phones, etc.Yes its a bad job, but its a role where a newly minted college grad can learn an industry by observation. The expectation is that after a term of service in this job, then the assistant can move up the latter into a different aspect of the business. After one year here she should be able to get her \\"real\\" dream first job, which is writing for the New Yorker.Miranda turns out to be a very demanding (to say the least) boss. She expects her assistants to be on call, any time, for any reason, and many of their tasks rely around the personal life of Miranda, and not her professional role as magazine editor. This takes the expected toll on Andrea's \\"real\\" friends, boyfriend, family and personal life.There are good parts to the job, however. Even though Andrea is the lowest at Runway, she can invoke her boss Miranda to get anyone else to do her bidding. She has a basically unlimited expense account (though little salary) and can have her pick (after everyone else on staff) of the latest designer wear.The book is reportedly an \\"expose\\" of the author's own job as an assistant to Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and thus shows a lot of mean-spiritedness toward the Miranda character. Miranda is written as a very hateful selfish woman who belittles everyone else in her life with the exception of a few who she toadies to. Andrea is, of course, just the poor little girl who is trying to do right and goes the extra mile and still gets grief for it. Anything that goes wrong, even when it is due to Miranda not telling Andrea what she needs to know, always gets attributed to Andrea's incompetance.Some of the episodes are no doubt based on real events, and do happen to be quite amusing (throwing out and reordering breakfast every 15 minutes because it has to be hot when the boss arrives) and to read the book for those episodes makes it worthwhile.The ending (which I won't describe here) I felt, was contrite, forced, and very sappy. The characters were exceedingly one dimensional. The whole Christian (a rival for Andrea's bf)/Andrea relationship just didn't make a whole lot of sense as well.I can see how this would make a decent movie script, since it is a very visual book and the one-dimensional characters would translate well into a movie setting. As a literary work though, 3 stars is being generous. Its been tagged as chick-lit and that tag works well.Skim it for the anecdotes, but as the dedication says there are only 3 people who believe this rivals War And Peace, and they are the author's mother, father and sister."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"entertaining most of the time, but the same scenario every time...got a little old..The author writes well, but this story should have ended after 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Best book I've read all year...If you liked Nanny Diaries or Confessions of a Shopaholic than get this book and get ready to laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The platform for this novel is great- it tells the tale of young Andrea Sachs, trying to make it in the vicious world of business competition, anorexic coworkers, fashion, and an incredulously unreasonable boss. However, I found that the novel, in general, was a disappointment. It is obvious that eventually Andrea will be forced to quit her job; it is silly that the entire novel drags along, causing her one disaster after another until she finally decides to quit. The weird part is that Andrea isn't into fashion and her passion for writing and aspiring to work for The New Yorker isn't presented strongly. I felt that the dialog for her boyfriend, Alex, and her coworker, Emily, is unrealistic. No one in real life talks in ridiculous paragraphs that sound like movie scripts without interruption. Miranda wouldn't be as highly regarded in real life as she is in The Devil Wears Prada. I have trouble figuring out if the author was into the wealthy lifestyle or not; a lot of the things about the novel confused me. The deterioration of Andrea's relationships was exaggerated; her trip and her homecoming were the same weekend, and then Lily's accident is during her trip too. Of course her boyfriend has to dump her and her sister have a baby and her best friend almost die in the same week. And, since Miranda was so horrible to her, why didn't she premeditate leaving her job? Why does she have to quit randomly without making a bigger scene than she did? It is frustrating to see her suffer for almost the entire year and then finally figure out that she wants to leave her job uttering only a few expletives. It could have been more exciting than that. Her next career option? Freelance writing for Seventeen..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a fun read for readers into chick lit. Light, fluffy: it doesn't take much to get through it. If you have ever picked up Vogue or Bazaar, you will get a kick out of the behind the scenes description at a fictional fashion magazine.The story is simple: Andrea Sachs, a recent graduate of Brown and an aspiring writer, takes a \\"once in a lifetime\\" job as an assistant to the famous (and infamous) Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine. Miranda is the ultimate boss from hell-and human from hell-whose outrageous demands and bizarre habits drive our heroine insane. The book basically chronicles one incident (tracking down Harry Potter books before publication and sending them to Paris) after another. Most are very funny.However, other than a serious of very funny fictional anecdotes, there is little else to this book. There really is no plot, zero character development and no insight. The author never really questions why or how Miranda turned into a she-devil and tells you absolutely nothing about the other fashionistas who work alongside her in slavish devotion to the magazine. The other characters-a saintly boyfriend, an alcoholic roommate, a snaky hot shot writer-are all one dimensional.Still, if you're on a hot beach this summer-and you don't need to be challenged-you could do a lot worse than \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\""},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada was an absolute great read. I found it quite funny and interesting before discovering the author, Lauren Weisburger's story behind it. It's nice to see young women telling stories from their point of view in the workforce. It sure made me remember how hard I worked not even five years ago. While reading the book, I also began to look at hard working \\"invisible\\" people differently and with more appreciation. If just a few people are effected this way by reading the book, publishing it was totally worth it. There was something in the book for everyone from Fashionistas to the ambitious to the naive to relate to and enjoy. Thumbs up Lauren! There should be a sequal, do include more traveling for Andrea when you write it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a fun, light summer book - perfect for this time of year. If you are looking for some great insight into the world of high fashion magazine publishing - this book is not it. I agree with other reviews that Weisberger is gramatically challenged - but she is also \\"story-challenged.\\" The book jumps around far too much between different times and characters for me to get a clear picture of her world. I have to admit that while her boss does seem more than unreasonable she does not embody the devil until the very last scenes. These are a couple of cloudy scenes where even Weisberger seems ambilivent about her boss. The supporting characters in the book are underdeveloped and seem to only serve to attempt to humanize the Andrea character. This book would be better served if the editor and author realized the lack of experience of the author herself and waited a few years to publish it.That being said, if you can look past the obvious errors in structure and grammar it is a fun read about the rich of New York that most of us will never see."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While the writing style of Ms. Weisberger is energetic and engaging, the book remains a superficial read. If one is to believe Ms. Weisberger's claim (made on her appearance on the Today's show on NBC) that she wrote the book to provide an insight into fresh college graduate's experience on her first job, then this book is interesting (even though 99.9% of all graduates will have different experiences). What this book lacks is an in-depth description of the actual fashion business -- and Ms. Wiesberger apparently had unprecedented access to important sources. Regrettably she dwells on the idiosyncrasies of her boss' lunch orders, schedule, office politics and the like, leaving one to think what an intresting book this could have been had Ms. Weisberger taken the opportunity more seriously."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Great book ! Very entertaining ,but not for kids because of the language ,and it is quit priced,Make it cheaper !"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I recently read The Devil Wears Prada by Laura Weisberger. In it the main character, Andrea Sachs, learns that one must put their relationships with loved ones before their personal ambition for superficial social positions and meaningless wealth. The book highlights the pretentious world of fashion, filled with greedy individuals, greedy for only the material things in life - money and fame.The author was extremely effective in conveying the multiple settings in the book. The story's backdrop is bustling and busy New York City. \\"Andy\\" lives in a small, shabby apartment. In contrast, her workplace (and where she is situated during most of the book) was described as nothing short of luxury. Andrea recounts her first impression of the Runway Magazine's posh headquarters, \\"doors opened silently, reverently, to a grand, stark white reception area. Beautifully chic furniture with clean, simple lines dared people to sit, ready to scream out in agony if anyone -horror!- spilled.\\" Descriptive words such as \\"grand,\\" \\"stark,\\" and \\"chic\\" really expressed the overall appearance of the setting Weisberger was trying to convey and helped paint a vivid picture in my head as a reader of the events to unfold.Another facet of Weisberger's writing, that was particularly effectual, was her depiction of the story's climax scene. After months of pure torture at the hands of Andrea's \\"boss from hell\\", Miranda Priestly, the poor protagonist has had enough. Upon being given one ridiculous order too much, Andrea swears at Miranda and describes the subsequent reaction, \\"She gasped audibly while her hand flew to her mouth in shock, and I felt not a few [people] turn to see what the commotion was. They'd begun pointing and whispering, themselves as shocked as Miranda that some nobody assistant had just said that -and none to quietly- to one of the great living fashion legends.: The audible gasp and the way Miranda's \\"hand flew to her mouth in shock...that some nobody assistant had just said that to one of the \`great living fashion legends'\\" really puts me right in the action of the scene, with me silently rooting on Andrea's uprising.Another reviewer (Kimberley Wilson) stated, \\"If you love fashion and gossip, The Devil Wears Prada will make you smile. If you want a terrific book, this won't be the one you're looking for\\" and she is absolutely right. This book is not meant to be an intellectual read, but simply a light and fun book to read. It is trendy and fun and boasts style over substance. The various designers and fashion industry aspects of the book make it an enjoyable reading experience, but it is by no means a fictional sensation. The plot is slightly predictable but the easily lovable characters will keep you enthralled.One quote that really clinched the author's writing style for me was when she detailed Miranda coming into work and the chaos that ensued, \\"As I raced out of the office, I could hear Emily rapid-fire dialing four-digit extensions and all but screaming, 'She's on her way - tell everyone.' It took me only three seconds to wind through the hallways and pass through the fashion department, but I had already heard panicked cries of 'Emily said she's on her way in' and 'Miranda's coming!' and a particularly blood curdling cry of 'She's baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!\\" What I liked about this style was that it was very realistic and gave me an exact idea of Miranda's personality and the perception of her staff towards her. The over-dramatized interpretations added to the overall charm of the story.Bottom line, I would recommend this book to a friend as a fun and breezy read. It is light and funny and serves as an easy reading experience for anyone looking to be entertained by a cute, fashion-y book. The fashion industry aspect and the enchanting characters make this an engaging story. Additionally Andrea's wry sense of humor and perfect comedic timing adds to this already delightful read. This is a must-read for any fashion-loving, gossip-enjoying bookworm."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger can (and does) say in ten words what a skilled writer could say in one.The result? What could have been a sharp, satirical novella clocks in at 360 pages of non-stop whining.I won't be finishing this one. If I want to listen to New Yorkers complain about their publishing jobs, I'll go talk to my co-workers."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The only possible reason for reading this book is to see if Anna Wintour stand-in Miranda Priestly is the worst boss ever. She is. However, unlike The Nanny Diaries, this book is so poorly written that by page 300 or so, you couldn't care less is Miranda had her young assistant Andrea drawn and quartered. There are a collection of characters so poorly drawn, serving only to satisfy the author's whim at the moment, that any arc is rendered flat and you find yourself waiting for the next Miranda outrage, which, after the twentieth one, is no longer shocking. Is Emily a back stabbing co-worker or a comrade in arms? Will sweet boyfriend Alex dump job-obsessed Andrea? Does funky best friend Lily have a drinking problem? Will Andrea survive this job to make it to The New Yorker? Who cares? After reading this book, I promise you, you will not care. Watch the final season of Sex and the City and you'll get the same fashionista flush as you had hoped you'd get from this pitiful book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book started off fun and then you realize that all this girl does is rant and complain...all the time. By the time you reach the middle of the book I didnt think her &quot;monster&quot; of a boss was mean enough to her. MY GOODNESS...keep this character and the author quiet."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The fundamental premise of this ludicrously stiff and artificial novel is simply this: a struggling young writer takes a job with a nightmare boss in an attempt to gain a foothold in the magazine world. And Miranda Priestly is, indeed, a nightmare, but she's the SAME KIND of nightmare throughout the book, and her ridiculous antics, rather than seeming either shocking or comical, come across as boring, predictable, and contrived. Alex, the heroine, doesn't make the experience any easier--she's whiny, inarticulate, and, judging from the quality of her dialogue, should be kept far, FAR away from writing, as, in fact, should her author. It's worth reading, if you have absolutely nothing better to do, but if you're looking for worthwhile literature, you're better off reading a romance novel, which, at least, has a long-standing tradition behind it, whereas this novel and its similarly wooden sisters are the products of untalented young women with nothing better to do but whine."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"ms. weisburger can't write. it is a tragedy that so many talented writers are unknown and poor and a [person] like her has so much recognition. it's hard to care for her protagonist when she complains about the fashion world yet simultaneously eats it up, and her caricature of her boss is more schlocky than convincing. but of course, she gets a job at another publication, where her editor worked for the very same monster the book is about. how convenient. ..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's books like these that perpetuate stereotypes that young, upper middle class new york women must necessarily behave in a snobby, pretentious, racist, self-important, ungrateful, and (at least in Lauren Weisberger's case) untalented hack wannabe writer manner.Weisberger is apparently from the school that dictates that being sarcastic, \\"jaded,\\" and unpleasant to strangers and muttering mean comments under one's breath automatically makes a person witty and \\"in.\\"Note to Weisberger -- you are SO out."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book because the basis of the book peeked my interest.

I'm relieved that I'm not alone. I bought a used copy at the bookstore by my house, thinking I'd enjoy a nice, \\"flip\\" summer read, but all in all, I'm pretty disappointed. I feel like I could have written this book in a weekend, and I don't know squat about fashion. There's not much plot here, and really, not much point from what I can tell, and I'm on page 152.It's got some cute parts, and then some really ridiculous parts (when the lame-o security guard at her building requires her to sing Spice Girls and Madonna before he'll let her pass, I literally rolled my eyes).I'm quitting now based on what I've read here.

It was plain and simple funny. This is a great read for anyone who has ever worked in an industry which takes itself way to seriously, i.e. fashion, advertising, entertainment. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the situations this poor assistant found herself in. The author does an excellent job of outlining the job and boss from hell. A great summer read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I would rate this book at less than one star, but I give it one star for the title which urged me to buy it. Not only is the book written by someone who has the literary skills of a junior high school student, but the story line is one dimensional and silly.Also, I'm starting to believe that the ugly business of product placement,is creeping into American &quot;literature&quot;, (if you want to call this stuff literature). In the first chapter alone I must have counted at least a half a dozen references to product marketed by or for Americans, everything from a big black Lincoln Nav, to &quot;Manolo's, to Jimmy Choo. Is this author earning a little or even a lot of money on the side by taking from marketing agencies?This novel is about as satisfying as a bag of potato chips or a Big Mac. (Oh, excuse me, it was Burger King that is mentioned in chapter 18). I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good satisfying read. Actually, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone at all. I'm ashamed of myself for buying it. For some reason I thought it would be an interesting and thought provoking study on the fashion buying habits and trends of America. But it's not. After all, that kind of study would require a great deal of research and time, and this book feels to me like it was written over a period of a weekend.If you are the type of individual who is searching for a clever and thought provoking analysis of American fashion and style trends, or if you enjoy a well written work of fiction, this book is not for you.

I must confess that I read the reviews on this site before buying the book- at a discount retailer I might add. Don't worry-the front cover wasn't ripped off.I must admit that I was a little surprised by how vicious and negative the reviews were about this book. I felt as though Ms. Weisberger's tale might have been a tad true and all the negative reviews posted on the site were from people who worked for Vogue Magazine who were pissed off that Ms. Weisberger was spilling secrects about how vapid their lives really were.Fashionista's fighting back!I was convinced that some low level Vogue assistant, all anorexic fingers and bulging eyes, was furiously typing bad reviews in hopes of sabotaging Ms. Weisberger writing career. Trying to keep a good woman down.I'm sure that Ms. Weisberger is a good woaman. I'm afraid that is not the case with her book. This book was ....well... how do I put this lightly....sorry to saying....but it was BORING. I was bored reading it. I tried...oh HOW I tired to get into it. Hoping the next chapter would be the chapter that something, anything would happen...but it never was. I thought, maybe it's me? So, I lent it to some else in my office to read-she too couldn't get into it. I'm sorry Lauren, I think the idea was great. You really know your designer clothing and the situations-which I believe you lived through- were awful. I too worked for a bitchy boss so I know the things you illustrated does happen...but for the love of GOD could something dramatic have happen?

Totally lame ending, totally lame book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"...that's it. I had been wanting to read this book as soon as I heard about it. The main character, Andrea seems to be less developed than the so called &quot;devil&quot; character, Miranda Priestly. I was abhored by the selfishness Andrea seemed throughout the book, thinking only of how to advance her career but not noticing that all is not well with her boyfriend and allegedly best friend. Both call for help during the book, but Andrea is too absorbed in herself and the fashion industry. It is a contridiction that she works in the fashion industry because everyone basically tells her, she doesn't know how to dress.I find it a shame that I found Miranda, a woman who expected everything to be done for her as soon as she mentioned it, was more likable than Andrea.The pages of the book seemed to go on for-ever with nothing being accomplished. The best part of the book was when Andrea finally realized that there are more important things in life than advancing your career or being there to help boost one's own ego.Also disappointing in this book was I never found out why everybody jumped to Miranda's beck and call, especially when half the people didn't really know or care who she was. I also found it ironic that in New York that people would jump to someone as infamous as Miranda.On a side note to Laura Weisberger, don't judge all southerners by Elvis, who could show quite a tacky side. Oh, also, just because we have a slower drawl doesn't mean we have a lower IQ. Just ask any of our many novelists.If you must read this book, borrow if from a friend or library.

But that is exactly the situation Andrea Sachs finds herself in when she accepts a job at Runway magazine as the junior assistant to the Editor in Chief. Miranda Priestly is a demanding, ego-centric, selfish, b....strong willed woman who wants every demand met almost before she makes it. Andrea is a graduate of Brown University who's lifelong goal is to write for The New Yorker magazine. A more mismatched relationship never existed at Runway, but Andrea is making the best of it with the promise of promotions and recommendations to come. However, she must decide along the way if her deteriorating friendship with her best friend, boyfriend, and family are worth the career steps that she hopes she is making.Lauren Weisberger has delivered a funny and moving novel that hits home for anyone with career aspirations. Despite the extremes that these characters deal with, anyone who has had to cancel plans with family or friends because of work can relate to the tough choices that Andrea faces. Some of the novel is a bit over the top and unrealistic, but so is the world of fashion in New York. There are times when you just want to scream for Andrea to quit and she doesn't. *SPOILER* It is further frustrating to not see Miranda \\"get it\\" in the end.** But overall it is an entertaining and quick read that young professionals, in particular, will enjoy and recommend to their friends."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada has compelling plot about a recent college grad's first job working for an evil fashion editior maven. That ends what I thought worked well in the book.What didn't work well was the immature writing style which smacks of 6th grade girls' notes to each other; the thinly developed characters (especially Miranda who practically shows zero favorable traits) and the humdrum subplot involving the boyfriend and best friend.

Since I have a long commute and have recently gotten into listening to books;it helps the time go by quickly.

Mostly disgust for Miranda, and anger towards Andrea for allowing anyone to treat her with such utter disrespect. It definately captured the feel of NYC and the fashion industry, and gave the reader the feeling of stress that accompanies that lifestyle. (I actually had to put the book away for a day because just reading it stressed me out). Those things are all good, however I was very disappointed that as witty and intelligent as the main character, Andrea is, she showed complete ignorance by stereotyping \\"anyone who lives below the Mason Dixon Line\\" as a dumb Southern Redneck or hick. I pretty much lost all respect for both the book and the main character when this began to surface. It pretty much ruined the whole book for me and negated any redeeming qualities."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger's witty novel The Devil Wears Prada about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses is truly a cynical and comedic view on the modern working world. Weisberger captivates the attention of the reader through her recurring use of stream of consciousness. This literary device allows the reader to be in intimate contact with the narrator's true thoughts and feelings as they arise during her initial evaluation of a situation. The experiences of the character are raw in the sense that they have not been processed and restated or told to the reader by the author. In the case of the character Andrea Sachs, viewers see the revelation of her feelings towards her cosmopolitan job and nightmare boss. Andrea feels a deep, dark cynicism in her assessment of the superficial world of New York fashion and the modern world that is reflected in the lack of values that her job and coworkers display. The technique also reveals the humanity of Andrea's everyday views and actions as seen in the following passage where she contemplates asking someone to pick up her lunch since Emily was nowhere to be found. \\"After all, I was supposed to by the lunch fetcher: Oh, yes, darling, I'm simply too important to abandon my post here wrapping presents, so I was wondering if you might pick me up a turkey and brie croissant? Lovely\\" (62). In conclusion, the author's employment of stream of consciousness strengthens the novel's content and the effect it bestows upon the reader."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I purchased this book through Amazon.com right after another great purchase, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. Both books are semi-satirical and set in 'big, bad' New York City, but that's where the similarity ends. The plot for THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA revolves around Andrea Sachs, who graduates from Brown and gets a job that 'a million girls would die for.' She is the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Ironically, Andrea doesn't even want the job -- she has only accepted it because she thinks it will help her land her personal dream job: working as a writer for the New Yorker.

That's because the action takes place at a fashion magazine! (The jacket mentions Prada, Armani and Versace, in italics, no less.) Yes, it's superficial and gossipy. Novels that proudly describe themselves as &quot;delightfully dishy&quot; generally aren't known for nuance or subtext. Weisberger is a much better, more talented writer than Candace Bushnell, to whom she's been compared on this board. This book is nowhere near as good as NANNY DIARIES. But it is what it is -- a little tome that's easy to polish off and makes you feel better about your plain little off-the-shelf life."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I understand that this was not the most well written or suprising book, but I truly enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone looking to read a fun, easy book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I can't figure out how this book made the Bestseller list. It's the worst book I've read all year, and I read a lot. I loved the Nanny Diaries. This book isn't even in the same ballpark."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I listened to this book. It started off fairly good, but totally fell apart at the end. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this, because it really isn't worth the money. It's like the author couldn't think of a good ending for the book, so she just tacked on anything... it leaves one feeling very unsatisfied."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I've listened to the book on tape twice and I am getting ready to buy the paper-back book to read. This is such a light-hearted and funny book. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"not since reading 'bridget jones diary' a few years ago has a book caused me to laugh out loud.i enjoyed this book so much, not only for the laugher, but for the characters. you will fall in love with most of them, and identify with all of them.the book is full of fashion lines, descriptions and analysis, but even if your not a fashionista you will fine it funny and consuming.i highly recommend this book, to those who just need a light easy read, one to laugh and escape for the world for a few moments."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you aren't expecting award-winning fiction, just a fun romp and expose of the fashion world, then this book will deliver. I didn't go in with very high expectations. I knew this would be in the style of the Nanny Diaries, but in the end, I found it to be a much better book, because the main character was so much better developed. I got so caught up in the main character and my identification with her, in fact, that it took the other characters in the book to point out how poor her attitude at work was. I was going right along with it until other characters called her to task for her disdain for everyone in the fashion world.Weisberger's writing style was conflicted. She could go for pages using no other adjective besides \\"cool,\\" and then she would throw in a vocabulary word like obsequious in a decidedly un-elegant sentence. She seemed to be forcing her Cornell education not to go to waste, but the style wasn't consistent at all.For a fun look at the fashion industry and devilish bosses, as well as devilish employees who dish about their careers to the whole world, pick this up. Don't expect a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just didn't get this book. Didn't see what was supposed to be so funny about it. Andrea came across as a whiny complainer who, although she kept stating her fight against fitting in with the New York fashion world, seemed to secretly crave and yearn for it. She's also a masochist who consistently let someone mentally abuse her and came back for more. All under the guise of trying to move up into the journalistic world. Sheesh.There were parts that were humorous, but more were just boring. I didn't like the way the author rambled on and on and on, searching for that one-liner that would bring a laugh from the reader and never quite getting there."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After hearing about this book for ages, I decided to give it a try. Really, what is everyone all gung ho about? The character is unlikeable, although she obviously thinks that she's got the brains of a rocket scientist the way she looks down on everything and everyone around her at her job. Her relationship with her boyfriend is just plain old boring. The boss is a walking stereotype. I would have given this one star, but because I couldn't even make it through the entire book before I got bored and sick of the nauseating characters, I figured that wouldn't be honest because I don't know if the entire thing is bad - but most certainly the first half that I read wasn't worth all the press."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Unless you have lived the author's life, this is a truly tiresome book. It may hit the spot for 23-year-old women who are intimate with the fashion scene. For the rest of the population, it's a waste of time. The characters are badly drawn. The main character, for instance, is supposed to be smart and feisty. She dreams of writing for The New Yorker. Yet she chooses a year of exhausted humiliation over relying on her assumed intelligence and determination to secure her future. As a reader, I get that she is exhausted and that her job is rotten. That comes across loud and clear, but the author never moves on. There's no relief, no sense of the character actually growing or changing. Instead one long whine ends with the character acting as poorly and selfishly as those the book presumes to castigate. I'm not far from 23, I remember what it was like to begin working, but please...show us you can grow up or don't waste our time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up this book expecting a woeful sob story similar to The Nanny Diaries that would do little more than reassure me about my own unglamorous career choices. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed following Andrea's day to day experiences and meeting the characters she discovers in the fashion world. I thought the depiction of an arrogant Ivy League graduate discovering her own ignorance, incompetence, and ultimately, empowerment, was true-to-life and even inspiring. As beach reads go, this was a pleasant diversion, even though there were a few threads left hanging (what became of the stuttering travel writer? And where are things left with Christian?) I would recommend this book to those who will identify with Andrea- give it a read if you are recently graduating from Stanford and choosing between Morgan Stanley and writing the police blotter in Evansville, Indiana."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Imagine graduating from college and landing a posh job at the major fashion magazine in New York City. Such is the case of Andrea Sachs, a 23 year-old small-town girl who's more comfortable in a pair of Nikes than a pair of Jimmy Choo stiletto boots. As a junior-assistant to the awe-inspiring, evoking panic in you heart Miranda Priestly (just Miranda to you) - Andrea is forced to juggle her personal relationships, some semblance of a social life and all the while try not to forget how many \\"raw sugars\\" to put in Miranda's Starbucks tall latte every morning.One would think that landing an elite position that \\"millions of girls would die for\\" at a place like Runway magazine would be a proverbial walk in the park, but Andrea quickly learns - Miranda Priestly is to be respected, not questioned and most importantly - feared. While Andrea struggles to remember how to arrange Miranda's daily ration of magazines just so and how she likes her bacon arranged on her plate - her personal life beings to collapse. Her best friend Lily turns into a promiscuous raging alcoholic and her boyfriend begins to feel neglected.So why would anyone put up with the verbal abuse dished out by Miranda? Easy, once a year has lapsed in the position a recommendation from Miranda guarantee's that Andrea can almost pick and choose from her choice of jobs. So with her eye on the prize - Andrea leaves her personal life behind amidst a sea of \\"Yes, Miranda's\\", \\"I'm Sorry Miranda's.\\" and a slew of late night cell phone calls with ambiguous demands.The dialogue of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is quick and easy to follow. While it enhances the reading experience to be a bit familiar with the fashion industry - its designers and brand names, it definitely won't stop you from enjoying Weisberger's witty writing style or from laughing out loud. The novel definitely falls into that \\"chick lit\\" section of reading, but it is definitely engaging. Weisberger is adept at making you \\"feel\\" what her characters are going through - whether it's the anticipatory fear that Andrea feels when she thinks that she might have missed an all-important phone call from Miranda or the decisions she must face in choosing between Miranda and her own life.If you're looking for deep character analysis or a book that will cause you to ponder the troubles o' the world - this is not the book for you. If you are in the market to be entertained and to laugh for a bit - you'll probably like this. Weisberger has crafted in Andrea a character that you can get attached to. While Weisberger pokes fun at the size 0 girls who consider themselves fat that work at Runway, there is still that underlying feeling that there might just be more to be thankful for than to complain about.All in all, I'm impressed with \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" as it is Weisberger's first novel. She created a young, hip and entertaining read that can appeal to a variety of readers across the board. Another Amazon quick-pick I recommend is &quot;The Losers Club&quot; by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The only words of any literary merit to this shallow piece of absolute crap are in the title, it hooked me into buying it.The depth of this storyline (contact lens) sets ALL woman back years. The classic tale of the mean witch boss abusing the poor wittle, filled with dreams,overworked personal assistant. Where (boo-hoo) she (the personal assistant to the witch) gets to wear high-end designer fashions(supplied by the company) &amp; travel (wah!) .At her most gracious, the poor overworked personal assistant was buying Cappuccino's for the homeless- on the company dime- instead of just getting coffe for her boss. She sure showed her mean ol'boss &amp; helped the homeless, too. The author is a painfully shallow,self centered brat, in what is a thinly veiled autobiography.The ending shows our heroine at a fabulous party, dancing the night away &amp; making out with a famous author in Paris .Her wretched boss asks her personal assistant about a personal matter (how dare she!). Our Cinderella aquires the spunk to talk back to her the boss (in the most anti-climatic, UN-you go girl tell-off of all time) and leaves her &quot;really hard&quot; job.The downtrodden, shining pillar, of all that is good returns to New York, sells her haute couture gear the company supplied to her, for this trip to Paris (instead of returning it), for extra dough - enough to live on for a year. Now, she can focus on writing this thought provoking (Bleh. Gag. Vomit.) masterpiece.Stay away- run, do not walk away from this vile book -which by the way has made this poor wittle overworked girl with the really icky boss a millionaire. I am enraged/disgusted that I read this; I want those 2 hours of my life back."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK, so it's got a nice cover and got some good reviews, but come on! It's boring, and who cares about the main character? It's hard to get behind a character who hates and complains about everything yet is a toal hypocrite since she acts just as poorly as the people she bashes.Fashionistas - in the same category - is a MORE ENJOYABLE book. The story is fun and the writing is witty and humorous. I actually laughed out loud through most of the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I agree with the general consensus that the book had some fun parts, but was generally way too whiny and predictable. By the time I was 2/3 through I was mentally done with it.My point is that from the point of view of someone in her 40s, I can really, really see that it was written by someone in her 20s. The continuously preachy and annoying message that it is just SO wrong to expect anyone to do any personal tasks for you (even if you were told that was the deal when you were hired) and SO disgusting - so incredibly disgusting - to touch someone else's laundry. . .ya know - I just do think that titans of industry should be able to use their time for something else. And that we all have to pay our dues.So I guess I'm not in my 20s anymore. And I could tell that this book was written by someone in her twenties. As they say - beautiful to look at, but we're really not interested in what they have to say. More talented writers excepted, of course."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was one of the worst I've read in the last few years. Filled with designer jargon and the incessant whining of the main character, it was boring and a nuisance. Unless you enjoy people incessantly complaining about their boss and how much their job sucks, I really wouldn't recommend this book. The other thing that bothered me was the pure hypocrisy of the main character, Andy Sachs. She complains about the girls she works with and then becomes one of them. Maybe the book didn't describe things enough, but I also didn't think that her boss was that horrible and so her complains and whining just fueled my annoyance.If you want to know the storyline, rent the movie. It's a lot better and more worthy of the money. I saw the movie after reading the book and I thought it was much better than the book and was actually worth my time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Do not believe the hype. This book is so bad that it is not even worth a trip to the library. It is 360 pages of non-stop whining, complaining and stupid sarcasm. The worst part is, it is the SAME complaining over and over! The writer establishes at the beginning that the boss never says, \\"please, thank, you, etc.\\", but she insists on complaining about that on every page up until the bitter end that you pray comes sooner. The main character is a spoiled, snotty brat who complains that her boss is too demanding but she doesn't even follow through on the simplest tasks, like getting her coffee, without indulging in her own pleasures of smoking, talking with her boyfriend and taking coffee to people OTHER than her boss! She also has a problem that her boss doesn't really care about her and doesn't want to get to know her - welcome to the real world, Lauren! A lot of bosses are like \\"Miranda\\" you were just too immature to know that and realize that working in the fast lane is FAST! Also, if \\"Andy\\" complains page by page how exhausted she is, why does she go out drinking with her friends until 3 a.m.? Give me a break! You are not supposed to have it all right out of college - get a clue. \\"Andy\\" should go back to Connecticut where she belongs!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked this book a lot ... Didn't LOVE it, but liked it. Learning more about the fashion industry and the high-powered, power-hungry people who work in New York is fascinating. And then there are the normal, more-like-us, side characters who are everyday likable and make up for all the shortcomings of the upper echelon.The devil boss-lady, Miranda Priestly, is certainly as the title implies: mean, arrogant and disrespectful! What an unlikable woman, but she certainly knows her business. She needs to take a good course in management/employee relationships; she hasn't the first inkling of how to treat employees. (In real life, she would be sued for harassment.) But that's what drives the plot, so can't knock it. And it takes all kinds to make the world.The lovely, young heroine, Andrea, would be a very sympathetic character if she weren't so snooty. But her escapades and the \\"trouble\\" put on her by the mean Miranda is amusing and fun to read about. I learned to like Andrea through the book, but she's too unsophisticated for that magazine. Her main redeeming point is that she has some literary ambitions, but you'll have to read for yourself to see if she achieves them.All in all, DEVIL is an amusing, entertaining read. With Prada being the current \\"darling\\" of the fashion world ... right up there with the all-time biggies, like Gucci, Lous Vuitton and Armani ... well, it's a timely story and a to-die-for title. What woman who ever wanted Prada shoes or purses could resist this book. My sister saw the movie and she's raving over it, but then she's always been able to buy \\"designer\\" clothing, often revelling in them. I hear that Merle Streep is perfect casting for the role of Miranda, but why not? She's one of the best actors in the world.I was going to give this book four stars for quality, but gave it five because of the author's quirky, catchy, clever title."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lamest of all chick-lits. Good thing I didn't actually READ the book - I got the abridged CD - ugh. (long commute home) I got so fed up with the main character being a weak little spoiled ivy-league brat. This story proves WAY too many stereotypes about ball-breaking NYC women, and all the while the author thinks dropping random designer names is going to make the reader swoon. gag.This was so boring, I returned it for cash. Don't waste your time. Read anything by Kinsella instead for a better light chick-lit read. In fact, if someone ever gives you this book and says, \\"I was totally reminded of (fill in the blank)\\" or \\"You'll love it!\\" - you should be offended!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Characters were poorly developed. Read through the whole novel, the only thing you get is Andy had a very very bad job because of her nasty boss. There are no character building around Andy, her boss Miranda, her boyfriend Alex, Lily... From cover to back, it goes on and on complaining about the job, but nothing more! If you skip 200 pages of the book, guess what, you are not missing any plot, not a bit!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I wonder if all the bad reviews on this book are from people in the fashion industry...hmmm..in any case, this book is never marketed as 'War and Peace' as the author puts it. It's a light read-perfect for the summer or a cold winter day. I think most people can relate to the boss from hell and kudos to the author for having the guts to write this book. I tihnk we can all relate to being a lowly assistant treated like garbage. The best revenge is success--and this book is certianly successful. so if you're looking for a light summer read, and can relate to having a boss from hell--you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ok, so you've read all the negative reviews. I can't tell you that they're all wrong and this is a masterpiece...but it's not nearly as horrible as it's being made to seem.It is what it is, a fluffy summer read. Fun to think some of the gossip is true. Not edited very well.

It had been billed to me by others as being funny. Ha! It is not only not funny, it is tedious, trite, and annoying. The narrator makes ridiculous assertions too often to list them here (she's going to get a job at The New Yorker after having been somebody's personal assistant for a year? Huh? Maybe if she was Si Newhouse's personal assistant and the job was somebody at The New Yorker's personal assistant.) Do not waste your time on this. It is just plain stupid."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is &quot;beach book&quot; by all accounts.

If you liked Nanny Diaries, you will love this book.Hilarious and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"i had heard of this book through magazine reviews and while i have read similar books (shopaholic series- quite funny), i was very disappointed. I certainly didn't think it warranted the 300+ pages that it was (&lt;200pgs more appropriate i think) and i felt the author was was too descript on fashion items and not enough on the story. I kept reading the book in anticipation something exciting/unpredictable would happen (it never) and finished it thinking that as i don't work in fashion, maybe there were a few fashion in-jokes that I didn't get (giving it the benefit of the doubt). In all i agree with other reviewers that it's a beach read, but the length of it makes it too long to recommend it(who reads 300+ pgs at the beach, if you do i hope you wear sunscreen!). Read this book only if you have a LOT of time (which i have at the moment), not to satify curiousity (as i did) because you will end up disappinted."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm a 17-year-old student from AZ, and I LOVED this book. If enjoying this book means I'm shallow and immature, then I never want to grow up! I loved this book so much I even shared it with my mom! Some reviewers have said the book wears thin on the designer label references, and they've also said the characters are shallow and not memorable. Wrong! Andrea is an extremely likeable character, and the trials and tribulations she goes through are real and personable. All characters (Lily, Alex, and Christian (AKA Hot Smart Writer Boy) are well developed and not just secondary fluff. All in all, a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this book up because I thought it would be an entertaining read on my vacation. However I found it written in a scattered style and did not hold my attention. I mean it starts off with a gal trying to drive a Porsche in NY and then jumps to Andrea's life. A lot of time was wasted on character development. For instance, Ms. Weisberger spends an inordinate amount of time on a male writer that has a crush on Andrea. The books ending was about the worst I've ever encountered, you would have at least expected that Andrea ends up with the writer (due to the number of times he was brought up in the book), but no, you're left looking for that one last page that really contains the ending, yet left with nothing at all.This is a fluffy book that is a real waste of time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's pretty obvious that this was Lauren Weisberger's first attempt at a novel, because the book isn't very well-written and just doesn't &quot;flow&quot; very well at all. That being said, however, I found &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; to be incredibly entertaining. It's definitely a &quot;fluff&quot; book lacking any sort of brilliant literary genius and is solely meant to provide the reader with some light, amusing reading. It's easy to relate to Andrea as she deals with the trials and tribulations of working for the most powerful and sadistic woman in the fashion industry. The descriptions of Andrea's boss are hysterical, and Miranda's behavior will have you rolling your eyes, cursing out loud, and rolling into fits of laughter.The best parts of the book are the sections devoted to chronicling Andrea's professional nightmares at &quot;Runway&quot; magazine, which thankfully account for most of the story. There are several supporting characters that just seem to be thrown into the book at random intervals (Andy's boyfriend, her alcoholic best friend, that guy Christian that she's always flirting with...what is the POINT of that relationship?! It never goes ANYWHERE and just sort of hangs there!), and the plot screeches to a halt and really drags whenever these supporting players show up. It seems like the author throws them in there simply so they're around to wrap up the ending of the book, which is very anticlimactic, rushed, and pretty disappointing. I had an idea of how I'd have liked the story to end, and Weisberger only met my expectations halfway.For a first-time effort, this was a pretty good book: very entertaining and definitely worth reading if you're looking for something to keep you mindlessly entertained. I think it would have been much better if the supporting characters were a bit more developed (or cut out entirely: you could easily have shaved 150 off the book that way) and if the plot wasn't quite so jumpy. Still, I'm glad I read it. Miranda Priestly is a great character...I hope someone makes this book into a movie someday. It would be hysterical!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book just cashed in on its back stage access. Poorly written and the character was not likable. The Pop Star synchronization of book writing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Anyone who has worked in corporate American, and especially New York, will relate to this tale. While it's supposed to be about a publishing company, it could be almost anywhere, for there are lunatics running around in business pretending to be bosses and employees.

I just saw someone in my bldg. with the book in her hand in the elevator. I told her not to waste her time reading a couple hundred pages of whining and complaining...not to mention horrible dialogue, which shows nothing good about &quot;Andrea&quot; and her attitude regarding work. I think almost everyone could write a book like this.....except she has some nerve writing it about such a highly respected editor!

So, if you're in the mood, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"A few hundred pages of drivel. A complete hack job that reads like it was written by an opportunistic twit who had this idea on her third day at Vogue, thinks she is a far more talented writer than she actually is, and thinks that she is a far more profound individual and thinker than she happens to be..... The thinly veiled aspect is kind of embarrassing -- inserting Anna Wintour as a peripheral character in an attempt to be all &quot;Look! It's FICTION&quot; makes you want to sit her down and tell her &quot;sweetheart, you've gone this far, there's no saving your tail at this point....&quot;Skip it. The whole project casts a ghastly pallor on her moral fiber in the first place, but the Anna Wintour celebrity industrial complex needs to be stopped anyway. Not only that, but Miss LW comes off SO entirely high and mighty in her various media appearances -- as if she is doing the world a literary service by writing trash -- that it makes me want to hide the copies of this around every bookstore I go into just so people can't find it......"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Having worked for a woman very similar to that described in the book, albeit in Interior Design, I felt great sympathy for the main character, Andrea. There are some truly revolting people out there, and frankly you are better off getting out early on -I only spent 6 weeks there, as opposed to the year the main character put in - and this book was giving me horrible flashbacks.Apart from the similarities to my experience (which meant that in a lot of ways I didn't really enjoy the book as it brought back a lot of bad memories), I found the book shallow and fairly glib - there was no soul searching at any point except the end, and then that was fairly over dramatic. In addition, the novel was quite poorly written - ungrammatical and mostly consisting of \\"conversations\\" rather than descriptions. Reads like a screenplay."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After reading the champion tome, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" I think a more apt title may be \\"The BARRACUDA Wears Prada\\" because that is just what Miranda Priestly is!What makes this book so good you may be thinking? Miranda Priestly. She is so funny, and over-the-top. And Andrea has the patience of a saint. She stays on board with this witch, day in and day out because she has some delusional impression that Miranda Priestly can either \\"make or break her career!\\"Miranda Priestly is a terribly pretentious fashion maven that makes Madonna, Joan Crawford, and Karl Lagerfield look like chop-shop amateurs compared to her! Miranda takes great joy in badmouthing, belittling, and rudely ordering her staff around. Mostly though, her assistants Andrea and Emily take the brunt of her abuse.Andrea is a sweet young college grad from CT suburbia that gladly accepts her first job at \\"Runway\\" magazine in urban NY. This is the job that \\"a million girls would die to have.\\" Andrea often wonders who these \\"million girls\\" are and why they would want her job because it's certainly not all it's cracked up to be. Her official title is \\"2nd assistant to Miranda Priestly\\" but that is just a fancy title for slave. Sure Andrea gets nice cloths and works with lots of famous models and goes to cool parties. But her boss is a modern-day Freddie Krueger in stylish pumps!Miranda is so nasty, and condescending. When she barks out her extremely unreasonable orders (such as getting an advanced copy of the new \\"Harry Potter\\" book!) it is apparent that she has no care or concern because she never shows any dignity or gratitude towards her assistants. And Andrea can never ask Miranda to kindly repeat one her demands;...because Miranda considers questions from her staff to be one of the seven deadly sins...it's just as bad as wearing a polyester Wal-Mart knockoff!Also I kept trying to find some type of humanness, or sensitivity within Miranda. It was never revealed. In fact, I believe that Miranda may be a robot that is programmed to wear $100,000.00 designer outfits while she steps all over all the little people because I can't imagine a real person could be so incredibly heartless...?I really didn't enjoy how the book ended, though. I don't want to give anything away, but I do think the ending was somewhat anti-climactic. Also, reading about Andrea's friends and family was boring. But the salacious tidbits about Miranda more than made up for it.Please keep in mind that the book is very different from the movie. Aside from the basic plot (sweet girl works for mean-spirited fashion guru) there aren't much more similarities.I recommend this book to anyone that ever had a hateful boss like Miranda. I had one that was pretty repugnant but I am certain that anyone who reads this book will agree that no one is worse that Miranda Priestly!Lauren Weisberger is an awesome writer, thank you for writing such a funny and entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My friend insisted that I read this book so I picked it up thinking that it would be a light yet entertaining read. Though I'm picky about writing styles I knew not to expect much from this book and it's a good thing that I didn't. The author's writing style is choppy and amateur at best. I'm glad that I live near the beach because that's the only place I can justify reading this book.

Not only do I have no tolerance for weak characters, especially women, I have no patience for such ridiculous scenarios. There is no way anyone with any self respect would put up with such a ridiculous boss for any length of time. The only reason I finished this book is that it was a book club selection. I should have read the last chapter and saved myself the pain of reading the entire thing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As this book is clearly autobiographical, I think this book would have been much improved if the writer waited several years after her stint as an assistant concluded and then penned the book. Then, at least, the writer would have &quot;gotten over&quot; her need to avenge her boss and focused more on revealing the juicy aspects of the fashion world. The inside scoop on the world of fashion journalism was the only interesting part of the book and unfortunately, it took a minivan-size backseat to the author's incessant whining about her boss! The author is obviously young and naive because anyone who has been working for awhile has had to eat dirt for difficult people at one time or another -- however, it does not necessarily make interesting subject matter. The main character, Andrea, is unsympathetic because she has this sense of entitlement so that, despite being only a recent college grad with no skills or work experience (except at an ice cream parlor), she expresses on every other page how wronged she is because she is not obtaining solid writing experience at the magazine even though that fact was openly disclosed to her before she accepted the job as an assistant. Her attitude is bad, as her boss points out correctly, and you begin to feel more sorry for the boss for having an assistant who takes cigarette breaks when she should be working. Further, to its detriment, the book is filled with Andrea's (i.e., the author's) numerous unfair judgments of her co-workers and her boss (who cares if her boss wants two sugars with her lattes?). If she was a better writer she would have simply relayed her experiences at the magazine and let the reader go along for the ride -- instead I feel like I'm back in high school and the author is trying to force me to &quot;take sides&quot; in a fight she's having with her friend. Moreover, the unredeemable writing doesn't it make it any easier to get through either. (By the way, did anyone else think the boyfriend, Alex, was a jerk?)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you enjoy reading lists of fashion products you might enjoy reading this book, but even that's a long shot. There was so little story between the description of clothes that it was more like looking at the Fall issue of any fashion mag which would have been cheaper and taken less time. I could have forgiven it's lack of plot if it had been the least bit clever -- or if any of its characters had been the least bit clever. A waste of time even using it to get to sleep."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was relatively enjoying \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" until page 72 when Ms. Weisberger takes on the city of Houston as if she was being paid by the Southern Stereotypes of America. She refers to my hometown as the following: \\"city of misery\\", \\"Third World\\", \\"swamp\\" - to name a few.Now, I can take a ribbin' - in fact there are plenty of things about Houston to poke fun at. But this was vitriol, not humor. I thought about pointing out that a city with the 4th largest museum system, a world-class ballet, a Grammy winning opera company and a Tony award winning theater probably shouldn't be called Third World...but what's the point? I hope Ms. Weisberger comes to Houston on a book tour. She will find the people very friendly and courteous... even though we have those horrid southern accents she hates (New Yorkers sound like music?)So I'm returning my copy for a full refund."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Okay, so I don't usually read books that don't fall under the \\"literature\\" section of the bookstore. But when I found out that the main character went to my alma mater, I decided to read the book for myself. I wasn't expecting a classic work of literature (come on fellow readers...LOOK at the cover AND the title...) I did my research on the book and author and decided to see how she did...And I got exactly what I expected. It took me one night and a morning to read the book and at the end of it all I was satisfied. It had its funny parts, it was an easy read, and since I had a hellish job at a law firm straight of Brown in Boston with some anal retentive not-worthy-of-calling-themselves-human being attorneys, I could empathize. Remember what you are reading about, remember the title, remember the author wrote it straight out of college and stop comparing it to the Nanny Diaries...umm...it has...like, different authors...And you'll find yourself a quick, easy, entertaining, feel good book. Otherwise I hear that Jane Austen and James Joyce have some really good books on the market. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is the poor man's Nanny Diaries. Not only is the style eerily similar but so is the plot. It was painful to get through the book but I felt obligated to finish it since I paid $... for it. Spend your time and money on elsewhere; this book isn't worth it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The greatness stops with the title. This is part of a new genre of literature built around the success of Sex and the City and aimed at young women who dream of living in New York and wearing $1000 shoes while making $30,000 per year. It is mildly entertaining (emphasis on mildly) for escapist reasons, but I wouldn't put it in the category of a guilty pleasure. It is fun to think you could get a job where you have access to unlimited priceless designer clothes for free by pure luck, but that is about the only fun fantasy this book perpetuates. Unhumorous & boring. If you want to dream about wearing Prada and Versace buy a copy of Women's Wear Daily."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK....everyone who has an evil job out of college fantasizes about seeking revenge against their vile boss by writing a tell all novel. Did Michael Lewis start this trend I wonder?So I guess Weisberger is a bit more motivated than most since she actually finished her tome of revenge.Other than a window on wintour's obsessive ways, this book is pretty useless. And Weisberger's portrait on the back just makes the narrator smack of hypocrisy. With that absurdly perfect blowout we are supposed to believe that she's a happy go lucky bohemian intellectual right?????? Oh I forgot! It's not autobiographical. Yup!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Apparently all you need to have a bestseller these days is a semi-shocking title, for there is no other reason for this book to be so popular. The book is impossibly long with chapters that never seem to end and a storyline that is painfully repetitive and goes nowhere. We start with a typical Miranda Priestly moment, in which the infamous editor of &quot;Runway&quot; magazine is ordering poor little assistant (and narrator) Andrea around. Andrea then flashes back to when she naively accepted the job and every belittling thing Miranda has made her do since. We never return to that original scene, mind you, but rather pass it at some unnamed point and proceed to the end of Andrea's job stint. And while the climax is somewhat satisfying, its punch is diluted by the two (yes, TWO)interminable and trite chapters that follow. Meanwhile, every one of the characters (with the possible exception our narrator Andrea) is entirely two-dimensional and instead of caring for the people that were supposed to matter (Andrea, her boyfriend Alex whom I only had lukewarm feelings towards, and her &quot;best friend&quot; Lily who had more problems than a math test), I found myself more intrigued by Miranda and her yes-girl Emily (the senior assistant whose occasional comraderie with Andrea seemed forced by the author). The subplots are poorly developed, largely forgettable, and generally unresolved as well - all in all unnecessary additions to an already verbose novel that could just as easily been a short story in Cosmo.The bottom line: Read FASHIONISTAS by Lynn Messina and published by Red Dress Ink. It has a very similar concept but is better structured, faster paced, and much much funnier."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read the Nanny Diaries and really liked it. Not the best book ever but fun reading. That is what I was hoping for with the Devil. I began the book not totally enthralled but hopeful because my sister and my mother both highly recomended it. I now am questioning their taste in books. I find Andrea to be an annoying and weak person. It seems that every time she takes a stand, someone is able to talk her out of it. Also, many of the other characters are very inconsistent. Emily, for example, to the reader is totally devout to Miranda and never really says abything too horrible. Then all of a sudden, in the middle of the book Emily goes off the handle because Miranda wanted her to confirm a hair and make-up apointment. I don't even want to get into how it seems that Lily walks all over Andrea, she just does! The chapters wander in and out of the present and the past which adds to the confusion. I found myself at times yelling at the characters in the book (not Miranda though) and I do not believe that was intended. I was a Creative Writing major in college and if I had EVER handed in something like this, I would have been laughed at. On a lighter note, Miranda does some entertaining things and I mostly enjoyed knowing that she was upsetting Andrea."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's a quick, light read. I have also known a boss similar to Miranda, thankGod I wasn't her assistant though!There are some funny parts &amp; the occasional one-liner, but all in all, it wears a little thin. The main character is incredibly naive for most of the book &amp; we're expected to believe she suddenly smarts up in the rushed ending. One would think that she'd develop a survival instinct over the course of the book. The characters are a little 2-dimensional and the main character doesn't develop over the course of the book (except at the very, very end).It's a great book to read on the plane, I certainly wouldn't pay the full hardcover price for it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Initially, I thought this book was going to be a fun light-hearted read. I was disappointed to discover that rather than being adventurous, this book was nothing more than a long list of whiny complaints made by the narrator, Andrea. There is never a moment when Andrea is actually happy and content, which eventually drains the reader and contributes to the fact that this book is just one big headache. I only finished due to curiosity, but the ending is so predictably anti-climatic that I found myself feeling no emotions at the end. Save your time and read something fun with a rewarding ending such as I Dont Know How She Does It by Allison Pearson."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found \\"the Devil wears Prada\\" to be a bit boring. I admit that I am a sucker for the recent glut of twenty/thirty-something tales of making it on the world but the plot was nonexistant. I kept waiting for something REALLY aweful to happen and Andrea would save the day and finally get her job at the New Yorker but no...nothing. This book feels more like the author complaining about her days as an assistant to the Vogue editor than a novel. Weisberger tries to add some other characters such as Andrea's pregnant sister but it fails miserbly to take the reader anywhere. Weisberger should have just stuck to writing a memior about her days as a fashion editor's assistant. Also, I think that this book was poorly edited. I found a few grammer mistakes and many sentences that felt out of place--as if they were supposed to be edited out but got forgotten. Leave this book on the shelf where you found it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was quite a quick read; in fact I was already at page 250 when I realized that nothing of real interest had happened yet. Rather than the witty and charming protagonist I expected, Andrea Sachs is predominantly unlikeable, rarely displaying any attractive characteristics. She's snide, rude, and negative. I have no doubt that the story is entirely autobiographical, simply for the reason that no writer would conjure up such mundane information, only to quickly pass over what could have been entertaining moments. Finally, for a person so critical of fashion magazines, it is notable that her book reads as though it was meant for nothing other."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked the premise of the book, however, found it to be very poorly written with weak character development. Unlike in Nanny Diaries, it is difficult for the readers to feel any sincere connection to the characters, main and secondary. I had little sympathy for Andrea as she seemed completely lazy in her employment role. Part of an assistants job is to figure out the missing pieces of a demanding boss' puzzle. I have had one such boss. One example is when her boss tells her to find a review in &quot;The Post.&quot; Ms. Sachs assumes it must be the NY Post and when she doesn't find it there fails to think of other &quot;Posts&quot; in the media. I immediately thought why not try the Washington Post, duh. Later, after asking the boss again, she is informed to check the WPost. And, this Andrea character was way too whiny and annoying for me to be anybody's heroin. Always soooo tired. Wah Wah.Anyway, an overall entertaining but much too forced and under developed effort to make me recommend the book - though I am sure that the title will sell the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked the premise of the book, however, found it to be very poorly written with weak character development.

The movie is actually much cleaner and more interesting than the book. My advice- watch the movie and don't waste your time reading the novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love the movie that was made based on this book so I had very high hopes for the book. Unfortunately, I was devastated to find that the author doesn't know how to write a book. She jumps all over the place, with a lot of \\"remembering back\\" moments. Now I know why the movie was made to be so different from the book. They are hardly the same in any way other than the very basic story line involving the Editor in Chief of a major magazine that is bossy and demanding. Seriously, I would save your two cents on buying this book if I were you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Great concept, great title, unfortunately Ms. Weisenberger is a terrible writer (not that she's likely unhappy with how she's done with this!). It's so rare that a movie is better than the book - but in this case don't even bother with the book. It's far too painful to attempt to read. Save your money and rent the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As someone who has lived in New York City and has worked with horrendously miserable people with power - which was the main reason I decided to read this book - I know very well how a person can get stuck in Andrea's situation. You're fresh out of college, you are desperate for a job that might advance your career, and this seemingly glamorous opportunity comes along. Quickly you learn that things aren't all that glamorous, and you know you're being mistreated, but you think there really aren't any other opportunities out there, and you just need to make it through this. Besides, you feel like you're getting invaluable experience by suffering through it because your boss knows so many people and has so many potentially useful connections.The problem with Andrea is that she remains an unlikeable character throughout the book. Unlike those I've known in real life who have been assistants to insufferable people, I don't feel sorry for her. She tries to cheat the system by taking 10-20 minutes longer than she needs to on every errand she's sent on because she needs to smoke a cigarette or use her cell phone, and she cheats the company out of all sorts of money, but she can't even be bothered to treat her boyfriend or best friend decently during that period of time. She wastes food constantly and doesn't seem to care. After several months of working for Miranda, she still offers her stupid explanations and excuses when Miranda obviously isn't interested in hearing them. I feel like we're supposed to empathize with Andrea and cheer her actions in the end, but she is written as a lousy employee, a lousy friend, and an altogether lousy person.Aside from that, for what this book is, it could've been at least 100 pages less. By the time I got maybe halfway through it, I was starting to skip every paragraph that clearly existed only to describe whatever fashion was involved with the given situation. Yeah, we get it - everyone at Runway wears really expensive clothing. If all I wanted were descriptions of fancy designer clothes, I wouldn't bother reading a 300+ page novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's a pretty good book.

I found the novel \\"well written\\" and difficult to put down, and thought it was better and more detailed than the movie. I don't understand the comments and have no idea what is meant by she doesn't write well (or is it good)? and that her writing is ungrammatical. I have a hunch that Gertrude Stein or William Burroughs would have said ____ __.

In The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger, Andrea Sachs is a woman who has just graduated from college. She finds herself in a job that \\"a million girls would love to have\\". This extravagant career is to be the personal assistant of Miranda Priestly, who is the legendary editor-in-chief of Runway, the finest fashion magazine in all of New York. To Andrea, this job is just running errands all day and getting yelled at by her boss. She is determined, though, to work for Miranda for at least a year, because she thinks it will open lots of doors for her and then she might finally get her dream job: to work at the New Yorker.As Andrea improves and works harder for Ms. Priestly, her personal life gradually starts to fall apart. Her best friend, Lily, is furious at her, until Lily gets into a major accident, and Andrea still \\"has to work\\" so she can't come to visit her in the hospital. Also, her boyfriend of three years, Alex, dumped her because she changed so much as a result of her horrendous job. On top of all that, her sister, Jill, just had a baby. Andrea hasn't even visited the baby who is now three months old. Andrea has to make a choice: does she want her entire life to revolve around Miranda Priestly and Runway? Or should she abandon her fashion-filled life and even maybe her chance at her dream job to join her friends and family at a time when they need her most? Either way, there are issues for our heroine in this exciting one-of-a-kind chicklet!Once I began to read The Devil Wears Prada, I couldn't stop laughing. At one point in the book Miranda received 256 presents for the holidays from a variety of designers and other famous people. It was Andrea's job to unwrap each gift and decide whether or not Miranda was permitted to see it. If it was electronic, it was unacceptable. If it wasn't custom made for Miranda, it was unacceptable. I thought this was an amusing moment because it shows the difference between an ordinary person and a person who is extremely wealthy. Most of the parts in this book are comparing the ridiculously rich and the people who are just making enough money to pay the rent. There are so many ridiculous and breath-taking moments in this book that it will keep you turning pages and never want to put it down!One of the themes in this novel is how challenging it is for a young adult to balance two incredibly essential values: her friends and family, and her career. It shows that no matter how important your job is, your friends and family are there to support you and you will always need them to help you get through life.As a result of Lauren Weisberger's witty characters and her excellent writing skills, The Devil Wears Prada is now a major motion picture and a huge success. So if you like exciting fashion-filled novels, this is absolutely the one for you and you'd be a fool not to read it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was very monotonous and predictable. I fault myself for not doing a little research before buying it. Since it was made into a movie, I made some assumptions that it was a good read. Clearly, the casting and eye-candy made the whole concept worthwile as a movie. However, the book really fell flat. The characters were not engaging and the plot could be stated in one sentence : I had a very demanding job with a horrible boss where I got to wear great clothes and get a glimpse of the fashion industry. I was expecting some sort of revelation about what makes Miranda tick or what Andrea learned from the experience. But it seems that Andrea does not have enough depth to have really learned anything. Save your time and money and just watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"But isn't most chick lit? Its starting to seem that way. For years I've passed DWP in the bookstore and scoffed at a book with a designer's name in the title. Then the movie came out, and it looked fun and I love Meryl Streep. After seeing the movie, which was fun enough, I decide to go get the book and give it a read. Half way through I'm sure it will end up being used as a coaster for iced coffee for the rest of the summer. There is absolutely no plot, and if I hadnt seen the movie, I would know she would quit in the end, not in a cop out way but a \\"noble\\" way. Andrea has absolutely no personality and shes so inconsistent. One days shes wearing prada and obsessing about her weight, the next she's above all things fashion and beauty oriented and can't wait until she's a super intellectual writer at the New Yorker. Its so annoying that every character in the book goes to an Ivy League school, I can't believe half the stuff in the book got past Lauren's editor, not to mention made it to the big screen."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was thrilled at the thought of reading a book about high fashion and a mean boss. When the movie previews started airing, I decided to read the book before seeing the movie. Don't bother! The writing is mediocre, and the story - wait, there isn't one. It is a quick read, but I think that's because you're desperately waiting for something to happen. And when you finally get to the end, it's as if the editor said, ok, wrap it up in the next 10 pages. The ending is totally dissatisfying and well...dumb. I have heard the movie is very fun though, and that Meryl Streep is amazing. If you're considering reading this book, I suggest you skip it and make a bee-line for the nearest movie theater instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book starts out great. It's cheeky and funny.. but this books big problem is that the plot is to thin. So, your boss is crazy.. then what? The answer to this is nothing!

After about 200 pages, the jokes gets old and you just want it be over.."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a quick and light read.

That's always a sign of a book worth purchasing, so I did. It was, overall, an enjoyable piece of fiction.Sure, like some of the other reviewers, I would have liked to have seen other sides of Miranda's and the \\"Runway\\" characters, but ah well, the book is still at it's best when she and the \\"Runway\\" characters--in every sense of the word--appear. These women often times seem not human in their villain ways, though it's still a fun read. Otherwise, chunks of the story are \\"told\\" rather than \\"shown\\", but there is still enough to keep the pages turning and the reader wanting to see what Andy has to endure next.Bottome line, The Devil Wears Prada is a bestseller for good reason and is worth the read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was an easy read and interesting. There are so many parts of the book that you know are so very true. In the world of fashion there is always drama. I recommend this book to those who are looking for light hearted reading coupled with fun."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Maybe this book should have been a fictional memoir of a fashion assistant's life. While I enjoyed Weisberger's contemporary approach, I found that the content was entertaining but after awhile, it's like, \\"C'mon with the turning point!\\" If you're into chick lit, fashion, NYC, magazines, then this is definitely a novel for you. It took me longer than usual to finish, because it isn't quite the page-turner...but it's so cosmopolitan, stylish, and savvy. A must-read for young women."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you are a fan of Bergdorf Blondes then you will love this. It's kind of written in the same vain. It's funny and entertaining and a good light read.As someone who has had a [...] for a boss, I could totally empathise with Andrea. She accepts a job as an assistant for the head of Runway magazine and things go south from there. What a cow. She is demanding and draining and Andrea is not like some of the snobs she works with. Imagine working in an environment where you can't go to the toilet or get lunch if there is no one else in the office even if they have 'stepped' out for four hours?This is a funny look at life working for someone you hate, but knowing the job can take you where you ultimately want to go, you stay. I can't say I've been treated like Andrea has, but it's still relatable to many people. I can't wait to see the movie version with Meryl Streep as Miranda and Anne Hathaway as Andrea. Looks like that will be as fun to watch as this was fun to read. I highly recommend this to people who love light humourous books."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As a trashy novel, this isn't half-bad. No, it's not social satire on the level of Tom Wolfe, but as long as you understand that and accept it for the mind candy that it is, you might enjoy it. No, it has no discernible plot. No, it's not particularly well-written. Yes, the dialogue is rather pedestrian. Let's face it, it probably wouldn't have been published if it weren't based on a real-life person, but that's half the fun of reading it and it's an entertaining read, a guilty pleasure like a fast-food meal that you allow yourself to indulge in once in awhile but that would get nauseating if you ate all the time. It's totally disposable.And I thought the ending was perfectly fine, I have certainly read far worse endings than that (um, the Da Vinci Code?)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a complete copy of the Nanny Diaries with less subadtance. if you want a quick funny read, read the Nanny Diaries instead of this imitation."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I know this book proclaims NOT to be about Anna Wintour, but the descriptions of life at Conde Nast are dead on.

And the grammar is the worst I've ever seen in published writing... which is particularly astonishing since the narrator/heroine claims to be a graduate of Brown with a burning desire to write for The New Yorker.

Instead, she winds up starting out as an editorial assistant for Runway, a fashion magazine, in New York City. Andrea assumes that her one year spent there will result in an excellent recommendation to any other magazine of her choice. However, her boss, Miranda, winds up being the boss from hell. She is nasty and thinks that the world revolves around her. Andrea winds up being more of Miranda's 7-day-a-week personal assistant, rather than her weekday editorial assistant. Andrea is forced to keep her cell phone on at all times (including weekends), just in case Miranda needs something. Soon enough, the 7-day-a-week pressure that Miranda puts on Andrea, as well as her personal life, takes its toll. At the end of the story, Andrea is left to choose between the sought-after recommendation or continuing to receive Miranda's abuse.I thought that this was a fun story to read. I agree that it was a little too long and repetitive, but I don't agree with those who said that it was a waste of time and money. The format was similar to last year's, 'The Nanny Diaries.' I recommend this book to those looking for a light, summer read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was almost embarrassed for the author as I read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" due to the fact that the exact same story was written last year by the co-authors of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\".

I found myself wondering if it was just bad luck that \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" got published first, or if the author of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" actually knew of the prior and shamelessly copied those writters style."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although she was given an enormous opportunity to work alongside some of the most eccentric, talented, influential, and fashionable people in the world, Lauren W. failed to capture her experience on even the most obvious level. The biggest problem with the book is that it doesn't say anything - lists of tasks and errands do not make for fascinating reading. The characters at the magazine are oversimplified when seen through the eyes of our narrator, whose snotty attitude prevents her from seeing deeper than the designer clothes. This book is just a bitter tome written by an angry girl who cashed in on the name of the woman who employed her - employed her when no one else was offering. Unfortunately the narrator's insecurities about her lack of &quot;perfect hair, perfect shoes,perfect body...&quot; prevented her from seeing anything at the magazine other than that."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Let's face it, people: when you pick up a book titled \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" you're probably not assuming that you're going to go on an odyssey teeming with profound insights on life. (At least, I didn't.) But, having thoroughly enjoyed the film with Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep, I figured I would enjoy the book at least as much, since the books are usually better than the movies. Alas, it seems that Lauren Weisberger had about as much to do with the film version of her book as Candace Bushnell had to do with her book's television incarnation, \\"Sex and the City.\\" And, like Bushnell's case, the film of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is better for it.The book is overlong and rambling, and that's not even the biggest problem. Weisberger's characters are poorly developed and shallow. Miranda Priestly is beyond unpleasant and unkind for no reason. Now, characters who were villains for the sake of being a villain were fine when we were three years old, but come on, even supervillains in comic books usually have a reason that they are the way they are. Not Miranda Priestly. No explanation is given, no shred of humanity revealed.Then there's the protagonist. She is completely wrapped up in herself, and, worse, she's not even consistent. She alternates between being \\"above\\" the other employees at Runway, the fictional fashion magazine at which she works--a charge rightly leveled at her more than once by fellow assistant Emily--and making snide remarks about other people's fashion, about which she's supposed to be so amazingly unaware. Tell me, does it really compute that someone who claims not to know how to banish panty lines because she hadn't yet \\"heard of thong underwear\\" (keep in mind that this book was written in 2003, not 1973, and that everyone, even your grandmother, had heard of thong underwear by 1998, at the latest) and yet turns around and bemoans the fact that some poor fashion-deficient soul is wearing a tux with tails in May? (I will honestly say that, while I'm no fan of tails, really, I have no idea when it's appropriate to wear them and when it's not.) She's completely wrapped up in herself, not noticing (or caring, apparently) that her friend has begun to drink herself into a blind stupor and take home random men from a bar to have (perhaps unprotected?) sex with them. She flirts shamelessly with a famous writer, although she has a fantastic boyfriend that she allegedly loves.Another characteristic really got under my skin, but I think it has more to do with the author's feelings than with the protagonist. Weisberger is completely disdainful of anyone who comes from the south or (gasp!) has a southern accent. She seems to introduce the character of Andrea's sister and brother-in-law just because they happen to live in Texas and her brother-in-law has a \\"horrible\\" southern accent. When Miranda's brother-in-law comes to town with his fianc&eacute;e and she throws them an engagement party, the guest list is full of wealthy southerners, of which Andrea is nothing short of appalled. She discusses their horrific lack of fashion sense, their horrific accents, and their horrific natures in general. Excuse me, Ms. Weisberger, but there are just as many rednecks in New England as in the South, and plenty of people with northern accents have an IQ ten times lower than someone with a southern accent. I live in the South, but I'm from Ohio, so this deeply offended me, even as a non-southerner. I'm not exactly sure what kind of horrible experience she had that made her hate the South and all things southern, including the people, so much.This book is 360 pages long, and should be somewhere around 150. The characters are shallow and, honestly, you don't care because you kind of get the feeling that Andrea and Miranda deserve each other. You hope that Lily, the best friend, finds her way into an AA program, and the boyfriend, Alex...well, you hope that he just runs for the hills. Unless you really, REALLY want to read this book for some reason, I advise you to rent the movie and take a pass on the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I purchased \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" I was expecting an amusing \\"boss from Hades\\" tale coupled to a satire on the fashion industry. After all, the clips from the recently-released movie looked wickedly witty. Would that I had actually read the Amazon reviews prior to paying good money for this nearly plotless, tedious read.As you probably know prior to reading this review, our \\"heroine\\", Andrea, is a recent college graduate who gets a job as an assistant to the editor of THE last word of high fashion, Runway magazine. The humor arises from the multitude of insane tasks that Andrea is assigned to do on a daily basis. That's basically the complete plot. The secondary characters are not developed, and Andrea herself does not inspire any empathy from the reader. In terms of the impossible job tasks- they fall into two categories 1)Andrea being expected to read her boss' mind (e.g., knowing when the boss is expected so that her breakfast will be delived at precisely the correct hot temperature; the antique shop was on E 68th street, not \\"on the 70's somewhere) or 2) be two places at once. At first, the tasks are amusing, but after a while........... sheeze, OK, already, the boss said one thing but meant something else. Repeat variations on this them over and over again. Tedious!The surprise, however, was the venomous streak of anti-Southern sentiment. While this theme only popped up twice in the novel, I was struck by how cruel and misguided it was. Terms such as \\"redneck\\", \\"hick\\" and \\"third-world\\" abound, along with a significant amount southern-drawl bashing. For example, at a party, people from the society-pages of Charleston and other parts of South Carolina are described as looking like \\"an upscale version of Deliverance\\". Complete, of course, with gaudy jewlery, big hair, chiffon dresses and bad tuxedos. In other words, they are ALL painted as a \\"dumb southerner\\" sterotype. While I can certainly be amused by good natured-ribbing of classic \\"southernerisms\\" (mine included), I found the author's approach to simply be mean-spirited, ugly and uninformed.I am sorry that I put money into this author's pocket. I will not do so again."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up this book because I saw its advertisements for the 2 out 3 years I lived in NY all over the city and because I wanted to read it before watching the movie. I didn't expected it to be War and Peace kind of material. Still I found myself dissapointed.What makes it so dissapointing? It is not the main character, (Andrea). Story basically is: she gets the wrong job in order to skip all the bottom feeding jobs she would have to go through to reach her almost impossible career goal of writing for the New Yorker. She thinks that being a slave to a neurotic psycho will help her get her dream job.I don't have a problem with that because it happends all the time, specially with people that are just out of college, and specially in cities like Manhattan where there is a whole society that revolves around what brand you are wearing.My problem with the book is that there is no climax. It is just problem after problem after problem all the way until the end at which point Andrea realizes something she already knew from day 2, that this job was not teaching her anything valuable to her career (except how to be snobby, materialistic, pull the right strings to meet the right connections) and that she was not going to get those connections any way.Also I really do not understand why chapter one \\"is\\" chapter one. Chapter one should have been somewhere near the end, before her flight to Paris."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was OK, and that is being generous.One good thing I appreciated in this book was the slight focus on the seriousness and hazards of alcoholism and dependence, and the effects of being a workaholic.For the most part, I felt the book was one giant advertisement for a variety of grossly overpriced merchandise. It merely stoked the fire of our countries material driven, superficial, celebrity obsessed attitude.Also, the references to anyone from the south being a \`hick' no matter how much money they had, generalizing all southerners as having an obnoxiously redneck accent, and calling Houston a \`swamp' and \`third-world country' were incredibly ignorant, arrogant, and snobby. Whether the author holds these opinions in real life or was simply adding to the showiness of the book, I don't know, but I didn't care for it. I live in New York, and it makes me wonder; has the author even noticed the variety of \`not so eloquent' accents around here?I will admit though, I am more of a fan of classic literature rather than this girly type fiction and romance novels. That aided in my dislike of this book. I mostly read it because I was curious due to the hype and I like to read the books before going to see the movies."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book as the story line sounded rather intriguing and fun. What a disappointment! First of all, I don't think that this book is well-written. A lot of the dialogue feels very contrived and simply not believable, like something one would write in a high-school writing seminar. Secondly, I did not feel any empathy for the main character or her situation. After several hundred pages of her complaining about her job and regaling us with incident after humiliating work incident, I just felt like screaming at her and telling her to quit already! Thirdly, the final climactic moment of the book was a huge letdown. So Andrea finally gets to tell her boss off, big deal. Her confrontation with Miranda lasts about a nanosecond, and she uses the magic f-word which is obviously enough to secure her downfall with Runway magazine. Combine this with the moral dilemma of choosing between being with your best friend on her deathbed or a chance at true fashionista stardom, and you have all the makings of an extremely unoriginal ending to a mediocre book. I would not recommend this book, maybe the movie is better?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love first-time authors as I enjoy hearing new voices in a world that often doesn't like to experiment. Unfortunately this book just doesn't do it. It's a rehash of many of the brand names that made Sex and the City - the tv show only - so great. But where were the great characters? I really could have used some! Or even one! This book just never caught me up. More fundamental: it was just a long series of anecdotes. Did anyone else notice that it didn't have a plot??"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book kept me up ALL night. I couldn't put it down! Laura Weisberger's glimpse into the fashion industry left me wanting for more...Miranda Priestly, Editor of the hottest fashion magazine \\"in the world\\" is the epitome of the \\"Evil Boss Syndrome\\" and Andrea Sachs gets the job \\"A million girls would die for\\" as her personal assistant.The Devil Wears Prada is Laura's \\"slightly\\" fictional account of her own days at Voque working for the very real, Anna Wintour.If you're looking for a page-turner, then look no more. This book is funny without being over the top, heartfelt, clever and always refreshing. If I could read it again for the first time all over again, I would!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Talk about overrated. I am astounded that this was actually a bestseller and that it's being made into a movie. I can only hope that the movie turns out like Legally Blonde - bad book, good movie. I'm only giving this two stars because there still worse books out there.The book's plot was decent enough - girl gets a job as a fashion magazine editor's assistant and discovers that her boss is a complete nightmare but has to stick it out with the hope that it'll lead her to a job writing at the New Yorker. However, the writing was not very fluid, the editing was awful, and scenes seemed to be repeating themes over and over again for lack of anything better to write. The reader doesn't particularly care about any of the characters, even the heroine. Ms. Weisberger fails to focus on anything except how incredibly awful the boss is, writing scenes of Miranda (the boss) demanding her coffee immediately, demanding a hot lunch but then already having eaten when it's brought to her, demanding a new printed schedule, etc. etc. You get the idea she's a bad person to work for - only none of it is funny. All you're left thinking is why would anyone really and truly stick this out? Another annoying aspect is that one character's dialogue is always completely written in capital letters, which gets old very quick and adds nothing to the book.Also, the editing was exremely poor. For example, there is one scene where the heroine is going out and her roommate, Lily, does her makeup. Then, only a few pargraphs later, the heroine is wondering where Lily is and it's discovered that she's passed out, drunk, in her room with a guy - and has been for awhile. Uh, what? I would like to think that published books have simple problems like this taken care of BEFORE going to print.I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless the plot intrigues you and you're able to overlook bad writing in favor of the story. And even then, check it out of the library and don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In keeping with the sartorial theme of \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" I would rate this book classic JC Penney. Not Prada or Valentino by any means, but above Bargain Basement clearance racks. The plot and its characters, for the most part, are quite forgettable. With the exception of Andrea and her boss, Miranda. Miranda's antics and Andrea's continued tolerance of them leapt far beyond the bounds of reality. I found it difficult to sympathize for someone allowing themselves to endure such exaggerated circumstances. It is an okay beach read, but don't expect fireworks."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'll admit it - I read this book for the hype. They're making a movie, the title's catchy, it's a best-seller, blah, blah, blah. By the third page, any reader can see where the story is headed. The main character whines and complains her way around New York; all but abandoning those who love, support and need her the most for the sake of her first job out of school. A job, as we're reminded incessantly, \\"any girl would die for.\\" The ending is no surprise - but so long overdue, to say it was anticlimactic is an understatement. Please don't get me started on the author's writing style and tone... My friends and I wrote better notes in high school.Here's a newsflash: most jobs suck. In fact, most jobs suck, aren't in NYC and don't lend expensive designer clothes to their employees. This is one case where I'll bet the movie is better than the book. It really is the only hope for redeeming this drivel, I mean novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Definitely addictive reading! I can emphatize with all the characters here as its like taking a page out from my everyday mundane office life. Those universal traits that you despise in your boss: egoism, inflated self-importance that the world revolves around them and only them, treating you like you are some slave not worthy of dignity.Plus those colleagues: hyprocrites who complement their boss as the \\"greatest of them all\\", insincerity, lack of camaraderie etc...Andrea did the right thing with these types of bosses from hell, they don't deserve you, you deserve much much more by exploring further job opportunities. See the light!!BTW, Meryl Streep will be cast as Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell and she is perfect for it given her steely look. Can't wait for the movie to be released in 2006!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If I could rate this a quarter star I would. Catchy title and cute cover: only polite things I can say. It lacked character and plot development needed to sustain an audience, among other things. We get it, Miranda is a monster - can't that be said in under 368 pages???I actually felt it to be a huge waste of time and am so glad I borrowed it from the library rather than waste my money as well!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In fact, I was way too old for it when I was 21. Sorry, I can not recommend this book. The characters are not developed very well. I feel absolutely no sympathy for the heroine who, if old enough to live on her own and take on the world by storm sure as heck doesn't have any self-respect or common sense. It seemed like a good idea for about 50 pages and then fell flat. I basically just skimmed the remainder to find out if anything ever really changed. For the most part, it didn't , the only character that seemed to have any growth in this book was one that had been on the peripheral during the entire novel. This book flew against the face of realism, ridiculously so...even for a piece of summer fiction. If you have a limited amount of time for your summer reading list, as I do...and you are over the age of 19 with your self-esteem and common sense fully intact, take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" by Lauren Weisberger is a light-hearted read about a girl just out of college that is struggling to find herself. She lands a job at a major fashion magazine as a assistant to a VERY demanding boss. The entire book consists of Andrea, the assistant, finding herself, throughout the year she is contracted to work at the magazine. She ultimately realizes what's real in life, but too late that she must live with the sacrifices she made along journey. This book is \\"chic literature\\" which is not meant to be deep or moving, but to be a light enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea Sachs has landed the alleged dream job a million gals would die for--junior assistant to the demanding, bitch-on-wheels Miranda Priestly, editor in chief of Runway, a snooty fashion magazine. Andrea aspires to write for The New Yorker and hopes a year at this job will be the stepping-stone to that end (a go-fer job to writing job?). Miranda is notorious for expecting everyone to cater to her every whim 24/7, as well as interpret her vague orders with precise clarity and carry out those orders with extreme efficiency in two seconds. The story is about Andrea's year of servitude working for the lunatic.Yes, I bought the book because of the hype...my mistake. The story was disappointing and basically the same poor-me whining thing over and over; it's too long; the writing is hilarious and sarcastic; the end is a letdown. The author was writing from some experience...why the hell would you continue to work for control freak in the slight hope of getting your dream job?? It's a tedious read at best."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\". As a college student I like reading about a recent college grad and her efforts to survive her first real job. The only thing I didn't like about the book is it made me want to buy an entirely new wardrobe of designer clothes!! Other than that I would suggest this book as a quick read that provides some laugh out loud moments."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought this book at the Linate airport and read in four days(!). There are some parts of the book that could be done better, but the general feeling is that is a really good book for its kind. It reflects the thoughts and actions of normal cute girl who enters in the advanced age of 27 - considering the field we're talking about - in the New York V.I.P. lifestyle.The story flows easily, almost naturally. Having lived in Milan, Italy for several years, which is the world's fashion capital, I found the book pretty familiar with stories I've heard or encountered.It's a good book, with happy end and all the necessary ingredients."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While the story and characters of this book were OK, I don't feel this book lived up to the hype and acclaim it received.The story, is somewhat a shallow one. It's pretty much one sided- about Andrea who is an assistant to a huge fashion magazine editor who treats her and everyone around her like crap. The things she demands of her assistant and staff, the things she says and does, are outrageous. Thus, the story summed up. To make matters worse, I really didn't care for Andrea, like another reviewer, I just couldn't relate or understand what she was thinking. Also, what I really would have enjoyed, was a few other characters that were given more of a subplot than they were. Andrea's boyfriend, parents and roommate were not given much of anything. To me, I enjoy a story with many dimensions, and this book did not do that for me.While the book had its moments, and was an ok read, I wouldn't really go out of my way to recommend this book. Even though I worked for a boss that was pretty insane as well, that wasn't enough for me to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"An awesome book, stereotypical but it takes you into the world of glitz and for a second you get the live what you thought was teh dream. I consider it the best out of all PR, hollywood, fashion, secretary books. Its a fun read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Like several other reviewers, I don't really understand what all the fuss is about. \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is not all that amazing. The villians are one-demensionally evil, even ridiculously so. You can see most of the plot twists coming from a mile away. The deciding moment in protagonist Andrea's life, near the end of the book, couldn't be more stilted. Lauren Weisberger has a point to get across about unrealistic standards of beauty, and she smashes you over the head with it. Again. And again.Having said all this, the book is also fun. I read it on a long plane ride, when my brain was too mushy and my butt too uncomfortable to have much patience. It was a perfect time-killer. Heck, at times I felt like I enjoyed it a lot. I'm a mid-20-something woman who works at a job she hates, dealing with a jerk of a boss. If you've ever been in that position, or even close to it, there are elements of this book that you will enjoy. And, Weisberger does have a knack for clever sarcasm. It was hard for me not to like Andrea when we were allowed inside her head, even though she did whine a lot.In sum - a fun, quick read and worth a shot. Though it probably won't be winning a Nobel Prize any time soon."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book kept me reading, which is a good thing. I'm not a person who reads alot. It was a nice book for the time being, but I don't think I'd read it again. Once I finished the book I was left thinking, \\"Is that it?\\". I guess it's all in what you're looking for. If you want a book that is entertaining and fun to read then this is a good book. If you're looking for a book that you'll want to read over and over again, one that builds suspense and provokes feelings, then this is not a good book for you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I don't think anyone picks up a book like this expecting a ground breaking work of fiction. No one hopes to have his or her life changed by the moral of a book like \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" and I am not an exception. I expected a book that would entertain me, keep me interested, and would make life a little less dull. These goals were all achieved.Looking back over the opening scene of the novel, though, I am confused. It seems to start in the present, then explain how the lead character, Andrea Sachs, got to such a miserable predicament. Yet, this scene is never revisited. This certainly isn't important, but it might have helped the flow of the novel if it were.No, I was not moved by this book. It will have no lasting affect on me (although I DID fall asleep last night wondering how on earth my wide feet would ever be forced into Jimmys or Manolos, but that's a different issue), but it helped me to fall asleep at night, closing my day in a relaxed way."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Weisberger's follow-up to her 2001 debut \\"God Wears Pajamas\\" is full of faded ideas and tattered characters. In \\"GWP\\" she invented a St. Peter who hands out p.j.s at the Gates of Heaven. Portraying God as an advocate of the happy nap was an inspired idea, and it elevated this reader's conciousness to levels not achieved since I first read Camus. In \\"Prada\\", however, the gag of Satan forcing new arrivals to don uncomfortable garments seems contrived. So you didn't get into Heaven and now you have to sleep in golf shoes. So what? It's impossible for the reader to connect the dots when Weisberger offers fewer than you find in a typical elipses.

I read the long book in a couple of days and never felt bored with the plot or characters. The sub-plot of Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend, Alex, and her writer/crush, Christian, didn't seem to flow with the rest of the book (and got on my nerves a little), but overall it was funny to read of the horrible fashion editor and her smartmouthed assistant.

So the ending was a bit lacklustre, it left me disappointed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The incredibly naive and inexperienced assistant (Andrea) in this book can't seem to grasp the not-so-subtle realities of hierarchy and expectations in the work-place. One can't help but feel, through the incredibly poorly written narrative (without a plot, one might add), that the author embellished a bit too freely, absolutely refused to explore at all the Editor's (Mirabella) work, position or point of view at all except in diet-breaking-like sampling, and promptly and guiltily reverts back to her usual boring bashing.The complaining becomes downright nauseating and soon we start to sympathize with the Mirabella about having to deal with such an ungrateful, unmotivated and clearly unprofessional assistant. Andrea seems to have forgotten that her job there is as an assistant - and instead focuses only on her pretentious goal of working for New Yorker.Though we might at first sympathize with her for the demanding work-load, all she seems to do is respond through belligerence, complaining and petty pilfering - and seems completely proud of this pathetic behavior, like a child making a face at the teacher after he has turned his back.Overall, we are presented with a very mediocre report of an incompetent assistant's life working in an extremely important position by a very mediocre writer.

There were definitely times in the book where I laughed (the part about all the Christmas gifts was funny), but I agree that the ending was predictable and the writing was choppy at times. The boss' antics were enough to make you want to jump into the book and strangle her, but the narrator of the story could be a little annoying at times. I suggest the book for an easy and enjoyable read, but it is not as good as the Jane Green novels."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada - Lauren WeisbergerI've read reviews of this book that say that it's fairly accurate. That this is based on a real New York City fashion editor. I'm going to guess Anna Wintour of Vogue. I can't say for sure having never worked at Vogue, but that's what \\"they\\" say. I read an &lt;a href=http://pix.popula.com/items/0224/vintage/wintour.html> &lt;U>article&lt;/u>&lt;/a> comparing Ms. Wintour to satan. Call me an optimist, but I can't believe that someone would behave as ridiculously as the Devil in this book: Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of Runway, *the* most NY fashion magazine.Andrea, the protagonist, is a newly-graduated English major who happens upon a job as the assistant to the editor in chief of Runway, Miranda Preistly. She goes to the interview while still recovering from amoebic dysentery picked up on a trip to Southeast Asia. She's very thin and not too clear headed. Fuzzy headed enough to totally miss the over-sell of every single person she met who told her that this was a \\"great opportunity\\" and \\"millions of girls would kill for this job.\\" Oh yeah? Then why, she never thought to ask, are you trying so hard to sell me on it?The characters are so one-dimensional. Is there nothing to Miranda but her vapidness? Is Emily nothing but a fashionista-wanna-be?I'd never have lasted at this job. One of Andrea's daily tasks is to have Miranda's breakfast ready for her when she shows up at work. However, Andrea never knows when that might be so she orders and throws away several breakfasts a day. Miranda will call and say \\"I need a skirt\\" and then hang up. Woe be to the fool who should ask any questions. Apparently, her assistants are to be mind readers as well. It's far better, says Emily, the person Andrea is replacing, to guess wrong and be thought a fool (and suffer the wrath of La Miranda) than to ask questions. I, my friends, would have been fired within a week. I hate arrogant, self-important people and I always have. Though, I did last six months once at a job with someone like that but not nearly as bad as Miranda. I couldn't stomach the waste. Though, Andrea has her secret revenge: she buys 3 extra Starbucks coffees each morning and hands them out to homeless people on the way back to the office. Once her boss discards her \\"last season\\" clothes - Andrea snags a few things to sell on Ebay. There are perks.One thing got on my nerves: Andrea's friends would simply not believe that she couldn't talk to them at work, not even for a second. I don't care what job you have - if you can't talk on the phone while you are at work, your friends and family should just deal with it. That is a huge pet peeve of mine. If I am at work, then leave me the hell alone. But I digress.Once upon a time, I would have loved this book. As it is, I think it's mildly pleasant and not offensive. That's probably the best I can say about it. If you're looking for something to read that won't require much thought, this is the book for you. If you can get over the needless waste and ostentatious displays of wealth and privilege."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The ingenue Andrea goes to work at a fashion magazine as a junior assistant to the insane and flamingly narcissistic editor, Miranda Priestly. As the summary of the book indicates, that's pretty much it.First, the thumbs up. The recitation of Miranda Priestly's behavior is very entertaining and well written. The character is quite frankly amusing, and this is why I gave the book three stars. If, as the book summary indicates, it is based on a real person, I remained floored that someone so fundamentally absurd is able to function outside of a locked facility.Now, the thumbs down. The recitation should have been cut to 100 pages. All the filler in between did not help the plot or the character. For example, the main character, Andrea, keeps reacting (and telling her reader) how tired she is. That is it. No progression. After awhile, I became tired of hearing how tired she was. But it did not change. Stagnation.Another example of filler is all the peripheral action regarding Andrea's family, best friend, boyfriend, handsome writer who wants to date her, etc. I suspect the author was trying to put Andrea's character development or progression on that side of the book, but it just did not work. It did not dovetail at all with the fashion story.Lastly, the character of Andrea did not make sense to begin with. Her stated overriding passion was to work for the New Yorker; it was her lifelong goal. The author is very clear on that. But the character does little to make it happen. Before college graduation, she makes no move to set up interviews, internships, writing experiences, portfolios, etc. She instead waits until after graduation, and after a summer knocking around Europe, before drifting around to look for a job. And she, gauche and with no interest in fashion, lands a dream fashion job.It just does not jive. Nor does her tolerance of the harassment a security guard meets out to her every time she wants to enter the building of the magazine. I suspect the author was trying to force substance on the main character. But on the other hand, in order for the story to work, the main character had to behave like a rabbit. These two glaring contradictions are very difficult to reconcile.Overall, a pleasant read, but one you should get from the library."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I can't believe it was on the NY Times Best Seller list for six months - maybe it took readers that long to realize this book has NO plot whatsoever. Let's just say I went against my better judgment in reading this cutesy Bridgette Jones-type novel.The over-description of some things (something about listening to music on her i-Mac) and name-dropping got annoying, as another reviewer pointed out. It seemed to be just done to impress the reader, rather than give any insight into this girl's world. I find it implausible that this girl can get hired in the first place, much less thinks she can work for a fashion magazine (or ANY job in corporate America) without some decent clothes first. What was she thinking?I found Andrea's character to be underdeveloped, the characters of her sister and brother in law to be completely useless, and the only person I could picture in my head was Lily. If they were such good friends and looked out for each other, why did it take so long for Andrea to figure out Lily had a drinking. problem? (Whoops, minor plot hole here!) I was hoping this novel would at least mention the current problem of corporate excess and overspending, and maybe we would see Runway magazine get audited by the IRS and Miranda Priestly would go to jail. That would make it worth reading.I'm sure this author has some talent; let's just hope her second novel (if there is one) is a little better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think it's important to judge a book on what it's trying to be. This isn't trying to be great literature. Even so, I don't think it succeeds. What I wanted was a quick, fun read about the fashion industry. Instead, I found an unsympathetic narrator and poor writing. Some of the insights were fun, and sometimes I really felt for the narrator Andrea. Everyone has had a bad job or a bad boss, and it's easy to empathize and fun to relate. But the author isn't able to sustain the good points over the course of the entire book. Too often, Andrea comes across as immature or judgmental. Too many of the secondary characters are cliches, like her too-good-to-be-true public school teacher boyfriend. I found the uneven quality of the writing was distracting. I am picky in what I read, even for fun books. If you're like me, you probably want to skip this one.

Storyline has potential but Weisberger is unable to make it work. Character development leaves much to be desired and Andrea Sachs, the heroine is completely unlikeable. She is self-centered, selfish and stupid too. I did not find Andrea's self absorbed diatribes about her difficult boss amusing at all. That's right, not even a chuckle. Several hundred pages are filled with Andrea's constant complaints and \\"poor me\\" rantings. Weisberger tries to redeem Andrea's character at the end of the book - She FINALLY tells her boss what she thinks of her (in no uncertain terms, I might add) NOT because she has a friend who is in the hospital and needs her, NOT because she has neglected her family and boyfriend BUT because this one last request from Miranda is just too outrageous.Of course, the book has a happy ending. Like I said, several hundred pages (I wonder how many trees were killed) of incessant griping to read about Andrea's trite epiphany - Hey I don't need to work in this degrading job that I hate, I can write articles that will sell and everybody will love.

Most of the PR implies that this is a roman a clef about those days. So far the reviews that I've seen in a least two major fashion magazines haven't been kind but that can be chalked up to fashionistas being annoyed with someone who mocked their world.Does the book live up to the hype? Yes and no.It's an amusing book. The descriptions of downtown life in NYC, the side characters and the horrible antics of mean Miranda Priestly are fun but the heroine, Andrea is such a stuck up little snob that it's difficult to care about her. Margaret Mitchell was able to take a character who was an absolute monster and make millions love her. Lauren Weisberger doesn't have that kind of ability.What's really annoying is that the book has a choppy feel. Andrea lurches from one disaster to another with no transition in between. The plot has a formula that is an old as Greek mythology. The scenes with the best friend character, Lilly and the boyfriend, Alex won't surprise anyone. The climax is straight out of an old Edgar Wallace plotwheel. The ending was a sappy, predictable let down.The bottom line is this: if you love fashion and gossip The Devil Wears Prada will make you smile.

For those in love with all things Vogue et.al., who wouldn't want to read a deliciously biting roman a clef about a woman who is probably Anna Wintour and then some? Alas, that's the problem with the book, it only caters to those in the fashion know, which results in a shallow exercise of style over substance.While author Lauren Weisberger has a grasp of sustaining a narrative, but the predictable scenarios she concocts are hardly the stuff of good fiction or, sadly, biting satire. Bitchy asides and brand names are stretched thin, for sure.Even worse, her alter ego, Andrea, is too bland a creation for the reader to really care about. Her ambition is not telegraphed with any real force since all I kept thinking was why stick it out in a thankless job that is beyond demeaning? Is being a writer at the New Yorker that important? I'm sure it is for the character, but Ms. Weisberger's colorless prose fails to register such details with depth.As for the infamous character of Miranda Priestly, I know plenty of folks like this woman. Hell, I even worked for one. The only real joy generated by this novel was smiling over what a complete and total virago she remains throughout the book. I also loved how Weisberger captured the absolute absurdity of such fields like fashion and other show business enterprises that rely so heavily on image. The worlds she creates are definitely based on some sort of fact, but it is unfortunate the she didn't take such an interest in her overall plot or characters.Perhaps my dissatisfication in the novel stems from something greater. As \\"chick lit\\" continues to fill our minds and best seller charts, does the world need one more \\"Mary Tyler Moore-clone taking on the world on her terms kind of heroine?\\"British sensation Helen Fielding offered some reality and humanity to the hip and happening world of Bridget Jones. However, Andrea Sachs is no Bridget Jones and the short-lasting effects of this novel makes you wonder why can't us Yankees create such a vivid piece of fiction!Ultimately, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is Diet coke for the brain. To be honest, I am tiring of our current fascination with excess, entitlement and shallowness. This hotly hyped novel implodes before its predictable \\"up yours\\" finale. Like the fashion magazines it lampoons -- it's all about really pretty pictures with ultimately very little to say."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"i'm looking forward to the movie. and as i do with any movie spun off of a successful, well-known book, i decided to read the original material first, so i buy the book....fortunately i bought the 7 dollar copy so i don't feel like i wasted too much on it. what a waste! the sad thing is, none of the characters are likable at all.it has its moments(Mostly revolving around the titled devil, miranda priestly). but the dialogue is stilted and lame(much of what characters say are describing/explaining something that know regualr person would feel the need to say in real life, and which could easily be explained with naration), the plot is predictable, and andy, the main character, is too self-centered and pathetic to even deserve the title of 'heroine'.i would like to know if whoever published this book did it as a practical joke. you know, get a good laugh out of it.also, look for the part in the novel where weisenberger says in one paragraph that andy's apartment doens't have a kitchen, but in the VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH mentions her boyfriend going to the kitchen of her apartment.... sad"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'd like to be nice about this-the author is young-but I can't be nice and honest at the same time. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Motivated to purchase it by the hype and looking for something juicy, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was not much more than a great title. The author simply cannot hide behind her experience as onetime assistant to Vogue's Anna Wintour no matter how much she expects us to believe this was a product of an overactive imagination making things up at four in the morning.First of all, it's poorly written-filled with flat peripheral characters-and includes passive voice, clich&eacute;s and sentences ending in prepositions (HORRORS!) for which she actually apologizes since she, and by she I of course mean her main character, fancies herself a talented and educated writer headed for a position with \\"The New Yorker.\\" Without a doubt it is a thinly veiled product of the author's personal experience, which may have been easier to swallow if she didn't write in the first person. This main character, Andrea Sachs, a junior personal assistant to the most influential woman in fashion, is as loathsome and arrogant as her boss, the she-devil named Miranda Priestly. I would have loved to hate the demanding and rude Miranda, but in this story she is a boring, two-dimensional villain. The only reason I stayed with it for over 330 pages was so that I could see just how this lowly assistant would finally leave her hellish enslavement. And even that was terribly unsatisfactory. What could have been a truly triumphant moment, turned into a squeak (\\"that's all!\\") and an opportunity to profit on the resale of thousands of dollars worth of designer clothes she'd \\"borrowed\\" from the magazine's \\"closet.\\"Ms. Wiesenberger may have just signed the book deal a \\"million girls would die for,\\" but this sort of kiss-and-tell book-a mere opportunity to name drop and dish the rich and famous-reeks of bitterness and naivet&eacute;. (Writing this review makes me feel the same way!) The only thing I can say I truly enjoyed was her dedication and acknowledgments. Now that writing was witty. As for the rest of it, save your money. If you like this kind of thing and want something dishy, read The Nanny Diaries instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book! No, it's not terribly substantial and, yes, it is somewhat mean-spirited, but if even 25% of the things described in this book took place during Lauren Weisenberger's employ by Anna Wintour, I'd say that whatever Ms. Weisenberger wants to dish out, Ms. Wintour should take and be glad it's not more. Besides, does anyone think this book is meant to be taken seriously? Yes, there were times when I wanted to smack Andrea in the head and say \\"Get a life and a real job!\\" but not so much that it interfered with my enjoyment of the book. I found myself humorously horrified at the extent to which the Miranda Priestly character reigned with terror over her subordinates as well as open-mouth astonished at the number of people who took her abuse as \\"part of the job.\\" If these were real people, I'd recommend therapy...and fast.That said, I've just finished the unauthorized biography of Wintour, \\"Front Row\\" by Jerry Oppenheimer, and it appears that much of what is set forth in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is closer to the truth than one might want to believe. There is outright confirmation of Wintour's attitude, demeanor, and treatment of others that runs directly parallel to the actions of Miranda Priestly in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" So, if you're interested in a fun, easy read, I'd recommend \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" If you're interested in Anna Wintour and plan to read both books, however, you should definitely read \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" first. Somehow, I can't imagine it's quite as funny once you've read \\"Front Row\\" and realize how close to reality \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" might actually be."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Wow. This was an unbelievably dull book, which is something of a mortal sin for a gossipy tell-all. The \\"excesses\\" perpetrated by \\"Miranda\\" are, frankly, not all that shocking. Not for that circle. Nor is she sui generis in being a poor boss and an unpleasant waste of skin as a person. But I've read wickedly hilarious accounts of far more pedestrian events, persons and narratives...it's not so much the topic at hand in TDWP that induces dreariness but the execrable writing. The book should NEVER have been published. It might have been a great Rolling Stone or Harper's article, with more aggressive editing and tighter focus. Perhaps, as Weisberger writes in her dedication, we should blame the editor for taking out all the really funny stuff. Ultimately, though, it's the author's fault for sucking so damned hard."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is the story of one Andrea Sachs, an annoyingly passive-aggressive Ivy League princess who we are told is so out of touch with fashion that she can't pronouce Givenchy and who thinks that Target carries a brand called Massimo (it's Mossimo) - but yet who knows what designer John Galliano looks like. Andrea, straight out of Brown, wants to be a serious writer for The New Yorker, so she of course follows her dream by becoming a personal assistant to the editor-in-chief at Vogue-clone Runway - as opposed to, oh, say, actually pursuing WRITING. This is our first clue that Andrea is seriously out of touch with reality, and it only gets worse.We are informed (it is painfully apparent that author Lauren Weisberger never heard of the writing maxim \\"show, don't tell\\") that Andrea is quite possibly the Mother Theresa of Manhattan. Caring Andrea buys expensive Starbucks drinks for the homeless and actually - gasp!- learns the names of the drivers who ferry her around on her magazine's account. Virtuous Andrea turns down the advances of current \\"It Boy\\" hotshot writer, even though he has connections at her dream job, The New Yorker - as we are reminded every 50 pages. (We are told Andrea spurns him because \\"It Boy\\" is a lech, even though his behavior on paper is perfectly gentlemanly. Perhaps the confusion stems from Weisberger's wooden dialogue, which is overwritten and unbelievable to the ear, with no distinction in voice between the characters.) High-minded Andrea, who has actually read a Russian novelist and taken psych classes, looks down her nose at her shallow fashion-crazed colleagues, although that doesn't stop her from taking home from the office thousands of dollars' worth of Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, and matching Louis Vuitton luggage.However, even would-be saints have their dark sides, and Andrea's comes out in quite possibly the nastiest, grossest and passive-aggressive ways ever: she wipes her dirty hands on her boss's dry-cleaning and serves her boss lunch on dirty dishes, while dreaming of spitting into the food.There is nothing likeable or sympathetic about Andrea, and her whiny diatribes about her miserable working life wear on the reader after page 100. When her boyfriend, the male Mother Theresa, finally tells her off, the reader cheers even it does come 260 pages too late.THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA has gained attention because it is supposedly a roman-a-clef about life as an assistant to Vogue editor Anna Wintour. However, the Anna figure here is such a caricature, any deeper understanding or insight into the real person is impossible. And we can't figure out why Andrea puts up with her in the first place. Yes, yes, we are told Andrea's reasons (think I'm mentioning The New Yorker too much? Then you haven't read the book) but the reader can't suspend disbelief. Besides, as someone who led an earlier life as a Hollywood assistant - Andrea had it fairly easy.Like her character, who we are told managed to score $38,000 after selling all the stuff she \\"took\\" from the office, I hope Lauren Weisberger is capitalizing on the success of this novel. Because without the \\"Wintour is the devil\\" hype to sell her novel, her writing is vastly subpar. And the editor did her no favors - she let errors such as confusing \\"salon\\" with \\"saloon,\\" and several confusing time shifts, stand. In the acknowledgements, Weisberger says to blame the editor for taking out all the really funny parts - one wishes that some of that had been allowed to stay, for the novel could definitely use a lighter touch. Too serious to be a satire, and too over-the-top to be a real life look at a fashion magazine, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is instead what no book should be: boring."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Were it not for the Manolo Blahniks and Prada and Chanel designs that liberally decorate this book, it would never have been glanced at by a serious editor. The reason for its great success is not great skill or remarkable storytelling, but the fact that it caters to the self-indulgent and self-centered world that is New York publishing. So many times I saw Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City in the lead character's role!The author tells a good story. She has a real gift for words, and after about a dozen years seasoning, if she's not ruined by early and undeserved success, she might actually be a very good writer. It might also be a good move for her to shift to Hollywood, since her writing style is amazingly visual; I could easily see why her book was made into a movie so quickly.Be that as it may -- the book is self-indulgent and sometimes bitter and even nasty. The main character is not particularly likeable, perhaps because her primary love interest is really herself (which, if you think about it, is the hallmark of many chick lits). The characters I did like lost out in the end -- Alex the boyfriend and the alcoholic roommate Lily who was utterly lost in the world. There was no attention paid to rising tension -- tension rose to a certain level and plateaued by the third chapter. It was like a picaresque novel without the travel and excitement, and after a while you got weary of the miraculous monty-haul part with driven cars and high-fashion clothes and meeting celebrities. If more attention had been paid to the overwhelmingness of this for the main character, perhaps the book would have been better. Instead, after an initial bump of shock, Ahn-dre-ah pretty much accepted it as her due.There was no real conflict in the character, at least not a convincing one. There was no real goal (enduring the boss for a year, as a passive action, does not count); I mean, she wanted to be a writer -- where in the first 4/5 of the book did she sit down to write anything? Even with a boss from hell, there's a little time here and there -- or she could have sacrificed her mornings -- or something. Shown some gumption! A good character must want, and want desperately; I never saw that anywhere. These characters all pretty much drifted. And there was no real structure. It was a very odd novel in these respects. The characters were also very flat, very nearly caricatures. Sometimes actions didn't make sense; the taking-away of the credit card by the parents when the plot needed some tension, and then the miraculous returning of it because she needed it for furniture, makes me think that perhaps a little editing needed to be done there. It could have happened in real life, but in a story it's irritating -- why take it away only to give it back in a deus ex machina?But, and I have to be honest, I really, really took umbrage at one particular aspect of the book that is clearly part of the author and not of the characters alone: her obvious disdain for the South and all things Southern. You see, I'm from the South, speak with that-ther hick accent, was raised by rednecks and hillbillies, and yes, even go barefoot from time to time. My broad foot would not fit in a Manolo Blahnik. I think those models in magazines need a sandwich or two. And it honestly pissed me off to hear different characters repeatedly make fun of the hick accents and complain about how the Southern drawl made them sick and how Andrea's sister had picked up her own fake drawl and how those Southern hicks chaw on tobacco and the sound of their voices would drill a hole in your eardrum -- you know, Southerners read too? It might be a good idea to try being culturally sensitive for a few minutes. We hate Noo Yawk accents too, but we don't sit and write nasty things about them. Usually.Bottom line: interesting story that could have been told much better by a seasoned writer, or by this writer working in conjunction with a talented and devoted editor. Chunks of description dropped in, flashbacks, and the same actions described ad nauseum lead me to believe that cutting about 25% out of this book in the right places, and changing nothing else, would have made it significantly better. And if you can cut that much out of a story without ruining it, there's something wrong."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I tried very hard to like the character of Andrea Sachs and to root for her in dealing with her evil boss. Yes, Miranda Priestly is beastly, but Andrea's sense of entitlement seems boundless and she seems to invite more wrath from Miranda. I understand needing to go outside the office to have a cigarette, and I started out as a flunky assistant too. However, when Andrea is sent to buy her boss a coffee, it's expected that she return quickly. Instead, Andrea not only buys the boss's coffee, but also several others (which she charges to the company), and then distributes them to homeless people on her way back to the office. After the delay this causes, she sits down at her desk and eagerly looks forward to opening her personal email where she can read personal notes on the company's time. She's angered to spitting when the boss declares the coffee is cold and should be replaced. How dare the boss pull her away from her personal email? Because she's the boss, Andy! You shouldn't be buying things for others at your company's expense, you shouldn't be reading personal email on company time, and you shouldn't be complaining if the boss doesn't like it. If you don't like it, QUIT.While Miranda does come across as the \\"Boss From Hell\\", Andrea seems to be under the impression that secretaries and assistants can simply go about their daily lives of coming in when they please, spending the day chatting with friends on their cell phones, checking and answering private email, receiving tens of thousands of dollars in free clothing (which they can pawn and keep the money), being flippant to middle management, and deciding when and how they're going to actually do the grubby tasks that are their job. Paragraphs are spent with Andrea complaining about having to be AT WORK AT 7AM. Wow! How horrible! How many folks have BEEN at work for HOURS by then? And not having to deal with a rotten boss either.....some are working on dangerous machinery, tending to the sick in hospitals, repairing computers for banks, dealing with the public from behind a cash register, and more. And these folks don't get to take a cab to work and have the company pay for it...they have to go out and scrape snow off their car and pray that it starts, or get into a vehicle that's so hot you have to wear oven mitts to touch the steering wheel.I think that Andrea Sachs pretty well sums up the problems that companies have today......finding good help. I also think that she gives hardworking young people a bad name. If millions of young people entering the work force think that Andrea's conduct is the way to the top, they're going to be shocked and saddened when they find out that bosses expect you to work.Unlike \\"The Nanny Diaries\\", which is another book about a young heroine being driven to the breaking point by her employer's insane demands, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" presents no reason for Andrea to put up with the crap doled out by her boss except pure greed. Nanny stays because she loves the child she cares for, and also because she sees that the Mother is also going through a hard time. The only reason Andrea stays at her job in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is for all the freebies she can get or steal, and to put up with the job as a stepping stone to what she really wants to do. She's tolerating Miranda just as Miranda is tolerating her. This is NEVER the way to get and keep a job!I gave this book one star rather than zero only because now that I'm an employer myself, the book helped me to see what I DON'T want to find in an employee."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I listened to it as I was traveling and enjoyed the book completely"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think Lauren Weisberger is probably not too upset with all the snarky reviews, since The Devil Wears Prada has been a solid hit seller. There are no great revelations here, but it is a quick, fun book to read. It could have done with a little more narrative drive and some judicious cutting, but hey what do you want from a beach or subway book?p.s. Every time I see a picture of Anna Wintour since reading this, I think of the devilish boss in this book"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I definitely recommend this book to anybody who wants to read an entertaining novel. It is so hard to put down!I could not believe some of the things that Miranda was asking Andrea to do....."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With an attention grabbing title: The Devil wears Prada, one wonders about the hidden meanings, is it about the devil, or the Prada? It is about this girl, Andrea Sachs, who graduates out of Brown University, decides not to immediately apply for jobs and went backpacking all over Eurasia. Her deepest ambition is to write for The New Yorker; however, seeing that getting a job as a writer is extremely difficult, she applies to magazines as a personal assistant. After a few tries, she finally struck gold; she had gotten a job at a fashion magazine, Runway. Andrea is now one of the two assistants to the most powerful woman in the magazine, the absolute high-profile, successful editor of Runway, Miranda Priestley.So Andrea is this regular book worm; she does not concern herself with extravagant appearances and expensive brands all the time. This certainly does not bother most people; however, since Runway is a large fashion magazine, Andrea finds herself being laughed at and looked down upon because she doesn't measure up to Runway's impossible clothing value.Commanding, powerful, and simply demanding, Miranda Priestley, chief editor of Runway, puts Andrea thru all hell and back infinite times. Many miniscule things such as getting her dirty clothes to the dry cleaners, and buying lattes. Running pointless errands that would never satisfy the all domineering Miranda herself. While trying to fit to Runway and Mirada's demands, Andrea finds herself fading away from her family and friends. However, Andrea is so caught up in her nightmare and her persistent thought that Miranda's recommendation is one day going to send her to The New Yorker, she leaves all of that behind.Determined to prove to everyone at the office that she has what it takes, Andrea makes the transformation to better accommodate her job and to apply herself to all of Miranda's ridiculous requests. As a result she alienates herself from her family and friends even more. Just when Andrea has lost all sense in compassion, she finds herself wondering if this job is really worth it. This job, that a million girls would die for, may just be the end of her."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book (which I listened to unabridged on books on CD) gave me chills and moments of anxiety as I flashed back to a boss that I had prior to my current job. Although she wasn't quite as bad as Miranda, I could empathize with Andrea in a number of her horrible situations. I have been fantasizing about sending her a copy of the book, but have restrained myself thus far. The ending was satisfying and not at all predictable, I thought."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Maybe it's a little thing, but I found it irritating and implausible that Andrea and her friends use the phrase &quot;will do&quot; in response to the snooty orders they issue each other. These are supposed to be struggling 20somethings and they come off as arrogant and unlikable. The Nanny Diaries is basically the same story but is much, much better written."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I couldn't put this book down, it kept me addicted practically! Just the kind of book you want to read to forget the world around you and not have to think too much! I found it entertaining and very well written, while focusing on the fashion industry which I found amusing, it could be any one at any time at any job so it relates very well. I don't pick books usually based on reviews as you can't nest all books together for one person to like. I can't wait for another book by this author!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book!

I read this book right after finishing The Nanny Diaries, and I enjoyed this book so much more. While The Nanny Diaries is cute and silly, this book was more mature and believable. I think you have to have some appreciation for the fashion industry, and the obsession with designer labels to appreciate this book. If a book doesn't pique my interest after the first 100 pages, I will not give it a chance, but I genuinely looked forward to the evenings when I could read this book, and had a hard time putting it down!

It was an insider's look into the magazine world of Manhattan, which at times seems to run the city entirely.

Because I can relate, I enjoyed reading this book to a point. However, I think the book could have been half the size - I skimmed through it towards the later part. There's just so many nightmare work stories a person can read, especially if you live it everyday. I also think the narrator displayed too much of a \\"I am too good for this job\\" attitude. Most of us feel this way, but we put up with it because we need to pay the bills (and don't have $36,000 worth of designer clothes to sell) and these Miranda types offer salaries that you cannot get in most other administrative jobs. In some ways, the narrator had an attitude that was almost as ignorant as Miranda's."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"You know how you become terribly acquainted with the main character of a novel? When they hurt, you hurt, when they cry, you cry...Not with this girl. I came away with no feeling for &quot;An-dree-ah.&quot; The book was funny at times. I kinda got sick of the almost incessant stereotypes....It was cute though. Nice first novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have just read this book from cover to cover whilst holidaying in Manhattan over the New Year period. I just wish I'd met people as colourful as this whilst I was there.People who don't feel sympathy for the narrator obviously work in industries, like fashion, where they misguidedly believe that junior workers have the right to be mistreated. It seems that too many of the reviews centre around a character assassination of the author (no doubt these have been written by Anna Wintour's army of adoring, vacuous fans).Yes, the narrator does feel she's above the industry for which she works, but then again anyone with any brains would. As an avid enthusiast of haute couture who can still see the industry for what it is - a sea of cloth and textile (cleverly put together), anorexic models and industry hypocrites - I would never put up with a boss like that, however thankful I ought to be for such a great opportunity. If the book is semi-autobiographical, I salute Lauren Weisberger and now despise the sour-faced Anna Wintour more than ever! But tip to Lauren, use some of that alleged six-figure sum to pay for writing lessons - sentences far too convoluted, grammar awful.Grade C writing, grade A for subject matter and bitchiness."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"What a total waste of time. The author has NO aidea how to develop her characters--they were cardboard cut-outs. She did not give ANY detail about what Andrea's life was like before she interviewed at &quot; Runway&quot;( except for drifting through Europe and Asia with her boyfriend) I rather liked Miranda, at least her antics kept me guessing about what outlandish stunt she would pull on Andy next."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger, I hope you read this. Your book is terrific. I've published 5 books and thousands of articles -- only another writer would know that you don't need to be grammatically correct everywhere to establish character and mood and plot. Lighten up, reviewers! The book is funny, especially so for us \\"escapees\\" who grew up in NYC and now live elsewhere and can laugh at the absurdities, and relate to some of them. Many of the reviews that criticized Ms. Weisberger's writing style are themselves riddled with grammatical and spelling errors. And an Ivy League education does not a writer make, pardon the ungrammatical sentence. I loved The Devil Wears Prada."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is very similiar, but not the same.I think that we should give her a break. This book is hilarious and I think, exactly what it is supposed to be. A fun, easy read. Go with it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"THANK GOD I only checked this out from the library; I would be embarrassed to own such moronic drivel!Like many others, I was intrigued by what I had read about this in various fashion mags. What a joke! When I try to imagine who the people are that enjoy this, I can only picture the fashionista high school girls in the movie &quot;Clueless.&quot;Other reviews claim there are &quot;details&quot; about the clothes, shoes, whatever. NOT! Only the MOST superficial treatment. I mean, who cares, but this illustrates my point about other readers' opinions (juvenile, superficial).Basically, this book is just about &quot;Andrea,&quot; a pseudo-intellectual recent college graduate who happens to fall into a job at a fashion magazine (think Vogue), working for the hated editor (think Anna Wintour). The &quot;job a million girls would die for,&quot; to be exact..and all too often repeated by the hordes of airheaded hangers-on.This pathetic girl thinks doing a year's time in this job will eventually land her the job she has always wanted at another (literary) magazine, so she puts up with abuse from the editor and the first assistant. Finally she ends up quitting, at the end...but not before you have read through an entire book of whining, monotonous complaints about each incident of mental and verbal semi-abuse Andrea endures at the hands of the editor, Miranda. AND each incident is basically the same one, repeated over and over again! By the way, it goes something like this: Miranda: I need (insert very vague non-description of something) right away; I think I saw it at a shop around (insert general area in New York City). Seriously, the whole story is about Andrea's daily search for the item(s) Miranda wants, without ever getting any clues as to what &quot;it&quot; is (and no, this pseudo-intellectual never has the guts to just ASK).And that's the whole book, right there. I forced myself to read half of it, hoping something would develop (not even any character development in this waste of paper!). I finally gave up, and skimmed the rest...nothing happens until the last few pages, and the end is NOTHING worth slogging through the book for. (This is where Andrea quits the job.)If you think this would appeal to you anyway, check it out at the library first. If you do like it, may I suggest broadening your horizons? There are SO many &quot;chick-lit&quot; books to read, so many other indulgent &quot;quick reads,&quot; that are SOOOOO much better and more entertaining. Anyone who poops out this nonsense and calls it a book does not deserve to be paid for it.This was, without a doubt, the dumbest, most irritating, WORST book I have ever read!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Who am I to question the credibility of Weisberger's experiences at Vogue as told in this book? Even if the entire book was 100% real life, she did a horibble job at delivering it. It is indeed a real life turned drama (overly exaggerated drama), but there's no balance. Her writing became superficial and repetitive like \\"his $10,000 a day model girlfriend\\" or \\"from their $18,000-a-year private school.\\" There are more creative ways to describe glamour and extravagance. And the tone I got with these descriptions were of envy and jealousy. She couldn't separate her own feelings from the story which is in contrast to the character of Andrea, the narrator who Weisberger describe as \\"smart, refreshingly disarming voice...deep, dark devilish view\\". I saw hardly any of that within Andrea. She seemed like an ungrateful, boring, self-centered, arrogant, whiny brat - all the while, with her eyes on The New Yorker - yeah right!This book is centered around Miranda Priestly and her outrageous demands which is Weisberger's bridge burned to the core. There was no substance to the portrayal of Miranda, the writing was way too sterotypical. And for those who don't live in New York or aren't familiar with the fashion industry - Weisberger does little to grab those people. So I felt no empathy for Andrea and no resentment towards Miranda as it was clearly what Weisberger was trying to get.This could have been a great book but the writing is just horrible. It was entertaining just for the gossip. But next time, I would stick to The National Enquirer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My gosh, where do I start? I was in the airport and chose this book as my fluff book based on a recommendation and I have to admit, the title and the cover really got me. I did not expect anything more than a fun, lighthearted read about a young girl in Manhattan with a witch of a boss who I'm sure would have guy troubles of some sort, etc. I was expecting nothing more. However, what I got was a book that seemed to repeat itself over, and over, and over. What's more, the characters were hollow, boring, unimaginative, and limp. There was no plot and if there was one, it was undeveloped. I found myself backtracking from time to time wondering what the heck was going on. Lastly, the writing. Oh my goodness!There was a section of the book in particular that was just way off. The main character goes to a party and is dancing with this guy that was an underdeveloped character. The author really builds this up so that you think something significant is coming. It goes from dancing, etc. at 10pm with this man to \\"oh now it's 1am and I'm on the couch and it's time to go!\\". What the...???Basically the author goes back and forth, round and round, and nothing about this book ever comes together. It has potential, but the author should NOT thank her editor. She needed help on this book, let me tell you.I did finish the book. Why? Because it was like a train wreck -- disgusting and sad, but I couldn't quit looking. I am certain that that, and the buying power of late teens -- is what created the popularity of this book.As soon as I finished reading the book, I snapped it shut and turned to my traveling partner and said, \\"in my 20 years of reading novels I am going to do something that I've never even thought of -- I am going to write to the editor and publisher of this book to let them know what a complete horror this book is.\\""},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"For Heaven's sake, give the girl a break! This is a debut novel and Lauren Weisberger must have been all of twenty-four when she wrote it. Many critics have pointed out the sloppy editing,(&quot;heroine-chic&quot;, etc) but this is hardly the author's fault. Editors are paid to pick up on these errors. This isn't Tolstoy or Dickens. What it is, is a fun, light read... and surprisingly well-written given the age and inexperience of the writer. I thought she painted an extraordinarily vivid picture of the bizarre world of fashion magazine publishing in a story that was more cohesive, humorous and readable than many of the books that have received rave reviews in the last year. Perhaps the many bad reviews in newspapers and magazines were a result of sour grapes and a 'closing of the ranks' by the writers. Talk about protesting too much! They were bending over backwards to come up with bad things to say about this rather blameless book. I wouldn't buy it (I checked it out of the library) but I did enjoy it and I'm looking forward to the movie. I rather think that Ms Weisberger will have the last laugh here."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea Sachs, recently graduated from Brown and still recovering from a case of amoebic dysentery picked up during a post-graduate world tour, goes to work at Runway magazine as the junior assistant to the editor-in-chief, Miranda Priestly. Although she's not remotely interested in the fashion world, she takes the job (which \\"a million girls would kill for\\") because she sees it as a springboard to the career she wants at the New Yorker. In short order, she finds the job she doesn't even care about, and her ultra-demanding boss, are consuming her entire life, creating problems with her boyfriend, and cutting her off from her friends.There you have pretty much the entire plot in a nutshell. I won't tell you the ending, which is pretty predictable anyway. The strength of this book is not in the story itself, which actually reads more like a memoir like a novel. The intrigue of this book is in the look that it gives you at the workings of a major fashion magazine. The author was an assistant to Anna Wintour at Vogue, and despite the name changes, it's clear that we're getting an inside look at Ms. Wintour and her world, right down to the famed Vogue Closet, full of Prada pants, Gucci bags, and Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choos, which might be yours if you took the time to make friends with the right people.But the intrigue is just not that intriguing. There are some entertaining moments, certainly -- the panic that ensues when the staff discovers Miranda is coming into the office after several weeks away is pretty funny -- but the book is just too long, the plotline too simple (I might even say boring), and even the voyeuristic enjoyment you get from a tell-all tale wears thin long before the book comes to an end."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm a little late to this martini party, but was compelled to read it when I learned the author and I graduated the same year from the same school. I soon realized that the film script writers understood how to take the essence of her book and craft a story with natural crescendos and falls that she just couldn't at the young age she was when she wrote it.The core problem with this book is character arc. The beginning is written from the perspective of someone at the end of the journey, already jaded and frustrated before Miranda even comes back to the office. It would have been better if we could have seen an energetic and motivated young woman slowly descend from hope into despair - condensing Miranda's absence in the beginning and using it to create a mysterious and feared presence that is unleashed upon her return. Could have really drawn upon fairy tale structure in an interesting way. But, as written, where does a character go when she is at rock bottom by page 50?The author really should have taken some time off to reflect on her time there, using morsels of her experiences - for instance the Harry Potter fiasco - to establish major plot points. Instead, they were just another on a long checklist of things that were told to us like a laundry list rather than shown to us in a few poignant examples. The result was a sense that what she was going through really wasn't that bad and she was just whining. I never felt her struggle. I was just told repeatedly that it was there.The second problem with the book is the writing style. The author doesn't trust her audience to read between the lines and infer. Her bigotry against Southerners, immigrants from unhip countries, and homeless people is never resolved, leaving me to believe that these bigotries exist within the author herself and should really be resolved.In the end, the author is more a part of this world - the Ivy League education involving all the \\"right\\" fraternity parties described on the website is an example - than she would like to admit. She could not establish the distance necessary from this world to create a character capable of serving as the every-woman in the way that Carrie Bradshaw was able to be.This book represents the pitfalls of a young writer with a sense that there's a story in what she has experienced but not a firm enough idea where it is. Perhaps there should have been a stronger editor, and I pity her that she didn't know the hornet's nest she was diving into by writing about this vacuous world. It's also a commentary on the power of consumerist culture that a book of this middling quality could churn up so much money and attention without a market that demand it to be good. Ah, thus is life... It gave her a career, so let's hope her subsequent books continue to evolve. There is potential in this writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"OK, so it isn't Jane Austen.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes novels like Jackie Collins or entertainment related. I will see the movie now, the book was so much fun!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I do not read chick lit.Mostly, it just doesn't appeal to me. I go in for fantasy, horror, and books where there's more at stake than the cute guy or the character's mental health.However, I did enjoy this book. I just don't like to admit it.Andrea gets a job at Runway magazine, as junior assistant to editor Miranda Priestly. Miranda is a horrible demanding, vindictive boss. The job causes Andrea to push away her friends and family and lose herself in all the stress.Aparently the book is based on the author's own experiences with Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, but I didn't know that when I read the book.The Good:The book is actually quite absorping. I didn't expect to like it anywhere near as much as I did, and I found it difficult to put it down.It's got some very good humor. There were parts where I laughed out loud. Miranda's awfulness is played for laughs. There are also several giggles at the expense of Andrea's coworkers.Some of the side characters were fun. Emily, Andrea's coworker, is interesting. Unlike Andrea, she loves Runway and truly does admire Miranda. However, she's just as stressed as Andrea, if not more. Lilly, Andrea's best friend, is also interesting. She's a Russian lit major with a bit of an alcohol problem.I love Miranda's children.The bad:Miranda is too one-dimensional, and some of the difficulties she throws at Andrea are so crazy as to be unbelievable. She has one sympathetic moment, in which Andrea admires her, saying that \\"I never grew tired of watching Miranda. She was the true lady and the envy of every woman in the museum that night.\\" So she's still one-dimensional. She's a major character, and she can't get away being boring.Andrea herself is a bit 1D.The story is predictable. Lilly the partier is going to get into trouble, Andrea is going to have boyfriend trouble, etc., etc., etc.The ending. Is sappy. Is stupid. Is ridiculous. Made me scream at the author.Overall:I enjoyed this. It's not great literature. Whether it's good literature is up for debate."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a very entertaining book about life in the world of fashion media. A quick, fun read it is perfect for a long air flight or a lazy day at the beach.Having said that it is also somewhat disturbing to read page after page of the complaints of a disgruntled ex-employee. I keep wondering if the author realizes that she is not a slave and instead chose to work for the tyrannical Miranda Priestly, a thinly veiled caricature of Vogue's Anna Wintour.Though I was charmed to take a peak into the world of high fashion publishing, I kept wondering what a nightmare it must have been to hire a know nothing assistant who took this invaluable life experience and turned it into a rant against the impossible boss.Life is tough Ms.Weisberger. No job worth having is easy. I applaud your efforts to turn a miserable experience into a fun read, but get over yourself. There is no such thing as free couture. Instead of complaining incessantly, I wish you had seen the experience for what it was worth: a crash course in the insanity of working in NYC."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"No one should put up with a boss like that and kudos to Lauren for being dignified and telling \\"Her\\" where to stick her Manolos.

It's an very light read that is very predictable."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book's first impression is obviously shallow but if you get to finish it, offers a lot more. I say if you get to finish it because it is just abit too dragging. The first and last parts are interesting and contains the essence of the story, but the \`filling' in between is way too long, and at times cyclical.Though I have not seen the movie adaptation of this book, it doesn't take a lot of effort to try to imagine the scenes in screen. The book looks like it was custom made for a Hollywood chick flick. (the type that you would watch with your best girlfriends)The character of Andy is a perfect heroine, the one readers and viewers alike will really sympathize with--awkward, has her insecurities, has a good heart (she buys coffee for beggars), and has no idea about fashion.Insert a bestfriend who is just the exact opposite--messy, sleeps around, but always there. Add a lovable extra such as a building security guard who has a penchant for 80's music, a cute hot and famous writer who is crazy for Andy (and shows up just about everywhere) and of course--Miranda, the epitome of a grade A classy bitch of a boss.I don't know but to me it sounds like a modified, grown up and more chic version of The Princess Diaries. Not so much the storyline, but more on the character development and positioning.Coincidentally, the same actress (Anne Hathaway) portrays Andy and Amelia (Diaries)I like that the story doesn't have a clich&eacute; ending. It could have easily ended with Andy surviving her 1 year stint, gets promoted, because after all, before she had the fateful row with Miranda in Europe, Miranda was showing signs of interest and admiration in Andy. And hence lesson being \\"you will succeed if you persevere through patience and humility\\"But the story ended the other way around, she finally (though I wonder why it took her that long) had had enough of Miranda, and she doesn't bag her dream job, although she is off to a better start.The issue/question also of which would one rather have: a year working as a slave but at the end of that, you will reach your dream job or, working the normal way, with no guarantees of getting your dream job (or you could, except it may take 5 years or so).Choices such as this are pretty tricky and one thing is sure though, there is no short cut to success.Another issue is compromise. You may be working for the most powerful woman on earth, but when she crushes your pride and treats you less than a human being, at what point will you say enough?I won't say that I love this book but it sure is more than just designer chic lit."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Overall I found this novel disappointing. All the ingredients were there for a really satisfying satire/morality tale but they just never came together with the oompf they might have had in the hands of a more sophisticated writer. The heroine was not all that sympathetic, the villain not evil enough, plot lines either obvious or reiterative, climax really flaccid and unsatisfying. A few more drafts might have made a difference. A good book for a rainy weekend or day at the beach."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think the story was an absolute hoot. Great entertainment. Although, I would agree with some of the other reviewers that the tense of the story flipped around to much. I found myself having to flip back a few pages (on several occasions) to figure out if Andrea was talking about something happening right then, or relaying something in the past tense. Despite this, the writing flowed. Although I haven't seen the movie yet, I certainly pictured Meryl Streep as Miranda throughout the book. I am sure with her talent, she will be able to perfectly enact Miranda's role in the movie! That alone had me laughing at Miranda'a antics throughout!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book could have been so much more, but it was just too much superficial for me. It is so material oriented and has big designer names dropped left and right like its the only thing in the world that the person cares about. The book was too much about the world Andrea lives in that what she feels and human emotions. I give it three stars because the style of writing was quick and slightly witty. It flowed nicely but towards the end the story was too much of the same thing over and over. I got bored by the end since the same thing was happening over and over. The ending wasn't what I expected because it was too simple and didn't satisfy what Andrea went through. There wasn't a bang, just something simple. Maybe it's how life is...or maybe the story isn't that great.It was a fun light read...but not completely satisfying as other chik-lit books. Too much work, not enough life."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Decent writing kept me in briefly. Waited through the complaining about job, then more complaining, for plot to thicken.

Throughout the story, Andy, the junior assistant, chooses her job over her family and friends in many situations.The story was a little slow at first. It took about 6 chapters before I was into it. The ending was very enjoyable. It's a good beach read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While not a great read, this was especially appealing to me because I used to work in the industry. I can relate to everything she depicted. I've seen it first hand. A fun summer beach read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"i hated it, and not because it's chick-lit, or because it's stupid, but because the main character is SO unlikeable. Andi Sachs is a chain smoking, ungrateful, selfish girl who wants to be a serious journalist. Instead, she takes a job at Runway, the fictional Vogue. Ignoring the fact that it is a multibillion dollar company, and Miranda is the head of a HUGELY successful company, she spends most of the time saying how much better she is than a fashion magazine. It seems like Lauren Weisberger is bitter about her seperation from Vogue, and has decided Miranda is the villian, despite the fact that Miranda is a much more interesting character. Watch the movie instead: it paints both Andi, and Miranda in a much better light. Instead of Miranda seeming so black and white, Meryl Streep makes her complicated. I like chick-lit, and I like fashion, but Lauren Weisberger has written a book that incorporates both, but she seems to hate them as well."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved it. This is exactly the kind of book I am totally into reading. I love the story of a girl who comes from nothing, or next to nothing and lands it big with a job or handsome rich new beau. I don't get into the whole reading between the lines. If this is any hints into Laurens past job with Vogue, I don't care about that. I read books for the pure entertainment of it. Not to analyze every word or thought. Great book, and great movie to boot!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Great book to read if you have every thought your boss was a tyrant. I laughed and sympathized at the crazy situations the main character finds herself in. When she finally comes to the realization that the worse thing that can happen is to lose her job- she finally lets go and enjoys the privileges her job allows."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Its funny. Its well written. The evil woman will probably remind you of someone you worked for in the past. Great read for anyone that's had to do a terrible internship! The book holds your attention and the plot is unique. Definitely one for the collection."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Having seen the infamous movie adaptation before reading the novel I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised to find the latter as enjoyable. Sure, it takes a while before things really get rolling (that is called \\"character development\\"), and the major subplot involving the protagonist's best friend, though effective, could have been more subdued (still it was quite gripping and touching in the end); But as a whole, the novel sure captivates, due mostly to a fine rhythmic pacing and a fit narrative approach. The behind-the-scene roman &agrave; clef style does work to its advantage, as does the heroine likability status. You want her to succeed and have it all. Oh yes, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA deserves all the stops, especially for those beach read types who like something extra in between their book covers. Brava, Lauren Weisberger.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Devil Wears Prada By: Lauren WeisbergerFresh out of ivy-league college and looking to land her dream job as a writer for the New Yorker magazine, Andy Sachs (Ahn-dre-ah) embarks on a year long journey working as a junior assistant for Miranda Priestly, editor of the most fashionable magazine around, Runway. Working for Miranda, who is known for being sadistic, difficult and notoriously demanding, for a year will open the door to the New Yorker quicker for Andy than any other path she can think of. The question is, Can she survive a year with this woman? After all, this is the job, that has nothing to do with writing and everything to do with fetching coffee to dropping off dry cleaning is the job \\"A million girls would die for\\", or so she is told over and over again. But is she one of those girls? Especially when it comes at the expense of her friends and family? With a cast of easily likable and unlikable characters, Devil Wears Prada is an easy, fun chic-lit read that can be enjoyed. But while being an easy read, there is a well hidden core message that reminds us to realize how we prioritize work, family and love."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to admit that if I had read this before I had seen the movie I probably would have liked it a lot more. The book doesn't seem as outrageous once you've seen it. Miranda doesn't come to life as much in the book and Andrea doesn't have the same qualities on paper. That being said, I did enjoy reading the differences. There is some added substance to the book that they had to cut out of the movie for whatever reason. Although after awhile the book started to feel repetitive. I almost felt like Andrea in thinking what ungodly thing would Miranda ask for next because even I knew it was coming. I knew the inevitable conclusion, but I founds myself hoping the book would get there sooner. I would recommend it to those who haven't already seen the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love this book.

The whole time I was comparing Miranda's and Andy's character to Anne Hathway's and Meryl Streep's portrayals in the movie, thinking, \\"Would Anne Hathway/Meryl Streep do/say that?\\" The story line is completely different. The book's is lacking tremendously, with none of the twists and characters as the movie. I love the movie much much better, but I'm glad I read this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"One aspect of this book that is undermentioned is the impact of having a hellish boss. I read this book when I was in that situation and it helped me have some laughs along the way. Other than that it is a little fantasy land to drift off to on a vacation. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend is truly examined in the book - a major piece that was likely left out of the movie due to timing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It could of been better, but enjoyable quick read. I wish people/characters would quit whining and change what they are whining about."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is light, light, light. I was pressed to finish it -- but what the heck (I buy it, I read it). Andrea and her wimpy colleagues drove me up the wall. At least Miranda spoke the truth (for her!). I think the only people who would like this are those who have worked for someone like Miranda, or those who are really impressed by fancy clothes & designers."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I had completed the first 100 pages, Andrea had already become acclimated to the Strange World of Miranda Priestly having been born as Miriam Princhek in London.

Her Senior Assistant, Emily had guided Andrea in the exact preparation of Starbucks Coffees, Juices, with two eggs, Yogurt, Sausages and slices of Crisp Bacon! She needed 9 newspapers, from The New York TIMES, to The Wall Street Journal... Also Monday's Editions of 7 Weekly News Magazines, from Time to Newsweek to the New Yorker!Supposedly, Andrea assumes her Job as Miranda's Junior Assistant for the Editor Of RUNAWAY FASHIONS would become a rather routine. Wrong! This has become an engrossing, spell-binding story!

This is worth the read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found this book very disjointed and trivial.Obviously, I am not someone mesmerised by the fashion world and cannot understand the fascination.It passed the time on a cold, wet afternoon, but I wouldn't recommend it for a stimulating read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I worked at a Barnes and Noble and this book was on the bestsellers list for some time, so I purchased it and boy, was I disappointed. The \\"coming of working age\\" and \\"empowerment\\" story was well written, and the story was intriguing and amusing until the climax. I felt less empowered and more disgusted. What I disliked about this book was not the writing, for it was not of poor quality, but the climax was, in my opinion, horribly stupid."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I've been looking at this book to read for the past year or so and each time I went to buy it something kept holding me back. So when I finally found it at my local library, I took the chance on getting it knowing that I wouldn't be out anything if it was horribly bad. And horribly bad it was. Both Andrew and Miranda drove me up a wall. Each was whiney and selfish and their constant lack of consideration for other people was enough to make me want to scream. Andy ends up abandoning her whole life and throughout the book complains that she doesn't have a life. If you hate your job that much then please just quit and get it over with. Miranda, on the other hand, seems to find herself so high and mighty that she hires personal \\"slaves\\" to take care of her every whim. The whole story line tends to grow very old, very quickly.Furthmore, the people of the magazine industry should take a look at this book and see just how shallow they are. If I ever had to work with people who felt that if I didn't dress a certain way, with certain brand then I should be fired, I would gladly see my way out. Additionally, this book illustrates just why anorexia and bullimia are so popular among the younger generation of America. If these are the younger generations role models, our country has a lot to work on.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, not even for a beach read. The only reason I gave it a two was because I liked the cover and thought Andrea's boyfriend sounded cute."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Not very well written, but the characters are intersting and LOTS of drama.

It is the perfect thing if you just want something to relax with and something that makes you feel as if your boss may not be the worst in the world.When Andrea goes to work for Miranda, she has no idea what she is in for. As time progresses, Miranda's demands go over the top and Andrea is reduced to a mindless minion, spending hours on trivial tasks for a she-devil.The book is funny when it shows the depravity of Miranda and the incessant demands she places upon Andrea.Very fun if you don't expect a deep read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I work in an office that is right next to a popular chain bookstore, and I remember when this book came out a couple of years ago the bookstore made this massive window display promoting the novel, and I remember being attracted by the cute cover art of this book. It was colorful yet not very complicated -- it looked like something anyone could draw, and yet it was rather stylish and almost mesmerizing, in the same way that the girl who wears a simple, inexpensive little dress at that party ironically looks so much more sophisticated than the others in their designer gowns.The trouble with The Devil Wears Prada is that the cover of the book is the only interesting part of it. The rest of the book is, to use an already overused colloquialism, \\"uber-lame.\\"I knew I'd dislike this book even a year and a half ago since most of my coworkers disliked the book and told me about it. And yet, many months later, I finally surrendered and decided to read that awful book for myself. It's sort of like when your girlfriends tell you that a certain guy is all wrong for you, but you just have to date him anyway, convincing yourself that he's actually nicer than they say. Sometimes you're right and can revel in a \\"see I told you so\\" moment, but most of the time your friends correctly predicted an utter trainwreck. The Devil Wears Prada is a trainwreck. And, like a trainwreck, I stared at it from cover to cover, unable to look away, even though I knew it was terrible.I'm not going to get into why I think this book is a trainwreck since a lot of other reviewers have summed it up already in reviews that I agree with. Let me just warn you -- this book is probably all wrong for you. Maybe you'll read it anyway, and will have a \\"see I told you so\\" moment, but chances are you'll probably say to yourself, \\"yes, that book was a horrible experience, but I just had to see for myself.\\"PS~ 1 star for the cute cover, and 1 more star for the author -- it takes a huge amount of dedication to know you're writing a lousy book and have the will to keep writing and writing and writing..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you like the Shopaholic series, then you'll just love this book!

Miranda is the head honcho at Runway magazine and when she says jump, you don't even ask \\"how high\\", you just do it. Andrea soon realizes that her so called job isn't all what it's cracked up to be. She has to take care of Miranda's laundry, her meals, which by the way must be hot and placed in a specific way and so many more meaningless tasks. If you've ever had a boss that you absolutely hated, reading this book will probably make your boss seem like an angel. Strange thing though, I just don't ever recall Miranda wearing Prada as the title refers."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed the book &amp; thought it provided an interesting perspective of a world I had never even wondered about. Last year I really enjoyed The Nanny Diaries, which this is repeatedly compared to, and I enjoyed both.

Beyond that they don't share the same message so it isn't a repeat read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you love Fashion and NYC you will really enjoy this book! The title gets you...The characters are kinda flat, and a little underdeveloped but the book on a whole is very funny and interesting if you are into fashion etc...

I will read anything that Ms. Lauren Weisberger writes, bravo Lauren!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although the book was not very well written (and she did seem to complain an awfully lot) it was interesting to me as a reader, having worked there in the late 60's, early 70's (the days of Diana Vreeland) for gasp!......the advertising/merchandising department as an assistant. It was a hoot to find that I was an outcast according to An-dre-a. It was more of a life defining moment for me. Oh, there were horror stories, such as, higher-up editors demanding that their assistants come clean their closets on the weekends! But many of the editors were very good, creative, well adjusted people as I recall!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As a former Vogue employee for a short time (until I could take it no longer) who remained at Cond&eacute; Nast, I can say first-hand that The Devil Wears Prada is an accurate description of what goes on inside that building in Times Square. However, I found the writing poor and the book just a repetitive checklist of couture designers and name-dropping of NYC hotspots. If you live in NYC and work in publishing, take this book with you for a quick beach or plane read and enjoy saying to yourself, \\"Oh that must be (insert name of Vogue employee).\\" If you live or work outside of the NYC area, don't waste your time.I expected a much more in-depth look at the fashion publishing world, but turns out that my own personal experiences in the industry are significantly more interesting. Perhaps I have a future publishing and movie contract in my career, too."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"this book was very amusing; it tended to drown on sometimes, but i was very intrigued with wretched boss and crew that this girl puts up with. its definitely a good read...u dont need to be fashionable or interested in fashion to enjoy this book"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Developed and interesting characters. I love that the character though young have experience alot."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up the novel because I wanted some light reading, and I'd seen a review of the film which said that the novel was better--more pointed and biting. I somehow made it to the novel's end, but it had become tiresome and predictable by about page fifty.To be fair, I'm probably not the target audience, which seems to be teenage girls, if I can judge by Lauren Weisberger's writing style. Rarely is a guy mentioned without the adjective \\"adorable\\" attached to him, and the principal adverb in the book seems to be \\"totally.\\" The novel's main gimmick is that Andrea is abused and humiliated by her boss, Miranda Priestly. But that gimmick wears thin very quickly, as Weisberger can't really come up with many variations on it. And what's more annoying is that long after the readers have learned to see what's coming, Andrea remains clueless. After a while, Miranda isn't the only one who thinks Andrea is stupid--readers are inclined to agree with her.But the most irritating thing about this novel is its value system. Andrea comes from this literary family. For as long as she can remember, it's been her dream to work at The New Yorker, and she sees her job at the fashion magazine, Runway, as a stepping stone to her career as a writer. She spends the entire novel deriding the superficial cliquishness of the fashion world, where who someone is is more important than what ideas she has. Andrea (and by extension, Lauren Weisberger) thinks that she is so much more substantial than this. But it turns out that Andrea's world is just as cliquish. She almost falls for Christian not because of what he thinks but because of his celebrity as a writer. In the novel's conclusion, she enters the same building where she used to work, feeling superior to everyone there because, \\"now she's somebody.\\" It's tempting to think that Weisberger is engaging in a bit of irony here--that she's deflating her heroinne and poking fun at pretentiousness whereever it lies. But I'm afraid there's no indication of that. The novel is prententious, hypocritical, and--alas--a bore."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am only several chapters into the book but so far it's poorly written. I didn't find it witty at all. Too bad since a story like this could have been written in a much more entertaining way. I don't like the main character at all. She just seems so whinny and not very smart either.Not sure if I will finish the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This reminded me of the \\"Nanny Diaries\\". If someone could come up with a believable reason to put up with such horrendous behavior from a boss, both books would flow better. Although I will admit the opportunity to work for the \\"New Yorker\\" did flow a little better than the reasoning behind the Diaries.Another thing that both Devil and Diaries were lacking was depth, although they did try. Both authors did not have the ability to be both fun and meaningful. As a result, the meaningful parts almost slapped you in the face \\"Wait a minute? Was this a deep moment, I may need to re-read that page.\\" Both had climaxes so near the end of the story, that you almost wished they had just kept it funny and not tried to bring in any meaning and self-realization. Because the books were definitely funny, just very stilted when attempting depth.(By the way, Marian Keyes is totally able to do this. She took the same scenario and made it both a GREAT, FUN read and a MEANINGFUL story \\"Sushi for Beginners.\\" I always describe her to friends as \\"Bridget Jones - with depth.\\" So far, no one has been disappointed.)I will say that it was somewhat entertaining. My sister aspires to be a part of that world. If that reflects reality at all (and she makes the big time), I will have to make sure that she leaves work at work, because I truly don't care about such things."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Well, this isn't going to make literary history. It's a very, very fast \\"beach\\" read. Nothing heavy, nothing deep, just the story of an insipid personal assistant to a high powered fashion magazine editor. Once the pattern of verbal abuse, rudeness, and outrageous requests are established by Miranda Priestly (i.e. the \\"Devil\\") it goes on, and on, and on for chapter after chapter. I started to get fed up with the assistants constantly 'taking it' from the boss Miranda and couldn't wait for her to take action."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book kept me interested through out the whole thing, which has to mean something because if I dont like a book, I wont read it. I liked reading about the high end designer items, but my only problem with the book is that it really doesnt go anywhere. It just talks about her horrible boss and the stupid things she makes her do. There really isnt a big plot or climax. I was hoping for more in the end, and the book description, on the book flap anyway, doesnt even describe the book the way it happens. It makes it sound as if Andreah is going to nearly die - which she doesnt. Sorry to spoil it for everyone. I was hoping for more out of the characters; Andreas boyfriend, etc. but it just wasnt there. If you like designer items like I do, it will keep you interested, but dont read it if you can find something better. Please dont buy this book - check it out at your local library."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I often heard this book and The Nanny Diaries talked about together. After reading them both, this one is much better than the Nanny Diaries. It combines snappier dialogue and a better main character. As many women would love to be able to get an eye into the fashion world, this book takes you there as if you were on the bottom of the ladder. Whether it's accurate or not is not really even an issue, it's just a fun light read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This isn't Shakespeare and anyone looking for great fiction should look elsewhere. That said, if you are looking for good chick-lit, you should buy this book.

Miranda is a jackal and makes Andrea's life a living Hell. She forces poor Andrea to work 14 hour days and carry a cell phone at all times so that Andrea has virtually no life beyond her job. Andrea wants to quit but if she wants to get ahead in the world of journalism, she needs to work for Miranda for 1 year and then she will obtain the much needed and coveted recommendation. The only question is what will it cost Andrea in exchange?\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was priceless! Miranda Priestly is the boss from Hell and any person who has ever held a job can fully relate. Andrea is a totally sympathetic character that takes way more from a job than I ever would have, recommendation or not. I did wish at certain times that she would have stood up to Miranda. However, the novel was wonderfully crafted and I was terribly pleased with it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This was a fun read.

Well, with so many people wanting to speak their minds about it , it must be worth reading, don't you think? And here is another reason: When \\"TIME\\" magazine has Kate Bett - the former editor of Harper's Bazaar to review the book ,making all effort possible to send it to the pyre with the accusation of having the nerve to unveil the not-so-pretty world of a fashion magazine...IT IS worth reading.Lauren Weisenberg tells the story of a young college graduate with lots of dreams and no idea of what is going on, at the real world of business, who , quite accidentally, is offered the editor's second assistant job at the world's most successful fashion magazine. Believing she will be able to exchange this background with a work at the \\"New Yorker\\" , as she always wanted, she signs and her life at hell begins.Soon enough she realizes that she is working for a monster-boss, being asked to perform outrageous and pointless tasks, is working more than 12 hours per day and getting poorly paid for that, while her personal life is severely damaged. Will she put up with it? Would you put up with it?Although not a literature diamond, this book was fun to read and it puts a smile back to the face of those are suffering at work.I believe that , if anything, it is at least encouraging the fact that someone out there stood up and spoke against the modern slavery on the ever demanding, fast paced business world. It is encouraging because a lot of Mirandas and Emilys are arising from every corner. Look out!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book. I started reading and couldn't put it down! I still find myself thinking about the story. With out giving anything away... The story line could be a bit confusitng due to the jumping back to the main character's memory and the jumping forward to her present. However this in no way detracted from the story. In fact I think it adds to the the colossal break in the end, which made me smile and feel proud of our heroine.This was an entertaining, exciting and a fun, funny read. I recomend it to all who would like to be entertained.Just a warning...don't be alarmed if you start conscidering your clothes a bit more, at least for a few days!ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book. I also read the Nanny Diaries and although there are similarities to plot line, I was hoping it would not end the same. You will have to read it to see.

To me, it's not supposed to be a book that makes you think. It's not an intellectual novel. It's an easy, fun, quick beach read. Put simply: A book you can read in a day. Weisberger is not an excellent, sophisticated writer, but she's good enough to create a story that's both funny and interesting. I will say this, I wasn't bored. I agree that it is similar to \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" however; they were two very different books (different subjects), but yes, they border on being alike in that they both have insane, over-the-top bosses. My two cents: If you've got time, (or if you're going to the beach), buy it and read it, but if you don't, I wouldn't recommend it. Weisberger is no Carol Goodman (\\"The Lake of Dead Languages\\" -a MUST read) or Donna Tart (\\"The Secret History\\" - another excellent book). She could have published a better novel, after all, she DID graduate from Cornell. Tsk, tsk."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm surprised by so many lukewarm and lackluster reviews of this fun and witty romp.

Thankfully, Weisberger avoids the gimmicks and clich?s that turn me off of this genre. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; is a blistering but entertaining view of fashion publishing. Discovering Miranda Priestly, the world's worst boss, is reason enough to read this book. By some miracle, the monstrous Miranda doesn't overshadow the rest of Devil's characters: Andrea our narrator, her friends outside of The Fashion Publishing Industry, Miranda's latest junior assistant, and a staff of--- not sure what you'd call them - terrified cronies all with a love-hate relationship with Miranda.I'd love to see this make it to a film version and can't wait to read something else from this author. The writing, the characters and the unimaginable horrors of Miranda really set this book apart."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found the book pretty entertaining. A Brown Univeristy litereature graduate crosses with a high-fashion, icon, of course personalites are going to clash. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to see how it would end.I also found some inaccuracies but I over looked them. I thought the characters were very developed. I could feel Andrea's pain from Miranda's orders, etc. Although, I agree with the other reviewer, I don't know why she was so stuck on working at the New Yorker, I also didn't like how she, somewhat, put down fashion. I see fashion as a type of art, and expression, and a hobby.I kept asking myself what I would do in the situation. I probably would have stuck with it, seeing that I do not have the mass of problems she had. I also liked the side comments she made about such situations, quite humorous.Good, quick read. I'd recommend it to anyone who is into fashion."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The title is catchy, unfortunately, the book itself failed to live up to its captivating title. The narratives tend to drag a bit, which makes the story dreary at times. The readers will also found themselves being bombarded by designer names, and will also get an extensive lesson in what to buy, what to wear, and what is the acceptable brands to buy. After reading the book, even the least fashion savvy person would know that when you want the perfect wrap dress, you should go for Diane Von Furstenberg, the sexy strappy sandles, Jimmy Choo of course, and the famous scarf, please head straight to Hermes.Although the story is not what I expected, it was nevertheless, extremely entertaining, and fun. It's great for recent college graudates, girls who can never get tired of hearing about designer labels and the fabulous world of fashion magazines, and most importantly, this book is perfect for those who believe that no matter how harsh life can be, it will always have somewhat of a perfect ending."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The flamboyant title, The Devil Wears Prada, is the first novel by Lauren Weisberger. This book draws resemblance to her previous job as an assistant to Vogue magazine's editor. Set in a high fashion environment in New York City, the story revolves around Andrea Sachs who is a recent college graduate and dreams to write for The New Yorker. She contracts dysentery while on her trip to Delhi with her boyfriend, Alex where she loses twenty pounds and makes her already lean frame an ideal candidate for a job in the fashion magazine world. Andrea lands a job as a junior assistant to Miranda Priestly at the Runway magazine, \\"a job that millions of girls would die for\\". This starts Andrea's struggles with her life and career.Before she realizes it, Andrea is thrown into a world, which she hardly knew existed. Andrea finds herself in a workplace that shouts \\"Prada! Armani! Versace!\\"at every turn. Though Andrea has no inclination to the fashion world, she takes up this job believing that Miranda's recommendation will fetch her a job at the New Yorker after a year of service. She finds herself surrounded by people wearing the trendiest and the most expensive clothes. Her boss Miranda expects her employees to work fourteen hours a day and most weekends. As her assistant, she lived under the terror of her boss and was expected to do miniscule jobs such as wrapping Christmas gifts or serving her coffee at the piping hot temperature that she prefers. Her infamous boss, Miranda is impolite, mean, insensitive, and has no room for human errors whatsoever. Andrea's job gets so demanding that it strains her relationship with her boyfriend, friends and family. She is faced with a tough decision to choose between serving the devil or her people.The Devil Wears Prada is a humorous, entertaining and lighthearted book to read. For someone who is interested in fashion, the book is a good treat to the eyes. It is not a classic novel with character maturization, but a simple story without much substance. It is not for an intellectual reader since the readers learn the lesson way before Andrea does. Andrea's character is very interesting and easy to relate. Though the author did a good job of portraying the characters of Andrea and Miranda, after a while the monotony in the daily activities makes the book seem like a torture. My final thoughts on this book - it is not worth the hefty price."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just finished reading it and am soooo thrilled that the book didn't suck. I haven't read a book that hasn't sucked in a loooong time. It wasn't too sad, it wasn't toooo devastating, and it was written in an interesting way ... and I could barely put it down but when I had to I wasn't cranky with the people in my life (...because when I get into a book, I get into a book...)I could relate to almost every character in the book. It was like every single character (From the parents to the \\"bi_ch\\" to even the author. When I wrote, that's how I used to write.) was a different facet of myself.It could only take place in NY with the New York obsession of being smart and being at/in the right place/thing... being \\"in the know\\"...I just loved it! It's not a \\"girl\\" book... because I seriously find that term shallow and demeaning. It's a book about people... and life after college...What I really loved was that somehow, through it all, the \\"naive\\" lead character stayed \\"real\\" and didn't do anything out of character for her even though she was encountering what seemed like \\"out of body\\" circumstances daily... I could go on but I won't bore you...It's a lovely, lovely, lovely book... really... buy it, read it, save it, read it again in a few years...... and Lauren, I will buy multiple copies of your next book for a mention... ;) Congratulations"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was dissapointed of how the book ends. I would have expected Andrea's telling off Miranda to be more descriptive and intense. After all the stress and how much one gets to hate her boss....Andrea should have at least kill her. It is an entertaining but very stressful story to read. I would never put up with 10 minutes of this ridiculous Miranda character."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I finished this book in about three days, but wasn't very pleased. After months of wanting to read this book, I finally broke down and bought it. I should have checked it out from the library. I expected more excitement. I think it ended to soon. The end was rushed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. I can just picture every character and I now want to know what will become of everyone. Maybe a sequel? Very quick fun read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"A bright graduate of Brown finds herself hired as assistant to the highest woman editor (loved and hated by all) in the fashion industry - and relegated to being a go-fer, spending her days, in her own words, \\"finding, fetching, and faxing.\\" In spite of her grim job, she keeps a realistic outlook on life and shares it with readers as the author pens spot-on anecdotes and character studies of those within the frivolous world of fashion.A good beach read with a virtuous little moral waiting at its soft and palpable heart."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren/Andrea seems to have great contempt for the magazine she works for, the people she works with, and the fashion industry herself (&quot;why do I care?&quot; is asked often in this book), but she seems perfectly happy to wear/adopt the designer clothes and shoes that are given to her, and, for someone who doesn't care about fashion, she introduces all new characters (even the doorman) by what they're wearing. On top of this, she is ungrateful for her position (who takes that many personal calls?) and doesn't have the insight to understand why she *should* care: her boss, Anna Wintour/Miranda Priestly, is one of the most important and influential businesswomen in the world today-- how can that escape the narrator? If Andrea were really an aspiring writer she would be taking the networking opportunities much more seriously: she completely misses an opportunity with Christian's editor, for example. And the ending is indeed a letdown-- the Nanny Diaries did a much better job of vindication."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book had me hooked. It's a fast read and very funny at times. You quickly become part of the book and truley empathise with the mail character. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Well I just finished reading this book and completely enjoyed it! I was shocked to see all of the terrible write ups. I am a 30 something, avid reader from NY. This is not Shakespeare, nor was it meant to be. If you liked Sex In The City and The Nanny Diaries- you will love this book. Happy reading!!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"By the time you read this review, you probably realize that The Devil Wears Prada narrates a year -- well, eleven months -- in the life of Andrea Sachs, recent Brown U graduate.Desperately needing a job, Andrea signs up to be junior assistant to Miranda Priestly, doyenne of high fashion and editor of Runway, hottest fashion magazine on the planet. Being a junior assistant means embarking on a series of scavenger hunts to make the great woman's life easier or at least more amusing.Sure it's a light-hearted chick book. Andrea toils in a pink collar ghetto, courted by big-budget advertisers and fashion houses. She rides around in chauffeured town cars, gets to wear high-fashion clothes and meets famous people. In return she works eighteen-hour days and runs around on meaningless errands.Miranda sends her off to find a restaurant but conveniently forgets to mention that it's in Washington, not New York. She tells Andrea to find \\"Madeleine,\\" who could be anyone, anywhere. Miranda's assistants are terrrified to ask for clarification. Instead, they spend hours -- and thousands of dollars -- on inept detective work.Sure, it's a year-long version of hell week, but it's also an initiation into a world that will pay dividends throughout Andrea's working life. And I think Andrea knows this, on some level. I don't think she whines, as some reviewers say. I think she goes along with the program and handles herself amazingly well.And while the book could be shorter -- by the tenth torment we get the picture -- Andrea's job isn't all that unusual for a probationer entering a competitive world. Read Billable Hours and Liars Poker: highly paid legal and financial newbies spend hours doing what amounts to clerical work and round-the-clock devotion is the norm. And it's hard to argue they're serving humanity.I wish Andrea's parents and friends had left her alone to finish her year. Andrea's boyfriend is a nurturing-type schoolteacher -- a gender bender relationship -- and her father is a therapist. Neither understands the demands of high-power corporate jobs. Few organizations would offer compassionate leave for a friend's accident, and the circumstances leading up to the accident don't inspire sympathy.Comparisons to Nanny Diaries can be misleading. True, Nanny Diaries seems shorter and tighter, yet a nanny job leads nowhere. It's just a way for a desperate college girl to survive so putting up with a crazy boss has little value.Here, Andrea embarks on a career. Hanging out with the elite in any field gives you access that you can't get any other way, even if you change fields. Nannies serve time; Andrea undergoes initiation.In a brief \\"what happened next\\" chapter, Andrea benefits from her eleven months at Runway, just as the lawyer in Billable Hours admits he needed his affiliation with a big-name firm to get his next job. She learned more than she realizes as the book ends. A good read and no sympathy needed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"here's my two-cents. If the author, Lauren Weisberger, truly did write this book to spite her former employer, I wonder how her colleagues in the writing world perceive her now? It seems like she's outed herself as extremely unprofessional.and what the heck does &quot;natch!&quot; mean?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this was a good first effort by Lauren Weisberger although it really is no different from any other chick book, so I don't really understand why this one made it to the NYT bestseller list and any other one didn't. She does say in the acknowledgements that the people she named promised to buy multiple copies of the book if she named them, so maybe that explains the phenomenon.If you like chick literature, then I would recommend reading this book. I see it has some negative reviews, but it really isn't all that bad, it just has alot of hype, whether deserved or not deserved, you be the judge."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada offers insight into the glamourous world of fashion magazines. For anyone who has ever considered a carreer in fashion journalism, this book helps shatter the seemingly perfect world of magazines. It is written in a smart, witty style and while one may guess it is based on the author's own experiences, it is difficult to believe another human being could be so awful! It definately makes you appreciate your own boss a lot more after reading about Miranda's antics! Run carefully in your Jimmy Choo's and buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I've read through the reviews and to be honest, I'm a bit shocked there are so many negative comments out there. This isn't intended to be the next novel of the day, it's a light hearted, funny story. Give the author some credit for creating a cute, laugh out loud story. I had to shake my head at some of the crazy demands that Miranda had for Andrea. If you like cute and funny, pick this up, if not, leave it on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm sure we can all relate to having a boss from hell, but this is a whole other level of misery. I loved the authors' quick wit and fast paced style. I read it all in one sitting. Andy's character and dilemma (putting up with satan in the hopes of a chance at a real career) were relatable and sympathetic. Many of us have had the experience of been young and stuck in some job early on in our career, where we had to weigh the pay off of putting up a lunatic boss against our pride--and sometimes even common sense for the greater good of future prospects.The situations and tasks Andy faces were hysterical --and sad. For instance having Miranda wake her up at 3am ordering her to charter a jet for her for 6am THAT MORNING!Miranda was a hysterical character--made even funnier by the fact that people like her REALLY do exist with all their insane idosyncrasies tolerated solely because they are in a position of power. It was a fun peek into the fast paced, glamorous world of magazine publishing.I found this to be a highly entertaining and enjoyable read, not at all the novice attempt others are criticising it as being."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I absolutely loved it!! Weisberger gives a truthful account of what it is like to work for one of the biggest names in the fashion publishing world. As a friend of someone who worked for the actual woman this book is based on, I can tell you, it is all true!! This book keeps you sucked in from the first page to the last. It is very well written, hysterically funny, and an overall great summer read! I highly reccommend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Meet the devil...Miranda Priestly, editor in chief of Runway magazine. Ask anyone who works either directly or indirectly with her and they might, in a split second of thinking-before-speaking, admit she's the worst boss ever - demanding, overbearing, unappreciative. The list goes on and on.Of course, then the phenomenon of \\"Paranoid Turnaround\\" will kick in and they will begin spouting what a truly extraordinary person she is. Try telling that to Andrea Sachs, her new junior assistant.In desperate need of a job, and hoping to land something as an editorial assistant, Andrea left resum&eacute;s with several magazine houses. When she received the call for an interview, off she went, the Miss America of fashion-cluelessness, to the Elias-Clark building and the devil herself.Apparently, Andrea's obvious lack of knowledge evidenced by her mismatched choice of interview-appropriate clothing wasn't an important factor because she landed the job \\"a million girls would love to have.\\" Good or bad? She would soon find out.Prior to becoming Miranda Priestly's assistant, Andrea had a boyfriend, a best friend and a life which included spending time with them and her family. This, however, was unthinkable while working at Runway.Miranda and her needs had to come first, in fact, they should be the only thing that exist in a person's life. How could anyone possibly think that friends and family meant more than finding an elusive restaurant review in an unknown paper, having a fresh breakfast delivered every 10 minutes (throwing away each previous one when the new one arrives) until Miranda finally waltzes through the door or updating the Bulletin every six seconds as each new phone message arrives?But for all of the humiliation and torture of working for Miranda, after a year a person could basically choose where they wished to work next. And Miranda would pull her strings and make it happen.Andrea wanted to write for the New Yorker so badly she could taste it, but would she be able to hold up under the stress for the first year...even when it meant losing everything that was dear to her?Author Lauren Weisberger has an amazing talent of her own - balancing humor and cynicism with an underlying seriousness. The story of Andrea's career as Miranda's tortured assistant will have the reader bouncing back and forth between laughing out loud, wanting to throttle Ms. \\"No-one-and-nothing-matters-in-the-world-but-Me\\" and even wanting to smack some sense into the semi-brainwashed Andrea herself.Never once will the reader find the story dull as Andrea is forced to do impromptu karaoke in order to get through turnstiles, run down slushy sidewalks on four-inch stilettos multiple times until the coffee she is fetching actually makes it back into the building warm and is constantly forced to endure fierce degradation while wishing she could speak her sarcastic comments out loud."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is one of those rare occasion where THE MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK! Andrea's character in the book is pathetic. She whines and bitxxes about everything, and I'm getting VERY ANNOYED at her character. But since I started reading it, I have to finish it. Reading this book is a real TORTURE! Andrea is a forgetful snob who makes tons of stupid mistakes, and she does NOT understand the responsibilities of a personal assistant. She keeps whining about why she has to do all these things for her boss. Hello? That's your job, so STOP BITXXING! AND if she messes things up in her personal life, she blames it on her boss. How pathetic.I still don't know what all the hype is about. If you're reading this, here's my warning to you: DO NOT READ THE BOOK!Go watch the movie instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I haven't seen the movie, but I won't let my opinion of the book effect that, since I suspect the movie underwent plenty of rewrite, given the sad lack of charcater formation or dialogue of Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep in the movie. And boy, does this book need rewrites.Hardly a likeable character to be found, much less the supposedly victimized protaganist, Amanda. How sad that so much more research was put into the most minor details of labels, when pages of plot and character development could have been given to both main characters. The character of Miranda is a rich character, with so many possibilities, she can move almost endlessly. Instead, Weisberger just drops her on the fringes of the book and lets her become a child-fantasy of a she-wolf.Quite simply, any woman intelligent enough to have risen to the heights that Miranda Priestly supposedly has would be far more cutting, intelligent, managerial, and-- evil though she may be-- she'd have a lot more to scream about than the most trivial matters. Obviously, the author can't get beyond trivial-- so we're left with a completely unformed but potentially great character.The ending-- the final confrontation the book inevitably leads to-- is such a let down, happens so quickly, and is written so poorly, it's a wonder this thing made it to press. Here again, the author simply can't make an intelligent point, or deliver the come-uppance Miranda so desparately needs. In the end, after Amanda's final \\"tell off,\\" I was left thinking, \\"Miranda, it's your own fault for hiring such a dolt.\\"The potential in this book was vast, and some of the secondary characters are a bit above the level of vapid. But only a bit. The fact is, the book is not only a waste of time, it's even more criminally a waste of a great plot. In the right hands, Miranda Priestly could have been one of the great characters of modern literature, a Diana Vreeland set to fictional life. Instead, we get little more than trash-- with a lot of expensive labels. Too bad. I hope I like the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So a recent college grad with a boring boyfriend and alcoholic best friend takes a job with the worst boss in America, and in the fashion industry, no less, an area this beautiful but grounded protag knows nothing about. But hey, if it gets her into the NEW YORKER, it'll be a good experience.Wrong. Take off your clothes...This book proves that high fashion isn't a guarantee of class; indeed, it may reflect the opposite -- not to mention a desperation to be noticed. The drive to dictate what one must wear may say more about the need for attention and acceptance than recognition of what people want. The term \\"grace\\" doesn't include anything social in this tome. The book showcases the notion that being \\"cool\\" comes at high cost, both personal and financial: frivolous, wasteful costs. Why? To be noticed, of course. Just to be noticed.The book is not particularly well-written, but it is a can't-put-down read, even for someone with the fashion sense of Homer Simpson. Because it's a book about abuse of power, about insensitivity, about how much abuse people will accept to meet a \\"need,\\" regardless how artificial or shallow that need may be.This is a very good read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is an amusing fable of the consequences of trading integrity for access to power. The author would have us believe that she was willing to trade one year of her life picking up kids, dogs, drycleaning, and coffee in exchange for a good recommendation for employment as a writer elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is hilarious. It had moments I could live without, but all in all I loved it. One of the reviewers ripped this book and praised Bridget Jones. I thought Bridget Jones was awful or maybe I just couldn't relate. The target market for this book seems to be (possibly) the post-college, present-\\"life after college kinda blows, what do you mean I don't get to run things\\", pre-career that I love reader. (Ding, ding, ding). BJ was more later twenties, early to mid-thirties and still looking for prince good-hygiene (having given up on prince charming) market."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is the worst waste of ink in a long time. The boss is so maniacal that I couldn't believe the main character would stay working for her. It was too over the top. I got bored half way through and had to stop reading when I took a peek at the last chapter and knew there would be no great revengeful reward.Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am going to try my best not to throw up all over this POOR excuse for a read! If this were the last book on earth that I had to read just to maintain my last bit of sanity and intelligence, I think I'd opt for eating rocks and scribbling jibberish in the dirt! Who the HELL cares about this tale of who's who, her bitch boss, and her NAGGING! Spoiled, shallow, dead end book! My god man, it's so boring I think I just forgot what it was all about!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is only a hit because people want to see just how much of a rhymes-with-witch American Vogue editor Anna Wintour really is. Fine. We get the picture in the first chapter - she's kennel bait. The rest of the book is a whine and cheese party for the main character who is given a series of jobs to do, each more humiliating than the last. By the fifth chapter you just want to slap this girl until your hand is numb. I only made it halfway through the book before I gave up."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was a real disapointment. I'd put this book in the same category of The Nanny Diaries. A long boring whine about young women who expect to have it all and resent their older female bosses who expect them to actually (gasp) work for their salaries. Yes some of the work demands are outrageous but get over it. That's life. I didn't feel a bit sorry for Andrea throughout the book. Boo hoo her boss made her work late and she was late to a party. The boss went home late to her kids! If she hates it so much then quit and do the real work to get a job at the magazine of her dreams. Save yourself the aggravation and read a different book!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger did an amazing job of capturing a certain kind of American woman.Her main character, \\"Ahn-dree-ah\\", is a perfect example of an overeducated, racist, whiney twentysomething.\\"Racist\\"? The book's narrator frequently uses the term \\"redneck\\" to refer to people from the South. These southerners, rich or not, all have deep, torturous drawls, and in their tackiness aspire to the heights of elegance that the narrator and her boss represent.Ms. Weisberger must have encountered such women in college. Her portrayal is dead-on accurate -- unfortunately, she also effectively removed any sympathy I might have felt for the narrator."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"What is the point of this book? Is it how can you cram the name of every overpriced designer label into a paragraph? Where is the plot? Who cares if this girl had a bad job? Big deal she told her boss off... Skip this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As one of the editorial reviews said, it's somewhat like its predecessor, The Nanny Diaries, but not nearly as well written, nor as engrossing. I thought it was a decent book and entertaining. I have no interest at all in fashion (despite being a woman) but found the insider's look at the fashion world interesting. The author is drawing on her experience as an assistant to Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and the book does give a real feel for what it would be like to have that job. I found the ending somewhat contrived and unbelievable and am not sure I would agree with the author that the heroine should stick with her alcoholic, downward-spiraling best friend rather than stick with her job."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It's strange how the worker-bee memoirs of an exploitative industry have become pulp for entire generations of conspicuous spoon-feeders. If this story had a moral, it would be: Work yourself to the bone for people richer than you even if you have to sell everything about you that ever mattered. Alternately: if you aren't born rich or excessively good-looking, or if you haven't clawed your way to the bloody top of the social ladder, you are not a worthwhile person. Why torture yourself?This book is more or less a single scene from a soap opera, written out to novel length. Well, perhaps a magazine article written out to novel length. A very bad article that panders shamelessly to people who think that the fashion industry means anything at all.High-level fashion is little more than a way for very rich people to visually indicate their social status. So why should we want to read a story about a person who sells their soul to help other people achieve such a vapid objective?I'm tempted to write an essay on how this book represents the death of the novel in the American psyche, but I won't bore you with what is plaintively obvious.Please don't read this book. And I beg you, please, to do something with your life that is actually worth talking about."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Just got through reading this book. Honestly, I don't know what others like so much about it, and I don't know how it made any bestseller list because it's a piece of trash. The pace of the book was too fast--which would've worked with this story because it helps give readers a sense of what the world of fashion is like. But you still need a good story and you need really good characters to go along with this hard and fast world. The story was okay, I guess...it was a Cinderella-type story...but all the characters seemed pretty one-dimensional to me. The only interesting character in the whole novel was Miranda Priestly--but she operated on shock value alone, nothing more than that. Just about everything she did made me feel shocked for a second, then annoyed, frustrated or infuriated. That's a start, but you still don't have a character if you don't go beyond shock value and show something more--anything more, whether it would be some cliched secret, vulnerable soft side or more shades of evil as the uberboss she is. At least she incited some kind of emotional response in me, though. None of the other characters really did--especially the main character, Andrea. There was nothing to hate--or like--about her. I had no real reason to feel anything one way or another about her. I could care less about the other characters in the book, too. Even a little more character development would've gone a long way in terms of making this book better, though personally, I think the characters in this book all needed a LOT more development."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Without a doubt, the worst book I've ever read -- and one of the few I couldn't make myself finish. She's a poor writer with a weak story -- and didn't find a decent editor to get her out of the mess. It rambles, contradicts itself, the characters don't stay in character . . . . The main character, Andrea, is vapid, which makes her story a bore. Some people say that it makes good \\"beach reading,\\" but this book doesn't come close to that kind of achievement. A cute title and a hint of scandal gave this book a buzz it didn't deserve on its own merits. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought this book after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie as it looked rather interesting. However, in reading the book, I became very disenchanted. I found the book disheartening as I read on about such a difficult person and superficial work environment the character lives in. So be ready for this. Laura's writing is wonderful however. Through her writing she develops the young women through her difficutl experiences in dealing with an eccentric and self centered superior as well as back stapping work colleagues. I realize this is fiction, I look to books to escape this atmosphere."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was excited to read the book since I knew that the movie was coming out. Everyone had raved about it, so I had to see what all the fuss was about. After 100 pages (that I had to force myself to read because I was bored to tears), I had to put the book down because I just was not getting into the characters or the plot at all. Later, I gave it another chance. Again, I trudged through the whole thing, only finding a few parts amusing. It definitely is NOT a page-turner and the only reason I finished it was because I wanted to read it first before the movie. I did not feel sorry for Andy. I didn't get some of the other characters, which I thought the book could've done without (Christian). The ending was blah. (Although, admittedly, after seeing the movie, I liked the movie a *pinch* better.) Perhaps I didn't like it because I have no interest in high priced fashion. I have never had a job before where I worked for a tyrannical boss, therefore not being able to connect with the characters. Who knows? Bottom line: Book wasn't worth the hype (and neither was the movie)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought that 'The Devil Wears Prada' was a great summer read. It is not meant to be 'deep' or 'post modern' or 'philosophical'...it is just a funny and light book about an absolutely insane boss and her employee! Read it for what it is, a light summer read and don't expect deep revelations or symbolism. I read 'heavy' books, such as 'In Search of Lost Time', and you cannot hold them both to the same standards. Read 'The Devil Wears Prada' for what it is...a witty and not too deep book about a recent college grad and her crazy boss who probably needs to be medicated. How many of us can relate to that???"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw this book lying around and after about two minuets of reading it I was hooked. It was a quick, entertaining read but well written also.I have no interest in fashion but that didn't matter. I loved hearing about Andrea's impossible boss and I also enjoyed reading about her personal struggles while keeping the job and what choices she had to make. It certainly wasn't an intellectual book per say but it was really good for what it was and then some. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a quick (and clever) read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I recently bought a copy of this book at Costco's after I watched the trailer for the film and got highly interested.I truely loved this book. I simply could not put it down!Weisberger is an amazing author and I loved how she wrote the book. The story is very original and creative.Totally worth the read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up this book at a local library thinking that it would be a quick read. But I was sadly mistaken. Granted, the book did start out funny and entertaining, but I found that the main character's constant complaining was a bit redundant. There are some cute moments (Andy's encounters with Christian) but for the most part I found it difficult to actually get through a book that was only 300 or so pages. I have to give the author some credit though for writing a book so young and straight out of college. Maybe in the future her books will live up to their titles."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The cover art and the title drew me in, but I have to admit this story got a little long and didn't have that extra little bit of originality I was looking for. But, to expect something other than an incredibly dishy, fluffy summertime read would be expecting to much. Afterall, this is not meant to be an incredibly literary book.Andrea Sachs is a girl who thinks that by putting her time in in the trenches at a glitzy New York fashion magazine and working for the world's most horribly demanding boss that she'll be able to write her own ticket and persue her dream to write for The New Yorker. So What....??!?!? That's what all 350+ pages of this book keep repeating. Andrea desperately wants to work for The New Yorker and she is forced to work for this total witch of a woman, Miranda Priestly, who happens to be IT when it comes to the world of high fashion. I did enjoy Miranda's antics throughout the book, though and the ending was better than I thought it would be. However, I still made it all the way to the end of the book, turned the last page and thought: Oh! Well, it's over, I'm finished, on to my next book. And I have to say that I hate feeling that way. I also should tell you that I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of paying for it. Will I read any future novels by Ms. Weisberger? Probably, but if her future endevors aren't any better than this debut effort, I will most likely excersize my right to choose and choose something else."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was okay at best. I was waiting for a rise and fall of events or a definitive plot to come along, but when it all came down to it the book just told the story of a girl's life over the course of 1 year. I was looking for more humor and maybe a little more excitment. In fact the only part that caught my attention was the end. If you're looking for a book like this with a similar plot that'll make you laugh and sympathize and keep you on your toes, try 'The Nanny Diaries.'"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was cute if anything. It started off slow, but it got better, and I got really into it. With a title like \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" you really can't expect Hemingway or Salinger worthy literature. You do get what you pay for though. Weisburger is a young inexperienced writer who's testing the waters of writing. Granted the story was very scattered and not only lacked focus, but an entire plot line. It was a cliche story of small town girl tries to hit it big with her homely boyfriend and alcoholic best friend. It was entertaining at times, but definitly the kind of book you leave on vacation when you are done!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Entertaining to jump on this roller coaster with main character Andrea, but her non-stop bitching and lack of a backbone makes it hard to empathize too much with her character. Predicted the ending from a mile away, which was a major letdown. Thought the characters of Lily as drunken hippie, Christian as smug writer, and Alex and do-gooder were too shallowly portrayed.Fun while it lasted, but feeling empty after the experience. Kind of like reading Cosmo these days."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I fell under the spell of the magnificent marketing campaign and the catchy title and I bought the book. I eagerly anticipated lying poolside on a loungechair, diving in to the sunny summer reading fare. Unfortunately I took a bit of a bellyflop. Like the best laid summer plans, the book started out with such promise and then went nowhere at all. Young assistant has mean old boss. Got it. Now what? Characters are introduced and then left undeveloped. Situations are created and then left unresolved. Are we perhaps being groomed for a sequel? If so, lets hope that author Weisberger further develops her raw talent and we are given a new Devil's tale with more fire- that would be heavenly."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this book was really good. It was funny and there were certainly plots in the book. I actually can't believe that the word &quot;Hollywood&quot; was never mentioned in the book! Pretty good huh? This book has an excellent sense of fashion and if you love high quality fashion ( sorry, Gap and Abercrombie DO NOT count) this book is for you! There was such a passion talk about fashion that all I want to do is buy a pair of Jimmy Choo's now! hehe"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I checked DWP out from our public library the day before I went into the hospital for surgery because it appeared to be the perfect bit of light reading. Knowing that I couldn't handle a difficult read while under the influence of pain medication, I dug in and found it to be just what I was looking for. Look forward to reading about fashion, a more than demanding boss, and her naive new employee who just can't understand why her employer is such a [witch.] The close of this book is predictable and I flowed through this novel in a couple of days while dozing off between chapters. Enjoyable, but not serious, so take it for what it is."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved the title. Disappointed at the ending. I was suprised that after all the ground work that was laid out for this story that there would have been a phenomenal ending that we would have ravished. Weisburger let us down with the ending. It could have been so much more. I recommend Marian Keyes, she is a terrific author and seemed to blow the socks of this writer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked the premise of the book, however, found it to be very poorly written with weak character development. Unlike in Nanny Diaries, it is difficult for the readers to feel any sincere connection to the characters, main and secondary. I had little sympathy for Andrea as she seemed completely lazy in her employment role. Part of an assistants job is to figure out the missing pieces of a demanding boss' puzzle. I have had one such boss. One example is when her boss tells her to find a review in &quot;The Post.&quot; Ms. Sachs assumes it must be the NY Post and when she doesn't find it there fails to think of other &quot;Posts&quot; in the media. I immediately thought why not try the Washington Post, duh. Later, after asking the boss again, she is informed to check the WPost. And, this Andrea character was way too whiny and annoying for me to be anybody's heroin. Always soooo tired. Wah Wah.Anyway, an overall entertaining but much too forced and under developed effort to make me recommend the book - though I am sure that the title will sell the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book is essentially The Nanny Diaries set in a fashion magazine - evil, unreasonable boss; excesses of filthy rich lifestyle in Manhattan, etc., etc."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Supposedly written by an author with an insider's view of the fashion world, but when a book contains such gems as the description of a model's look as &quot;heroine-chic&quot;, even us non-fashionistas gotta cringe."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am sick to death of books about whiny, b*tchy, vain NY women (Trading Up, The Nanny Diaries, this book). I used to work and live in NYC, so I &quot;get it,&quot; but this book was trash. I got about 15 pages into it and said &quot;Enough!&quot; The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and Andrea should have just QUIT if she was so unhappy. I didn't want to waste my time with this."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book does what it promises-entertains! It's a witty, light, delightful romp."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I don't know what my expectations were, since this is Lauren Weisberger's first novel, but it seems as though if you have an interesting life experience to tell, no matter HOW poorly you write, someone will publish it...I was very disappointed in Ms. Weisberger's writing ability, and I agree with another reviewer who blamed her editors...if this is all it takes to get published, then I have a best-seller ready to go! I hope her writing improves if she decides to write another novel. My 14 year old neice could have written a better novel than this."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My goodness people - OK, this isn't supposed to be War and Peave here. It is simply an entertaining, humorous novel. It's an easy to read beach book, which by the way, was highly entertaining. People who are going nuts because it isn't of high literary caliber need to relax a bit. No one said this was a serious read. For god's sake - the name is The Devil Wears Prada. Come on now - If you are looking for a classic, choose Steinbeck, Hemingway, Dickens, even Shakespeare....But don't hate this book because it's not one of those. It is VERY entertaining, and if you are not ridiculous in expecting the great American novel, I think you'll really enjoy this. In fact, it was difficult to put down!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The people who are offended by the grammar in this book are just as pathetic as the \\"social climbing\\" fashionistas depicted in this book. This is not \\"Hemingway\\" -- nor meant to be intellectual in any way. The grammar is written exactly how a 21 year old girl would talk -- it shouldn't be edited by some intellect whose translation would ultimately dilute Andrea's sarcastic and funny tone which is what makes the book enjoyable.I know people well who live in this \\"fashion world\\" and it is so sad how self absorbed they are when their lives are really so meaningless and unimportant. There is such a consistent psycological profile among everyone in this industry from the fashion designer to the models to the fashion magazine editors --- they are all self centered, shallow, obnoxious, insecure, miserable human beings. The story of Miranda Priestly may seem far fetched to the normal working class family but spend a week on the New York fashion scene and you'll see dozens of Mirandas roaming the halls...even sadder...with dozens of wannabe's chasing after her. EXCELLENT READING for anyone who could care less about Versace's new fall line!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I know this book proclaims NOT to be about Anna Wintour, but the descriptions of life at Conde Nast are dead on. Although the book is mildly entertaining in that aspect, it is a boring and self-indulgent rant."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I started reading this book I could not put it down, it takes me out of my little house in the middle of Oklahoma to the busy streets of New York City, and the busy life of Andrea. When reading this book it helps you escape. It also makes you wander if you would put up with the same stuff that Andrea does for all the perks that she gets. This book is so good I wish I could find another book that Lauren has written because I am sure it will be as interesting as this one was I would tell everyone to read this book if they are interested in fashion and the inner workings of upper-class living."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I waited with bated breath for this book to come out. Having been in advertising for many years, I knew that I would relate to many of the things that Andrea dealt with (but thankfully I was spared of much of what she went through). The best part about this book is although she put up with a great deal, she manages to land on her feet in the end and save her dignity as well. A great read -- it will make anyone else appreciate their job!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am about halfway through the book now and doubt I'll even be able to finish it. It details Andy, the narrator, working as an assistant to Miranda, editor of Runway Magazing (read: Vogue). I think she missed what her job title was in the interview - Assistant. You makes coffee runs, pick up the dry cleaning...The book is all about how awful Miranda is, but she is allowed to be - she paid her dues, unlike our herione who thinks she's entitled to the same amount of respect by virture of existing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read through the book very quickly as it was interesting. I was mostly offended by the author's portrayal of the Indian characters in the book. Contrary to the author's belief, not all Indians are meek and nor do their homes smell like curry. As an Indian, I thought her comments were offensive and based on racial stereotypes. The writer should have gathered more accurate information before using stereotypes to thicken her book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought this book because of the great title and after finishing it(that was torture). I just had to say Du-Oh. I think I just wasted money on something that I should have just borrowed from the library. If this were a movie, it would be Gigli or Glitter. Too bad amazon has no zero star or garbage icon rating because this novel rates a zero star or at least two garbage icons."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book, and while I myself have had demanding bosses,demeaning bosses crazy enough to tell you to write something and then claim they NEVER told you to write that, and you then had to show boss where they WROTE it down I would of never done what her character Andrea did.I would of been fired for insubordination just for the sighing and the delibrate back talk with her little \\"Thank you\\". To show her boss she was supposed to be better.Not all of us get Mommy and Daddy to pay for us to go to Ivy Leauge colleges and wake up and know just cause you work for some woman for a year will you get a job at the New Yorker, tell me do you write for them now?I think not."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While the subject matter promised interesting reading, the writing is horrid. I am not even halfway through and I cannot bring myself to continue. I am amazed writing of such poor caliber is published. Heaven help The New Yorker if Weisberger ever gets her &quot;dream job!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As a person in the industry, I can tell you that, as ridiculous it seems to outsiders, a lot of the most hilarious things in this book are true! It's a great beach read!Better than the movie, and the movie was great."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As an avid consumer of the labels that grace the pages of Vogue, I eagerly anticipated reading this 'roman a clef,' expecting a saucy expose of the inner workings of the world's greatest fashion magazine. Boy was I ever disappointed. My main complaints about this novel is that (1) it lacks a plot and (2) it's flat-out boring.After the narrator (who is so bland that I couldn't care less about her) gets the job, she spends the remainder of the novel seemingly re-hashing a bad, busy day at work with a picky boss (who is so bland I couldn't hate her).I mean, seriously, if truth is stranger than fiction the this is boring. Imagine reading a blow-by-blow account of working in an office (where the women and men happen to dress very well)... and, wow, I can't think of anything that really set the office apart or the people as interesting.And since this was a novel, after all, why couldn't the author at least have made up some interesting/funny things that went on at the office?With such rich subject material, this is just poor writing. I was hoping for a breezy, funny, surprising bit of fiction to read while sitting by the pool this summer, but I was bored out of my mind.The only reason I finished the book was that, in the seaside town where I was vacationing, books were incredibly expensive (at least US $12 for a small paperback) and I was broke."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a lovely book for taking on some R&R. Funny and biting, the story of our heroine's first job is sadly familiar to many readers. It is easy to identify with Amanda because she is so 'girl next door' and because so many of us have had a boss that resembled Miranda at least a little!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In this book the author portrays the fashion world as a place full of shallow people who can't express themselves in any way other than obsessing about expensive possessions. Unfortunately the book is in itself an obsession of expensive products. Brand names practically drip off of the pages as if the author was drooling while explaining how magnificent the products are (but how pure the heroine is to not be into those things). The main character lacks any sense of professionalism or common sense. The author often has the heroine make stupid decisions and is incapable of acknowledging any character flaws to such a large degree that it is unerving.Without ruining the whole book you can understand it all within the first chapter of the book:The heroine must drive her boss's car. The stupid part isn't that she can't drive a manual car, but that she multiplies the difficulty of the situation by lighting up a cigarette while in her bosses car and in traffic. When the light changes or traffic moves she ruins her entire outfit (band names included of course) by getting cigarette ashes mixed with sweat all over herself. But I have to wonder what kind of idiot thinks occupying her hands while driving a manual car will make the task better? And what kind of person smokes in someone else's car without permission - not to mention your boss's?!The supposed character development is pathetic. She doesn't become any wiser, she just goes from being a lazy, oblivious idiot to a lazy, idiotic, anti-fashion snob.The redeeming factor of this book is that it is an easy read that has a comfortable flow. It doesn't take too long to read so if you need something to distract you from life and you aren't aggravated by stupid people then this is a good book to buy. oh and the boss does suck so many people can relate if you just ignore how the heroine makes a bad situation 100x worse."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I admit I saw the movie before I bought the book. My friends all told me that the book was better, but I didn't believe them until I read it. It's absolutely rivoting. I couldn't put it down. The movie leaves out a lot and changes the ending, which I thought was more realistic in the book.I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"My biggest problem with this book is that the main character, Andrea, is constantly berating herself. It reminds me of the negative self-talk that drives young women to eating disorders and other self-esteem problems. I can't stand how critical women are of themselves, and I can't stand that this novel's heroine (!) is constantly engaging in this type of behavior."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"...but maybe that's because I have no idea what goes on in that uppity fashion world and just a little insight was very interesting to me. I thought that the characters were much more developed than those in many other fluff novels that I have read and I really did care what happened to each of them. I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not worth $15, but it was a great, fun read, and I can recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up this book at Target when I had an hour to kill between appointments. It looked entertaining and I loved the title, although I had heard virtually nothing about the book since it was released almost a year ago. I really enjoyed this book, although I have to admit the ending was a let down. A bit trite and neatly wrapped. However, I could not put the book down and read it in 1 day. While many of the reviewers here criticize Weisberger for poor writing, there were many clues that she was an English major and knows good writing, especially when she mentions a love of Vladamire Nobokov, or saving old copies of the New Yorker. Perhaps this is just envy on her ease of making the New York Times Best Seller List. Personally, I wish I had her talent. Her experiences with a boss from hell rang true. When a boss requests something totally ambiguous, but already has the answer, you have to wonder about the sadistic nature of those at the top. I've worked for people like this in a different profession. I loved her nonmenclature, &quot;clackers.&quot; It brought visions of adversaries in an Oz Book. I know absolutely nothing about fashion, don't care, but am facinated by how it affects others. I didn't even know who Anna Wintour was until toward the very end of the book the name is mentioned, and as a lark, I googled it. I suspected that Weisberger had to work at one of the big fashion magazines, but didn't know she had worked for Vogue until I was nearly finished with the book. So it made absolutely no difference in how I enjoyed the book. If you have ever worked for a tough boss or do so currently, this book might just make you think you had it easy."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I first saw this book advertised in a magazine, and decided right then that I had to read it. I am a huge fan of chick-lit, and this sounded absolutely right up my alley. I picked it up as soon as it was available and could not put it down till I finished it. I really enjoyed this book a lot and cannot wait for the author to come out with another, hopefully similar. I got pretty into the characters and actually felt for them. Especially the main character, Andrea. I felt the same dislike towards her boss that she did. I kept wanting to scream at her to get out of that gosh awful position. Anyone who's had a boss from hell can relate, even if it was not in the fashion/magazine world. This book is a great summer read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to admit that I enjoyed the book to a certain extent. It was difficult to get too involved in it because the author maintains a surface level depth throughout the entire book. In other words, this is definitely not the most thought-provoking, earth-shattering book I have read in my life. Many of the characters were one dimensional and failed to evolve during the novel. I have to agree with another reader that the author failed to bring forth Andrea's true dedication. I was also sorely disappointed with the ending as I felt it was entirely cliche. If you want a novel that has twists and turns, this is not the novel for you."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Come on SNOBS .... this isn't suppose to win a Pulitzer Prize! This was a nice little &quot;beach read&quot; I was able to put one eye in the book and the other eye on my kids in the water. This was easy to read and not so absorbing that my children drowned. Thank god for a little entertainment that doesn't require a huge amount of concentration. I really enjoyed it. I have been reading a lot of &quot;heavy&quot; stuff lately and this was very enjoyable. Looking for great literature? Try reading &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; - by far the best novel ever written.I hope Ms. Weisberger didn't burn too many bridges in the fashion world.... she may be a one hit wonder. She also needs a better editor. The book would say something in a chapter and the next chapter would contradict what she just wrote. Don't buy the book....get it at the library, I hate supporting the stereotypical New Yorker with a silver spoon up-bringing!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read the book in 3 days! I thought it was very interesting and had a good plot while maintaining decency. I would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found this book to be highly entertaining. Some parts were very funny, although I'm not so sure that was the author's intention. If you are a secretary, you will definitely relate to this book (or appreciate your own boss more). If I had one criticism about it, it would be that it goes on way too long before the satisfying ending. The Nanny Diaries was similar to this book, but much better written. I recommend both of them."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"&quot;THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA&quot; seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea.

The main character, Andy was an uninspired lead and a boring one at that. I found it very difficult to relate to someone who just seems to be handed everything on a silver platter...it truly felt that she didn't have to work for achieving her goals. Thus, it made the book boring and complete out of touch with reality. Of course, sometimes you have suspend belief in novels, but I really can't do that for a whole book. Honestly, if this were me, there would be no book, because I would have quit that job instead of just complaining about it all the time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read the book first then i watched the movie and i loved them both equally. it is both witty and entertaining - a must read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Does Andrea make it though her year at the hottest fashion magazine? In the book, The Devil Wears Prada, Andrea Sachs is a girl who is looking for a job in New York City after college and ends up getting a job at Runway, a high-fashion magazine. She works for an ever-so demanding boss, who is known thought out the world. Working as an assistant for her? Not as easy as it looks. With fashion-obbessed workers and demanding boss, will she make it though or will she call it quits?My opinion about this book was that it was fantastic. After I watched the movie, I wanted to read the book, so I could compare and contrast them. The book was different from the movie and went into more detail in Andrea's life. One of my favorite parts in the book was when Andrea listed all different presents her boss got during Christmas. There were so many that it covered at least a whole page (pgs 49-50)! Also, Andrea also becomes someone that she's not. Andrea becomes a \\"fashionista\\" as she continues to work there, she makes a complete transformation from ugly clothes to high-fashion designer clothes. She also is so into work, she completely misses out on family events & times with her boyfriend and friends. Lauren Weisberger does a great job of getting into details in the high fashion world, I wouldn't imagine how she came up with listing all of the designer's names and fashion styles, It must have been hard for her to write a book like this! Overall, I gave this four stars because it has a plot that is twisted and turns a lot. The perspective of the book (Andrea's point of view) was well written, and I loved learning about what the high fashion world was like compared to a normal person life like mine. I would recommend this to people who love fashion or for people that would like to read a excellent book in the chick-lit genre!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just read this book, after seeing the movie. Wow, the book was so much better, because in the book Andy (aka..Andrea) says all kinds of nasty comments about Miranda, as does 'Emily', the other assistant. Books are always better than movies, ya know. While the movie was great, I found the book to be better. Miranda reminds me so much of my mother. Scary, huh? My mother wore designer suits, sky-high heels, perfect makeup, perfect hair, designer bags, furs...all of it. She was also very powerful in her company, as Miranda was for \\"Runway\\". My husband and I discuss this almost every time we see the movie. Strange, but true.Anyway, I found the book to be a great read. I read it in no time, because it was SUCH a guilty pleasure, and was like reading gossip in a way.Yeah, I'm kind of behind on reading the book, but I guess I had the wrong impression of it when it came out. I kind of figured it made fun of \\"lable whores\\" and such, and all the people that get sucked into fashion, and I guess I recently figured out that carrying Prada bags or Louis Vuitton bags doesn't make me a lable whore, at least not 100%"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is light book but it can get quite boring at times. There are some funny parts but they're not many. It's just a very long list of the devilish antiques of Miranda Priestly. Other than that there is no storyline to speak of. Lacking in substance and plot."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was funny, but at times hit really close to home for me. Any young woman who has felt left out, useless, overwhelmed and, besides all that, had boyfriend troubles as well can certainly relate and, if she hasn't totally lost her sense o' humor, will laugh out loud. I love chicklit and I also recommend To Love and To Work by Tracie Clayton."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"We all know the plot. I thought the book was well written (better than I could have done) but it was about 100 pages too long. And the ending dragged out. An interesting story, though.

Yes, I read Candace Bushnell's last book and yes, I have the entire series of Sex and the City and I have even read (and enjoyed) The Nanny Diaries. However...this was SO TIRED. I didn't care about Andrea, her boyfriend, her life journey...I did like the Miranda character and couldn't WAIT for the movie to come out to Meryl do it right.But that's just it...I was WAITING FOR THE MOVIE. And I loved the movie...but I don't need to spend time reading 100-150 pages about how hellish living in NYC with a devil-boss and getting sweet clothes on the side is....The movie was WAY better; and I don't say that very often."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"A fun FUN read. The book will show you the habitude of the fashionista's of the world, get you up to speed with the social scene of Manhatten,expose you to the glamour of the big city life and leave you longing to experience it all on your own (in my case, the feeling only lasted until the time i was reading the book).If you didnt know what drink to order at a groovy club/ lounge whilst out with collegues or friends, well no need to fear- Lauren Weisbergers books are like the social bibles for vogue-virgins. In fact those of us who think we know whatever it is that needs knowing on how to \\"swing\\" it, might learn a few more tricks of the trade along the way as well.I absolutely loved both The devil wears prada and Everyone worth knowing. Both were fabulous, light hearted, fun reads.Even though im more of a wanting to meet friends at a barnes and noble for a book club meeting kind of person yet because of her skillful writing, i didnt find myself resenting the lifestyles of the characters in her stories. i imagined myself living the same life vicariously through \\"Bette\\"- over-the-top dinners every night, club-hopping, meeting so many interesting people along the way- that is after all, a socialites life in the big apple. And as far as reading and imagining such a lifestyle goes- it was splendid."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have a word for the publishers out there. Just because a person likes fashion and \\"Sex in the City\\" doesn't mean they are illiterate. This book could have been a funny, entertaining look at the inside politics of a fashion magazine. Instead the book is a mishmash of fashion gossip without any story to kept it interesting. Did anyone...bother to edit this book?The idea behind the book seemed interesting enough-young woman gets job working for famous fashion editor-in-chief but where is the plot. There's some insider dish on the fashion industry but not enough to keep the reader interested. Miranda, the editor-in-chief, may be crazy but the assistant, Andrea, is a spoiled, whiny brat. Who am I suppose to like in this book? Andrea, I don't think so. Why should I care enough about anyone in this book to finish it?

My advice, as someone who endured the seasonal presentations, is to read the professional publications and NOT this opportunistic...version of events. Give it up, baby."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm really surprised by all the bad reviews on this book. Sure, the boyfriend storyline and the drunk best friend kind of felt rushed and put in at the last minute (hey, we need more of a plot). That's why I give the book 4 stars. But all in all the story was very nice. I liked the characters and the details of the behind the scenes fashion world. Should Andrea put up with the unreasonable demands of an unreasonable boss (and getting pre-release copies of Harry Potter IS unreasonable) just because she's getting paid? I mean people, come on!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Love this book, it is full of gorgous things you can imagine by discription, well written and a great lesson to us all."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I made it to page 99. When I read that a 6-year-old who brought a box-cutter to school was in the 4th grade, that was it. That fact was soooo wrong, I couldn't stomach any more. I didn't like the \\"heroine.\\" The descriptions of the clothes and decor were more like name-dropping than narrative. Maybe that's what readers who liked this book wanted, but there's so much better fluff-reading in the world. (Like Janet Evanovich). And any person in the world who is as obnoxious as the Miranda Priestly character needs to be shunned. I liked the movie, but it was very good casting that made it work, especially the impeccable Meryl Streep who managed to create a Miranda that wasn't a cartoon character. I found the book in a bargain bin and paid 40 cents for it; that was probably too much."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger has done a great service for people who have had the misfortune to work for an abusive boss; the author describes all manner of humiliations that will resonate with many readers. It's done in a light-hearted tone, which makes for easy reading.As an alumnus of New York City investment banks and law firms, Miranda Priestly reminded me of many a boss who acted as if they were curing cancer when they were merely putting together lucrative deals.Miranda Priestly exists in many forms. Lauren Weisberger was able to write about an experience that leaves many people ashamed and scared silent."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a good book, but what fascinates me most is that it has the most even distribution of reviews on any book I've seen on Amazon. 1, star, 2 star, etc. all get about the same votes. Take a look. You don't see it so even like that very often.This is a book that is really not for everyone. Being into fashion helps, and the author walks a wobbly line between glorifying the fashion industry and critiquing it.At any rate, it's a few notches above the movie, so if you enjoyed that, you would most likely find this book a fun and easy read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If not for the title that peaks your interest, or for the humor and undeniably great insight on what it would be like to work for a debutante of the fashion world, this book held my interest from beginning to end. If you are looking for a deep literary read, this is definitely not for you. This is a light, funny read that I, quite frankly, could not put down. Having no knowledge of fashion, designers, or New York City for that matter, I felt like I had an education on the fast paced, cut throat and very competitive industry that most girls can only dream about participating in. I thought Weisberger showed immense talent in poking fun at this glamorous way of life and I thouroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this mostly because I'd heard such good things about the movie, and I figured the book was probably better because, you know, it usually is. Well, from other reviews I've read and from what I've heard about the movie, I'll bet it's better than this book.This is supposed to be a bitingly funny book about a fresh college grad hoping to use her stumbled-upon job as assistant to the editor-in-chief at Runway magazine (which looks suspiciously like Vogue) as a stepping-stone to a writing gig at the New Yorker.So you have the mousy intellectual girl who doesn't care about fashion working in Fashion Central for a Really Mean Boss. She also has a mousy intellectual boyfriend and mousy free-spirited best friend, and is predictably torn between her two worlds. Really Mean Boss cooks up all sorts of demands and expects her assistants to read her mind, making for all sorts of misadventures. Blah, blah, blah.The premise isn't half-bad, for a light summer read, but the execution was clumsy and amateurish. Every time the writing got even a little bit nuanced, Weisberger seemed to feel that we needed a fuller explanation, as though we were all like the vacuous starved model-wannabes who roamed the halls at Runway. Ugh. Insulting. And dull.But I slugged my way through anyway. I'm still going to watch the movie, because Meryl Streep has to be fabulous in it, but don't bother reading the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm one of those annoying people who ALWAYS think that the book was better than the movie. This is an exception. While this was a fun, enjoyable read for sure, I feel like the author tried to do too much with some of the other characters in terms of character development (particularly in the case of the friend, Lilly), and then just kind of hurried through wrapping it up at the end. The end just felt hurried to me and I felt it was a bit of a let down. Otherwise, though, it was a cute, light, funny read and it kept me entertained throughout.The movie was very different in that it kept the focus on Andrea and the job, without veering in too many different directions, and I thought that made for a more enjoyable experience overall. I also liked the movie's ending better.I have to laugh at some of the other reviewers, though, for reviewing this as if it were some serious highbrow kind of book. Lighten up, folks, this is not War and Peace, nor does it claim to be. It's not meant to change your life; only to make you laugh a little. Which is a good thing. Really. If the only stuff you can admit to liking is snooty intellectual stuff, then perhaps you should have thought twice before picking up a book with a red stiletto heel on the front."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think this book is very funny. Anybody who has bosses from hell should read it. I really enjoyed the first half of the book, however, the second half is pretty much going on and on the same way as the first half -- nothing new. So I can see why some people won't like it. But overall, I think the book is a fun read and reveal the nasty side of fashion industry."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" some time ago and I thought it wasn't a bad book at all. Then I found out they were making a movie about \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and I figured I'd indulge on guilty pleasure and read it.I was disappointed! This is just a collection of \\"Miranda is so terrible\\" stories. I mean, we are talking about a whole year of working for this woman and there are relatively very few instances where we hear from the villain.She is in the middle of this elite fashion world and instead of getting some real insight as to how these people are, live, afford clothes is never revealed.What's worst is that you quickly get over the part where you feel your girlfriend is dishing out some dirt on her intolerable boss and say: \\"where's the plot?\\" The book just doesn't go anywhere and then it ends with the most anticlimactic confrontation between Andy and Miranda.Unfulfilling.... perfect for Hollywood and the type of movies they've been producing lately. You know, the type with lots of hype but no guts, the type that flops!SF"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I tried really hard to be interested in this book but i quit. I just can not do it. The main character is a bland judgemental person. The plot lines are old, Andrea is so busy she did not pay enough attention to her boyfriend and best friend...so what? She is not a very likeable character. Miranda Priestley, outrageous as she is, was entertaining to read (which is a reason I gave 2 starts instead of 1), Andrea needs to develop some personality. I heard they are going to make a movie out of this, and glenn close might play Miranda, that would be hilarious. So go to the library and borrow the book, it is not worth buying!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I couldn't put this book down, but it certainly wasn't due to the quality of the writing. I was just WAITING to find out when Andrea, the main character, would finally get some backbone and stand up for herself. In fact, throughout the entire book I found it hard to believe that she stuck through the job - even with the (potential) chance to write for the New Yorker awaiting her. Although it was a very entertaining read, humourous, and interesting in that it's based on the author's experiences working for Anna Wintour, it's poorly written in many places. Also, Andrea isn't particularly likeable. I get the feeling that since the main character is largely based on the author herself, she didn't get into character development they way she would have if she were completely inventing a character. All in all, I enjoyed it as a beach read with some laugh-out-loud moments, but I certainly wouldn't award it any prizes in literature."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"For someone who wanted to write for New York, ending up with such a novel it is not a good sign. I mean, I bet the devil is a happier person for wearing prada than if he read this awful novel. Sorry, but ...that's the ugly truth."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It seems that the only way Lauren Weisberger could have attracted any sort of hype to this novel was by using the chic label \\"Prada\\" in the title. This book does not say anything about the fashion industry but the obvious; that the industry is run by a bunch of sadisitic, anorexic, miserable women who can never be too thin or too demanding. Of course, some gay men are thrown into the mix. I am not from New York City or anything, but I do have the Style channel. You would think that this novel would have clever and witty things to say about working for a Vogue-like magazine, but at 360 pp it says nothing and is incredibly boring.The main problem is that the supposed \\"protagonist\\", Andrea Sachs, is a generic twenty-something who just graduated from an Ivy league school. She talks so much about her distaste about having to find a job (oh, heavens, no!) and her \\"just perfect\\" boyfriend and her hippie, pseudo-intellectual Janis Joplin-like best friend, her \\"fun\\" Scrabble matches with her dad, that I want her to be devoured completely by a witchy magazine editor like Anna Wintour. You can tell how thrilled I was to read this novel by the used of quotation marks alone. Andrea narrates the novel and has nearly a perfect life, and does not understand that maybe some readers aren't so privileged and that they may get sick of her incessant whining at having to fetch coffee for the world's most reputable fashion editor. In a tone just as immature as Andrea Sachs' narration, I say \\"boo-hoo.\\"Miranda Priestly, on the other hand, \\"the devil\\", I wish I got to know her a little more thourghout the novel. Although she makes impossible demands on her junior assistant, Andrea, she seems a whole lot more interesting and even, though this is a stretch, more likable. She takes Andrea in, the fashionless, naive, and ungrateful writer wannabe and makes her perform ridiculous tasks that make her learn to be sharp, articulate, and resourceful. Unfortunately, we do not get to know Miranda that well except through her siily demands. For instance, she tells Andrea to find a review about and Asian restaurant she read about in the newspaper. Miranda cannot be bothered with the details of telling Andrea which newspaper, so Andrea spends a day and a half speaking to the editors of every New York newspaper in an attempt to find the article, only to find out from a furious Miranda Priestly that the restaurant was in a Washington D.C. newspaper. She puts Andrea through hell over and over again in the same fashion (this too, gets tedious) but promises a wonderful carreer at the end of the journey at the one place in the world that Andrea wants to work, The New Yorker (cliche, yes, but it's perfect for Andrea's character). I am not going to give away the ending, but it as predictable as the events on each page.Weisberger's first attempt at writing a novel is pretty disappointing. She stretches uninspiring descriptions of walks in Manolo Blahnik heels, New York hot spots, and trips to Starbucks for an unrelenting boss into a 360 page novel. Also, this is all from the point of view a girl who lacks personality and life experience. It's criminal! And why are they making a movie out of this novel? One word, Prada."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not even worth the time it took to read the cover with. There is no point to it and nothing of interest to it either. It is not light, funny, emotional or even &quot;dishy&quot;(whatever that is). The book is boring! BORING!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was very excited to read this book. I even broke my own rule of book purchasing and bought it new and in hardcover. Whoa, was I disappointed! I expected a lot more Sex and the City and a lot less Nanny Diaries. It was virtually the same book--just different girls in different jobs. The main difference is that The Nanny Diaries is better written.Like many of the other reviewers, the main character didn't move me at all. I wasn't sympathetic to her plight, and her reason for staying in this job just wasn't all that realistic. Many of the other characters had potential, but they just weren't all that developed. I would have liked to have seen more of the \\"twins\\" and of Emily. I would have liked to know more about Alex; however, we are only given one tyrannical phone call after another.Check this out from the library or borrow your friend's copy. But save your money for something different!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I agree with the person who said that if you liked the Nanny Diaries, you'd like this book as well. Meaning, if you like vapid, &quot;girls who should know better&quot; characters in ridiculous New York situations, this is the book for you. Watch Ally McBeal? You'd like this book. Do we really need to read about yet another smart, capable young woman who falls prey to the allure of &quot;City Life&quot; and does stupid things in order to get by? I expected a trashy, Vogue-ish dishy read about Jimmy Choos, Manolos, and Prada -- and a character I could care about for at least a few days. But if you actually enjoy plot or character development, pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought it because of the hype. I read it because I bought it. I returned it becuase I'm not a fool."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"LOVED IT!!!This book is so familiar to me. No, I don't work for a fabulous fashion magazine, but I do work for the devil and she does wear Prada!This is a must read for all you Administrative Assistans out there who are constantly asked to do the most ridiculous tasks every day!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I actually enjoyed this book. Naturally, I wanted to slap Andrea and tell her to just quit, but then I think about my first job as an attorney, just out of law school, and I understand why she stayed so long. We want to be successful at our first job. We want do whatever it takes to move up the ladder. We don't want others to think that we could not cut it. I had a male version of Miranda, a partner at a prestigious law firm. I ran myself ragged trying to please my boss. After an emotional and physical breakdown a la Mariah Carey, I quit. Some people thought I was crazy, because it was such a great opportunity. But my health and my sanity were not worth the price of poker. That's why Andr&eacute;a probably put up with what she did. Only with age and wisdom, do we realize that there are some things that are just unacceptable.I have to admit, I did get a kick out of how far Miranda pushed the envelope. Calling from Paris to New York to have an assistant connect her with someone who was also in Paris took the cake. And the breakfast routine. I would have spit in her coffee or food. There is not enough therapy or medication that can tame the likes of her. I am not sure if Dr. Phil could have handled her. But I think I would have made Andrea's departure more dramatic. Bugging the office and selling the information to the highest bidder sounds like an option.All in all, not bad. Give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Imagine you are sitting having a bitchfest with four of your best girlfriends, surrounded by coffee and beer and yesterday's magazines in a slobby apartment.

She rules her terrain with a maniacal tyrannical hand and Andrea rues the day she took on ther job. Ho Hmmm..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ahn-Dre-Ah, the heroine, is cast in the mode of Nanny in The Nanny diaries, and Girl in the novel Citizen Girl. However, Author Weisberger, though a less skillful grammatician than the authors of the former novels noted above, does an excellent job of painting the portrait of the spoiled brat, insensitive-controlling, somewhat psychopathic, Miranda Priestly, a dyed-in-the-silk, control freak, and power figure in the fashion-periodicals world.Andrea, the protagonist, like her seem-alikes noted above, is seeking a career in periodicals publishing, preferably at the New Yorker and hanging on to a job as assistant to Priestly for at least one year-which, she has been assured will get her a \\"job-to-die-for\\" anywhere in the publishing or fashion industries. One year becomes her goal and her mantra in the position \\"a million girls would die for\\".Andrea then sets out to prove, apparently, that she is willing to endure abuse for long stretches of time-abuse that a person of common sense and a better self-image, and frankly a bit more sensitivity and spunk, would not tolerate for more than a few weeks, if that. Hired as assistant to the assistant to Miranda Priestly, High Priestess of Fashion and editor of Runaway Magazine (A place of business, indeed, any one with an ounce of integrity would run away from), she accepts conditions and orders which would be hilarious if it were not such a very well defined profile of so many bosses most of us with less masochistic tendencies would have walked out on much earlier.For approximately 92.5% of the book she allows herself to be enslaved by her all-too-self-indulgent, sell-out drive, and in the process all but loses her soul, family, friends, and lover (Just stay on hold for one year for me, okay?). Despite the mounting tension, or perhaps because of it, one wants to see her exercise some modicum of self-respect, and that is all that kept me interested, although as the book progressed, she became one of those protagonists for which you begin to have little sympathy, because she does nothing to merit the respect of \`Prada's readers, but you hang on to see if not she, than someone else will give Miranda that she deserves.The eternal and relentless name-dropping of fashion related celebrities, fashion products, which 99% of us cannot afford, and restaurants, clubs and watering holes, which fewer still could even get a reservation, might appeal to the vast majority of \\"Prada's\\"/chic/lit readers-which are mostly women, all but bores the heck out of a straight-guy-who read it and similar books at the advice of his literary agent (Yes, I know the demographics for which it was written-that percentage of women who are selfish, self-indulgent and materialistic, and not prone to action-enablers). Her adventures did hold some interest for me, mostly because, by far, the most interesting figure in the book was the villain (love to hated type). Although all of the action and non-action were predictable 50-320 pages in advance, her journey through the La-La Land of privileged-high-perk-jobs-people is believable because, and although not quite so privileged, I encountered similarly ethically challenged \\"bosses\\" in my academic, professorial, career prior to writing fiction. Some young women may bond with Andrea; many older women will wonder when Andrea will make a stand, but for a straight-guy to want to buy it and read it, he'd have to have strong motivation either from his agent or female companion. Despite it's grammatical-editing, weaknesses, I give it 4 stars because the picture perfect sketch of Miranda Priestly reminds me so much of a couple of close relatives.I give it 4 stars because of it's descriptive and susense-building personalty sketches, and I actually began to pull for Miranda-the villain. (But that's what Cub fans do when they get frustrated)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"What attracted me to this book in the first place was the title- how could you resist something with a title like The Devil Wears Prada? Its a great novel, and I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who can sympathize with Andrea Sachs, a recent college grad who lands a job working as an assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor in chief at Runway magazine. Her year of servitude will get her any job she wants, even a position at The New Yorker, a job Andrea has always coveted. Miranda is a demanding boss, asking her assistants to do ridiculous, even absurd things for her, like getting two copies of the latest Harry Potter book for her twin daughters before it even hits stores, or expecting food orders in impossibly short amounts of time. But Andrea always does it, though inside she hates it. Andrea holds a degree in English from Brown, and... this is what she ends up doing? Doing dirty work for a woman who is impossible to please? It sounds similar to a lot of people who are just out of college, and this is why I liked the book so much. Many people spend four years, or more, getting degrees, and then they find that those degrees in no way prepare them for the jobs they'll have in the real world.The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Andrea always sounded whiny and selfish. I mean, who really cares what you think? We've all had over-demanding, pushy bosses who expected the impossible from us. Half of me kept wanting Andrea to suck it up and do her job, the other half of me wanted her to stick up to Miranda.In the end, Andrea sticks up for herself. But, lucky for Andrea, it all works out in the end (though she looses her job and boyfriend in the process). If you want something fast and fun to read, then I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had heard so much about this book, I was prepared to like it before I read it. I was disappointed. It is a &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; clone. I cared more for the main character in the &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; than I did in this book. All she does is gripe about her boss and complain about how overworked she is. What little humor you see is forced and not funny. I am amazed that I finished it.One complaint I have about both books is their format. They are physically difficult to read.Jorge's review hit the nail on the head. Read it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Would you work for the boss from hell for a year if it meant you would get whatever job you wanted? That is the dilemma faced by young wannabe writer, Andrea (or Ahn-dre-ah, as the evil Miranda calls her). Andrea, fresh out of college and looking for a way to break into writing in a respectable forum, ends up taking the first job that calls her back, the trendy and snobby fashion magazine, Runway. Right off the bat, everyone lets her know that this is the job \\"a million girls would die for\\". But just as quickly, she learns that there is a price to pay for such a tempting shortcut on the career ladder.Miranda Priestly inspires fear in everyone at the magazine but not nearly as much as is suffered by her senior and junior assistant, the position Andrea takes. Instead of writing, Andrea must get Miranda's breakfast (often throwing breakfast after breakfast away, for fear it is too cool for the oft late Miranda). She must get lattes, get laundry, hunt down a copy of the latest Harry Potter book for Miranda's bratty twin daughters, and perform hundreds of other meanial tasks to satisfy the whims of her overbearing and selfish boss. An actress could have a good deal of fun with a role like Miranda,should this book ever be made into a film. I read \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" last year and Mrs. X, the villian in that story was pretty bad but there were reasons and definite unhappiness behind her attitude. Miranda is just evil and enjoys making those below her suffer.Andrea struggles with pleasing her boss and balancing what little time she has with her boyfriend, parents,and her friend, Lily, who is going down a dangerous path with alcohol and anendless parade of sexual encounters. All of Andrea's personalrelationships begin to suffer as her time is quickly eaten up by the unrealistic demands of her sadistic boss.I'm not into all the fashion labels but I did find this book interesting. It is an easy read and great for a summer book. One of my problems with the story is how Weisberger portrays the gay men at the magazine. They all seem to be effeminate, flamboyant cliches---for once it would be nice to see a gay man who isn't chasing anything in pants for a quick sexual romp and who doesn't swish around like a diva on the runway. The ending is a little too convienent but overall I enjoy the book. Luckily, I've always had decent bosses and supervisors but anyone who has had a boss that brought your blood to boiling point will more than likely sympathize with the long suffering Andrea. This book is not as good as \\"The Nanny Diaries\\", a book of similiar material, but is still a good read and worth a go."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The writing in this book makes it painfully clear why the author endured the abuse described just for the chance her demanding boss would pull some strings for her and help the author get a job as a writer--she has no talent. Anyone who actually can write would have enough confidence in her ability to get a job based on merit rather than enduring the humiliation described in the novel. The characters are undeveloped and Andrea comes across as a whining, self-centered, insecure brat who expects everyone around her to feel sorry for her but who has no interest in anyone but herself.If you have a lot of time on your hands, you may find the stories about Miranda mildly entertaining; however, if your time is precious to you, this is not a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I might have enjoyed this when I was a teenager or in my very early 20's but even just a little bit older and wiser and I found I couldn't relate to the main character at all. She spends the whole time working for this devil, meeting her every whim, complaining about how awful it is, and never does anything to change her situation! After about 1/3 of the book, I mostly just read it to see if the story would change, which it didn't. I can't really recommend it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book is the equivalent of some of those silly women's magazines that you read at your salon. Fluffy and harmless and fine to pass the time with. I just had to vent however about some of the sloppy writing and a few inaccuracies. Anyone who has ever picked up a fashion magazine knows that Bobbi Brown is spelled with an i not a y (the writer shouldn't use names that she can't spell properly), and six year olds aren't in fourth grade (anyone who has ever been 6 years old knows this one) oh and \\"Giselle\\" isn't really short, she's 5'11. I'm all for people being able to make a buck off of anything that isn't immoral or illegal but it irks me that this writer made quite a bit of money for such a lazy effort."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger has written a moderately entertaining novel- but the lady needs to learn to spell, write grammatically and inject some soul into her prose. Drum-role? Heroine-chic? Eek. How does someone get published by Doubleday with such horrendous typos?For someone who claims to know nothing about fashion, Andrea Sachs, the protagonist, sure drops those designer names from the get-go. (more errrors: Bobbi Brown, the makeup guru, is re-christened Bobby). She tries hard to make us feel pity, or at least empathy for her suffering at the hands of hellish boss Miranda Priestly, but doesn't quite succeed. Andrea herself is too flawed- a bigot who thinks all southerners are rednecks, a self-centered person who'd rather flirt with the hot writer with his 'adorable curl' than spend some quality time with her boyfriend. Yes, her boss is quite an insufferable character. But Andrea knows from day one what her job will be like, and she is compensated accordingly, 'making out like a bandit' at the end. If Weisberger's intent is to tar and feather Miranda Priestley (based on Vogue's Anna Wintour, we are told), she succeeds to only a limited degree. And if Andrea's dreams of writing for the New Yorker are in fact, Lauren's, she has a long hard road ahead of her.In its praise, the book is quite an entertaining read, if you are moderately interested in fashion and couture. The book definitely conveys the workings of the fashion world- everything from the anorexia and shallowness to the price of a Chanel gown to the frenetic pace of work at a magazine. For someone who scoffs at fashion and wears her declass&eacute; Ann Taylor shoes to work (to Miranda's great displeasure), Andrea succumbs to the whole thing too easily. When a desperate teenager writes to Miranda about how she hates her own body and craves Miranda's help, Andrea has the opportunity to give the girl a lesson in self-esteem, but fails. Ultimately it's a shallow book about shallow people. Don't buy the book if you can borrow it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Reading this book is like wearing a pair of Manolo's that don't fit. They cost a lot of money and look good but at the end of the day they hurt. A cute book but not worth the time to read the entire thing. Wait for the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I agree with so many of the earlier reviews. This novel was frustrating. The synopsis offered a good read. Sadly, the writer failed. The writing is horrible. There is little attention to detail and detail that was uneeded. I didn't care about any of the characters; they were entirely one-dimensional. Totally predictable."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just finished reading this book. The title/cover was the draw, but the inside was not worth me paying the hardback price (should have come to amazon.com before I bought).The concept of the book was good, but for some reason, the author could not pull it together to make it an interesing read. The development of the characters (the main character's best friend, boyfriend, boss)were just not there.I hate to mention The Nanny Diaries, but it begs to be compared. This book had none of the witty dialouge and zippy writing style of Diaries. For that reason, you found little reason to really connect with the main character and her angst. The writer merely described situations, but did not really pull you inside the moment with her writing.I mean, if I could care less about her relationship with her super-caring boyfriend or troubled best friend, that says something. And although I could stretch my imagination to visualize the cruelty that was her boss, the writing style did very little to capture the true &quot;horrible-ness&quot; of the whole job scene.Maybe if there were more characters from the fashion world thrown in (e.g. horrific models, demanding designers) then it would have been more interesting. But the focus on the main character and her devilish boss was too little to keep me interested. Lastly, it seemed that the same problematic situations kept resurfacing for the main character (i.e. her hellish job tasks). There was no real variety.I could go on and on, but you would be better served to wait for the paperback or borrow from a friend."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Let's be honest here. I, like many others, bought this book because of the title. Unfortunately, the title was the funniest part of the book. This book has been described as &quot;light&quot;, but there is a difference between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;pointless&quot;. I read the first half on a plane, and because it takes absolutely no intellect to read this book, it was a very nice plane book. The only bad part was having to finish it once you got home. I think the characters are well imagined, especially Miranda, but Andrea gets annoying after ahwile, Lily a little boring, and Alex a little unreal.I think this writer has talent but just a little trouble with plot and smoothness. Half the time you are confused at what she's talking about until you get to the third page of the chapter, THEN it makes sense. Unfortunately, the only reason you think about the things that happen in this book is not because they touched you, or sparked an interest, but only because you're trying to understand what just happened. This is a major chick book, so I give it that, and it isn't meant to be a thought-provoking book either. But please, give us something! I gave it two stars and not one because the author does give an accurate account of midtown New York and because the fashion aspect is funny too. But, just not funny enough to live up to the title."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Repetitive. Boring. Gets slightly interesting near the end, but then doesn't tie up the loose ends of Andy's love-life. What happens with Alex...or Christian? Hellooooo? The one interesting storyline just buggers off and dies!!! I've worked for a boss like Miranda, and I still found it painstaking to read the same scenarios OVER AND OVER again...."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'll read anything. If it's printed, I'll read it. But I gotta tell you, I got half-way thru this book, and I gave up. Miranda Priestly is a boss from hell. Everyone around her jumps thru hoops to keep her happy. The main character, Andrea, spends all her time at work running errands and living in fear of Miranda. Who in their right mind would do that, just so they could get a shot at working at ANOTHER magazine? If you want to read about numberous trips to the coffee shop, the cleaners, putting up with irritating doormen, and not much else, this is the book for you. But after reading 175 pages of Andrea's errands, that was all I could take."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read about this book after I finished &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; and thought it sounded interesting and funny. However, I got a little bored with the whiny narrator and the predictable plot line. Basically, the whole book is about a spoiled Brown graduate who ends up working for a nasty boss. We've all been there and survived to tell about it, so what's so special about Andrea Sachs and her struggle to succeed in the real world?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I jumped on it the second I heard about it. I work for a boss not unlike Miranda Priestly (except in my case the devil wears Armani) and Andrea's dream is my dream: to someday write for publication and earn a salary from it :) However, I honestly cannot say that this is a good book. It's disappointing writing from someone educated at an Ivy League school and I would hope that Ms. Weisberger's byline will not be appearing in the New Yorker in the near future. It is obvious that she is a novice and that her writing needs work. I love all kinds of books, from the fluffiest fiction to the most-indepth, well researched non-fiction. I definitely enjoy the fluffy fiction genre but there are definitely more worthy books to read. I would recommend Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic books if you're looking for something light and fun and entertaining. This one just doesn't do it. I think one of my favorite quotes from a movie sums it all up best: \\"More isn't always better...Sometimes it's just more\\". Ms. Weisberger's novel could have and should have been half it's length. How many times can a reader read the phrase \\"job a million girls would die for\\"? It runs rampant throughout the book. Ms. Weisberger is repetitive in other areas of the book as well but that is the one that got on my nerves the most. I kept thinking \\"OK! POINT TAKEN!!!\\" It's not easy to write a novel and I certainly applaud the effort but I agree with another reviewer that said this book was all about the sensationalism of a tell-all that's not a tell-all about what goes on behind the scenes at the workplace and that it was obviously pushed through the entire publishing process very quickly. I wanted to empathize with Andrea and like her but I thought she was just as snotty as the people she worked for and with and I also noticed the incongruency with Andrea's fashion sense. I wish with all my heart that I had liked the book. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is a must read! After 2 years of being a \\"personal assistant\\" to a high-profile executive in NYC, I can personally relate to many of the over-the-top and absurd demands that are brillianly and colorfully detailed in this amusing novel! For all those that don't believe this mythical and rediculous world really doesn't exist...well, it does! Thank you to Lauren Weisenberger for letting me point all my relatives and friends to this delightful book to say, \\"see...everything I told you about being a 'personal assistant' was true!\\" Well done!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a real boring, badly written book. Not worth the money, I made the mistake of not following the reviews in the NY Times and others who all agree that this book is garbage. I heard that she got the job at Vogue but was not very talented to do anything so she made up scandelous stories, shame she has no ability and people keep buying this nonsense."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I wasted my precious dollars on this trashy book. The title was what fooled me, I thought it would be a smartly written book. The plot is childish and the language is not at all interesting. What was Lauren thinking -- would such mediocrity really sell??"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked this up as a fun, light read, but it was a slog to get to the end. This book is a study of the mundane. It turns out that there is no reason for the story at all, much less the annoying details that it's full of. Did anyone proofread this or question why the different pieces were necessary? Things are thrown in with no regard to plot movement, character development, humor, general interest, good writing... And really, people who work in fashion are often underweight and very into name brands? Revolutionary! Let's hear more about that!The narrator is whiny, hypocritical and generally annoying. I didn't care what happened to her or any of the other one-sided characters, including her dullard boyfriend. I think I was supposed to feel sorry for Andrea or wish her well, but all I wish is that she never writes any books that are as bad as this one.This book ends in the most obvious, gag-inducing way possible. The story arc feels like an episode of Full House with the sad music at the end, where everyone has emerged older and wiser, only here the story isn't as well-developed or adult. Don't read it, dude."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So I saw the movie to this book first and I thought it was pretty cute and decided to get the book. Fortunately I bought it at a used book sale so only wasted .50 cents. Anyway...First off, the story has absolutely ZERO likable characters. Andrea Sachs is greedy, selfish, unloving, lazy, petty, whiny, undeserving, and foolish. She complains constantly about a job that SHE decided to take and one she DOESN'T need! This job at Runway Magazine has absolutely nothing to do with the career she is supposedly striving toward as a jounalist. Instead of taking the time to work her way up in the industry she decides to skip a few steps by working for the devil that is Miranda Priestly for 1 year. Then she feels that she will be qualified to work for The New Yorker. Okay, how does that make any sense? Wouldn't you like to have at least some experience under your belt?Anyway, I have come to the conclusion that Andrea Sachs in a mentally insane person. No one in their right mind would work for such an evil woman when they don't actually have to. As we live through the mindless, mundane and tedious tasks Andrea takes on we are left to wonder, why? Why would she choose to live this way?Andrea is greedy in that she takes the job at Runway just to skip a few of the normal, worthwhile steps any other writer would need to take to get somewhere in the world of journalism.Andrea is selfish in that she actually considers staying in Paris while her best friend is practically on her deathbed in the states.Andrea is slutty in that she honestly thinks its okay to lead another guy on while she is supposedly in love with Alex. She then seems to blow off the break up right after it happens because she is too busy to think about it.In the end it turns out that Andrea really never needed to take the job at Runway. She lands a job as a freelance writer. She makes thousands right off the bat and acts as though it's pocket change. So we just endured 360 pages of Andrea's agonizing life for nothing.My advice is if you are at all intersted in the story...see the movie. At least that was cute with a few chuckles."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I heard the movie was good and figured if the book was a best-seller, it'd be a worthy read.I did devour it over the course of a day and a half, but I'm wondering if that had more to do with the fact that I had little else to do, or if I just kept going see if something would happen already, or a combination of both.I found myself comparing it and the characters to the tv show Ugly Betty, since I'm such a huge fan of the show. The problem I have with this book is how one-dimensional everyone is. The players in and outside of Mode magazine on Ugly Betty are every bit as nasty, and yet the audience can get emotionally invested. In a similar situation of the Devil Wears Prada, you want to think that there would be something more to these characters--any of them, not just the people at Runway--but there really isn't. Even the protagonist, Andrea, makes you want to give her a shake and say, \\"How foolish ARE you?\\" Once she had the business card of Christian's agent, she had a golden nugget of opportunity in the way of networking her way through the literary scene! There is no plot, no real turning point, nothing fresh in either her inner and outer dialogue after about 10 pages. And I, personally, had a difficult time suspending my disbelief about her functioning at 115 lbs on a 5'10\\" frame. (I myself am an inch shorter and even the low end of healthy weight for that is a good 25-30lbs more than what she was. That Andrea still had nice skin and hair or a cycle astounded me.) But I suppose it only serves to illustrate a point about how superficial the fashion industry really is. And the ending? Sappy. Letdown. Meh.I'm glad I satisfied my curiosity and read it and it was by far not the worst book I've ever laid eyes upon. I laughed at parts here and there, and picturing Meryl Streep in all of Miranda's scenes was fun--I'll definitely watch the movie to see her in it. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an easy read for a lazy day at the beach or a long plane ride, but don't come into it expecting to be blown out of your socks."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Sometimes this site can be so infuriating. How can this book have only a three star average? I won't go into it now, I'm not in the mood. All I'll say is if you liked the movie, you'll really love this book. The book is far more interesting than the movie--and the movie was great, so I'd most definitely recommend this book. It appears I'm more generous than most people in my ratings. Or maybe I'm just more informed as to what great writing really is--and this book is very well written."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found this book particularly entertaining and somewhat frightening. Having worked in the fashion industry for 10 years (not at a magazine), I did recognize some truths about the higher ups in my old company. People outside the fashion industry would think this could not possibly happen and that people would not be okay with treatment like this but it does happen and I've seen it in action. I congratulate the author for getting some truths out and for creative license on the rest. Recommended for anyone in the fashion industry and all fashionistas."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really liked this book. Its the story of a naive woman from CT moving to the big city to get a job in publishing who ends up working for the meanest woman in NYC. It is filled with graphic, wonderful description, and the main character (although whiny) is very sympathetic. The book has a different story than the movie, so you can enjoy both without feeling like you are hearing it twice. I would recommend both the book and the movie for a little entertainment."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"We chose this book for our book-club (the back cover had a picture of Merrill Streep who allegedly chose to act in a movie version of the book -- and I remembered her as an actress having taste -- sigh!). I kept asking my wife, \\"Does anything happen or is it more of the same?\\" as I paged through the book. I quite possibly would have abandoned it midway, but I read through to the end and was disappointed. The story is told by Andre-ah Sachs, the protagonist, who works for Miranda Priestly, chief-editor-bitch at a fashion magazine called Runway in Manhattan. The story is entirely about her trials and tribulations caused by her boss, and after about the third time the description of events really ceased to be funny for me. There are several sources of conflict (between Alex her boyfriend and Christian -- a writer she runs across, between her commitment to her job and her friend Lily, between her professional goals and her actual life, between herself and a more senior assistant) but the plot is choppy, and none of the conflicts are truly explored, or decided upon. The main and only point of the book seems to be her boss's outrageous demands, and the end is entirely trite and oh-so predictable. The description of the fashion world is pretty much non-existent so if you are looking for branding thoughts or what makes Gucci a Gucci -- you wont find that here. And gee -- my summary took all of a paragraph -- instead of ~400 pages that felt like eight hundred. Enough said."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"That's just a supposition on my part -- I'll never know whether it's true or not! I've had a slight desire to read this book ever since I first heard about it (partly because of the fact that Weisberger used to work for Vogue, and partly because of its entirely awesome title), though I don't normally read chick lit. However, once I saw the movie, I made it my business to obtain a copy and read it right away. Now I have to say that having seen the movie, I found the book to be in many ways lacking. For one thing, I never really connected with the character. She had a job she hates but kept at it to achieve a certain end. I kept thinking that since she thought the ends justified the means, she should either stop complaining about the job and try to appreciate it, or just quit. A Brown grad in New York can always find work doing something!The Christian Collinsworth/love triangle subplot was very unsatisfying in this book. In the movie, it had a logial beginning, middle and end. In this book, Weisberger just briefly describes her main character's final conversation with him, as if she forgot that she had to wrap that storyline up in order to finish the novel. I also could not connect to her main secodary characters, the best friend and boyfriend. Everytime I thought I was on the verge of it, Weisberger moved away from them and went back to the main plot. It seemed as though she couldn't make up her mind, or find the balance she wanted between one plot and the other.Overall I think these problems are probably the result of it being her first novel, and therefore forgivable. I also think that I don't read enough chick lit to really understand how it's all supposed to work, so it's entirely possible that everything I'm complaining about is just par for the course in this genre. What I don't get is why chick lit even exists as a genre, when it's the exact same thing Harlequin books have been doing for years, except more expensive. This book was very dull in places (though it was supposed to be funny) and definitely not worth the eight bucks I ponied out for it.On the whole, the movie was a lot better. It had more spark and pizzaz than anything Weisberger wrote, and of course it helped to actually be seeing all the beautiful clothes instead of just reading about them. I wasn't totally appalled and horrified by this book's shortcomings, but I was far from impressed. I won't be checking out any more titles from this author -- no matter how great the titles are!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With the latest clothes, long work hours, low-carb diets, and juicy gossip-- THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is an eye opener to the fashion world that puzzles so many women. Fresh out of college, Andi lands a job \\"a million girls would die for\\" as a personal secretary to the most powerful woman in fashion, Miranda Priestly. Believing a recommendation from such a distinguished individual would guarantee her life's dream job as a writer for The New Yorker, Andi busts her butt for endless days by seeing to Miranda's every need and want. However, as the months of hard work pile up the line between her personal and work life vanishes and Andi begins to lose sight of her boyfriend, her best friends, her family, and even herself for the sake of her job.Conclusion...Overrated! It was simply not worth all the hype. Lauren Weisberger's, style, although fast-paced, quickly becomes tedious, boring, and repetitive. It may be fast-paced but it leads nowhere, and it drags on far longer than necessary. Supposedly, the movie based on this novel is far better than the book itself. But reading the novel left me with no desire to even watch it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger's mastery of the written word allows one to understand the pain and suffering of Andrea as she pursues her dreams to write for The New Yorker. I finished the book in two days because I was so drawn into Andrea's life and could not wait to see how her optimistic, naive character breaks out of her horrible situation.I loved getting away with this book, and recommend it to anyone with a desire to spend time with a great author and a great fictional character."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" asks the musical question, \\"Would you sell your soul to achieve a goal?\\" Aspiring writer for \\"The New Yorker\\" accepts a job at the bottom of the fashion industry food chain, as an assistant to an assistant to a dragon lady extraordinaire. Among the many required responsibilities of the position are a willingness to submit to brutal hazings and humiliation 24/7, for a full year!So yes; it's a bit over the top, but maybe you enjoy that sort of thing. Maybe it helps you to escape from your own lousy job/life, or maybe you're a sado-masochistic fluff muffin who actually prefers stiletto heels and sore feet to practicality and comfort. Or perhaps like me, you're totally mystified by such people, and looking to get a bit of insight into their world.Well I'm afraid you won't exactly find it here, though Ms. Weisberger's style is very readable, even if the material is somewhat predictable. The best parts of the book are the dedication and the acknowledgments; actually, they're hilarious. I think Lauren Weisberger has some very good material in her just waiting for the opportunity to be written. But first she had to get a best-seller published; hence, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"New York Times best seller books trageted for women readers usually lack of substance in their content. Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger however, explores core values of life as well as a picture of colorful and rich descriptions of the fashion industry.Andrea, a graduate from college is the main character of the book. Andrea starts to work as the assistant of the head editor at a prestigious fashion magazine in the big Apple. Unlike her job tittle, the work itself is very unimportant and dealing with her boss' petty errands becomes very hectic. in consequence, Andrea must take a decision of either working as an unimportant assistant in a glamorous environment or truly accomplish her dream career somewhere else.Weisberger, a young and talented writer graduated from Cornell university, illustartes the fashion magazine industry with a spicy tone. Devil Wears Prada employs trendy terminologies, giving off useful information behind the scenes of the fashion industry. Nevertheless, while describing the job tasks for Andrea, the author becomes a little redundant. For instance, the complaints Andrea struggles about seem to never end, making her boss seem meaner than an ogre from a fairy tale.Devil Wears Prada would be a suitable book for young people (especially women) interested with the latest fashion trends or those who long to become a part of the fashion industry. in conclusion, this book is one of the few literary works that engage in fashion issues and yet it is written in a very lucid and unique way."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"And it's all true.

The most wonderful cast even on the dark side. Suzy was the model of the day. We all know about Joan Crawford and what a job she did. The book was great, but maybe this is where this author really got her ideas, but enough of the whinning and absolutely not a fragment of story line...."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although, I don't agree with others who don't like her writing, I must admit that this book is possibly the longest, stress-inducing rant in history.

It's cool to get free designer clothes but to be mistreated in the most undignified and disrespectful way, I mean c'mon, the writer should have given us the satisfaction of Andrea saying more than just \\"%&#@ you, Miranda\\" in the end, in front of the world's best dressed people. To be so humiliated like that for almost a year, that is all an angry person could manage to say?

It was easy to find compassion for Andy, the main character, but after awhile, I found myself getting frustrated with her. I suppose being young,impressionable and thrown into this world was overwhelming. I can see how young women would relate to her, as I found her character to be realistic.Overall, I felt the book was a bit slow and repetitive, and parts read like an ad for high-end merchandise. It lacked depth. I kept reading, waiting to see what happens next, but in the end, was left still waiting.

The characterizations were flat, and I was at a loss when asked which was my favorite character - none of them. Yet they had ample and honest flaws laid out - lying, alcoholism, cruising bars, overworking.So my opinion was decidedly mixed, and it benefited from being a very light read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book.

Pick Nanny Diaries or this one but not both, or you will end up bored."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"First: the book isn't really well-written. The author, in what i'm guessing is an attempt to write the way people talk, creates clunky sentences and repeats phrases (okay, so Andy wants to write for the New Yorker. I get it). But when i picked up a book entitled \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" I wasn't seeking the next Booker Prize winner. Instead, I got a really funny beach read, with a character in Miranda that is so over-the-top you're thinking \\"she can't make this stuff up.\\" Andy isn't the most sympathetic character ( I felt much worse for the utterly disillusioned Emily) but she's enjoyable enough and her pop-culture and post-college references are right on the money. The characters and the plot could've been fleshed out more and the choppy writing could've been better edited, but the book was a glance into that world that many people are at the same time envy and are disgusted by. someone pointed out that the author seemed to be relishing in the lifestyle she was dishing on and I think that's pretty much the point. I for one would like to think that I'm above being bribed an endless supply of designer wear but then I think--oh please, who am I kidding? And I agree that it all could've been better conveyed but is it worth your fifteen bucks? It might be just to see how much money Miranda wastes on breakfasts and lattes, and her utter absurd \\"tasks\\" and belittling remarks--and then realize that it's not completely fiction."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" deals with Andrea who worked as an assistant for Miranda, the prominent editor in chief for Runaway, a fashion magazine. It was the first job Andrea landed after graduating from college and she was hoping this would be a stepping stone for her to work for The New Yorker. Unfortunately for Andrea, Miranda was terrible to work for, as she was arrogant, bossy, demanding, and act like she had to right to call her assistants at anytime. Soon, working for Miranda consumed Andrea's life and she began neglecting her family, her boyfriend and her bestfriend. She had no time for anyone and was constantly stressed out.I think \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is quite entertaining and it provides insights (especially since the author herself worked at the highly popular magazine) into the world of fashion magazines where wearing the right stuff (such as Prada, Gucci) is a must for every employee. The entire book basically deals with Andrea job at Runaway and don't expect anything more. Even though many chick lits deal with fashion magazines, this one in particular deals with fashion in detail."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It was humorous and the characters interesting, but the theme is similar to the Nanny Diaries: young woman just out of college takes entry level position, not really in her field, in order to break into her field.

But, throughout the book there is not one inspiring thing that teaches her, (An-dre-ah!!) how good of an opportunity this really was for her to take!

But as much as Weisberger tries to point out how superior she is to her job, how really substantial she is -- the book reveals the opposite. It's the trite complaint of a privileged white woman whining about being chauffered on errands and having to wear couture -- and other \\"degradations\\" beneath someone of her abilities. Her writing style, shallow observations and her preoccupation with dropping the names of every bling bling and obscenely expensive object she wears, eats, or encounters prove she isn't. The exhaustively detailed passages about every outrage she suffered were so tedious I couldnt read the book -- and I love dish. She comes off as catty, immature, superificial and extremely annoying -- the cardboard cutouts of the people she describes are mere props to the song of herself . She will never be able to write for The New Yorker -- but maybe Self Magazine?Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I grabbed Lauren Weisberger's debut novel as soon as it hit the stands. I had heard much of the hype surrounding this \\"kiss & tell\\" book, and was undoubtedly curious, considering that the author had worked for The Anna Wintour, and would have woven real-life experiences into her novel.I must admit for the first 100 pages or so, Ms. Weisberger had me enraptured in the world of Elias-Clark, Runway, and more importantly the world of her main character, Andrea Sachs. Being that I'm financially-challenged (how PC is that?), and cannot afford to buy Prada, Manolos, or Jimmy Choos, I could definitely relate to the main character. However, Andrea's condescending attitude toward her colleagues was a major stumbling block for me. She constantly complained about her boss, Miranda Priestly, and her Runway colleagues being so vain and condescending, but Andrea herself was pretty much the same, but on a different level.Like almost everyone else who have posted \\"Devil\\" reviews before me, I kept reading simply to find out how Andrea finally left Miranda's employ, and was very disappointed by the neat, predictable plot points that lead up to the event.Although this book did not live up to my lofty expectations, there were some hilarious moments, many of them involving Eduardo the security guard...very witty and clever to Ms. Weisberger's credit.Also, another bright spot in the book was the totally realiztic and believable relationship between Andrea and senior assistant Emily. They obviously weren't on the same page, and didn't like each other, but they got along when they had to. It would have been easy for the author to show these two characters locking horns in extreme hatred for one another, but Ms. Weisberger skillfully showed how two people can work together without liking each other. I honestly had expected Emily to go out of her way to make Andrea look incompetent, in light of her \\"devil may care\\" attitude. It was surprising and refreshing to see the slice-of-life relationship between Andrea and Emily.Most of the characters in the book were one-dimensional and extremely boring, especially Andrea's boyfriend, Alex. It's obvious that Ms. Weisberger crafted Alex to function as Andrea's conscience, as was the case with Andrea's family members, and best friend Lily.The character of Miranda Priestly was thisclose to being \\"deliciously evil\\", but the author never really showed us why Miranda was so unhappy. Yes, there was the background information given at the beginning of the book, but in the end, I could see why Miranda had to be demanding and icy and distant. Not to say that I totally agreed with her behavior, but I found it very difficult to hate her. For a short time in my career, I served as an assistant to a publisher, and I had to fetch coffeee, place lunch orders and the like. However, while my boss was much more personable than Miranda, I perfectly understood why I had to take care of my boss's personal affairs. Certainly, Ms. Weisberger didn't expect us to think that Miranda should have to order her own food, answer her own phone, and run a magazine empire all at the same time. As unfortunate as it is, there are just some people who have to delegate personal responsibilities...If you're looking for an easy read for a vacation, then this book should suit you just fine. Otherwise, I'd say wait for the movie.This wasn't the best piece of prose I've read, but it wasn't the worst, either. I am sure that Ms. Weisberger's writing will improve with her next book. I, for one, am willing to give her another chance."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'd recommend this book to someone who enjoys the show on HBO \\"sex and the city\\".

Having myself worked for a horribly demanding and selfish female CEO for many years, it was easy to identify with her frustration, degradation and lack of self-dignity and re-live the first years of my career. The only real humor regarding this book has been watching the fashion industry's reactions to the \\"INSIDE STORY OF THE REAL ANNA WINTOUR\\" which unfortunately is all this book amounts to be."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Funny, if not life changing, look at the worst boss ever!Take it to the beach this summer for a light, easy read that will make you feel better about your own insane boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am fourteen years old and a fashion fanatic. this book was amazing i could not put it down. the way its written is very humerous and you really find yourself rooting for the characters and you are really able to relate to them. it is a VERY GOOD BEACH READ! this is such a fun easy read i totally recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It is terrible.

It could not hold my interest, and I was not drawn to any of the characters enough to get past the 3/4 point. You know how you and your girlfriends go through your early 20's focused narrowly on yourselves? For outsiders, it's torture to listen to the endless prattle. This reminded me of that phase. We get waaaaay too much detail about the lead characters banal, everyday movements and thoughts, which are compelling only to her. The more interesting book would provide, of course, the fly-on-the-wall perspective on the editor-in-chief's life. As it stands in this book, we only get tiny histrionic bits and glimpses of the most potentially interesting character. It's all just too dull."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"only buy this book if you want an inside peak at the fashion business, the dialogue is unrealistic and wooden at best. the editor is shallow and vain. hello? this is the fashion world we're talking about - it shouldn't be a shock!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This was not the trendy book I imagined, just non-stop whining by the narrator, Andrea. She doesn't do anything but complain and have panic attacks. Receiving thousands of dollars in free clothing/shoes/makeup is not worth her aggravation either. Going to the best parties in NYC are so tiring since she has to talk to so many annoying beautiful people! As long as I was getting paid I wouldn't care if I had to drive in a town car all day shopping for my boss! *sigh. Poor Andrea.I didn't even finish reading the book, just half of it. The whole time I was thinking it was like reading a coloring book, since it had almost no substance. The Author just kept repeating the same mantra. We GET IT! Andrea wants to work for the New Yorker but might not make it a year there since her boss does not say hello or goodbye on the telephone. Maybe she should realize that the incessant hello and goodbye over the phone take up far too much time over the course of a day! This book is \\"chick lit\\" at it's every worst. Lacking completely in substance, with a heroine that has almost no common sense.It is far worse than reading a coloring book on second thought. At least a child's coloring book might have some sort of moral to it . The main character here was just a spoiled woman who didn't want to have to do any work or earn a rank, unlike everyone else in the world! Not everyone can do what they want in their first year out of collage."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The only thing clever about this book is the title. Because I have some faith in humanity, I'd like to believe that it would never be published were it not a roman a clef about a certain, famously difficult person. Miss Weisberger's characters are shallow, unlikeable, and one-dimensional contrivances who speak in horrible, wooden dialogue. The plot is a basic one which has been done many times to better effect by actual, talented writers. You cannot convince me that the author has any talent for observing human behavior as she produced no evidence of it in this, the worst book I've ever read. I never thought I'd be able to bestow that dubious superlative on another book since the day I read two chapters of Flowers in the Attic and threw it across the room in disgust, but V.C. Andrews is Leo Tolstoy compared to Lauren Weisberger. The NY Times was right in writing not one, but two reviews condemning this piece of trash."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio version. This was an awesome book. It kept me easily entertained from the first track of the book. The narrator did a great job varying her voice, and using pauses and other effects to make the thoughts and dialogue of this book very realistic and very entertaining. This book was very funny, and I could also relate to the frustration the main character felt. I really enjoyed this book, I really like this author because of her realistic, light hearted, humorous books."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Don't get me wrong- I enjoyed the movie and saw it twice, mostly because Meryl Streep's characterization of Miranda is absolutely priceless. But the book fleshed out Andrea's (\\"Ahn-dre-ah...\\") inner thoughts to make her motives more understandable. Her mutinous running comments about Miranda were exactly what any unfortunate \\"lucky girl\\" would entertain if she worked for such an over-the-top nut job as Miranda. The only false note that bugged me a little was the charming writer who sporatically popped up out of nowhere for the sole purpose of stirring up a little spice in the story. His appearances seemed totally contrived. However, all in all this was a fun book to read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"it arrived very quickly. and the products is in good condition.I like the purchase very much."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a good book, not fast reading. The movie was better, It portrays Miranda as a sociopath."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I picked up this book on a book-buying-splurge during a time at work when I really couldn't stand my own boss. While I certainly don't regret reading it, I probably would have survived without doing so. The writing is mediocre at best; although, for the most part, the story is good enough to carry you through to the end (if you have the patience, that is). I found that I could read it for a solid hour or so at a time, and I can certainly appreciate that much.What I can't quite grasp is any human being that wretched, boss or no boss. I can imagine the real person on which this book was based was a pretty bad boss (don't get me wrong, I've had some real nasty ones), but I would also hope that Lauren Weisberger took advantage of writing to exaggerate her experiences (and her boss) to let her learn to laugh at them both.Not the greatest book, but not bad, either."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I could not put this book down.

I felt that it was poorly written and had a very weak storyline (if having one at all). While I chuckled at a few one liners, the rest of the comments, conversations, asides, and thoughts of the main character felt forced and unnatural. Then in mid-story, the author tries to bring on a serious tone in describing the drinking problems of the roommate and issues with our main character's relationships. All of this seemed quite false, however, in such a materialistic, shallow story about the fashion world. This story may be suitable for drunken sorority girls or fashion expert wannabes, but for the rest of us, I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I got drawn into the narrative by its fast-paced, dense, witty first couple of pages. I felt much delight at Ms. Weisberger's obvious talent to make the inexplicably menacing quality of fielding a simple phone call for an erratic boss kind of an re-enactment experience.Days later, I closed the novel shut with a sour notion in the back of my mind. Something along the line of \\"It's Schadenfreude literature, it's like someone talking back to a bully after making sure a sheriff has secured the latter one.\\"The unforgiveness for having endured unforgiving situations that colors the narrative, and makes the final page a parting shot, is disturbing. It is so because it underscores a simmering feeling that Ms. Weisberger's autobiographic heroine, Andrea, had surely been good and ready all along the way to become a tyrant herself. Ready to pull all the strings for her boss -- had Miranda Priestly just once smiled at Andrea during the first days of her tenure at \\"Runway\\" Magazine. The monster within her was willing and ready to come alive.The real story line, therefore, goes like this: Someone inherently willing to do what it takes to advance her own career enters the fashion world. She gets overwhelmed and stopped in her tracks by someone more powerful and more apt at those very traits. The fictional Andrea is reeling over it. And the real Ms Weisberger, it would appear, does so as well.There are wonderful passages in this book. Very precise symptomatic etchings of what professional hierarchies can amount to. Enticing little asides about how dating in NYC can be a real brain-whacker. There is, however, a lingering notion of Ms. Weisberger not even having been aware of that there is more to it than drawing mere gossipy etchings, when composing the fictional character.She got close to hell without sensing the heat. She was sketching the devil without recognizing him -- in that it takes not that much to turn into the latter unwittingly, to stay true to the term. In this case, for the fictional Andrea to turn into a devil herself would have taken nothing but a smile. A smile of Miranda's, the Big Boss. The more the reader gets acquainted with the setting, the more this notion becomes a distinct possibility, never mentioned out loudly (for Andrea does not get it herself), though always palpably present between the lines.That would have been a great starting point for a great novel. Alas, Ms Weisberger seems to not even coming close to comprehending the darker forces that make her fictional Andrea long for a kind word. All there has sprung into existence is but a lengthy payback diary instead, of someone lashing out at somebody else after the fact, while never doubting her own good-will all the same, of course.Of course. Overstating one's own sacred good-will, combined with a relentless drive to get to the top as well as a penchant for sardonic sarcasm that is the very trademark of Andrea's, surely points to a lovely, loveable character. There are scores of them around on this planet, female as well as male ones.As junior associates, they are good chaps, though in a way that warrants caution, always ready to kiss up and bad-mouthing those they are kissing up to right after. Once they are handed down real hierarchical power, there is but one question popping up: How come we did not find out before?As such, I eyed the book cover with a long final gaze, thinking: Beware of Andrea's next move."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ever had a job offer that simply seemed to good to be true? Ever had a boss that could be the devil...the devil with a sense of fashion? In The Devil Wears Prada the main character gets that too good to be true job...only to find out that her boss is mean enough to be the devil. It is a book that explores how far you would go for the perfect job, and the perfect recommendation for future jobs. It is funny, cynical, and full of fashion sense."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In &quot;The Devil Wears Prada,&quot; Andrea Sachs, a fresh Brown graduate, is hired as the junior assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine. The conventional wisdom is that the book is based on the experience of its author, Lauren Weisberger, who worked for Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue.\\" It is also rumored that La Wintour (Called \\"Nuclear Wintour\\" by some) was not amused.Weisberger has an infelicitous writing style, but she is a gifted storyteller, has a wicked sense of humor, and fills her book's pages with quirky, interesting characters. Thus, she has produced a fluffy, funny look at the fashion industry and the people who work there.Weinberger's depiction of her protagonist, Andrea Sachs, is almost as unflattering as that of the cold, arrogant, and overwrought Miranda Priestly, for whom Andrea works. Andrea has a bad attitude problem and learns that, because of her drive and ambition, she has become her own worst enemy. In the most telling scene in the book, Miranda tells Andrea, \\"You remind me of myself when I was your age,\\" which causes Andrea to have an epiphany that I will not reveal here.The Devil Wears Prada is lightweight and not particularly well written. Nevertheless, it's a lot of fun. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Having worked IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY , it was easy to relate to this work and be awkardly reminded of some of my own actions while I was a 'player' in the business.

I am an avid reader of all styles of novels and this is one book that I can say that I truly enjoyed. I hope Lauren Weisberger releases another novel soon. Some of the reviews here weren't so great but give the book a shot. You just might enjoy it. It's a great novel to put your feet up too. So grab a latte, kick off those heals and sit back, relax and escape into the world of fashion, flash and style..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After hearing so many people talk about this book, I had to see what all the fuss was about. I loved this debut novel! If you need a fun read for fun's sake every now and then, you will love this book. Don't get caught up in the criticisms of Weisberger's grammatical errors...just enjoy this book for what it is...entertainment! If you are not into reading fashion magazines, cannot name a fashion couture designer, or do not follow fashion trends, I would not recommend this book. Andrea's bored attitude and loathing of the fashion industry as well as her snide remarks about Miranda and her co-workers are a riot. Being privy to her thoughts was hilarious! I laughed out loud when Andrea told Miranda off at the end! I am looking forward to Weisberger's next novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not only unoriginal (similar books include the Nanny Diaries, which was somewhat better) but very whiny. Despite her attempts, the author fails to convey any humour or gain pity for the protagonist... The Devil Wears Prada made me cringe; the &quot;protagonist&quot;(if she may be called that, as it is well-known that the author lived similar experiences) seems spoiled and unprepared to hold down a job. Basically, it reads like a spiteful dish-all about the author's boss (Vogue editor Anna Wintour). My advice: don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The sheer fact that so many readers have rated this book with only one star, proves the author's point and skill.Contrary to what has been written here, I feel that the style and language are appropriate to get the shallow, extreme world of fashion publishing across. The narrative pulls you in and you keep on reading every word, and laughing out loud many times, which in my opinion is one of the definitions of a good book. However, whether the author is/was skilled and/or experienced enough to fulfill her lifelong dream to write for the New Yorker has little to do with the quality of the writing in this book. Different messages require different media, which require different writing styles.Even if the author has taken the creative liberty to exaggerate the events and behaviour of Miranda (her boss from hell), the real message comes through loud and clear. The book describes a depressing place to work in, yet you keep laughing and wanting to know what happens next.Andrea, or Laura, might have been \\"the staffer from hell\\", as one of her former colleagues writes, she might not have had any PA skills to speak of and her attitude to feel \\"above it all\\" is probably true and terribly annoying, it is the bosses like \\"Miranda\\" whose behaviour are hellish. It is when the top of such corporations allow it and suffer silently with the rest of the staff, that they become the Enforcers, the guilty ones, helping the Miranda's of this world to keep on behaving like this.No person in this world can rightly claim the right to terrorise others. No matter what worldly position you hold, no matter if you've been born with a golden spoon in your mouth or as a pauper, you simply don't behave like this.It doesn't really matter if Miranda Priestly is Anna Wintour's alter ego. Only staffers can tell and they won't, as Laura does describe so well, they've been brainwashed and have lost the power to objectively look at their lives. Or maybe the many fringe benefits are compensation enough to accept the daily terror.Laura, as Andrea, isn't really trying to portray herself as a Saint. She's admits to many of faults and incompetences, some of which would not have been tolerated in other companies and would have had her fired much earlier. In that respect I can understand someone like \\"Emily\\" whose main complaint about Andrea is her attitude. In the end, Andrea decides that her ambitions are just not worth it when reality in the form of a friend in need, snaps her out of it.Bosses like \\"Miranda\\" exist. Be grateful that you've never encountered such person. But then, you've lost a chance to write a book about it. In the meantime you spend a few hours laughing out loud and being thankful that when your phone rings at 2 am in the morning, it's a \\"wrong number\\" and not somebody barking to find her a seat on a flight right now..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ineptly written, clumsily edited, Weisberger's thinly disguised autobiography is one of those quick reads that's perfect for a long trip or a night when you're too tired to focus on anything with more substance. Devil keeps the readers plowing ahead by describing a year's worth of excess and boss-from-hellishness. Can Miranda really be as awful and obsessive as she sounds? Oh sure, and Weisberger delights in regaling us with example after example of Miranda's lack of empathy and her emotional lability. How did Miranda get that way, how did she manage to achieve such success, and why does her kind of behavior exert so much power over people who should realize that they aren't indentured slaves? Weisberger doesn't explore this aspect at all. How can someone with so little regard for financial issues be running a major magazine? Weisberger doesn't care, and we don't find out. Nor does she ever seem to truly appreciate the fact that she was very lucky; if not for her stint with Miranda, she would never have had the chance to publish this book. (I don't think she could be a reporter for a college newspaper, let alone a writer for a major magazine.)I kept waiting for Miranda to get her comeuppance, but instead, it was more of the same old until the fictitious Andrea told off the boss and flew home from Paris, a quick but merciful ending to Anna's and our ordeal. At the end of the book, she's still babbling about the celebs she met and the clothes she got to wear (why bother with $800 shoes whose heels won't stay on?). Perhaps in ten years she'll have gained some perspective on her experience and polished her storytelling ability. Meanwhile, I'm giving her first awkward effort two stars because of the great Bad Boss anecdotes."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though it took me until well over half-way through the book to really get into it. There was one thing that bothered me. There was a reference to Walt Disney World's Epcot that showed me that the author didn't do much research. I found that to be a little un-professional. If she was going to use such a reference, she should have at least researched it and found out the proper spelling of Epcot. Other than that, I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"With a juicy, interesting story line like this book has to work with, there is no reason that the book should not be entertaining. Yet with the poor construction and editing, I found the book very difficult to enjoy. It seems like the publisher must have rushed the book to the shelves, perhaps to keep the liberally-used pop culture references timely and to capitalize on the gossipy aspect being touted in the media.In the book, the conversations are hard to follow and don't ring true, and the cutesy run-on sentences with parenthesized thoughts in them are tiresome. Trendy fashion terms, 20-something lingo, and Yiddish terms are tossed about without explanation. Worst of all, I came across some plot holes where editing must have slipped up and not noticed that the author changed her mind about the progress of a chapter. I was stunned, reading along, and then struggling to piece together what the intended direction of the chapter was. Also many far-fetched coincidences are used to tie the story together. You would feel like a fool letting yourself get lost in this story. It's hard to enjoy the continual negative attitude of the protagonist also; I couldn't feel sorry for her. So there was no really likable character in the story with which to identify.This one was given to me as a gift. I'm glad I didn't waste my own money on it!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I expected more from this book because of the publicity - Lauren Weisberger even got on the Today show with Matt Laurer. My advice, spend your money on a subscription to Vogue instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This poorly written book exists only to reveal a glimpse of the miserable excuse for a human being -- and a highly regarded one at that -- who edits a leading women's fashion magazine. Is Anna Wintour of Vogue as beastly as the protagonist's boss Miranda Priestley depicted in this book? That's for the reader to judge. Whatever degradation author Lauren Weisberger suffered at the hands of the real Miranda, however, she got a two-book deal from her publisher, which is about one book more than her talents as a writer merit."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Who edited this pap?First, Andrea says she specifically moved in with Kendra and co. because the apartment had a kitchen.She then says, about a chapter later \\"I thought about eating in the living room because there was no kitchen, but Kendra [and other roommate] were asleep there\\".In the VERY SAME PARAGRAPH, it says:\\"He tiptoed to the kitchen and came back with large garbage bags.\\"The above is only a small example of how the publishing world is going to hell in a Prada bag. The writing is appallingly bad, the characters completely undeveloped and one-dimensional, the situations completely ludicrous and the plot non-existent.What makes me ill is knowing that \\"writers\\" with actual talent are struggling to get ahead and this particular \\"writer\\" managed to scrape an international best seller out of one lousy job experience simply because the person about whom she is writing is supposedly famous.I wish books like this would be given less consideration - they give literature a bad name."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw this movie (twice) before reading the book, and I can say that the movie version of a book was much better (the first time I think I've ever said that).The biggest problem that I had with the \\"novel\\" is that I could not at all relate to the main character. Clearly someone from Gen Y. Perhaps it's because I've suffered too many bad jobs, or too many insane bosses, but I could not get over the sense of entitlement that Andy had in the book. She acts like she was servant, but she could have left the company at any time. Instead, she would \\"get back\\" at her company by - let's face it - stealing by submitting bogus expenses. The most telling example was when she would charge three extra coffees to hand out to homeless people every morning - not because she cared about the homeless - but because it would really piss off the company if they knew their money was being spent on dirty, poor people. I was really hoping she would get caught.Where the movie got it right is that they managed to make Andy a sympathetic \\"character\\" through Anne Hathaway. Both she and Meryl Streep managed to make the movie enjoyable and interesting. Anne's take on Andy was that of a young woman who genuinely tried to deal with a ridiculous job and gave it her best, even if it was \\"below\\" her.A fun light read, but the movie is way better."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw previews for the movie of the same name recently in the theaters, and since I like to read the books first, I picked this book up. I do plan on seeing the movie and sincerely hope that it's better than the book. The main character, Andrea Sachs, lacks depth and isvery one dimensional - certainly not someone that you could care about. Miranda is almost too much bitchiness rolled into one individual. I guess my biggest disappointment in the book was that I kept waiting for the 'big confrontation' that seemed inevitable - where Andrea could finally tell Miranda what she thinks of her and her job and it just doesn't happen. The ending was a huge disappointment for me. I just felt that the ending was lacking the sparks that it needed."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I wasn't aware this book was a bestseller or soon-to-be-movie when I began reading. Nor was I expecting great literature or insightful writing. But this book is scandalously awful. The main premise, that Miranda Priestly is not a nice person, is rammed home throughout the book. The characters are one-dimensional and disposable. The writing is poor (do publishers no longer employ editors?) and the d&eacute;nouement implausible and rushed. How this book ever got published I have no idea. My advice: better to read nothing than to read this.NB I wanted to give zero stars but am forced to give one."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Against all odds, a woman lands a prestigious job with a top fashion magazine.Then whines about it for the whole book.The job assignments are ridiculous for any job: A glamourized, over-worked go-fer who is expected to read the mind of her boss. An assistant for an editor who apparently does no writing. And somehow a year in this job is supposed to land her a writer's dream job at the New Yorker (you guessed it... it does.)This book offers no insight, no entertainment, nothing. It did not make me laugh. I did not like the heroine... or any of the characters. The 'plot' was inane. I cannot think of one redeeming quality of this book.Skip it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Written in much the same style as the Nanny Diaries and packed with similar faults, The Devil Wears Prada is a real disappointment. I loved the title and am always down with a bit of dirt on the fashion industry to fuel my love/hate relationship, so I was really looking forward to a juicy weekend read.Urgh. I found myself stuck in a plotline where predictably dowdy Andrea, the main character, is working for fashion magazine boss-from-hell, yet is too weak to quit. Andrea lives and learns painful lessons while kowtowing to her boss. And when she does finally does work up some gumption, you can't help but wonder why it took some 200 pages to do so and why it feels so terribly boring? Why oh why? Admittedly, Miranda Priestly, said boss-from-hell, based on Anna Wintour of Vogue and Lauren Weisberger's ex boss, is fascinating in her nihilistic and pitiless bitchy romp, but God, everyone else is so sychophantic and weak. It's hardly shocking that a character based on Wintour is outrageously awful, what's shocking are the like Andrea that work for her. Why won't someone just dump a milkshake on this woman's head (or Anna Wintour's for that matter)? And the scenes with Alex, Andrea's boyfriend in supporting role, were slightly nauseating. Let's just say he's dreamy, works with underprivileged children, blah, blah and get on with it.If you really liked the Nanny Diaries, then I'd recommend the Devil Wears Prada. Aside from subject matter, they are so similar in style and predicament that I had to double-check the authors' names to make certain they were different. If you're in need of a good bathtub read, try In Her Shoes, remarkably well-written."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Reading about heroine Andrea Sachs year working as the most junior assistant to the highest woman in fashion kept reminding me of something. I couldn't fathom what it was till I got about halfway through and then it struck me: domestic servants. As a keen fan of social history, I've read a lot about the kind of lives many women were forced to lead in the 19th and early parts of the 20th century. The hours were as continuous as the demands ridiculous. And, like Andrea in Prada, you couldn't leave because you relied upon your boss not only for your pitiful living but for a good reference. Without it, you couldn't get work elsewhere. Being dismissed without references meant, quite literally, the poor house for domestic servants. They put up with it because they had no choice.Andrea Sachs DOES have a choice but somehow she gets herself into the kind of bind where she believes she does not. She wants to be a magazine writer and believes her year in servitude to one of the most monstrous magazine editors in the business, Miranda Priestly, will get her there. So whatever hoops Priestly demands she jumps through, Andrea doesn't just jump but asks, \`How high?'Naturally you long for Andrea to tell Priestly just where she can shove the tall latte with two raw sugars that she demands throughout the day. You know it's going to happen. Eventually. What you don't know is how, why and where. It's this longing for a satisfactory denouement that keeps you reading. And here, Weisberger's doesn't disappoint.I bought this book because I'm planning a trip to New York and I thought it would be much more fun to bone up on the city with a work of fiction rather than a travel book. But though I learned a lot about uptown, downtown, midtown, east and west; I also had a fabulous time reading this book.Weisberger has been criticised for writing little more than a, \`Bash the boss' book but you know, so what? Bosses like Priestly - and there are far too many of them - need to be bashed like this all day every day. The domestic servants this tale reminded me of knew a great deal more about their masters and mistresses living upstairs than they who were served ever knew about those who served them. Which is why, in the end, it is those who are served who are the most humiliated by it; not the servers. When you pass your soiled knickers, no matter how expensive they are, to someone else to clean, you've lost all claims to dignity."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I bought and subsequently read this novel in the course of a few hours, hoping that the negative reviews regarding the author's style and the story itself would be proved wrong. At first Devil is funny, and yes, it does bear many similarities to The Nanny Diaries, but it ultimately pales in comparison.What put me off of this novel was its so-called heroine, Andrea, the quintessential &quot;I graduated from an Ivy school as an English major and therefore I am entitled to work for 'meaningful' publications!&quot; whiner. I didn't really care about her and found her irritating and self-righteous, and especially in the current economic climate, wholly unappreciative that she actually had a job. But I digress.The characterization of Miranda Priestly was amusing, but it felt like it became such a tired plot device after we must hear of how Andrea screwed up...again. I would have liked to see a more balanced portrayal between the two characters, because towards the end I almost liked Miranda (or was at the very least fascinated by her) and and decidedly did not like Andrea.What irked me beyond the main character was her narrative style, one that would make asides such as using &quot;the most cliched phrase in the English language&quot; but then continue to use said phrase, or interject rules of proper English grammar. It's as if she must apologize for not coining a more original phrase or not following those rules she knows so well, and her time could have been employed much better in writing a better novel.Overall, a highly disappointing read and a book I hope to return promptly."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Not having a background in fashion, I still adored this book because it reminded me of my first experiences working in Washington. While my boss was no Miranda Priestly, he could be just as irrational and extremely demanding. The strange world of the rich and powerful was just as foreign to me as it was to Andrea Sachs. There are some faults and lack of character development, as is mentioned in other review, i.e. Lily and the make-up and I don't really get the reason for the Christian character, but I still read it in less than a week, because I wanted to know how it turned out... It didn't make me laugh-out-loud on the train like the Shop-a-holic series, but it was pretty good."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Worst book ever. This author tries to make the main character seem witty, funny and charming, but none of those goals is accomplished. The humour is too over the top and just does not cut it. The main character is completely unlovable, much like Carrie Bradshaw in 'Sex and the City'. This book was on a New York Times Best Sellers list? please."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I wasn't overly impressed by the beginning of \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" but a third of the way through the novel, the writing and momentum picked up and there were flashes of brilliance in some extremely well described scenes. (I found the song-dance routines Andrea had to go through with Eduardo hilarious.) The ending was anti-climatic. Surely a bright girl (Andrea) who knew the inner workings of Miranda Priestly's life could have come up with a more clever and classy way of terminating her relationship with her boss. The ending, like the beginning, was written in that annoying pseudo-sophisticated style found in many women's magazines."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"... and the sub-plots are somewhat cookie-cutter - but if you've ever had the World's Worst Job, working for the World's Most Obnoxious Boss - and strived valiantly to keep it because you're sure that at some point, some time, some way, it will all pay off... you'll be able to relate and get a few good giggles. I know I once worked for that boss, that company... just without the glamourous industry, without the fabulous perks, and for $10,000 a year less.I agree that the main character, Andrea, doesn't do a lot to generate sympathy for herself - but come on... she's fresh out of college, and anyone who's ever managed entry-level staff knows that dozens of personal phone calls and too-long coffee breaks are often par for the course.All in all, it was a fun read - not literary, not deep, not profound - but fun... and makes me wonder if I could have stayed a little longer at my truly wretched previous job if I'd at least gotten free Jimmy Choo's out of the deal..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is about a spoiled young woman with poor communication and decision-making skills who constantly complains about her insensitive employer's poor communication skills. There are some episodes where the writer builds some interesting conflict, but then the chapter ends and in the next chapter the essence of the conflict is long forgotten without any satisfying explanation of how it got resolved.Being a fashion-follower for decades, I was hungry for an inside look at the fashionistas. What a disappointment! I eagerly read the first few chapters. Half-way through I became dismayed, and then only skimmed the last half, uselessly hoping to find something worthy of my attention.If you have only enough money to buy one book, do not waste it on this vacuous story."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Just the title of this book made me buy it. This is the story of aspiring writer Andrea who wants to work for The New Yorker but gets her start as a lowly assistant at a Vogue type magazine for a psycho (aka &quot;Devil&quot;) boss. The tasks that the poor heronie is made to endure are way over the top but the author conveys them with some dark humor. Very much in the vein of the Nanny Diaries (without of course the sickening child neglect). This was a fun, quick read if you can handle reading about the demeaning treatment of another human being. It's really scary, but there are actually jobs out there like the one in the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoy a fun, mindless novel as much as the next chick (Good In Bed, Nanny Diaries, etc.) but this book was just plain awful. I found myself skipping ahead to see if anything interesting was going to happen but it just moved from one preposterous plot point to another with zero style or wit. The main character is such an annoying little brat that you start rooting for the &quot;devil&quot; (her boss). And one more thing: the spelling and grammar errors are just unforgivable. Wouldn't someone who is such an insider know how to spell supermodel Gisele's name? Or at least spell it one way consistently? I'll say it again: blech. If you still want to read it, I'm listing mine immediately on half.com."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a very light book. One cannot help but feel sympathy for Andrea. Many of us cannot help seeing glimpses of our own bosses in Miranda! This is like watching something on Cinematherapy; not very superior literature but at the same time pretty entertaining."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed this novel like I enjoy reading an US magazine while standing in line at the supermarket. I know it's not really good for me, and not making me a better person, but I have to look at it.The book, while redundant and choppy, was still entertaining. I really felt myself picking up speed towards the end - you just know from the very beginning that something HUGE will happen between Andrea and her boss. So the book is almost impossible to put down. I doubt it will be on any academic reading lists, but it was sure fun for a summer read. Good luck to her with her next book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I can't understand the hype around this book, nor can I really understand how it ever got published. The writing is simple and uninteresting, the plot is almost nil, and it's completely self-indulgent. I had much more sympathy for the mean boss Miranda Priestly. At least she was competent. There is no depth, no major style - the author uses big names to impress the reader rather than detailed, well-written descriptions of the clothes, parties, etc... A waste of money. I skimmed the last 50 pages to the predictable ending just so that I wouldn't feel like I threw $20 in the garbage."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I looked forward to reading this book. All of the hype made it sound like a fun summer read. THE BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!! The main character was contrived and all too stereotypical do-gooder.IT BORED ME TO DEATH!! If you liked the Nanny Diaries, you will hate this book!! It is the same plot only in the world of fashion instead of the world of an Upper East Side Mom.Worst money I EVER SPENT!!HORRIBLE BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I thought it would be a fun read, full of insider gossip about Vogue, but Andrea, the narrator, was one of the most unsympathetic characters in recent fiction. Andrea is pretentious and spoiled and I thought if she mentioned the New Yorker one more time I would slip into a coma. She complains about all the thin women at the magazine, but tells us over and over again how she is 5'10\\" and weighs 115 pound. I didn't feel sorry for Andrea, who is at the beck and call of an evil Anna Wintour-esque character. and horror of horrors, forced to get fattening food for her -- in fact, by the end I was skimming the book and was rooting for the boss. The Devil wears Prada is boring, self-indulgent and badly written. Save your $$$ and read something else."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this book. It made me laugh out loud numerous times and was extremely entertaining. I couldn't put it down because I could not wait to see what Miranda would do next. It's even funnier for those of us who have done time for people like her - yes, for all of you with doubts, they do exist!! The characters are very well-developed and the plot moves along quickly and smoothly. I have read some of the other reviews and think they're unnecessarily harsh with regard to the writing style. No it's not Shakespeare, but I don't think it was intended to be and it is written well. You will like the book if you are a fan of the Bridget Jones and Shopaholic type books. I'm eagerly awaiting another book by this author."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was eager for a fun, summer page-turner, but this book made me more bummed out than relaxed. The writing is terrible, and at the end, I felt a little dumber for having actually read the entire novel.While the story about working for a crazy boss was somewhat engaging, and something most people can probably relate to, the character of Miranda seemed to be the only fully thought out and realized persona. The author didn't seem to know where she was going or where she was taking her protagonist. The &quot;character development&quot; was Less Than, and the ending seemed extremely rushed. I won't spoil the ending for those who have yet to read it, but I'll just say that it was not very believable that these characters would be acting in this way.It just baffles me that a piece of writing that probably wouldn't even generate a passing grade in Freshman Creative Writing 101 would actually be published! Wow!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I can't believe I wasted my money on this...! My third-grade cousin is far more skilled at plot development than Weisberger will ever be....if you're really in the mood for an expose, just reread Nanny Diaries - trust me, it will be far more satisfying."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not thought provoking literature but I dont see what everyone is complaining about. It is supposed to be FUN. It was very fun to read, a guilty pleasure. The title alone told you that this book was major chick lit and not supposed to be intellectual. What is everyone complaining about??? I am an educated person and the grammer did not bother me one bit. A very good read. Highly recommend it espcially if you like fashion."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think we were supposed to hate the boss but frankly, the whinny, self-pitying narrator got most of my wrath. So she works for a hard boss, a lot of us do and with a lot less perks than this chick got...plus, she knew it was only for a year - big deal! Did she think that she didn't have to pay dues like the rest of the world? I work in the entertainment world and have worked for people like this and know that it's a means to an end - I didn't take it out on coworkers, friends and my work...and I didn't really enjoy reading about someone who does. My advice - don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have found over the years, if you give a book a low rating, you also get an abundance of \\"not helpful votes.\\" Such is life! In all honesty, I could not give this book any better rating than one star. By now readers have read the editorials and reviews from readers, and no doubt seen the movie. You know the story and how it revolves around the fashion industry, so I will spare you the long-winded, boring details again.For the life of me, it is difficult to understand why this book got such rave press reviews. It is nothing more than a shallow, cutesy little drama reminiscent of a low-rate, over-dramatized soap opera. On the positive side, the book will give you a few chuckles if you have a rather adolescent sense of humour. Miranda Priestly plays the role of the bitch and Andrea the whiney, demanding snot with her nose in the air. Nothing flowed together in this book, events just happened one after another without any real purpose. The plot, if you can call it that, was predictable and mundane. The best part of the book was the fact it finally ended, and the way it did came as no surprise either."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Yes, I'm a career military Soldier (male), and even though I was a little embarrassed to carry the book around, but I really enjoyed this light hearted comedy.Weisberger lays out a wonderful story about what it may be like to work for a boss who is almost like the devil. Most of us can relate to Miranda Priestly in one way or another, no matter career field you work.The antics that Andrea go through to please her boss are side splitting, while leaving the reader with a pang of pity for her.As time rolls on and Andy slowly lets her job and the devil take over her life, she finally realizes that she almost looses everything for the one thing that she thinks will give her a jump start on life is just the opposite. The ending is a little trite, but it will leave you with a simple good feeling that Andrea does not go down with the ship and her life ends up better for it.I'm not sure I'm a better person after reading this story, but it wasn't a total waste of time. Now I know more brand names than I care to say and I know some terms such as fashionistas, and hope that I never utter such words. So if you are looking for literature, look somewhere else, but for a quick simple absurd laugh this one lives up to its reputation. I haven't seen the movie, but the book is more than enough; no desire to see this in film."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I got this at the airport: 'nuff said. I was glued to it through two long flights and wasn't bored at all. No, it's not literature, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't have any deep messages. But that's not why you're reading a book called \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", is it? I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews!Andrea is an average college grad with an un-average first job. She thinks it will get her somewhere, but she blows it at the end. And yes, Miranda is right: Andrea's attitude sucks. But it is still fun to read about a crazy boss and her hilariously impossible demands. That's all."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The only reason this book was published is clearly because the author worked for a high-profile member of the publishing industry who has made a few enemies in her day. There is no other plausible excuse for the hype surrounding this endlessly whiny diatribe of a recent college graduate. Everything is overly dramatized by the main character, and everyone is an affronting menace. The main character lacks any complexity as she is continuously martyred by The Real World. Even the antics of the evil boss suffer due to the incessant \\"I am a such a victim!\\" tone of the book, a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting read that would have probably been addressed by peers in a beginner level writer's workshop. The cover art is fantastic, though."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Found the book interesting, fun and entertaining and that was good enough for me. Good view of the fashion/mag industry. Could relate to the lack of confidence displayed by the heroine as she was very young. You could read worse."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to explain something right off the bat.I read Confessions of a Shopaholic just before this book.I figured -anything- would fill me with joy after that waste of time.And, I was right. However, I was right for the wrong reasons.This book is not for everyone. But, even for the people it wasn't written for (ME), it will be an enjoyable read.I am not a label-whore, and I don't know my Prada from my Gap. This fact alone kept me from feeling that this novel was penned for me. There is a LOT of label whoring going on, and all of the enjoyment of that was missed out on by me.HOWEVER.This is a fun book. I can be critical, and I usually am, but I can't help but recommend this book. I didn't know that the author wrote from personal experience, but knowing that makes it even more worthwhile.The characters are well fleshed-out, which is something that is lacking in most other \\"chick-lit\\" books I've read. Yes, yes, the story is longer than it needs to be, but this isn't some grandiose novel...it's just right.Miranda, the extremely uptight and demanding boss, is obviously patterned after whoever Weisberger worked for, and drove me absolutely batty. But, that's the point. I've read comments that say that the ending is anti-climactic, but I quite enjoyed it.I don't want to get more into the plot, other than to say that you should read it. It isn't a perfect book, but good luck trying to find one of those.As an average, relatively poor woman, this book gave me a little bit of a thrill, being able to read about the rich and the glamorous.Read it. It's entertaining. It's quick. It's fun."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Wow! If I didn't know better I would have thought that \\"I\\" was Andrea. The book made me flashback to my younger days when I worked in NYC at Federated Department Stores Corporate Headquarters on 14th and Broadway. I moved to NYC from Maui, Hawaii and somehow landed my very first job in the fashion industry. I HAD NO IDEA what I had gotten myself into. From my first interview wearing a borrowed business suit (puffy sleeves and all) and cheap black heels I felt exactly as Andrea did in the book.I absolutely HATED my boss (and at least 98% of my coworkers). But, just like Andrea, I found myself transforming. Within a month or so my 20% discount at all Federated Stores was like gold and I wore nothing but Adrienne Vittadini and Versace. I remember the ridiculous demands, the late hours, the low pay, the hunger pains, and of course the fabulous looking, perfectly chiseled gay men.I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this book as much if I weren't familiar with the world of high fashion. Those people are looney! BUT, like Andrea, my fashion industry job was an unbelievable learning experience.I hated the ending. The ending was the only completely unrealistic part of the book. No one would put in that kind of hard time and give it up with a month to go. Not for a loser friend who brought her situation upon herself, and certainly not for her boring boyfriend.The world of fashion hardens you. If Andrea were a real person she would have either cursed Miranda out within the first couple of months, or seen it through to the end. I also don't understand why the author alludes that Andrea is somehow responsible for her friend's deterioration.All in all, sappy ending aside, if you've ever worked in or around the world of fashion, you'll relate to this book. Pull out those old company photos and throw darts at everyone. It'll be fun!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book, in my estimation, is a fun read. No, it's not Great American Literature, but whoever thought it was going to be is stupid and deserves to be disapointed. I was glued to what was going to come next (in reference to Andrea's relationship with her boss, Miranda), and it IS FULL OF JUICY GOSSIP. Those readers who are knowledgable about the fashion world will instantly catch on to who the author is alluding to in some of her characterizations, and those reader who don't know and don't care won't miss out on any crucial parts of the book.However, I do have a few pet peeves about this book -My biggest pet peeve is that the whole book works up your anger towards a character (i.e., Miranda Priestly), and then disappoints you with a less-than-satisfying conclusion. All through the book, I couldn't wait until Andrea finally told Miranda off - I expected at least a paragraph or two from Andrea detailing to Miranda exactly what she thought of her, and why. But no - Andrea sticks out a whole 11 months with Miranda, then quits and doesn't even do the reader justice with a good a_s-chewing.My second pet-peeve - Lauren obviously needs to take a trip down to some of the Southern states so she can cure her prejudice towards those who inhabit states below the Mason-Dixon line. I don't even live in the South, but I am still tempted to write her some scathing letters to her about her ENDLESS insults towards southern people. I guess in Lauren's world, a southern accent is connected to a small brain, and she continually calls Southern people &quot;hicks&quot;. It's funny that she does that, since she's the one who is showing her ignorance in those comments.My third pet-peeve is the parts about Andrea and her friends, Lily and Alex. I really could care less about those two - every time there was a part in the book about them, I was tempted to skip ahead. It was almost painful to have to read dialogue between them and Andrea - the author drags every conversation she has with them ON AND ON AND ON AND ON. And I'm sorry, but between Andrea's endless &quot;I don't understand what you're saying&quot; comments to Alex/Lily to her &quot;um. . . uh. . .&quot;'s when speaking to Miranda, Andrea comes off as a freaking idiot, and it kind of makes you understand why Miranda delights in tormenting her."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I do not recommend this novel, although it is interesting to skim the name-dropping about real people; the details about those real people are probably accurate, as they would not be protected by violation of privacy. Nonetheless, the novel seems mean-spirited. While the &quot;Devil,&quot; allegedly based in part on the author's former real-life boss Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, is a fascinating creature of arrogance and greed--and meaner than hell, maybe similarly to how some have described other &quot;famous women&quot; in real life--there isn't any depth to the novel. According to an interview with the author that I read on-line, Ms. Weisberger knows &quot;this isn't War and Peace,&quot; and has been surprised at all the &quot;buzz&quot; and about being called the new &quot;it&quot; writer. I don't think so. Cleverness and cuteness don't make for strong writing, no matter how many names one is able to drop."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book presents itself as a quick, stylish read. It's not. It contains many structural errors. The reader is expected to embrace one-dimensional characters. It plods along- same-old, same-old, to its weak, predictable ending. This story could have been written by a high school junior."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"You'd think a novel about a young woman working in the fashion industry would at least be glamorous, but after the first chapter it quickly became boring and whiney. The prose was leaden! Whoever told this woman she could write? Although it's obviously thinly-veiled autobiography and the narrator wants to be a writer, this book was full of such scintillating sentences as &quot;You're scared of me,&quot; he stated factually, flashing me a teasing smile. More Danielle Steele than Helen Fielding.But worse than that, there's almost no forward motion to this story. Once it's been established that she hates fashion and despises her shallow editor, what are we waiting for? I felt ahead of the story, uninterested in the main character and almost sympathetic to the boss from Hell. No particular character growth, no surprises, no startling sentences and no laughs. Yes, it sounded like a grueling job, but her reasons for staying were never convincing...other characters in the book are just as shallowly portrayed. She has a flirtation that leads nowhere, an impossibly saintly boyfriend, and a troubled roommate, all of whom seem to be right out of central casting from a Judith Krantz tv movie.I loved Bridget Jones and I read magazines and should have loved a story about a young Jewish girl who wants to write who falls into this job, but her attitude and self-involvement was a turn off. It took me a whole week to finish this and I wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't been asked to read it as a reader's corner reader for Elle. A trip to Paris began to make the book more interesting-- but then it, and the book, abruptly ended.Read THE NANNY DIARIES, HIGH MAINTENANCE or THE LOVELY BONES instead!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just got out of college and worked one year for a company which I thought treated its employees in the most servile way possible. Fortunately, I moved on for better things in life but the experience is unforgettable. 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a fun read but things were a bit too farfetched and the writing extremely redundant. For such a lengthy book, some chapters could have been dedicated to make the book a little insightful than repeating the atrocities of the boss over and over again."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a rollercoaster of a ride about the travails of Andrea Sachs, hired as assistant to Miranda Priestly, the impossibly demanding editor of Runway magazine. Andrea is by no stretch of the imagination a fashionista, so one does wonder a) how she got the job, and b) why she doesn't ever seem to realise that if the job is hateful it's because it's so obviously the wrong job for her. The idea that she would see such a post only as a stepping stone to working for the New Yorker undermines her moral indignation at Miranda's behavior - Andrea is using Runway so why shouldn't Runway use her? Plus, if one accepts a job of that kind - which many women would die for - you have to accept that there's going to be far more rough than smooth. Having said that, the ancedotes about Miranda are fairly outrageous (though I expected her to be far more ghastly than she actually was), and there are many insider's nuggets for those of us who are interested in the New York fashion scene. I don't think it's a great book by any means, largely because the author is clearly just getting an unpleasant experience off her chest rather than setting out to write a great novel with a great plot (there's very little plot). But I'm sure the film will be very entertaining and the book has certainly made me want to see it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"A few points that this author should take note:- no need to go into excruciating detail about every single thing just to up your word count.- not everyone from the south is an inbred hick, and not all southerners talk like idiots.this book was OK. I'm reading it because the movie looked good, and I'm betting it's going to be one of the rare times the movie is better than the book... Of course, Weisberger gets her money either way. I probably would have stopped reading long ago if it weren't for the movie, though."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"So I'm not ashamed that I wanted to find out about life at Vogue: the good, but especially the bad (!). However, this book made me feel like weak and depressed. Either you think Lauren is great and side with her against the monstrous AW, or you think Lauren can't write very well and probably deserved to be sent on meaningless errands. I fall into the latter category. There are some funny bits in the book but overall it was a little tiresome."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"And there was I naively thinking that a person would need to have a modicum of talent to get published. Apparently not - a fact illustrated by the fact that \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was not only published but also was on a best sellers list. I am stunned!I have never written a review on a book before but this book was so very, very bad, so DIRE, that I feel compelled to try to prevent others from wasting their time in reading it.I rented this book on audio tape from the library so that I would have something to listen to while I painted my house. The only thing that kept me listening until the end was a kind of morbid fascination determined to see if it could really get any worse. In this one respect the book does not disappoint. It doesn't necessarily get any worse, but it does stay just as bad. Thank goodness I did not spend any money on purchasing it.Let's get this straight. The whole story is extremely poorly written, is completely missing a plot, repeats itself endlessly, and contradicts itself in quite a few places too. One of the most completely implausible ideas was that Andrea would get a job writing for the New Yorker after being an assistant for one year. It's so insulting to the reader's intelligence to imagine that this inarticulate girl, who can't utter a sentence that doesn't sound like it's from the mouth of an adolescent valley girl, would get a job as a writer!Miranda's character would have been slightly more credible if an effort had been made to make her just a tiny bit more realistic. I'm not saying there are not people like her, what I am saying is that they do not have more power and influence than the President of the United States which is what the book would have you believe.This story is written with a definite target audience in mind. I'm pleased to discover that I am clearly not one for whom this book was intended. If you like chick-lit then I suggest reading an author who writes with talent and humor, like Miriam Keyes."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"YEAH, I heard such good things about 'Devil Wears Prada', but it's a completely plot-less book. If you have a boss that you absolutely hate then you may get a kick out of it. The basic gist of the story is a day-to-day recount of this woman's workday - she works as a personal assistant for an editor-in-chief of some fashion mag. in NYC. Apparently the author went through the same thing for 1 year of her life when she worked as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of Vogue. So this is somewhat autobiographical. You think that would be intriguing, but it's really not. Just a day to day spiel of how mean the boss is and how much she hates her job and they name drop top brand labels in every other paragraph. blah blah blah. No twist in the story, no story really.

Andrea's job as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor of the glam fashion magazine Runway, is just familiar enough to anyone who has ever had a corporate/office-type job to be real, but extreme and over-the-top enough to keep the reader riveted to the page, in a &quot;oh my god, I can't believe anyone would ever &lt;i>act&lt;/i> this way&quot; haze. It's a haze made all the stronger by the fact that the character of Miranda Priestly is based on a real person, Anna Wintour of Vogue. Miranda's antics are so appallingly mesmerizing that you don't even dislike Andrea for being a wimp and putting up with it -- like Andrea, we can only go along for the ride in a sort of dazed amazement. But the moment at the end of the novel when Andrea finally tells Miranda off was deeply satisfying.The one thing that annoyed me -- and it annoyed me quite a bit -- was the unnecessary yet repeated bashing of the South and of Southerners. From the beginning, where Andrea makes fun of her Texan brother-in-law's accent, to the middle, where she mocks the Southerners Miranda invited to her brother's engagement party for being hicks, to the end, when she's packing to go to Paris and just can't help herself from making one last dig about &quot;cowgirl chic&quot; and how cowgirls are obviously not chic, even though this really has nothing to do with anything that's going on in the plot -- throughout the novel, this elitist, &quot;anybody who's not from New York City isn't worth knowing&quot; attitude pervades the book, and really undercuts Andrea's position as the sympathetic Everywoman we're supposed to be rooting for.Even so, this was a fun, poolside read, the perfect guilty pleasure for summertime!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil is not good. The editing is almost as bad as the writing, which is repetitive, ungrammatical, flat. Fashionistas, by Lynn Messina, is better if you want a similar millieu, and the Nanny Diaries is a million times better if you want an assistant revenge saga. So why is The Devil striking a chord? Beats me, but here are two silver linings among the mostly clouds:- our heroine does come across as authentically clueless, which makes her wide-eyed education in the fashion world easy to relate to - who among us, after all, is an insider in the fasion world? This book may be inept, but it isn't a cynical, machine-tooled marketing ploy. It's authentically inept.- Anna Wintour must be a helluva woman, because Miranda Priestly is a helluva character. Totally hell on wheels in a way that's believable and yet distinctive: she's a crazy tyrant whose mad whimsy believably ruins the lives of her underlings, and yet also plausibly scares them into doing their best on the job. I don't know Wintour, of course, but I assume, after reading this, that if you want to know what she is like, you don't need to wait for the biography. Weisberger's depicted a fascinating character, and I can't imagine she has the chops to invent such a person.- everyone's had a horrible job once, and so there's something to the gimmick of I-had-the-worst-job-ever.One thing that is particularly not good about the book: the heroine is no fun at all. She's so sure she's ready for the New Yorker, and accordingly entitled to kid gloves at work, but there's no indication that she's competent or likable, except for the laughable stock figures of the working class who pop up in the novel to tell her how great and humane she is."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The idea of this book had a lot of promise; who hasn't had a tyrant of a boss who they've wanted to tell off? And knowing that the author once worked for Vogue, the story kept you guessing as to which vignettes were based on real-life incidents. However, once you got past the idea of this being a \\"tell-all\\" (which the author claims it isn't), there wasn't much of a story. The \\"heroine\\" was whiny, and really didn't give us much insight as to why she'd deal with Miranda. Sure, she wanted to be a writer, but she worked in NYC, the publishing capital! Surely, there had to be some other apprenticeship out there to help her hone her skills. Plus, once she did land her dream job at New York, who was to say that she'd even have the skills to keep it - especially when her Runway stint was doing nothing to broaden her writing.What also bothered me was the characterization of Miranda. She was just too one-dimensional. We saw glimpses of the other facets of the editor, especially when she was dealing with her kids. What made her such a bitch? Why did she turn away from her Jewish roots? What was her relationship with her daughters like? I really wanted these questions answered and they weren't.Finally, the story meandered (or should that be \\"Miranda-ed\\") a bit too much. Whatever happened with the dog who Andie was transporting at the beginning? What was up with her and Christian? And the \\"payoff\\" really wasn't much of a payoff. You at least wanted to see some blood shed.(...)On a separate note, may I suggest Christine Baranksi as Miranda if this does in fact get made into a movie?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book to see what the fuss was about and if it was indeed as good as other chicklit books.It isn't.The ending is more predictable than an episode of Friends.

It's just a waste of time and paper."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Lauren Weisberger takes you on an unbelievable ride! My heart rate went up everytime I picked the book up and I couldn't wait to see what she had to do next. This book is great for anyone who has ever been an assistant for a difficult boss. I thought the writing was a bit choppy at first, but once I started reading I got into the style."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a very interesting novel----light reading. I did not noticed the grammatical mistakes and other errors that supposedly repelled other people, and I am an English teacher! This is the perfect book to read at the beach or when waiting for a plane. Written in the same vein as Nanny Diaries and covers much of the same (interesting to me) territory. We can all relate to people at work who are completely horrendous and demanding. The only thing I didn't like was that some characters, like Christian, were not fully developed or well-rounded. I was always waiting for some climactic incident that never came."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this was a fascinating look at how someone who generates lots of revenue is permitted unfettered power over underlings. It sheds light on not only the inner workings of VOGUE, but I suspect Enron, etc. Miranda/Anna can do whatever she wants to anyone because of her ability to generate income for Conde-Nast and all those who depend on Vogue for sales. The &quot;rules&quot; of common decency don't apply to her, either by her own or anyone else's standards because everyone depends on her for money. (I am asuming the book pretty much accurately portrays the authors's experience working for Anna Wintaur at Vogue). More of these kinds of books should be written. Maybe it would serve the salutory effect of curbing the excesses of executives when neither they nor their employer does so."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I devoured Devil in one day. Despite the book being too long (some parts seemed to drag on), I actually enjoyed Weisberger's debut and feel that it was on par with The Nanny Diaries. Even though the ending was predictable, it is more interesting than the ending of \\"Diaries\\"- which I think was a major flaw in that book. Overall a fun summer read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although at times a humorous read, I completed the book really not liking the main character in the least.She reminded me tremendously of the stereotypical, spoiled, JAP, sorority girl who transfers to formally impressive Cornell so she's able to say she's graduated from the Ivy League, whines her way into a potentially fabulous job in fashion that people \\"would kill for\\" and then takes her vitriol and writes a book courtesy of probably one of the contacts she made in said job during her year of hell. We call that bad form.Having been in the industry for over a decade, I found Andrea Sachs' character unrefreshingly familiar: conflicted over her \\"deprived\\" lot in life, kind to the homeless not so much out of guilt but more out of her desire to potentially hurt her employer, conflicted over her selection of potential mate, conflicted over her choice of roommates, conflicted over free designer clothing and free trips to Paris.Where did theses ungrateful brats come from? When was everyone born with such a sense of privelege?When I joined the great world of fashion, entry level people behaved in a manner that was tantamount to the postulants of Vatican One. Look it up if you can't remember what that was like.I truly hope Lauren Whineberger's attempt at a roman a clef is more contrivance than anything else. Quite honestly, I didn't find Miranda Priestley's behavior all that bad.I've seen and acted much worse."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"a lot of hype, not even close.poorly written, bad plot, uninteresting characters.overall, save your money."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andy is a really smart girl from kinda rich CT who moves into NYC to start her career as a journalist/ editor. She ends up interviewing for an editor's assistant position in Manhattan... but in a FASHION magazine. Andy HATES fashion and deems it completely beneath her and her brain. We watch her go from a mousy, scruffy, completely unfashionable girl to a sultry, high priced, and over extended assistant. She only has to stay with the job for ONE YEAR, then Miranda (her boss) will write a letter of recommendation to ANY MAGAZINE Andy wishes to work for. It is widely known, thoughout the publishing world, that Miranda is the most high powered, demanding boss in the entire world. (some nights she even calls Andy out of her slumber at 2:30am to schedule an earlier flight - by 15 minutes!- because she can't STAND to wait a moment more)Andy is wearing the trends and doing the \\"high fashion\\" thing of planning and attending national events and whatnot- just to pass the time and earn her marks of Miranda's approval. She's trying to keep her brain in tact, but finds that she kind of... dare I say... LIKES the fashion industry.Andy is trying not to shed her smart skin in exchange for the submissively enhanced skin that the assistants at the magazine wear. She's trying to keep her composure while being stepped on countless times by the woman who holds Andy's future in the palm of her hand. One wrong move, and Miranda can stop all of her journalistic future in one snap of her tiny, manicured hand.This book is perfection! A little emotion, a little determination, fashion sense, crazy boss, \\"what do I do now?\\", and strength.This book makes me miss NYC, want to strap on my Marc Jacobs' imposters and strut down Main Street with an air of confidence!If I need a boost of motivation, this is the book I pick up and read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was so excited to read this book, as I love this type of writing.

Do they only poll the shallow and self-absorbed? The book has a plot, which earns it two stars. It is fraught with loose ends, no resolution for some of the main characters, and a one dimensional heroine who'd like to believe she's two dimensional.

This is not great, meaningful literature, and the fact Lauren Weisberger is a new writer is abundantly clear. However, if you accept that this book is meant to be entertaining and gossipy, placed in a setting where intellectuals do not abound, you will find it quite fun.The main character, Amanda, accepts a job at a fasion magazine primarily because she is just out of school, she needs a job, and has no ambition beyond wanting to work for The New Yorker some day. Miranda, her boss, is a caricature of all the horrible bosses you have ever had or heard about. Amanda's co-workers live in fear of Miranda, but have also taken on some of Miranda's worst characteristics, yielding what little power they have maliciously.Much of the structure of the book is around boundaries. This is Amanda's first job, and she does not know how to set boundaries between her work and personal life. Her boss has no boundaries between herself and her underlings. Amanda and her college boy friend struggle to redefine themselves as a couple in an adult world, while Amanda's best friend slips over the line of partying into alcoholism.Certainly, some of the characters are shallow and the action is contrived.

It is painful to read, especially if you are used to reading real books. This doesn't even qualify as something I'd line the cat's litter pan with. The writing is just plain awful and irredeemably tedious. There is no way this book could have been saved once she committed pen to paper. I must admit that I made it through only one and a half chapters before I tossed it across the room. My only regret is that the author wasn't there when it landed. Don't go anywhere near this one unless you have a death wish for the author.

Not only are the characters one dimensional, but the writing is terrible.Now at page 88, I am making the decision to throw this book in the trash, to express my disgust. After all, there is no sense in wasting my time in addition to my money.What pushed me over the edge, you ask? The following paragraph:\\"I finally freed (the cell phone) from a tangle of underwear at the bottom of the bag and flopped backward on the bed. The little screen announced immediately that I had no service at that point, and I knew immediately, instinctively that she (her boss) had called and it had gone directly to voice mail. I hated that cell phone with my entire soul. I even hated my new home phone by this point. I hated Lily's phone, commercials of phones, pictures of phones in magazines and I even hated Alexander Graham Bell.\\"My question is: Has anyone edited this???It makes me cringe to know that this novel was on the New York Times bestseller list for six month. It is very scary to think that anyone out there would be satisfied with this dismal quality."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I think most reviewers missed the bigger picture of this book, which, unlike the movie, goes well beyond the specific topic of the fashion industry. Anyone who has ever had a nightmare supervisor, or has ever stayed with something for way too long without knowing why, will identify. One reviewer felt there was a lack of transition from disaster to disaster; maybe so, but that actually adds to the reality of a situation in which there is no logic: the boss from hell is always unpredictable and the reasons one stays in hell never make sense. I liked Andrea Sachs and empathized with the complete nonsense with which she chose to deal, over and over with no apparent way out. Besides that, the book was a good laugh. One a million authors for sure wish they had written! And because of the breadth of the book, I'm sorry, I know I am in the minority on this, but: its MUCH better than the movie!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Don't look for haute art when you buy this book where haute couture takes center stage.

Guys will be bored to death."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book has a lot of interesting albeit unoriginal ideas (work-life conflicting with home-life, mean boss and unfulfilling job, seemingly perfect love-life rent asunder by mysterious-but-attractive new hunk, etc.), but the trouble with this story is that the author fails terribly in making it very enjoyable to read. This is probably because, as others have pointed out in no uncertain terms, that the protagonist in this story (obviously meant to be a stand-in for the author herself) is thorougly unlikable. The main character is petty, self-righteous, snobby, and over-priviledged. If Andrea Sach's coworkers dislike her, it's probably because the author makes it so obvious that Andrea believes herself to be \\"above her job.\\" The main character has such a low opinion of her coworkers and such a correspondingly (and unjustified, I might add) high opinion of herself that it's no wonder she has no fun at her job. The Sach's character seemed to think she could just leap out of college and into her \\"dream job\\" of working at New Yorker Magazine (by what merit, is never explained) without busting her hump for a few years and slogging it out in the trenches of penal servitude. Seeing as how her character has had a silver spoon in her mouth since day 1, it's understandable why she refuses to pay her dues like all the people she looks down on.Because the main character is so completely unlikable, it also makes the so-called payoff at the end of the story less satisfying than it could have been had the main character gained the sympathy of readers. The sudden, \\"unexpected\\" (yet predictable) twist of good fortune at the end of the story will have the reader saying \\"wow, that's great for you, Andrea -- NOT\\" because this character is unjustly vindicated for her lifetime of sloth, snobbishness, racism (yes, Racism), and self-entitlement. It would have been far more entertaining if she had her nose shoved in the mud, or her boyfriend dumped her for Emily, or her roommate revealed that SHE got a job at the New Yorker, or Andrea's parents admitted that she was adopted and not at all Jewish but was instead a Hindu and thus shouldn't have been on such a high horse with her former Indian roommates. There was so much about this book that could have been interesting, but the author lacks the talent at this point (and I add without an ounce of malice or envy that the author probably NEVER will have the talent, either) in her career to do anything with it. The secondary characters are useless plot devices and are underdeveloped. Thus, the reader cannot care about them. The only character we see developed is Andrea Sachs, and she is unpleasant. Miranda Priestly was actually more comically demonic than realistically mean. She is thus not believable because the reasons for her behavior are never explained. If we got into her head more it could have been entertaining to see how Andrea and she come from different worlds. Instead, all we see is that Andrea is a huge snob and poser-intellectual and thus is fully qualified to work for Runway. She ought to leave The New Yorker for real talent.And one more thing -- namedropping: Wiesberger should know it doesn't impress anyone, except for the person talking."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Paint-by-the-numbers plot that reads like a third-rate gossip column stretched out over a couple hundred pages; a bland, boring protagonist who's a thinly disguised stand-in for the author herself; two-dimensional characterizations; and trite plot \\"twists\\" that don't surprise anyone: this novel manages to hit every trendy bar on its way down the Bad Novel Cliche Street.And most irritating of all (to me, anyway), the arbitrary dismissal of anyone from below the Mason-Dixon as an ignorant, tacky, stupid redneck with an unintelligible accent and no fashion sense (despite the fact that her insipid heroine is supposed to be an aspiring writer for \\"The New Yorker\\" and therefore above such trivial concerns as fashion)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I saw a television show that raved about this book alongside the Dirty Girls Social Club.

And you can't help feeling that the spitting happened only Weisberger doesn't want to own up to such appalling behaviour while she's trying to paint her employer as the devil incarnate to her 'cutie-pie, caring-sharing' alter-ego. Every task is too demeaning for Andrea. We never really find out what fabulous qualities she has which allow her to consider all work beneath her, apart from an extraordinarily high self-regard. Washing dishes was a no no, even if it was just one plate, but faking expenses (lots of them, every day) was OK by her. Revenge on the company that expected her to actually work for her pay is the name of the game. In an attempt to gain our sympathy Weisberger explains just how tough it was to get up every day at 5:30 in order to get in at 7:00. But that sob story soon palls when she reveals that her commute was a whole 10 minutes (thanks to a company sponsered taxi ride, which she regularly rorted). So why the 5:30 alarm? Because it was half an hour before she was actually out of bed and an hour was needed to try on and reject outfits. Organizational skills are obviously not Ms. Weisberger's strong point, which may explain why she wasn't the most appreciated employee chez Vogue (alias Runway). The main character of this novel is so unsympathetic that the whole premise of the book is undermined. It's not the boss from hell that grabs your attention as you make your way through this long whine, it is the staffer from hell. A warning to all employers.

Hired as Priestly's assistant, the job \\"millions of girls would die for\\", Andrea's life takes a huge turn for the worst working for the boss from hell.For anyone obsessed with the trendy, glamorous world of fashion and New York City, the book gives great details of famous designers, restaurants, places to socialize, what is in, and so on. Each detail of Andrea and Miranda's wardrobe is brilliantly described, down to the color of their Manolo's. We read of Andrea desperately trying to locate Karl Lagerfeld, dry cleaning a $40,000 Chanel dress, wrapping thousands of dollars of Christmas presents...But, the fun stops there. Without the great descriptions of the fast-paced world of fashion, there is little to work with. Other than the great displays of hellish terror from Miranda, the characters are flat and predictable, the plot elementary, and the ending a yawn. I would be more inclined to recommend The Nanny Diaries for this type of book, where the writing is much more advanced and interesting."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although I'd been warned that this book was insipid garbage, I decided to pick up a copy of the audio book to help me endure a six hour drive. I love a good, trashy novel from time to time, so it seemed like a reasonable purchase. Unfortunately, the trashy factor could not compensate for the mediocre writing and bland one-note characters. Both Andrea (our banal, unsympathetic heroine) and Miranda (our tiresome, one-dimensional villainess) are underdeveloped and lack any sort of emotional complexity. As a reader, I should have been happy that Andrea, the underdog, gets her absurd and highly implausible happy ending, but instead, I was just happy to have her shut up already.As for Rachel Leigh Cook's reading of this novel, well, it just isn't a great fit. RLC's Minnesota accent does little to convince me that we're listening to the first person narrative of a Jewish girl educated at Brown. (Though, certainly, some of this could have been a problem inherent in the writing. I certainly didn't believe the character had been on so much as a college visit to Providence.) Anyway, as for RLC, her meandering narrative style might be charming in another context, but it's wrong for this book.The subject matter of this book has limitless potential, and this should have been a fun and funny read. What a terrific opportunity to skewer the fashion/magazine industry! And what a disappointment that it doesn't deliver."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book was entertaining with a great storyline.

Ms. Weisberger's depiction of Anrdrea's struggle at Runway was pretty spot-on. Her personal life was not as well created, but the \\"job\\" parts were horrifyingly accurate and well-done. I had wonderful experiences there that are another story, but I also had the craziest jobs you can imagine. A variety of instances: I had to make sure that the wife didn't know that the mistress was in the building, I had to find an important man on a flight from LA, when no one knew which flight he had taken (Airlines won't release the passenger lists), one of my bosses threw a full three inch three ring binder at the wall over my head, someone put laxatives in the coffee of a particulary nasty boss, on one interview for TV as an admistrative assistant, I was told I was entirely too friendly and open and \\"Was I from the midwest?\\" -- I was so anxiety ridden at one job, I couldn't swallow my lunch and to this day I don't like going out for lunch.The author captured the feeling of being in that position extremely well, because she's been there.The lure of the famous and the beautiful can be strong when a young person is trying to find their place in the world. This book portrayed that struggle. I think everyone who works goes through a time when they have to figure out how much they will put up with and how much they will compromise themselves. It's scary and you can get lost. I did not like the ending though, because it was weak compared to the strong writing about the lure of \\"success.\\" If you see really beautiful clothing and furnishing and homes, it tempts you and you can start to want it. I wish the author had made more of an attempt to develop Andrea's character other than at the job.

Needless to say I was disappointed with the movie but absolutely loved the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ms. Weisberger's vaguely autobiographical novel is a deliciously funny tale of The Boss From Hell....yet it's very unfunny because it's (a) true and (b) bosses like this continue to thrive in the business world and victimize others.Still, the author manages to do what we'd all love to do: expose the evil, get famous, and make a lot of money doing it.

Does one want to be famous or INfamous?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is a funny look at a young girl's experience working for a nightmare boss. It is even funnier than the movie and a quick read. I'd recommend it as a good book to toss in your beach bag!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Seeking entry into the magazine world, Andrea Sachs is thrilled to land a position as assistant to Miranda Priestly, editor of \\"Runway\\" fashion magazine. But all too quickly, Andrea realizes that working for someone like Miranda is the equivalent of indentured servitude. No request is too small -- or too ridiculous -- for Miranda to make, from tracking down a yet-unreleased Harry Potter book for her twin daughters to ordering $100 steak lunches that Miranda may or may not show up to eat.As the months pass, Andrea's job begins to cost her her family, friends, and boyfriend -- not to mention her own sanity. It becomes increasingly obvious what Andrea must do; and yet, she is somehow unwilling to give up and admit defeat.While Weisberger has taken on a comedic tone in relating poor Andrea's plight, the underlying messages are serious. Too many people, eager to climb the proverbial ladder of success, refuse to consider what it may cost them."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I liked the basis to which this book was written. However, if you are going to make the main character appear to be a naive girl who is not akin to the bustling world of the fashion industry - one who has a dream of becoming a big time writer for a newspaper, why does she have to swear all the time. I simply thought all of the swearing was unnecessary and detracted from how good the book could have been."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Perhaps its because Anne Hathaway will be playing the role of Andrea, or perhaps Ms. Hathaway is playing the role because Andrea and Princess Mia are very similar. Either way, the book similar to the Princess Diaries due to the fact that a individualistic person is fighting against a transformation process. It was a bit shallow, dragged a bit, but generally it was OK. I might read it again as a quick read or suggest it to a pre-teen/teenage girl. It wasn't terrible, wasn't my favorite, but was an enjoyable way to pass a few hours on a Saturday."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Like others here, I picked up this book because I wanted to read it prior to seeing the film. Also, I enjoyed the Nanny Diaries and thought I might enjoy this book as well.I had some pretty demanding bosses in my secretarial career. I recall being paged at a bar one evening by an angry employer who was incensed that he had missed his daughter's something-or-other, because I hadn't told him his wife called earlier that day. (Nevermind that I hadn't spoken with her -- the receptionist had taken the call.) Or how about the one who didn't talk to me for two days because instead of putting his letter in the mail at 7 pm that night, I dropped it off at the post office the next morning.Because of my personal experiences, I thought I would identify with the character Andy more than I actually did. I agree with another reviewer (an employer) that her sense of entitlement was off-putting -- in fact, boss Miranda wasn't too far off the mark in her assessment of Andy's attitude near the end. Andy seemed to become jaded much too quickly -- in reality, I think it takes a couple years before a person would get to the point where they feel justified in basically stealing from the company, if ever. Perhaps the author was just trying to convey Andy's immaturity.My other complaint would be the choppiness of the book. The author starts in the middle of the story and then goes back in time, which I found odd. When I got to the end, I had to go back to the beginning and re-read the first chapter, since I thought they were supposed to tie in together somehow.Unless you're really into fashion, I would skip this book and read the Nanny Diaries instead. It has just as much fun skewering the crazy wealthy but does it with better character development and better writing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I agree with a sentiment previously expressed: How could Andrea look herself in the mirror every morning as she basically whored her self-respect out to her boss, yet when a young, eligible, handsome guy who has obviously caught her fancy comes along, she not only won't do anything with him on principal (she still has principals at this point?), nor will she ask him or his obviously-interested publisher for help? One would have thought them equally viable references to the publishers at The New Yorker. I kept waiting for one or both of those men to come back into the picture, for Andrea to send Miranda a signed copy of The New Yorker where her revolutionary articles are published, only to have her settle for something less.It's a good read, it's light and fluffy, and not too taxing. It's also pretty darn entertaining, but don't expect any motivating revelations into your own psyche.I am excited for the movie, though. I kept imagining the excellent Meryl Streep in Miranda's role, and it was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I'm the type of person when i start a book i finish, well this is one book i can't finish. It is just so boring, nothing exciting happens, its not as funny as i thought it would be. I think we get it by the first page Andy has a horrible boss, did you need to write a book saying pretty much the say thing through out the whole freaking book. It was horrible, it was a waste of a good 5 bucks. I'm not to happy."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book (yes, the WHOLE THING), just hoping to get to the plot. Even in the end, none of the shallow characters became triumphant or victorious in any of the struggles they experienced during the whole story. Sorry if I \\"spoiled\\" it for you...The book had a great beginning, but telling the whole story proved to be the author's weak point.Skip this one..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"What happens when a young, sheltered, suburban narcissist goes to work for an older, celebrated, cosmopolitan narcissist? A better writer with more capacity for introspection could have perhaps described a certain, interesting, coming-of-age. Instead, we are subjected to a tedious account of all the blows to the ego that the author had suffered from the hands of her previous employer. The beginning of the book establishes the basic conflict between Andy, the unusually normal, beautiful, talented, idealistic, kind and sensitive protagonist, on the one hand, and Miranda, the bitter, rude, materialistic,impatient, sarcastic and self-centered employee on the other. The rest is a repetition of that very shallow theme: the idealized self and the villified other. Nothing in the portrait of Andy (who, despite claiming that she is not interested in high couture drops designer names like any other fashionista; who, despite attempting to establish her moral superiority over Miranda, unabashedly steals from and exploits her employers; and who never outgrows her self-entitled immaturity), nothing in the depiction of the secondary characters (one-dimensional caricatures) and nothing in the embarassingly bad writing redeem this book.Ms. Weinberger would have done better to save us the agony of listening to her rantings and to have found herself a good therapist instead."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had high hopes about this book after watching the movie, but was terribly disappointed. Andy was not the smart, good-hearted person she is in the movie. She was a whiny, obnoxious, shallow-minded woman who I found difficult to like. Not only was her character disappointing, but so was the intriguing personality of Miranda. The fabulous interplay between Andy and Miranda is almost non-existent and only really hinted at. The story line is also totally different. That in itself wouldn't be a problem if the original book was at least mildly interesting. The writing was not well done and it amazes me this ever went from lit. agent to publisher. The best thing I can say is that I love the title. Whoever did the adaptation of the book to the movie should be applauded because it seems the old maxim is wrong: you can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read this book a few years ago. It was horrible. The characters uninteresting, the plot boring and the writing unbelievably terrible at best. When I heard that it was a movie with Meryl Streep, I thought that maybe they changed something and made the movie great. But it was just as terrible as the book. Don't waste your time or money, find something else!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I felt like I was reading the first draft of a novel that had potential. The book starts with some random middle scene that you keep waiting to get back to at some point while your reading, but never do. Any scene that would provide some real character development is told as an afterthought so you are left not really caring about any of the characters, including the narrator who seems like a friend of a friend who is telling you outrageous stories about her crazy boss. You really have no idea if this girl has any credibility at all, but you enjoy her gossip until you are just so sick of it you want to shake her and say, \\"so quit already\\". And right around that point (when you are well into the second half of the book) a real plot actually starts to develop.The book is very episodic and disjointed, going back and forth in time for no other reason then to rush through the scenes that would really help drive the plot and make you know the characters. I don't think I've ever read a book where I cared any less about what happened to the main character, and the only character that really intrigued me was the senior assistant, Emily, whom our main character never really lets us know because she is too arrogant to think Emily may be more than just a Miranda groupie. I found myself siding with Emily when she would tell Andrea just to quit instead of complaining. I couldn't quite understand why one year as a personal assistant for an insane woman in a powerful position (who might fire you at any time) would put Andrea closer to her goal than a few years as an editorial assistant at any other magazine, where she would actually get to do some writing or editing. Especially since she isn't trying to make a good impression. She feels inconvenienced when she can't make her personal calls and thinks nothing of using company money for personal expenses (which seems to be the trend at this particular company). I was hoping that we would understand why she was doing this, but because we never really got to know her it was hard to tell if she was just a spoiled brat, or becoming jaded by the environment, or if she really felt like she had no choice because she had no life outside of that place.Just as the blurb says, this book is gossipy, which makes it fun to a point, but I think Weisberger could have reworked the book to make it more plot driven and less tedious."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I loved this novel.Who knows? Maybe we jaded metropolitan garbage warriors share a common outlook. That's the only point at which Andrea and myself intersect, other than being women. This narrating character--who is intelligent and mentally goofy all at the same time--is my polar oppoite, and yet I get her. I get the post-college graduation ramblings and shock at being thrown into the frozen shark pond (perhaps the sharks wear Uggs or something) of the professional world. The scary thing is I look around at my peers, and I remember the women I went to college with, and I think cripes! Andrea is real!I never would have read this book if it hadn't been suggested to me, because I don't give a tinker's fink about high fashion. But I am tuned into the media enough to know something about modern cultural literacy, as frothy as it might be. So I knew what Prada was--and that it was a thousand times more expensive than a kidney transplant. Having read the book, I like high fashion even less, but I did have many laughs reading this subtle set-up of the industry.Er...everyone got that this was the whole fashion smashin' gone way over the top, right? These were characters blown up and out of proportion in order to turn the offices of Runway Magazine into a three-ring circus sideshow of freaks. In real life, Miranda Priestly wouldn't \\"have it all\\" so perfectly, the staffers wouldn't have impossible proportions and weights, Andrea would never have been hired, and nobody would get catapulted to a high position after a year as a personal assitant (as opposed to an editorial assistant). It's a fantasy full of famous names, and that's what makes it fun."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The pleasure in reading The Devil Wears Prada derives largely from the sure knowledge that we ourselves have never behaved so despicably as Miranda Priestly. This book gives the average shlub unparalleled opportunities to look down on the svelte queens of fashion from moral high ground. From that standpoint, and for an inside look at the fashion magazine workplace, it's loads of fun. It's a lightweight read with a quick pace."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"It absolutely is! It has quite a dramatic, almost painful humor. Quite simply, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is an extremely well-written parody of bosses-from-hell with perfect comedic timing. I'd say even the ending was pretty good on this one.I rarely read books twice, but I did read this one twice and enjoyed it just as much the second time around if not more.Even if you're not a big chick lit fan, you may enjoy this book (and it may turn you into a fan of this genre)."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and for the first half or so, did, because I was so eagerly anticipating the point in the story where something would actually DEVELOP- alas, nothing ever did.I was looking for some McReading for my island vacation and picked this up at the airport. Early into the book, I found myself telling my husband that while the writing was pretty poor, the author was a good storyteller, to which he responded that that is how romance novelists are commonly described. What I meant to say, I suppose, it that she was good at listing a sequence of events- either that she had a great memory, or put some of those note-taking skills to good use. In fact, this was not actually a work of fiction, not a novel, but read more like a diary: &quot;5/9- Work sucked again today. 5/10- Boss still impossible. 5/11- Oh, I'm so miserable. (But I won't do anything about it.)&quot;Honestly, I couldn't have lasted 5 minutes with a boss like that, so I just couldn't understand how the &quot;character&quot; could complain so much about her situation but never act to change it. For all the chutzpah she seemed to think she possessed, she continued to allow her boss to perceive her as pathetic and weak. And it was pretty sad that after 11 months of torture she went out like a total sucker with absolutely nothing to show for it. Considering how witty and glib the character makes herself out to be for the most part, I couldn't believe that's the way she let her tenure end. It kind of reminds me of the way I quit my job at the pizza place when I was 19.But that's OK- it did entertain me on my trip, and as this is the first review I've ever posted, it evidently made me think.I did find it interesting for the bit of insight it afforded into the fashion world- I live in NYC and can tell you that this is a part of the city few people notice or care about."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Although I swore I would never pick up another &quot;average girl trying to find/marry Mr Right while balancing her career and dealing with quirky friends&quot; book, I read this one. At first I found it entertaining - an inside look at the ultra chic, fashionista world - the self-absorbed, demanding boss, etc. More than halfway through, however, I was sick of the heroine's &quot;poor me&quot; simpering and only kept reading to see if she would devlop a backbone (but by the end, I really didn't care anymore). Overall its a mildly entertaining beach-type book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Ms. Weisberger has written a fantastic read assailing her former boss, Anna Wintour of Vogue, sometimes known as Nuclear Wintour. Or did she? The HarperCollins lawyers obviously take this as a work of fiction but no one else would. Why else call Wintour by name for no reason near the end of the book except to prove the point badly that she isn't Miranda? but is Nigel Andre Leon Talley? Again, who else could it be? Thanks for letting us in Vogue and conde Nast, even if you do call them Runway and Elias-Clark. No one else throws away money like that for nothing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wears Prada is a book about fresh-out-of-college girl Andrea Sachs who applies for assistant to Miranda Priestley, editor of the nation&iexcl;s most successful fashion magazine, Runway. A job that &iexcl;a million girls would die for&iexcl; immediately turns suicidal when Andrea realizes that Miranda&iexcl;s barking orders are not only impossible to handle but also forces her to completely turn away from the life she had led peacefully before this job, which included friends, her boyfriend, family, and time for herself. As Miranda&iexcl;s endless and complicated orders rapid-fires towards Andrea, Andrea&iexcl;s patience wanes, yet she is intent on the award she will receive at the end of the year: a recommendation from Miranda for Andrea to work at any magazine she chooses.Although entertaining and interesting, this book holds little depth, and the author spends most of the book describing designer labels and runway outfits, from shoes and skirts to scarves and mittens. This book is an excellent read for those who are interested in fashion and trends, because the author describes each and every materialistic item, such as Prada bags, Manolo Blahnik shoes, or Oscar de la Renta evening gowns. It also informs the reader of the classiest lounges and restaurants in New York City. The book describes the highly exclusive life of a highly exclusive character, which gives readers a sense of the thrill of supreme wealth and riches.In my opinion, the ending was a sort of disappointment, as if the author was rushing to finish the book and came up with an easy way out, with no twists and turns or unexpectedness. The characters and their outcomes were predictable, however, this book is great to just enjoy and is an escape from seriousness and reality. It&iexcl;s the classic &iexcl;chick-lit&iexcl;, a light-hearted novel for those who are seeking entertainment and a laugh."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I really loved this book. Yes, it was a light read, but I knew that going in. I believe the author took the most hellacious traits of many &quot;bosses from hell&quot; and then thought up Miranda. I was amazed that Andrea stuck it out for as long as she did--eleven incredible months. Along the way, she nearly lost everything in her personal life, and was lucky enough to realize this during her next-to-last month with this shrew. This was a terrific book to pick up and have some real laugh out loud moments. Hope to see more from this wonderful author!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you've ever had the boss from hell, you must read this book! It actually made me not want to complain about my own job!The story is very funny and yet frustrating, you really start to feel sorry for the lead character and the devil she is hired to work for. It also gives a bit of insight into the world of fashion in New York. Very fun read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I adore this book. Part of me didn't want to - but the more I read, the more I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. We've all had a Miranda Priestly in our life at some point, and I often found myself relating to Andrea in the novel. It was highly enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it. Be forewarned - if you are not a fashionista or are not up on fashion, you will not enjoy this book. There are many &quot;insider&quot; type fashion references that one without a thorough knowledge of fashion and the industry would not appreciate or understand."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Listening to the audio version of this book in my car provided me with as many moments of hilarity, frustration, and angst as the main character passes through herself during her grueling year of work as a fashion editor's assistant.Even though Weisberger concentrates on the rarefied world of high fashion, I think any recent grad can sympathize with the changes that come about in Andrea's life because of her new occupation, and the difficulties she has with the quirks of her job.Also, I think some of the other reviewers missed the point of Andrea as a character...she wasn't looking to even be in the world of fashion in the first place -- instead she considers herself an intellectual and a writer who wants to be a part of the New Yorker. If you are looking for a fashion &quot;fan's&quot; perspective, you won't find that here and you probably won't &quot;get&quot; this character. But I found her to be a sympathetic character, if only becuase I too am a j-crew wearing fashion nobody post-English major who over-analyzes everything."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this book was fascinating. I could not put it down. To be privvy to a life that most of us can't even imagine was fun and voyeristic. I highly recommend it as a quick, fun read. The only unanswered question I had was what happened to Christian and was that story based on someone real?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I started hearing about this book months before it was ever printed, and bought it in hardback the day it came out (a first for me). Even with all the hype I enjoyed this book. It wasn't the full out exposee it was presented to be, but all in all a good read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book takes forever to build and goes nowhere. I kept wondering when the climax would occur and almost missed it in its complete lack of melodrama. The almost cursory last chapter was a bore. One has to ask, who is the devil in this book? Is it Mirando, or is it really Andrea?"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"What a waste of time this was to read, a story of greed, waste and an abusive boss, greed and waste. I would have quit at page 20 except that it was a book group pick so I stuck with it. It was a really horrible story of female on female emotional abuse and emotional violence.My entire book group hated it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Andrea gets a dream job at a fashion magazine, but gets the boss-from-hell. Actually her dream involved writing for the New Yorker but fetching coffee and dry cleaning for the boss seems unlikely to train her for that. She plugs away as the job becomes all consuming and the demands from her boss grate more and more on her nerves.As her relationships dwindle under the stress of the job, the conflict with the boss becomes more personalized. Andrea becomes more and more paranoid as sleep deprivation and lack of social support turn her into a whining, unpleasant person herself.Fascinating insider view of the fashion industry and working in the high-pressure NYC jobs. Often funny, a bit romantic and eventually somewhat depressing as Andrea is dragged further and further down by the job and the horror that is her boss."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"In a lot of ways, Lauren Weisberger's bestselling debut novel is like the worst kind of girlfriend: physically attractive, and yet beneath the makeup she always wears she's shallow, materialistic, vain, condescending, and backstabby.How is \\"T.D.W.P.\\" shallow? Because beneath the pretty cover there's no real depth to the book, in either its so-called heroes and villains, or its alleged plot. The \\"conflict\\" of the protagonist, Andrea, putting up with Miranda (her boss) and her various abuses, \\"complicated\\" by the drinking problems of her best friend and the crucifiction of her boyfriend (who seems to be so altruistic he would make a good Biblican character), have all the depth of an inflatable wading pool.How is T.D.W.P. materialistic? Because Weisberger thinks she can dazzle you long enough with her book's cute cover and all the designer clothes she mentions, and the stars she name-drops (oh by the way Lauren, Giselle Bundschen is an inch under six feet tall and is incorrectly accused of being \\"short\\" in your book), so that you'll forget that the book really has nothing to say.How is T.D.W.P. vain? The book puts a little too much emphasis on the physical aspect of human beauty (even for a book about writing for a clothing magazine) and consequently underdevelops human characters. Example: at the end of the story, Andrea somehow manages to get an article she had written published in Seventeen Magazine -- an article she brags she had \\"written in about an hour.\\" Obviously even a space-cadet magazine like Seventeen has got to have some depth to its articles, so Andrea saying how easy it was to have a piece written for them is akin to claiming status as a superior writer. She NEVER demonstrates any talent in the book for writing. Weisberger merely TELLS. Never shows. A cardinal error, and thus VAIN, as if Weisberger believes herself so smart she can just tell us what's true, and we'll eat it.How is T.D.W.P. condescending? One word: HOMELESS. Weisberger seems to think that rich, privileged people \\"throwing a bone\\" to the needy (all on the company dime, I might add) makes them philanthropists. Andrea's character isn't even buying coffee for the homeless for the sake of being nice -- she's doing it with the peurile, ulterior motive of hurting her boss. What a condescending person. Utterly disgusting.How is T.D.W.P. backstabby? Because with all the hype you think it will at least be interesting.The book betrays you.Dump it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I completely disagree with anyone who says this book only caters to those interested in fashion. I have little interest in or knowledge of designer clothes or the fashion world, and I don't subscribe to or read any fashion magazines. That was exactly why I passed by this book several times before finally picking it up this weekend. I thought it was going to be some story with a character I couldn't possibly relate to-- someone steeped in fashion who only cared about appearance.When I read the first few pages with Andrea IN the designer clothes, I thought I was right... but to my pleasant surprise, the main character turned out to be someone I could relate to and respect. As a recent college graduate, I know from personal experience that the prospect of finding a job... getting a job... and trying to figure out a career are incredibly common to anyone in the relative age range of 21-24. It's no easy task to deal with a first \\"real\\" job and the trials it provides while keeping an eye out for what comes next, because, inevitably, there will be a next. No one stays in their first, entry-level, junky job, but this is a perfect read for the people who ARE in their first, entry-level, junky jobs.What I found most impressive about this book is the way that, just like Andrea gets sucked into the lifestyle surrounding her job, the reader gets sucked into her goals for the future and how the job will get here there. Towards the end, even as you realize it's wrong, it's so easy to rationalize (along with Andrea) that this is what she needs to do to secure her future; that she only has a few more weeks left-- all the while knowing deep down that, really, it's totally ridiculous.If you've ever had or have a boss who drives you insane for any reason, this is a great book to read because it will show you that your boss is a picnic in the park. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Very entertaining read, as long as you don't work in a similar job to the one that the main character has, that is, as a low-level peon to a hateful editorial vp at a fashion magazine. In that case, you might want to consider another escape read. But for the rest of us, this book is fun and it gets into how much we all love to hate a dispicable boss. The author relates the get-yer-feet-wet experiences of a young woman named Andrea at a completely exploitative entry-level job, which looks glamorous to everyone else because it's in fashion and she gets all these great discount clothes, rubs shoulders with the chic and famous, etc. etc. But Andrea, a young woman fresh out of the ivy league English lit mill, has a dream. Fashion mags aren't her thing, but she hopes that by putting in her year at this grovelling, kiss-ass position, aka gopher, it'll gain her a great reference so she may eventually have a shot at working at her dream job, a real editorial position at \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine. Does it happen? Read it and find out."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Now, this was a strange experience - I can't quite decide whether I liked this book or not. It is light on plot, and can be summarized thusly: Girl gets job. Girl complains about job. But it doesn't pretend to be anything deeper than that. Didn't love it, didn't hate it - but there were elements I loved and elements I hated. Confused? Yeah, me too.The good:Quite well written. Now that the author of this \\"semi-autobiographical\\" novel has (hopefully) gotten revenge out of her system, I'm curious to see what else she can come up with. While the narrative sometimes - well, often - veered towards annoying, overall it was fairly engrossing and I wasn't tempted to quit halfway through.Good characters - for the most part. The outlandish villainy of Miranda is often hilarious. While one larger than life character can easily overpower the rest, there are several endearingly quirky folks among the supporting players. I'm always impressed when an author can create minor characters that are as interesting as the \\"stars\\". The doorman who tyrannically extorted pop tunes in exchange for entrance into the building cracked me up. And Emily - ah, I loved her. Yeah, I said it. Loved her! Such a bizarre, brown nosing little robot.The bad:Andrea! It wasn't hard to relate to her situation. We've all fancied ourselves a martyr at the hands of an evil employer at one time or another, and we've all complained about it too. However, most of us realize that dream jobs do not come without years of paying dues. Andrea never got over being stunned that the real world didn't find her as deserving as she imagined herself to be of the job of her choice, straight out of college. Her sense of entitlement was irritating, as was her passive aggressive behavior - the just barely audible sighs in response to Miranda's orders, using company funds to buy coffee for the homeless (for the sole reason that Miranda would be appalled). Reprehensible as she may have been, Miranda would have been entirely justified in firing Andrea's arrogant butt.The ending - what a letdown. We spend 350 pages watching Andrea suffer through increasingly poor treatment from the vile Miranda, clinging to the remote possibility of Miranda recommending her for the New Yorker (and given Andrea's behavior, why would she?). The climax occurs in Paris, when Miranda finally goes too far, and Andrea can't take it anymore. And so she... drops the F bomb. That's it. She utters a cuss word and then spends the remaining 20 or so pages patting herself on the back for it. I thought Andrea was a writer? Surely she could have used her gift for words to give Miranda an eloquent, blistering dressing down that would have made for a satisfying conclusion.My mind is still not made up, so I bestow unto \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" two and a half stars - right in the middle of the loved it/hated it spectrum. Sadly, the rating system will not support half numbers, so I will err on the side of generosity and call it a three."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I couldn't get enough of the NY & high fashion featured in this book. The story wraps up well, but leaves a little to be desired. Although it is great for a fun, quick, laugh out loud read. I hope for a sequel or anticipate another insider look at a women's working world from Weisberger."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I had fun reading this book and I am not at all a fashionista. Ms. Weisberger keeps it interesting throughout. I was disappointed though, like others, that Andrea didn't listen to her inner voices about what really matters in life until the anticlimatic blow-up with her boss at the end. I guess that would have made the book shorter though..."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I fully expected this book to be fabulous but I turned out to be fabulously dissapointed with the perils of Auhn-dreas bummer job working or Miranda. It takes me about 4 chapters to start asking myself why Andrea does'nt just march up to her nasty boss and tell her just what to do with her Prada. The supporting characters are non realistic and the book gave me an overall complex about how unglam. eating at Bennihana's is. I expected so much more from this novel but really all it manages to do is label sling excessively and make me wonder why anyone in the world would sell their free designer goods just to make a chunk of change. Keep those Louis Vuittons girl! Really dissapointing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"One of my favorite chick books! It was entertaining, fast-paced, addictive- and I love Weisberger's take on her character's- she gets to the innocence and vulnerability of Andrea, as well as the nastiness and equally vulnerable Miranda. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I love this book, I read it twice! A great chick lite book to add to your collection!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is one of those rare cases where I have to say I think the movie was better than the book. Maybe my views were tainted because I saw the movie first, but I thought the consolidation of the story necessary to cram it into a two-hour movie actually made it stronger. Not to mention that fashion guru Miranda Priestly's character was so convincingly crafted in the book that reading about her horrid demands actually gave me a headache - a testament to the characterization but still not all that much fun.However, I'll be the first to say I have no real basis for reviewing this one because I am not a connoisseur of chick lit - my experience with the genre is limited to The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing and Bridget Jones's Diary (both of which, incidentally, I loved). So by all means, don't take my word for it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" this morning. The book was light, fun and entertaining. On a different note, the book also lets the reader realize how superficiality plays a large role in today's world even beyond the catwalk. And with that obsession, shows how some folks would even compromise their own beliefs/values, neglect their personal lives and allow outsiders to belittle them to eventually have that ever-so-deserved job that \\"any girl or boy would die for\\". Is it even worth it in the end? Check it out and see for yourself! My rating: 3.5/5 stars."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is what Summer Reading is all about - absolutely delightful to read, an absorbing story with a wonderfully satisfying ending. I laughed, I cried, I read it in a total of 9 hours - one of the quickest to read and hardest to put down books I've come across. No deep and meaningful revelations about \\"the life, the universe and everything,\\" but I found a lot to relate to in this story centered around a sympathetic protagonist (an aspiring writer) and a truly demonic boss. Read long before the movie came out."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed reading this book although at times it was hard to think of a person being so crude. That's the point right!? Was very surprised when I watched the movie (after) and found them drastically different."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Here's an engaging story about a young woman who dives headfirst into a world so foreign, yet so enticingly deviant, that she cannot help but become part of what she finds so distasteful. Does she manage to free herself from fashion world body snatchers? Why reveal the end........Readers will get to know several characters quite well, and yet maybe there's one or two too many that seem only to exist so that there will actually be a world that our heroine \\"turns away.\\" And yet she does turn away from much of what and who she knows during the process of becoming all consumed by her new surroundings. In this respect, it is the writing that fails, but not spectacularly.Our author tells an engaging enough story that we care what happens. And she creates an over the top demonic boss who is both outrageous and simplistically sad all at the same time.Writing: Not great, but works well enough.Character Development: Good where it is essential, but otherwise not so hot.Plot: Nothing new here, but the setting is more unique than you're used to, and so, even if you care nothing about the fashion world, you can still \\"get it.\\"Does it Work? Yes, it does! But it could work better!GRADE: B"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This debut novel sat on the New York Times bestseller list for months, and was turned into an Academy Award-nominated film. I did the non-bookworm thing: I saw the movie first. When I finally picked up the book, I was both delighted and irritated. I was delighted that Andrea had a more complicated personal life in the book than in the movie. Her best friend and roommate, Lily, is a promiscuous, alcoholic graduate student and her boyfriend, Alex, is an idealistic elementary school teacher. She loses sight of both of them as her job gradually takes over her life. Even Emily, the senior assistant, shows signs of cracking under Miranda's pressure. There are many, many instances of Miranda's tyranny over her little empire, which guarantee that you'll be simultaneously laughing and wincing at poor Andrea's suffering.If I had to choose one thing that bothered me, it would have to be the dialog. It was incredibly contrived and most of it wasn't believable. The conversations sound like they happen in someone's head, but when you put the words down on paper, it all sounds fake. Real people just don't talk like this. I would try to imagine these people saying these things, and it didn't work at all. It really takes away from the story, and it shows how untrained the author actually is. Much of it sounds like it came out of a high school creative writing class. At the same time, though, Miranda's outrageous rants and requests (\\"Yes, there's something wrong. Something very, very wrong. Why do I have to come back to my office to find this sitting on my desk?\\") are perfect, which hints at some real-life experience of the author's.If you're a fan of chick-lit, this book is great. It's full of fashion and fabulousness, parties and Paris. Just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"DWP has many pluses and minuses. The pluses are a great plot centered around a struggle with a power crazed boss. The minuses are the many overwritten passages. Weisberger was new to writing and that is to be expected and the story eclipses a lot of it. The best thing to say for it was I was pushed to turn the page and could read it in a short period of time and feel transported to her situation even when I didn't like the genre. For a first timer that is impressive."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"You know how the book is out and you have to see which is better the book or the film. Well the toss up is the movie is so much better the book is ok but not as good as the film.:)"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"After about 50 pages I thought to myself -- if Miranda is so bad, quit already. If you don't want to quit, then stop complaining and get to work. And then there are another 50 pages of the same. And another. After 250 pages, I figured there would be some plot movement. Not to be. In fact, the first 400 pages are more of the same.I was disappointed in the characterization. I never had much feeling for Emily, Lilly or Alex, let alone the other folks in Andy's circle. I was particularly disappointed in Miranda. Obviously, she did something right to get to where she was in her profession. But we never see that other than through the rantings of Emily -- and even there, you can't decide if she's serious or sarcastic.I think the author was trying to tell/show us that the fashion industry is so cutthroat that young people will put up with absolutely anything to move ahead. That may be true, but this book didn't tackle that issue in any depth at all. In fact, by making Miranda so evil, she and everyone in the book become caricatures. At some point, I felt like I was reading Cruella DeVille and 101 Dalmations. Or maybe wished I were.Most critically, the reader never fully understands how Andy matures -- it sort of happens but it's never shown. Since that process is (or must be because nothing else is) the heart of the book, it's absence leaves a huge vacuum.Overall, the premise was okay but the author did nothing with it. And, when the big \\"dramatic moment\\" came at the book's end, I found myself shrugging and then rejoicing that the book was finally over."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I was disappointed with The Devil Wears Prada. It was pretty boring. I think the selling point is that you get insider information about Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and her many infamous piccadillos. That part was, in fact, interesting. But the storyline was practically non-existant (unqualified assistant hates her demanding boss), the ending unsatisfying and contrived and the writing, well, the author's craft definitely needs maturing."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Enter Andrea Sachs (Andy) fresh out of college and looking for her dream job as an editor for The New Yorker. She decides to pay her dues to the top in the form of a year of working for the editor-in-chief of Runway Magazine - a very upscale fashion magazine. The only hang-up here is that she is basically the gofer girl for Miranda Priestly, a high powered, and very high maintenance boss. Andy feels if she can just get through the year, the promise of \\"getting whatever job she wants,\\" i.e., writing for the magazine/paper of her choice, will become a reality. The story takes us through a journey of high fashion and egos - very demanding and impossible employers and hoity, toity co-workers. It seemed to me that no job at the end of this self-inflicted hell would be worth the abuse Andy suffers as she tries to satisfy one impossible request after another. We see her family and personal life turned upside down (all her own doing) as well as her relationship with her boyfriend (Alex) and best friend (Lily). The beginning and end of the book are the actual storytelling factors. The middle is necessary but drawn out as the story repeats and repeats the same scenario - Andy is compromising herself at the hands of a demanding and ridiculous boss. While I know this very same thing does go on every day, it is definitely helpful to look at something like this and see how utterly absurd someone's life can become and how the important things in life can be lost as one seeks a professional goal. There is certainly a lesson to be learned from this movie and we are somewhat entertained while learning it. My biggest objection to the book is that the author went on and on about the fact that Miranda was heartless and Andy a slave to her demands. We got the picture loud and clear and she could have made her point minus some 50-75 pages! The conclusion is somewhat predictable but all in all, the book is a light, summer read (perfect for a few days at the beach). The book is much better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The book was entertaining particularly if you are in the 20-30 age range.

I have never been to New York, and have hardly experienced \\"the finer things in life\\" but I can see what they might look like through this book. It prepares me for anything I might come across during my internships through school or my first real job. I loved, loved, did I mention loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Book is better than the movie. The book Miranda is much better written: I like villians with no redeeming social value... much more true-to-life.

A fun summer read and a fun summer flick."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is not a literay piece, but a great beach read sort of book that will make you lol in some places or gasp in others.Worth buying or checking out at the library.

You just wanted to say \\"Get on with it!\\" And, as others have said, there were definitely a lot of predictible things in this book, such as the end. But the end was the BEST PART! I didn't mind the suffering through I had to do in order for it to end the way it did. It's a light, easy read that should take no time to get through. I was actually glad I read it when I did, because the 3 books I read prior to this one were pretty deep and I needed something mindless for a while. I guess I can go see the movie now...\\"That's all.\\""},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I truly enjoyed the book, and I would happily recommend it to others. I only gave it 3 stars because its an entertaining read but I don't put it inthe category of great literature, but then I don't think its meant to be.I read this book sometime last year, before the movie, and I didn't even know that the author may have been writing some half-truth into it, given her experiences. I enjoyed it because I could relate to the things that happened, not because I am in fashion, but I think anyone who has worked under an unpleasant boss and felt trapped by that job for whatever reason, can relate. I thought this was an interesting look into what a person is willing to put up with for their goals and where a person draws the line.Unlike a few of the previous reviewer, I felt that the characters and their motivations were believable too.I did find the book to be rather predictable, but with books like these (especially with such a hip title) I expected that. I mean, there are certain books/movies that you pick because generally, you know how it will end. Who picks up a romance novel to find out the heroine dies after the hero rejects her? Who watches an action flick to find out that the hero dies before saving the victims? Like the more popular versions of these predictable vehicles, this book is very entertaining in the road to a know destination, and that is its purpose."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a great book! I It's very funny book, also I love the movie. This book would be the perfect summer read or just a pick me up. I've never laughed out loud when reading a book but I did with this one. Don't get me wrong, this will not go down as one of the greatest literary achievements in history but it was very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is an adolescent romp by an author that has penned an anecdote that doesn't convey the sympathy for the lead character I think she was going for . . . and frankly, there really isn't a single character that's very likable . . . if we're suppose to condone the lead character expensing numerous items to her employer as retaliation, the author has a twisted set of values. Taking into consideration the author's youth, it's an adequate first novel.The story does share some insider perspective on the fashion publishing industry . . . although, her lack of discretion in sharing a former employer's idiosyncrasies and eccentricities may not be a good move for one so young."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The cute heroin, Andrea Sachs, always wanted to be a journalist for her favourite newspaper The New Yorker, but as she makes a first application at the Elias Clark building after the college she discovers a new world.

But this isn't the worst, Andrea who isn't into fashion gets the job a million girls would die for. But Andrea dicovers really fast that Miranda Priestly, the woman in fashion and editor in chief of Runway, the most popular magazine in fashion, is a dragon. So Andrea has to be prepared for her improper phonecalls 24 hours, because Miranda has to get everything she wants and she has to help her everywhere she can.

The jokes aren't funny, the plot is far too undeveloped and the heroine is annoying. The entire book consists of her whining about her job. It's a good premise, a job in the fashion world with the boss-from-hell, but the writing is just so uninteresting that the story falls flat on it's face.

If you're really curious, go to the library."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I normally don't write reviews, but I feel compelled to tell potential readers of this book to ignore all the nasty negative reviews and READ THIS. I love this book. I love it more than Shopaholic, way more than Bergdorf Blondes (a waste of money) and ALMOST as much as Jane Green's Babyville. This is a great book, an unforgettable character and a budding author. Ignore the bad reviews, because the media is biased when it comes to protecting its friends.

I waited a long time to read this book and wish I would have waited longer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"And it is the only good thing. I came to the conclusion at the end of this whiney diatribe by a spoiled, phony, ridiculous, mediocre excuse for an employee, that the devil was not Miranda, but Andrea.Skip it."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is far from terrible. Although the writing quality is not excellent, Weisberger has managed to scrape together a fair plot with its share of engaging moments. Anyone coming to shred the book apart based on its failure to solve all employee-employer relationships has a bit of a complex.However, the novel is uncomfortable to read at times, due to the close ties it possibly has to real life. There is not a single likeable character, not even our sassy protagonist, Andrea, who is quite the unmitigated, self-centered brat. Put upon, downtrodden, and a good trooper, but a brat nontheless. You hate the boss, but you also love her for being the only plausible character. No one scares me more than the bipolar, obsessive, robotic Emily, and as for Godlike Boyfriend? Please.Entertaining? Yes. Enjoyable? Possibly. Good? Debatable."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I could not get past page 38 of this unfunny, cliche and contrived material. The protagonist is most mundane without a single interesting character trait. The \\"boss from hell\\" character lacks any substance or believability.

Totally not worth your time, unless you're stuck at the airport with nothing better to do."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book details the plight of a young journalist with a \\"banana republic heavy\\" wardrobe through the world of couture and designer labels. The crazy antics of her overzealous and mean boss are hillarious, while her own reactions are so bitter and cynical they make you laugh. In the hopes that this personal assistant job will put her on the fast-track to success, she loses sight of her real priorities. Her final decision revolves around a common theme: career or personal life? You can relate to many of her troubles and struggles, and cheer her on as she climbs the mountains built by her boss. This is a funny book you won't want to put down!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I must say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK and I don't really agree with a lot of the comments I've been reading in the reviews. I picked up this book at a Goodwill store, actually, because I liked the title. It was great!!! I experienced all of the feelings I get when I read a good book: laughter (very often!), sadness, sympathy... I felt uplifted when I finished it and was only a little upset about its ending (mostly because even though we pretend we don't, we all want hollywood-style endings!). If you're in the mood for something fun and modern, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"As I write this review, I am still in limbo as to whether or not I actually liked the book. I agree with the many reviewers who loved it, and also with those who simply did not.THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (indeed a VERY creative title) was I guess, just OK. I will admit that from the first page I was disappointed so I put it down, and it sat on my desk collecting dust - that was July 2003. I looked at it two days ago and decided I was going to just go through with it and read it.*sigh* where do I start? Honestly, the front flap of the book pretty much sums it up. \\"Andrea Sachs is a small town girl fresh out of college, who lands the job \\"a million girls would die for\\". Along with this so called \\"dream job\\" is the boss from hell - Miranda Priestly. Andrea is in for a rude awakening. Her ultimate goal is to become a writer for The New Yorker, and she feels that working for the high-profile, almighty and omnipotent Miranda will get her there.An-dre-ah (as Miranda calls her) endures almost a year's worth of abuse from this woman. All she did was complain, complain, complain. It got annoying after awhile, because she never really DID anything about it, so there was definitely a lack of sympathy. Being Miranda's personal assistant took over her entire life, and she started to slowly, but surely abandon her family, best friend, and boyfriend. Didn't she know that this job wouldn't land her career as a writer for The New Yorker???What's funny is that I can totally relate to Andrea. I interned for a high-profile celebrity's Production company (which shall remain nameless) while in college and also had the boss from hell - but I did something about it, so it irritated me that the author made Andrea such an infuriating character.The only positives about this book -- the fact that the storyline was consistent and SOME parts of it made me laugh. Other than that, I didn't enjoy the ending, and I didn't like the fact that Miranda's character wasn't extended a bit more. There had to be more to her then the fact that she was a witch. The readers did get a taste of her acting somewhat like a human being... and I thought we were getting somewhere -- but then unfortunately that was quickly taken away. My rating? 2 stars.I heard this was supposed to be made into a movie, maybe that will resuscitate this mediocre attempt of what it's really like to work for the rich and glamorous."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that mentioned it was hard to sympathize with Andrea. Her passive-agressive behavior was a complete turn-off. Besides, after my own stressful day, I found it hard to read the rantings of someone else's stress. Had to finish it on a day off!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This is a great book--I found it hard to put down, and it's the perfect companion for all those recent college grads slogging through their morning commutes (or perhaps their jobs). But ultimately Weisberger offers little original here; she just plays a series of riffs that she knows will sell plenty of copies. If you like Madonna better than Britney Spears, you'll like Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' Diary better than The Devil Wears Prada. Fielding employs many of the same rhetorical techniques as Weisberger--using lots of brand names and silly hyperbole to conjure vivid images--but her writing also doubles as social criticism, something that Weisberger's agent presumably advised against."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book is nothing more than what it promises to be... a light read and laugh at the over pretencious fashion world, the need to please and the true bitchiness that a woman can poses. Nothing particularly sparked wihtin the 360 page account but the much anticipated (as well as predictable)ending was to necessary to shut the book on."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"One of the funniest books I have read in a long time.

She really wants to be a writer for the New Yorker, but takes a job as an assistant to the editor at Runway, a fashion magazine. Believing that this will put her on the fast track to her dream job, she gives up her life and sanity to the editor, Miranda Priestly. Miranda is the devil! She calls at all hours of the night, has impossible demands, and has taken away any semblance of a normal life for Andy. The story goes from there and can be funny at times. My problem with this story is that Andy gives up everything for her supposed future. She puts work ahead of her friend that is quickly becoming a raging alcoholic and sex addict, she answers the call of duty before her boyfriend of three years, and she doesn't stand up for herself until the end of the book. It's just not that fun to read about someone allowing themselves to be walked all over.If you don't expect too much then you might enjoy some of the story."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"&quot;A million girls would die for your job,&quot;---everyone seems to tell Andrea this, from the moment she gets her job as assistant to chief editor Miranda Priestly at Runway, the hottest fashion magazine.Fresh out of college, Andrea Sachs is hoping to enter the world of magazine publishing at the New Yorker, but breaking into the occupation isn't all that easy. So, she applies for a job as assistant to the editor and miraculously gets it. Unfortunately, its not at the New Yorker, its at Runway, a fashion magazine (Andrea doesn't even care about fashion.)From her first day on the job, Andrea dislikes it, but this grows to a hatred of it. she works amidst beautiful, anorexic models who consider her size six fat, and other intresting characters. Unfortunately, Andrea barely gets to meet any of them, as she is always busy following the huge demands placed on her by Miranda Priestly. Lunch must be on time and warm, or Andrea has to go out again, the layout for the magazine must be brought to her house a night no matter how late, and a trip to Europe can be demanded of Andrea at a moments notice. Those arn't even the worst scenarios, Miranda often eaves incoherant instructions, that must be followed without question, or Andrea will be promptly fired.The demands of her job cause Andrea to lose track of what's truly important in her life. Her best friends alcoholism (until its too late) her boyfriend (or should I say ex) and family. Andrea is left to choose her family and friends or job.This novel blends the serious with comical expertly.

The hired help are just insignificant creatures to be used and discarded like used kleenexes with never a thought for how her egregious behavior affects them. How dare Andrea complain! She should consider herself lucky to lick Miranda's Jimmy Choo shoes.You can be sure that Anna Wintour, in her wildest dreams, never believed for one moment, that she would ever have to answer for her mistreatment of Lauren Weissberger. So, it is poetic justice that Weissberger was able to exact her revenge on Wintour by putting out a New York Times Best Seller. And now Wintour is righteously feeling the searing ignominy that she has so insouciantly inflicted on others.The great Anna Wintour has been humiliated by an ingenue and now can not dine at Le Cirque or Daniel without enduring snears and snide remarks from her former legion of adoring fans.

Also, she mentioned that Miranda received a makeup set from Bobbi Brown, but it was spelled Bobby Brown. I believe others have mentioned the issue with the Harry Potter books. (in the book they came out in January, but in actual life they came out in June.) Besides that, I thought this book was terrific and especially good for an author's very first novel!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you think watching the movie was enough, you're wrong!This book was so funny, I laughed until my sides hurt.It's an insight into the life of a young woman with an overly-demanding-bordering-on-neurotic boss.There's so much information given in the book as well...Background info that the movie just couldn't capture.And the movie changed alot of stuff as well. Even if you loved the movie, read the book!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Boring and painful. Andy never quits whining or smoking long enough to partially resemble someone you would want to do well. I would have prefered for her to have been fired, disgraced, and thrown out on the curb."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"When I saw that Meryl Streep was to be in this movie I figured it had to be a good.I was wrong.Tedious,repetitive,bigoted and whiny do not make for funny.I kept thinking perhaps a stint as a student nurse at an inner city hospital would do Andrea some good.This book could have used some major editing.I had to wonder who the author knew."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The reviewer who compared this book to diet coke couldn't have been more correct. It was an okay read. Enjoyable, but didn't have any real substance. This was not a book that entices a person to ignore the outside world and keep reading. Instead, it was the type of book you read for a few minutes each night before going to sleep. I didn't experience my usual \\"mourning\\" period after reading it that I do other books and was able to jump into a more intense book right after. It actually left me craving a much more intense read.My boyfriend and I even started refering to this book as diet coke. I'm not sure he actually remembers it's real title.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it on a superficial level and that I wouldn't contemplate reading it again in the future... but I don't see that happening. My mother, who read it as well, was much more critical of it than I was... which is the opposite of what normally happens."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Each disaster is no different than the next, and the plot doesn't go anywhere. I was disappointed. The concept is great and I can see how it fueled a good movie, but the book itself was not very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I couldn't put down this book until I finished! Whoever wrote on a previous review that Lauren Weisberger's book was like a written version of a Sex and the City episode is so right!I won't discuss if it is fiction or the writer's biography because it is really beyond the point. The book is very funny, lighthearted and the fashion world is depicted so well. Besides, the plot is well constructed and the core issue of the book is interesting: how much are you willing to sacrifice in order to get your dreams (the dream job in this case)?And having had my share of hidious bosses with obnoxious requests, I really laughed with Andy's struggles in order to fulfill them all."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I found the book to be hilarious. There was so much in it that I had undergone in days gone by when I worked for the devil. I have been retired 10 years, but this novel reminded me of the crazy things the devil wanted from me--aand how I strove to meet expectations that were ridiculous. It is great for a laugh. I read it straight through. It is well written and fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Just finished the book and think it is worth reading although perhaps a bit overrated. The protagonist, Andrea, after an escapade through Europe lands a job as a fashion assitant to Miranda Priestly, the editor of a fictional Runway magazine (supposedly based on Weisberger's experiences at Vogue).The main focus of the book is the way Andrea has to cope with Miranda's harsh demands such as flying two copies of the new Harry Potter book to Paris in a couple of hours time when the book has yet to be released. The interactions with Miranda get a bit repetitive and the author really tries hard to make these small scenes where she struggles uberdramatic. At times, it works. But I have to say that, from my limited experience in the corporate world, and, more to the point, from those I know who work in the fashion world, the character's supposedly nightmarish journey is not that atypical. Nearly everyone has had a brass, bitchy boss...big deal. And yes people in the fashion industry obsess over their weight, and?On the other hand, the scenes are painted realistically and the insight into the structure of the fashion industry is at times intriguing. The worst parts are the interactions with her boyfriend, Alex, whom is painted as this too good for tv daytime soap opera, bleeding-heart liberal, who wants to save the children in public schools and her friend, Lily, a Ph.d. candidate who sleeps with guys she calls Tongue Ring Boy and Pink Shirt Boy and drinks until she pukes every other scene. These sections are generally dull and the characters and interactions not very appealing and insightful.As per the ending, I actually thought it was fairly satisfactory, as opposed to other reviewers, as hackneyed as it was. What Andrea says to Miranda is probably what a character in this situation would say, however trite and incomplete a commupeance. Overall, worth a read...it was captivating, althought some more depth and insight would have made this that much more powerful."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Miranda is not diabolical enough. She's just chilly. Annoying, of course, but the self-pitying heroine is soooo obsessed with every teeny slight that she loses our sympathy; enough already. Meanwhile supposedly venomous Miranda is really no more than moderatley inconsiderate. I kept waiting for something mean. Never happened. Bring back Les Liaisons Dangereuses, or Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, for real devils. This book was a pallid whinge."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I read some of the reviews on here before I purchased and read this book. I figured it would be a short chick novel that I would forget about 10 seconds after finishing. But I ended up being very surprised.While this book's content is a stereotypical female novel, it is written very well. The lanuguage that Weisberger uses is not typical to this kind of novel. It flows very well and hooks the reader instantly. She has awesome imagery; I could very vividly see every description. (So much so that I keep on forgetting which parts were in the movie and which parts I remember from my imagination while I was reading the book.)The plot is basically straight-forward with a few departures down mini-plots. I really enjoyed my read- the entire thing. I'm not much into cliche \\"girly\\" reading, but I really did enjoy this book. I agree with what another reviewer said- I really did learn something about the industry and have am actually more appreciative of high fashion.I think I may just go buy my own Prada bag.Anyway, buy this book if you are interested in a ridiculously interesting read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I thought this was a great book. It was funny, the characters were likeable, the plot ( and sub plots) were interesting - I read it in 2 days - my boyfirend who was reading it to me one night finished it by himself when I fell asleep - he had to know how it ended!Maybe the people who have poo-pooed the book dont like fashion - or maybe themselves are intinmidated by it - but as a &quot;fashionable NYC gal and accessories designer&quot; I found the book a hoot!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wear's Prada is a wonderful book for the beach or a relaxing afternoon by the pool. Those that just graduated from college and are in the working world will relate to the ups and downs of the first job blues.

But the author Lauren Weisbereger creates a page turner for those that love fashion and are curious about what goes on behind the scenes. A must for girls graduating from college and heading to the beach!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"This book, which although the author says it is not autobiographical, we all know it is based on her experiences. This book makes my horrible boss stories seem like nothing. I do believe their are Miranda's out there, and enjoyed reading this poor women trying her best to deal with her unreasonable demands.. ha ha ha"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The Devil Wearas Prada was a scream. The story focuses on a young girl in Manhattan, working her first real job after college, working for a horrible, horrible woman. This may sound boring, but Andrea's sarcasm and wit kept me interested all the way through. It was easy to relate to her loathing for the fashion industry, her disgust at being frowned upon for being an enormity at size 6... It was easy to read, a good book for the summer."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"While Weisberger may not write well enough to join the staff at the New Yorker, but trust me you will not even notice. This is the ultimate beach read of the summer. Besides the yummy descriptions of the couture clothing hanging in \\"the closet,\\" you will love to hate Miranda, sympathize with Andrea's boyfriend, and be utterly charmed by the new man in her life, Christian. This is the book you long for your best friend to read so that she can call you up and exchange \\"can you believe her!?!!\\" conversations. Miranda Priestly takes the cake for boss nightmare stories; she is so far from reality she actually has \\"Harry Potter\\" books taken on a private jet to her twin daughters' rooms at the Paris Ritz so that they can have them a whole day before the rest of the world! Naturally it is Andrea's job to coordinate all of this, including actually obtaining the books a day early! So much fun, but be careful - you'll have an uncontrollable desire to go on a shopping spree when you hear about the only perk of Andrea's job!"},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"The devil doesn't wear Prada, the devil wears sweatpants. The main character of this book infuriated me as much as she was infuriated by her boss. She was unappreciative, unprofessional, lazy, and immature. Her boss demanded the best for the right reasons. The portrayal of the fashion-loving fools was great, and this book had many laughs. At the same time, it was great to see how anybody can demonize others while they themselves aren't the Archangel Gabriel, either. 4 out of 5 stars - a must read."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I usually dont buy novels but this one caught my attention at the book store because of its unusual cover. I was convinced on buying the book when I saw that it was about a person (Andrea Sachs) struggling to keep her job because of all the crazy things her boss (Miranda Priestly) makes her do.I truly recommend this book to everyone who, in some time of their professional life, has had an \\"impossible boss\\". Believe me, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" deals with Andrea who worked as an assistant for Miranda, the prominent editor in chief for Runaway, a fashion magazine. It was the first job Andrea landed after graduating from college and she was hoping this would be a stepping stone for her to work for The New Yorker. Unfortunately for Andrea, Miranda was terrible to work for, as she was arrogant, bossy, demanding, and act like she had to right to call her assistants at anytime. Soon, working for Miranda consumed Andrea's life and she began neglecting her family, her boyfriend and her bestfriend. She had no time for anyone and was constantly stressed out.I think \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is quite entertaining and it provides insights (especially since the author herself worked at the highly popular magazine) into the world of fashion magazines where wearing the right stuff (such as Prada, Gucci) is a must for every employee. The entire book basically deals with Andrea job at Runaway and don't expect anything more. Even though many chick lits deal with fashion magazines, this one in particular deals with fashion in detail."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"Weisberger provides the reader an amusing if not painful insight in the world of fashion. Like uncontrollably glancing at a car wreck, the reader cannot help but follow Andrea's midadventures in providing for every silly need of her sadistic boss, Miranda Priestly. Though at times the heroine seems to be annoying in her narrow minded drive to get the recommendation from Miranda that will promise her any future job she wants, one should wonder what they would do if they were in Andrea's shoes. She is not the perfect herione. Despite occasionally forgetting her family and freinds while working for Miranda, her ambition is aspiring. From beginning to end, you stick with Andrea hoping that she will get fired for her own good but also hope that her patience and endurance will pay off. Very entertaining. **Give yourself extra points if you recognize the designer names mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Of course, it is not classic litterature but it was fun nontheless.

For years, I lost more of those arguments than I won because I didn't always hold myself accountable to the same standards to which other functions were held, nor was I expected to. Over time, my staffs and I got better at measuring the impact of our strategies on various measures of organizational performance, and with that came budgetary &quot;victories&quot; and greater respect as business partners. That's what The Human Resources Scorecard is all about, and by reading and using the wisdom it contains, newcomers to the hr function and late adapters of hr measurement, can enjoy in relatively short order success and respect, which are the &quot;price of admission&quot; to the &quot;executive suite&quot;. Having achieved that credibility, we then have the challenge of elevating our conversations with our bosses, peers and clients regarding the intangible dimensions of human and organizational soul, but that's another book in this series."},{"Title":"The Human Resources Scorecard (Improving Human Performance)","review":"This is a comprehensive guide for evaluating any type of Human Resource Development (HRD) program.

Phillips adapts his ROI methodology for corporate training and applies it more generally to all Human Resources initiatives. Measuring so called \\"soft\\" subjects like training and HR has been a difficult and ongoing issue for practitioners who need to convince executives that their work contributes to the bottom line and adds value to the organization. Phillips provides a framework for measurement which, while not perfect, will give you results that executives can understand and help you build the case for why money spent on developing employees is not money thrown away."},{"Title":"The Human Resources Scorecard (Improving Human Performance)","review":"Super reference guide. Case studies are well organized and meaningful."},{"Title":"Effective Work Breakdown Structures (The Project Management Essential Ibrary Series)","review":"Of the three books that focus solely on work breakdown structures this is the most complete. The other two are &quot;Nuts and Bolts Series 1--How to Build a Work Breakdown Structure&quot; by Carl L. Pritchard, and &quot;Project Management Institute Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures&quot;. The burning question is how do they compare and which is best. For a no-nonsense and pragmatic book the &quot;Nuts and Bolts Series&quot; book wins. It has the distinction of being the first book on the subject, and is one that I used as a reference for the past 4 years. If you are planning to certify as a PMP, your best bet is the PMI Practice Standard, because you're sure to encounter exam questions that are based on that book. However, if you want a comprehensive book that covers every facet of principles and practice, this is the book to get.What sets this one apart from the other two (all other factors being equal) is the clearer descriptions of the principles, and the checklists. I also like the way that the author goes deeper into details about how to align the WBS to various project types (product-, service- and results-oriented projects), and the more complete life cycle view that this book provides. As an aside, a results-oriented project, previously mentioned, is a project such as organizational change management, which doesn't produce a tangible deliverable in the same manner as, for example, a software development project does.To put into context the comparison among the three books, I favor this one because of personal preferences. Each merits, in my opinion, equal value, and any of the three will give you the knowledge necessary to develop a work breakdown structure."},{"Title":"Effective Work Breakdown Structures (The Project Management Essential Ibrary Series)","review":"A total of 100 pages, which would seem a bit pricey, but in the 100 pages Haugan does a very competent job of covering the subject.Most of the critical concepts in PM are really pretty basic, and most projects and PM texts fail on understanding and executing on those basic concepts. This book is very clear and succinct on the basics of WBS.I very much admire Haugan's approach. I expect my copy will be around for a long time, marked-up, with yellow sticky-notes protruding out."},{"Title":"Effective Work Breakdown Structures (The Project Management Essential Ibrary Series)","review":"This book is short and sweet.

Obviously Mr. Sims has experiences and life history worth sharing. However, in this attempt to tell share some of this history (as historical fiction) his writing appears padded and strained. The characters were caricatures and, while I wanted to care about them, I had difficulty extending that empathy. It seemed that Mr. Sims was aspiring to be Erskine Caldwell-ish; however, he fell short of the mark and Hard Rock is no Tobacco Road."},{"Title":"Chanur's Venture","review":"In the sequel toPride of Chanur, it's been two years since we last saw Pyanfar Chanur and her crew, and things haven't been going well for them. The paranoid, xenophobic, and combat-averse stsho, who run the oxygen side of Meetpoint Station, are unappreciative of the upset attendant on Pyanfar's sponsorship of the human Tully after he escaped his kif captors, and they have barred The Pride of Chanur from the station, while the mahendo'sat, instead of sharing humanity's trade with the hani, have gone off to pursue it on their own. Pyanfar has just gotten her papers cleared (without, inexplicably, having to pay the usual exorbotant bribes) to dock at Meetpoint once again when she encounters the mahendo'sat huntership captain Goldtooth, who has brought her \\"a present\\"--Tully, back from human space with what Goldtooth claims is an offer for trade--as well as a packet of documents to be delivered to the mahe government, and an almost unlimited credit with it to soothe any misgivings. But, as once before, there are wheels within wheels in this situation, and Pyanfar and her crew, though they're pleased enough to see Tully again, soon find out that there are things they're not being told. And the sinister gray-skinned kif are after Tully once again, and not disposed to hold their fire if anyone else gets in the way. What's more, Py's husband Khym, who has been deposed by his own son after hani custom, is now voyaging aboard The Pride, a fact considered scandalous by not only his own people but every other oxy-breathing race in the Compact--and he's not sure he wants another male on the ship even if it is an alien.This is just a quick overview of the tangle in which The Pride finds itself enmeshed, as once again trade takes a back seat to politics and interspecies relationships turn murderous, while a representative of the hani council sticks her nose in where it isn't wanted and gums everything up all the more. Though perhaps not quite as fast-moving as the first volume in the series, this one is equally convoluted and suspenseful, and also includes a very helpful Appendix in which Cherryh gives the reader some important background details about the seven Compact species. The various alien characters are well-drawn and fascinating (though the hani are the focus, I admit to a liking for the cheerful, shambling, pidgin-speaking mahendo'sat), and once again the author demonstrates her uncanny skill at making an alien people seem real, sympathetic, and almost less alien than their human shipmate."},{"Title":"Chanur's Venture","review":"This book picks up about a year after &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; leaves off. From the very first moment, you're caught up in the plot and furiously trying to turn the pages faster and faster in order to see what's going to happen. But, then, after about 170 pages of extremely well written, tightly packed, emotionally wrenching, pages, right at the very pinnacle of tension, it ENDS! Aaaargh! There's no excuse for this except pure greed on the part of the publisher. This book should never have been published without its sequel, &quot;The Kif Strike Back.&quot; I feel really bad giving such an excellent piece of work such a bad rating. But, unless you have the sequel handy (perhaps as part of the &quot;omnibus edition&quot; &quot;The Chanur Saga&quot; (which apparently ends without ITS finish)), I can't recommend you read it.

The POV is fascinating, and the \\"human\\" elements are delightful."},{"Title":"Chanur's Venture","review":"First of all: Have you read _The Pride of Chanur_? If not, stop immediately and go and do it, because this one is the second part of a four-decker and if you attempt them out of order you will have no idea what's going on. Now, then. The story picks up a year or two after Pyanfar Chanur and her crew of cousins have gotten straight with the Han government and with their trading rivals after almost singlehandedly bringing humanity into contact with the more civilized parts of the Compact. However, there are deeply conservative, xenophobic elements among the Hani who would just as soon they had never entered galactic society and that challenge becomes clearer as the plot progresses. The Mahendo-sat, who themselves were the first aliens to contact the Hani a few centuries earlier -- and who also want a piece of the new trade-pie but who aren't as bloody minded about control as the Kif -- are trying to manipulate the situation, even going so far as to use the totally unpredictable, methane-breathing T'ca and Knnn as pawns, and *nobody* understands *them*. If all this sounds complicated, that's because it is. But, if you read from the beginning of the saga through to the end, and if you pay attention, you'll witness one of the most fascinating psycho-political struggles you've ever read. It takes considerable talent to get the reader to understand the internal and external political mindsets and social structures of several very alien races -- and to do it from the point of view of yet another alien race. This is extraordinary stuff -- but start at the beginning. And be aware that the story doesn't end here, not even with a traditional cliffhanger. No, it simply pauses -- and you want to have the third volume ready to hand."},{"Title":"Chanur's Venture","review":"Every title in this series is worth a second and third read.

Cherryh is a great add on to the Pride of Chanur. I can't wait to get started on the next book in this series. Which is the Kif Strike Back.This is a true Sci-Fi book with space travel and creatures of all shapes and sizes. From the Tc'a, which are snake like beasts: \\"On the violet one, a huge serpent form, which moved and shifted restlessly before the waist-up glass.\\" \\" Wrinkled, soft-leather skin with phosphor-glow in the gold, eyespots large as a fist, five of them clustered round a complex trifold mouth/sensor. The tongue darted constantly. The body shifted to this side and that, which Tc'a always did.\\" All the way to the Mahendo'sat which is a dark furred primate like race: \\"And rounding a collection of canisters awaiting dock side pickup, she spied a dark-furred, all but naked shape: mahendo'sat-ordinary encounter anywhere on Meetpoint. But this one flung wide his arms. His eyes lit up, his broad mahen face broke into a charming grin that showed blunt primate fangs all capped in gold.\\" The mahen that was just in the previous quote is known as Goldtooth, which he basically ends up starting the series of mishaps that happens to the Hani crew of The Pride. Hani are basically a lion like race, and The Pride is the name of the ship that this certain Hani crew led by Pyanfar Chanur travel in space with. This book starts you off at Meetpoint Station were Pyanfar is to have a meeting with her old friend Goldtooth. But after this meeting Pyanfar and her crew's situation got bad and then worse and so on. And to think most of their troubles are started all because of some human the Kif are chasing. I am going to stop now because I don't want to give away any more of the books story line.But any way from beginning to end this book kept me in suspense with all the exciting things that kept on happening. But especially the part when Hilfy and Tully were taken. It made me wonder what would happen next. I think that the end of this book was quiet satisfying for a series book.

Cherryh's style of disjoint, clipped sentances along with her lack of detail on so many subjects which are crucial to the understanding of the interplay in the political game she is striving to describe, make reading her books aggravating in the extreme.That is not to say that she doesn't have some good ideas and that her plot is not interesting. She does, and it is. But it is so hard to read!

Kozak's writing is much smarter and funnier than most work in the female sleuth genre, and DATING IS MURDER is fully the equal of its predecessor in humor and depth of characterization. Kozak brings back old friends from DATING DEAD MEN-the inimitable Fredreeq, the redoubtable Joey, the astutely deranged P.B., the singular Uncle Theo, the offstage drawling Rex Stetson-and introduces an array of beguiling new characters. No detail goes astray in the consistently engaging plot, not Richard Feynman or the goose or the cat or the meat mallet, and especially not Conraua (Gigantorana) goliath. The world of the novel is beautifully realized, Wollie's wryly observant voice is a joy, the attraction Kozak conjures between Wollie and Simon is palpable, and the pace never falters.

While the first book started off with a bang, this one starts much slower. Last time I complained that I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight, which wasn't a problem this time around. However, the pace in the first half was a little slow. The plot does kick into high gear in the second half and it was hard to put down after that.Fortunately, the characters are strong, and that helps keep the entire book interesting. Wollie is a very vulnerable character in this book, dealing with her break-up as well as her desire for a child before she no longer can have one. Yet she is strong in her search for Annika, plunging ahead even though there really isn't anything in it for her. Her friends support her and do always have her interests at heart even if Wollie doesn't think so at the moment. I actually liked them better then in the first book.The book is also liberally laced with humor. The first person narration provides lots of laughs from Wollie's slightly sarcastic observations on the proceedings. And Wollie's Thanksgiving with her family provides lots of laughs as well.While the first half drags at times, this is still an enjoyable second entry in what will hopefully be a long running series. I'm already planning on another date with Wollie."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Wollie Shelley is a thirtysomething single woman living in the greater LA area. She does a variety of odd jobs from designing greeting cards and painting murals to being a contestant on a reality dating show. She's working through the heartbreak of having her fianc&eacute; dump her and move to Asia with his daughter. This starts to take a backseat to intrigue when a friend of hers, Annika Gl&uuml;k, disappears.Annika had been in LA working as an au pair for the Quinn family, plus working as a production assistant on Wollie's show, \\"Biological Clock.\\" When Wollie investigates Annika's life, she finds a narcissistic ex-boyfriend, jealous au pairs, and hints at a dark lifestyle that seems at odds with what Wollie and Annika's other friends know of her. Wollie finds herself in the middle of some major intrigue with a drug czar, a new designer drug, and a federal co-agency investigation, not to mention getting over her heartbreak when a new love interest enters her life.Kozak is touted as the new Janet Evanovich or Sue Grafton. She's not. She is, however, a strong new talent who weaves a decent mystery around a chick lit background. Wollie is a likeable heroine, attractive but unaware of it. I couldn't completely warm to her, however, because she embodies too many clich&eacute;s. She's a wimp. Not just in a fight-or-flight situation, but in other day-to-day things like driving. Even though she's a voluptuous six feet, she's a shrinking violet. When she does drive, or stick up for herself, it's almost an accident she makes it through. Another irritating clich&eacute; is Wollie's baby fever. She pines over other people's babies (but not children) and sighs over Baby Gap and strollers. Hasn't this theme in women's fiction grown a bit stale? And what's with all these characters who don't have real jobs or normal names?Those things aside, because I'm sure they do appeal to a portion of the populace, this was an enjoyable book. I can't say I'll rush to my bookseller for more Kozak, but I'd pick up another one of her books if I found it lying around."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"I always wonder if the second book in a series will be as good as the first. So often, they are not. In this case, it is better. Dating is Murder is clever, fun and entertaining as heck. I couldn't put it down. And, the ending sequence was the best I've read all year. Just when you think it can't get better, it does. Kudos, Ms. Kozak."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Because of her friends and the lack of income from her Good Golly Miss Wollies greeting card artistry, Wollstonecraft \\"Wollie\\" Shelley is a contestant on the new reality TV show Biological Clock. Her two pals entered her name and key stats, big chest, big legs, big bod and she was accepted as the perfect six foot contrast to the other female contestants. Wollie would trade in her fifteen minutes of Warhol fame for money so she agrees to the opportunity. Three women date three men with the audience deciding who should mate and produce the next generation.While dating on the air, Wollie's math tutor Annika vanishes. Unable to stay out of the situation, Wollie finds LAPD lacking interest in the case except for a cop wanting to take her out. So Wollie decides to look for the busy Annika, who besides teaching works as a production assistant and as an au pair for an Encino superwoman. As she makes some fumbling progress, a stalker warns Wollie to back off or else. Being Wollie and attracted to the stalker, she chooses or else.Chick lit meets amateur sleuth in Southern California. Wollie is as irreverent as ever though her dates seem a bit livelier than her previous appearance (see DATING DEAD MEN). The story line never takes itself seriously as it spoofs reality TV, chick lit novels, and amateur sleuth who-done-its. The cast starting with Wollie, but also her friends, her TV dates, the stalker, and the missing Annika come together to provide a humorous take on DATING IS MURDER.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Every way I try to sum up this book seems trite and silly: 'zany heroine' and 'impossibly laughable situations' and 'disastrous romances'. But, other than the bit about the police detective (without giving too much away I'm not sure I can say more) seeming incredibly forced and unrealistic, the story was actually pretty entertaining. And it did keep you wondering right up until the end. It's the kind of book you don't want to put down because you just have to know!Not for those who like hard-boiled serious mysteries, but any fan of cozies or the Plum series will probably find this entertaining. The slight character problems aside, it was a fun, fluffy read.My one criticism is a person one (a bit of a crusade, I guess) about the 'math is hard' attitude. I guess I'm just so very tired of women who can't do math, though at least this time it's shown biting her in the rear. It was too easy and stereotypical as a plot device, and perpetuates a sad misconception."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Harley Jane Kozak gives us a clever plot, fast action, and, best of all, lots of good laughs in this second book of hers. Besides lovable Wollie, the book is packed with quirky characters and comical situations. As soon as you fall under good gal Wollie's spell, you find yourself rooting for her as she tries to cope with the likes of the LAPD, or SMC, and the other difficulties of life in L.A. As she tries to make a living with her art work and a role in a reality TV show, she is also compelled to search for her missing math tutor, Annika, even more mysterious than mathematics itself, which baffles Wollie. Forget all about Doc, Wollie's love of the previous book! Now it's Simon, a new mystery man."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"In general, I agree with the other reviews posted here. Our heroine, Wollie, is a perceptive, compassionate and funny woman struggling to survive in the LA maelstrom. She scratches from job-to-job, happily accepting an apartment-sitting gig to save on rent as well as a dubious role on a reality tv show, hoping to win extended life insurance for herself and her mentaly-ill brother.I enjoyed this book and its precedent. My quibble is that I think Ms. Kozak tries to do too much. The byzantine array of plots and subplots introduce us to a cast of characters so large you wish at times you had a scorecord to keep them straight.Given that, Kozak's writing is still energetic and fresh and doesn't reveal any of the burn-out that has crept into the writing of her contempoaries in recent years."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Join Wollie Shelley in her second adventure under the able hands of Harley Jane Kozak as Wollie deals with reality TV, a missing friend, drug lords and frog murals!

It will hold your interest throughout the book and the background on the au pair program was interesting. Without spoiling the ending, I thought it was a little rushed and somewhat of a let down after the reading the whole book. However, I would still recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"This book is better than the first. I am really looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"\\"Dating is Murder\\" is a HUGE improvement over \\"Dating Dead Men\\". The behaviors of the characters were more believable (or easier to suspend disbelief for?), especially Wollie's. I had far fewer \\"huh, why on earth would they do that?\\" moments than I did while reading the first in the series (only one that I can actually put my finger on. What was with the deal with Detective Cziemanski???). I think the story is better, more clearly plotted, and Wollie's anxiety about Annika really drives the story forward. I do think the author seems to write female characters a bit better than men, especially Harley's love interests. They seem to be rather two-dimensional. The world Wollie inhabits is interesting and well-drawn and her friends are a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"What a wondrous, unusual, complex and surprising book. I was carried along into Wollie's world, quite pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this tale. The characters were fun to spend time with, the frog-ish asides were interesting and provided depth to the story, the ending surprised me, and all in all, I enjoyed this world. I will be backtracking to read Kozak's first novel out of order, although I see that readers aren't quite as crazy about it. But I'll try it anyway, since I enjoyed this one so much."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"I really liked Ms. Kozak's first book (Dating Dead Men), but this one is ever better. I love the heroine, the hero is great. And this is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Ms. Kozak's humor is fresh and creatives and have me laughing hard."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Wollie Shelley creates greeting card sayings, but she's also an artist. Currently she's painting a mural for friends while they are on their honeymoon. Her friends talk her into being a game show contestant on the reality TV show Biological Clock. The three female contestants each date the three male contestants. The audience will vote on which couple would make the best parents, but the winners do not have to have a baby.Wollie's friend Annika, who also helped out behind the scenes at Biological Clock, has vanished, and Wollie is convinced she's in danger. Annika's mother calls from overseas, and Wollie decides to help. She begins interviewing the family Annika was an Au Pair for. The police don't take her disappearance seriously.

Is someone on the show connected to Annika's disappearance? Can she finish out the show?I really like Wollie. She is so much fun. She gets herself into many interesting situations, and it's always fun seeing how she'll get out. Her friends are great as well. I like the setting of LA for these novels. I really adds character to the story.This is a fun chick lit, cozy mystery and I highly recommend it. Be aware. You won't be able to put it down as you'll want to know what happens to Wollie next."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"I am glad to say I really liked this book. It's cast of characters reminds me of the Stephanie Plum novels. Laugh out loud moments make this a great read! I hope to see more of Wollie and her friends!"},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"You won't want to put it down for very long.Although the comparison to Evanovich is unavoidable, it's not a copycat book by any means. \\"Detective\\" Wollie Shelley (what a name!) is very much her own quirky person, and the setting is LA (Wollie is living in West Hollywood) rather than New Jersey. This is the first by this author and I look forward to more, although there were enough intriguing comments in this book that she could go back and write one in the period *before* this book.The plot involves a missing au pair. Wollie is a contestant on a cheesy reality TV show called \\"Biological Clock\\" in which the audience will vote on who should be helped to make a baby -- and one of the prizes if she wins will be health care coverage. Besides, she's getting to the age where she may need help to conceive (all of this is told rather humorously with guest experts on the show). Annika has been hanging out on the set because she wants to help produce a similar show in her native Germany. Annika's mother calls Wollie to ask her to find out where her daughter is -- she missed their Sunday phone call and has disappeared. A visit to the police isn't helpful, so Wollie and her friend Joey (one of the show's producers) start investigating on their own, interviewing a number of people. Wollie has an attractive but mysterious man trailing her and warning her off -- but warning her off what? The show? Her investigation of Annika?There's quite a bit of humor in this book, but even more important for me, the book was well-plotted and truly a mystery."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"This follow-up to the tremendously entertaining _Dating Dead Men_ lives up to its predecessor. These books are a cross between mystery and romance--or maybe chick-lit. They have a light touch on the whole boy-meets-girl thing and a light touch on the whole somebody-goes-missing-or-gets-killed thing, and they have many, many laugh out loud moments. Kozak's protagonist Wollstonecraft (Wollie) Shelley is a bit of a ditz, but she's warm and likeable and generally pretty plausible as a character. The story is convoluted, but not unbelievably so. I rather suspect that if I started investigating the disappearance of a German au pair, I'd find a lot of tangents myself.Kozak does a good job of combining humor with some genuinely creepy and disturbing mystery elements. One scene in the book managed to be both gut-wrenching and amusing at the same time. I was put off at first by the absence of the first novel's hero. The romance element of the novels means you get invested in Wollie's boyfriends. But I trusted that Kozak would make the ride pleasant anyway and offer me an equally attractive male foal point for this novel, and she didn't disappoint. I look forward to seeing what Kozak does next."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Imagine being saddled with a name like Wollstonecraft Shelly! Fortunately, she goes by Wollie which is much easier to wrap your eyes around - and so is the statuesque blond bombshell that is the heroine of this second novel by Kozak. Wollie is a Renaissance woman, L.A. style; a greeting card designer, part time muralist, part time returning college student and one of the stars of a super low budget reality TV show called Biological Clock. As bad as that sounds, it is a step up from her last part time job of serial dating (in the awesome debut Dating Dead Men). This time out Wollie's math tutor, who is also a German au pair for a wealthy California family, goes missing and no one seems terribly concerned. Wollie goes on the hunt for her and stumbles into the middle of a joint FBI/DEA drug investigation. Luckily, she also meets a rather sexy Fed named Simon and she is gaining ground as the favorite on Biological Clock. Lots of laughs, a little romance, and a real surprise ending put Kozak firmly in the must be read category, an elite place indeed. Very well done."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"This suspense-based LA novel is written in the insouciant manner of a young woman on the go, desperately trying to make ends meet when she finds herself in the middle of a quandary: what has happened to Annika? And why?Wollie Shelley takes whatever employment she can get, an artist and current game show contestant (\\"Biological Clock\\"), conducting a simultaneous search for Mr. Right (listening to the ticking of her own biological clock). When Annika, a German citizen who also works for the Biological Clock reality show, drops out of sight, Wollie puts her considerable energy into tracking down her missing friend. A simple search becomes ever more complicated as Wollie traces Annika's last few contacts before her disappearance.Eventually, Wollie is forced to turn to the police, another source of frustration, and finds herself caught in an FBI drug cartel investigation. To make matters worse, there may be ties to contestants on Biological Clock, low-budget though it is. Wollie has gotten herself in deeper than intended, but is not of a mind to back out once her sleuthing curiosity is whetted. What's a little danger where friendship is involved? All the better, when \\"that man\\" appears in her life; if not necessarily good timing, Wollie isn't about to practice catch-and-release, although this particular man complicates things considerably.Kozak is an actor familiar with the LA scene, Topanga Canyon denizens and the atmosphere of television reality shows. She puts her experience to work in crafting a likeable character that is part bluff, part tough and seriously concerned for Annika's welfare. Like any well-meaning amateur detective, Wollie gets in way over her head, but is naive enough to remain unaware of the seriousness of her predicament.While Dating is Murder is no Sue Grafton mystery novel (as is suggested on the book jacket), it is entertaining light reading, LA style and the author shows potential. Everything works out in the end as Wollie's mistakes are artfully redeemed by the new man on the horizon. Half mystery, half chick-lit, this novel will find an audience willing to follow Wollie's well-intentioned exploits, not to mention some behind-the-scenes dish on reality TV.

I enjoyed the ending as well as the zany humor throughout the book."},{"Title":"Dating Is Murder","review":"Wollstonecraft (\\"Wollie\\") Shelley would love to have a kid, but fears she's not mother material. She's uneducated, bad at long-term relationships and worse at math - an underachiever designing cute greeting cards, living alone in a cheesy LA sublet.She does odd jobs to get by. For one, she's a contestant on Biological Clock, a reality TV show with poor ratings.It's a low-budget production. Three men and three women are dating each other on camera. Ultimately the TV audience will vote on which contestants they think have the most promising genes and should procreate. The contract releases the winners from any obligation to do it.All this keeps Wollie pretty busy, but when her math tutor Annika, a nineteen-year-old German au pair, disappears, Wollie embarks on an investigation to find her. This will lead to a series of zany and terrifying entanglements with murderers, drug dealers, plumbers, paparazzi and law enforcement types, one of whom is extremely attractive.Wollie is a stunning blonde, six feet tall and startlingly well endowed. TV viewers want to know, are they real? And yes, they are. She's a wonderful combination of high minded, frivolous, inquisitive, friendly, unathletic and determined. Almost everything she thinks and does is funny.In fact, this is the funniest book I've read since my first Harley Jane Kozak book, Dating Dead Men. I can think of no more delightful way to escape the grim realities of life than locking yourself in somewhere with this book.

I can't wait until she finishes her next book.I am fascinated by her style of writing, her choice of words, her comfort with her characters and their surroundings. She always has that extra little phrase or dialogue that makes you feel that these people are real to her.

Mutiny at sea, a husband and his pregnant wife stranded on an unknown African shore and that's just for openers! In 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs created one of the most enduring fictional characters in literary history:Tarzan. Burroughs had a knack for story telling and of creating alien worlds and cultures in amazing detail. In &#34;Tarzan of the Apes&#34; (the first book in a long series) ERB takes you back to the beginning , back to focus on Tarzan's early life and the primitive world he grew-up in. Over the years I've read this novel many times and it has never lost its appeal. ERB's narrative conjures up mental pictures of incredible power: the baby Tarzan nursing at his foster mother's breast, the finding of his human-parent's tree-house and the treasures it contained, his first contact with other humans and the love-hate relationship he had with the native people that killed his ape-mother Kala. Was Burroughs &#34;politically correct&#34; in his portrayal of all the side characters and issues that fill out the narrative? That's for the reader to decide, just keep in mind that both the author and the novel he created are a product of the times He lived in and should not be judged by 21st century standards. Right or wrong the world was what it was. So buckle up and prepare for an action packed ride to a steaming tropical jungle filled with danger, intrigue and mystery. When the beautiful fair haired stranger, Jane Porter, finds herself in the hairy arms of a huge bull-ape and all hope is lost, then only Tarzan can save her from &#34;a fate worse than death&#34;.

Although as a rule I think it's silly to judge works from the past by the standards of today, it's hard to get around the fact that TARZAN OF THE APES is racist. Not racist in passing, the way, say, DOCTOR DOLITTLE is. TARZAN is racist--or rather &quot;racialist&quot;--in theme and intent. Take away racialism--the notion that &quot;good breeding&quot; results in superior creatures--and there's not much left but lots of cool action sequences and exotic settings. Mind you, it's no simple white supremist tract. Most of the whites in the book are portrayed, as an earlier reviewer noted, as deceitful, cowardly, and ignorant. (Mind you, there are virtually no flattering portrayals of blacks, either.) But the reason little Lord Greystoke--an orphaned infant alone on the Dark Continent--not only survives but actually climbs to the top of the food chain to become, literally, king of the apes is his superior genes. This isn't just implied, it is argued passionately. There's simply no getting around this aspect of this book. The scary thing about the book is not simply that it is racist, but that the excitement and romance of the book actually make the racist notions attractive. We often like to believe that wrong-headed ideas are obviously wrong to anyone who encounters them, but behind most wrong-headed ideas is something seductively attractive. TARZAN illustrates that dramatically. When I read it, one portion of my brain deconstructs the Victorian colonialist paradigm that lies at its heart, but another portion goes all fuzzy and just revels in precisely that same politically-incorrect paradigm. For an adult who can indulge in that fantasy, and then resurface unscathed (?) at the other end, Tarzan is a wicked delight. But would I give it to my nine-year-old son (who is himself &quot;biracial&quot;) without first having a long talk with him about history and so-called &quot;race&quot;? No. On the other hand, a politically correct prep talk might have just the opposite effect I intend. Better to let him discover the book himself when he's grown up and less likely to be seduced by scary notions from a dark past. Then we can talk about it over a beer.Incidentally, anyone who knows anything about apes may be appalled by the apes in TARZAN. Gorillas are, of course, generally very placid, and chimpanzees, while often violent, are never subject to the kind of murderous frenzies Burroughs' apes are. Note, though, that Burroughs has cleverly dodged zoological nitpicking by making *his* apes of a species unknown to human science, a kind of missing link that bridges the apes we know and ourselves.Considering all this, I think Disney must be given credit for painstakingly removing the ugly premise of the original while still managing to retain much of what makes the book so thrilling. But that they did so at the expense of Clayton--one of the few decent humans in the book, turned by Disney into a cookie-cutter villian--is a shame."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I first read the Tarzan series when I was ten. I read them again while in high school. During graduate school I gave my complete collection away. Now in my mid-50's, I have once again discovered the Tarzan books.

Tarzan is a hero who never grows old."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes features one of the most well known characters ever, Tarzan. He has been depicted in film after film both in the silent era and during sound. However, this book is very different from the popular films starring Johnny Weismuller and is just as entertaining.Tarzan was born in a wild jungle of Africa where his wealthy and important English family was stranded after mutiny on the ship on which they were traveling. When his parents succumbed to their environment, a lonely mother ape took their baby and raised him as her own. In the jungle, Tarzan adapted to his environment to become a fierce warrior though he always felt that he was different from the others. Later, when more victims of mutiny find their way to the same shore 20 years after Tarzan's parents, Tarzan comes into contact with his own race for the first time and finds love in the beautiful American Jane.Most of the book is about Tarzan in the jungle with wild animals and savages. There is little dialogue, but it is still a fascinating read. When he does meet humans, the story becomes a bit more dull, though the parts with Tarzan and Jane radiate with sexual tension. It's an amazingly well written story, one that keeps the reader wanting more. Thankfully, there are several sequels."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This edition is adapted by Harold and Geraldine Woods. It is not the story as written by Edgar Rice Burroughs but a simple retelling for young children."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I personally enjoyed the book, and finished reading it in just three days. The first few chapters were really good---exciting, gripping and helluva interesting. I couldn't put it down. The reason why i gave it 4 stars and not 5, however, was because i found the relationship between Tarzan and Jane so stale. It occupied only, say... a bit of the book? And everytime jane was mentioned, I wish the author painted a better picture of her. She was either invovled in some trouble and needed help from the hero ( it always seems so) OR she had fainted. Thank goodness the action saved everything. It isn't stomach-squirming bloody..... you feel like killing a lion or some animal after reading this book. read it for the action, but don't bet too much on Jane."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This was a great book from beginning to end. It had a great story line and a good ending to it. I really liked reading this story and it's really the first I would really recomend for someone to pick up. that's why I gave this book a five-star rating."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan was a book that kept me waiting to find out what happened next. It is a story about a man who, as a child, was adopted by an ape when his own parents died in a forest in Africa which no men lived in. The story follows him as he grows through all the adventures that he has and even as he falls in love with the beutifull Jane. To find out more you muts read it yourself."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This book is a classic. It is not at all the chessy sterio-type &quot;Me Tarzan, You Jane&quot; that has overtaken our society. It is a classic tale that sweeps you away, and the writing is sophisticated enough to make this tale seem real. Whether you believe it or not--well, that's up to you."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"As a young teen I began reading the Tarzan series...I read all that were available at the time, and I read them many, many times. I always believed, and always will, that Tarzan is a wonderful role model for humanity to follow. He is the noblest of all the beasts, including Man. His heroism and strength combined with his compassion and intelligence make for a superhero of almost Godlike proportions...yet, not beyond the reach of the impressionable minds of a developing teen. I recommend this series of books to all parents out there if you want your child to have a positive role model in this world of not so desireable public figures. Tarzan is so much more than an ape man...he is the original SUPERMAN!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I found it quite refrshing to read a novel with vocabulary. I've become very disappointed with todays papermill of novel with the same old bland plot written to sell so I've returned to classics such as Tarzan which I've never read before now. I sure wish I had read this as a kid. Great stuff. I've passed them on to my young nephew. A good plot with a James Bond style adventure."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes is a great book that most people, mistakenly, will think they know about. They are mistaken because most people know Tarzan from the movies, TV, comics, etc. which do not come close to portraying the book. The first four books in the series (Tarzan of the Apes, Return of Tarzan, The Beasts of Tarzan, and Son of Tarzan) should be read as a series of 5-star books that tell a continuous, exciting, and engrossing story. These books can be re-read dozens of times as the years go by and still seem exciting each time (even 50 years later). Most of the other books in the Tarzan series are still enjoyable, and recommended, but they are a bit formulaic, especially the late ones."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs improbable but entertaining novel of a young English lord (Greystoke) and his wife marooned on the west coast of Africa. Both die shortly after the birth of their son, who is adopted by Kala, a female great ape who has lost her own baby. In best Darwinian fashion, the child thrives on jungle life. In Tarzan, we have the physical perfection of a wild animal that is guided and animated by a human brain. Lots of fun adventures here. Good old-fashioned escapist reading. Caution: This book will be considered racist (somatotyping, etc) by modern standards but was (sadly) well within the societal norms of its day."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is one of the few \\"classics\\" that I truly enjoyed reading. This is a fun book. Very entertaining. Burroughs' language, while very British, is simple enough to draw the reader into the action, of which there is a lot.From the beginning, Burroughs does not slow down much to describe feelings of the characters, only those necessary to continue the story. He simply goes on with the action, which makes for a fast-moving story. The chapters are short, as well, which makes for quick reading.I had one complaint with the character of the boy Tarzan, and that was his seemingly unending ability to learn. He finds a book and in a couple of years, he recognizes the characters enough to know how they relate to the pictures. Then he finds a pencil, and, after marking up a desk for a while, suddenly comes up with the idea to copy the characters in the book. A ten year old boy is going to come up with that on his own? And by eighteen he is fully fluent, with the help of a dictionary.Also, I did not like how the ending is a sort of cliffhanger, which leaves the reader wondering what will happen next. However, it does guarantee that I will read The Return of Tarzan, which is, I suppose, the intent.Along the way, one does get caught up in the romance angle with Jane Porter, especially knowing her standing in the Tarzan canon. It is this angle which makes the ending all the more frustrating. One wishes to know for sure that they will end up together, in spite of interference from her previously intended.One English phrase that comes to mind to describe this book is that it is \\"a ripping good yarn.\\" I look forward to reading others in the series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This book is easily one of the best I have ever read. I couldn't put it down!! Edgar Rice Burroughs made Tarzan seem so real. I'm going to read all of the other books in the Tarzan series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I'll leave a review of the story for others. This review pertains to the binding, quality of paper, and general presentation of the book.The paper is acid-free per Library of America (LOA) Standards. Harback color and dust jacket, as the first reviewer stated, appear to harken back to the original. The binding is strong/tight. The book looks great and feels good in your hands. Not your usual flimsy paperback or hardback with pages that will go yellow. The words are larger than than those in the excellent Penguin Classics hardback library. LOA did a smiliarly fantastic job with Burroughs' book A Princess of Mars (first John Carter book).If you like well-bound classics that will not dissolve in ten years, this is for you!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"There are books that everyone 'knows' but hardly anybody reads any more. Reading these classics can be quite illuminating; they are not what you think. For example, do you really know how Dracula was killed? Or why The Virginian said \\"Smile when you call me that\\"? Read the originals; you'll be surprised.\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\", the first of 23 Tarzan adventures by Edgar Rice Burroughs, is full of surprises. The Tarzan of this book is not the Johnny Weissmuller or Ron Ely that you might know. He is not raised by gorillas (as I had thought) but by mythical 'anthropoids', a sort of missing link between man and gorilla, with rudimentary speech and a social structure that includes ritual and dance. This is a science fiction tale, a sort of \\"Lost World\\" meets \\"Jungle Book\\". Tarzan befriends and converses with (and kills and eats) a variety of beasts.There are aspects of the story that modern readers will find as hard to swallow as some of Tarzan's raw meat dinners. For example, this jungle is populated with lions, hyenas and elephants, creatures that in reality never go near rain forests. We are also asked to believe that Tarzan teaches himself to read and write from books that he finds.Many modern readers will also find the racialism difficult to take. He boasts of being \\"Tarzan, killer of beasts and many black men\\". Coming on a village deep in the jungle, he immediately readies his bow and poisoned arrows. When his European companion admonishes him that it is wrong to kill humans, the hero protests \\"But these are black men\\". (Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't believe that scene was included in the Disney version). This is a 1914 American novel, with all the prejudices intact.It's quite well written; Burroughs is very readable. The plotting is a strange mixture of ingenuity and clumsiness. There is a very clever device that involves Jane thinking there are two ape-men, one an admirer, the other her rescuer. But the plot also requires three separate mutinies, two of which just happen to involve cousins, to take place off the same remote African beach. This is beyond coincidence.So is this genre classic still worth reading? I think so, for the same reason \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Virginian\\" are still worth reading; this is the book that started it all."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs, now catalogued as a classic writer actually became instantly famous before this book with his Princess of Mars book published in 1912, while this book later in 1914. The story of a lost boy in the jungles of Africa where the parents are mauled and killed by Apes, and likewise, the son taken up and raised as one. If you are familiar either with the new Disney rendition or the Hollywood Johnny Weissemuller versions, then you just have not met Tarzan, Lord Greystoke. Both Hollywood and Disney do an injustice, not only to Burroughs, but also to the story and the writing. Embarking on this book, I expected a quick fun, high adventure story that gets to the point without finesse or care of the medium. But E. R. Burroughs gives you all the excitement with the careful delivery of choice words to put you there. There is a lot more emotion centered around this book than one may expect from a jungle adventure. Subtle, but poignant are his words and a visual clarity of the personalities and action make this a worthwhile read, and certainly a classic that can stand next to many other verbosely exaggerated popular classics (I am not mentioning Dickens)."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs will never be nominated for world's great writer. But to quote Stephen King, &quot;it's all about story dammit, story. Edgar Rice Burroughs knew this better than anyone.&quot; In Tarzan of the Apes you will discover the true meaning of &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot; You will not care about the geographical liberties Burroughs takes with Africa. The fact that Tarzan's jungle has lions and elephants which live in the more arid regions of Africa. All you will care about is &quot;travelling along the middle terrace&quot; of Tarzan's world and racing along to his next adventure. You will cheer for the heroes and utterly loathe the villains. Also do not expect the grunting, snorting, and nearly mute Tarzan of film. In all 24 Tarzan books he never said, &quot;me Tarzan, you Jane.&quot; you will find in Burroughs' Tarzan a symbol of every ones desire to go primitive. If you are not a fan of highly imaginative fiction avoid this book at all costs. But if you do love a good STORY by all means pick up this book."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This, the first of the Tarzan series, sets the stage and ground rules for all subsequent Tarzan novels. When Tarzan's aristocratic and ship-wrecked English parents perish on the coast of Africa, the baby Tarzan is nurtured and raised by Kala, the mighty she-ape. If you are looking for literature, this is not for you. However, if what you seek is old-fashioned adventure, excitement, bloody battles and unlikely coincidences that advance a fast-moving and easily read plot, this pot-boiler is for you. As it was for me. Begin at the beginning, and read the original inspiration for all the movies about the Lord of the Jungle."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I was a little bummed. I got this after reading an unedited version and was disappointed to find this one was censored. Not even the Modern Library Classics edition presents the entire, original text.Apparently, sometime in the 60's, the Burroughs estate excised certain things to make it seem less racist. Reading it now makes me wonder what's the point."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The writing is largely crisp and no-nonsense, more interested in telling its tale than bogging down with &quot;what it all means&quot;. It paints vivid pictures of the African jungle and what life would be like for a man who could survive it.The fact that it's &quot;unrealistic&quot; is irrelevant, and more a reflection on our current obsession with &quot;accurately reflecting the world as we believe it to be at this exact moment in time&quot; than with good literature, (Shakespeare is rife with inaccuracies also, so what?).This book was good enough that I spent the next month reading the 25-odd sequels in the series. How many ca. 1915 era books can one say THAT about?"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I have been reading all of his books since I was old enough to first pickup a book. I have read everything he ever wrote, and can say without a doubt his works are still thrilling and engrossing despite the years. Sure, there is nothing politcally correct about his books, but you have to remember WHEN these books were first written..and any attempt to water them down is a travesty. I still have first edition copies given to me by my father who purchased them when they were first published.Lose yourself in one of his wonderful books....step back in time..and enjoy. Recommended for all ages... I still pick them up when I want to be transported to other worlds."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan Of The Apes is one of those rare novels which seems, rather than having actually been written, to have sprung forth fully-formed from the collective unconsciousness. Burroughs' tale of a young English lord raised by savage apes, though somewhat tarnished by its reliance on stereotypes (racial and otherwise), retains the power of primordial myth.There's a lot to be said of Burroughs' writing, both good and bad, but in the interest of brevity I'll simply pass along this caveat: do not start this book without having its sequel (The Return Of Tarzan) on hand. I made this mistake and, as I write this, am cringing in frustration at not knowing the resolution of the cliffhanger ending.Having said that, I highly recommend this to all lovers of adventure fiction."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I read first this book at age of 12 and got a crush for him. Funny thing is that no matter how many years go by, the story hold the magic and charm it had for me back then.Although everybody must have seen the movies of Tarzan and he has become some kind of cliche, I do recommend wholeheartedly THE BOOK. Rice masterfully develops the most appealing character in the smart, funny, strong, innocent, reliable, courageous man who is brought up by animals and wanders alone in what is practically a paradise. It is a beautiful utopia of what human beings could be in nature, that good is deep in our nature and what makes us human goes far beyond culture, remaining intrinsically in the soul.We get to see how Tarzan learns everything by himself, the use of tools and even learn to write and think with words all of his own. The freshness of discovering the world through Tarzan's eyes is an adventure in itself!This first of around 17 books of Tarzan is certainly the best, for the quality of the plot, the characterization, and richness of descriptions of the most lush and exotic settings. It's not too late if you haven't read the book, go grab a copy and you won't regret it no matter what your age be."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The fact that this is a great story is demonstrated in the number of movies, TV shows, graphic novels and written matter based on the main character. There is something very moving, exciting and primeval about a child raised by apes who can move between the world of the jungle and civilization with such ease. And there is something very sexy about a man of power, both physical and mental who has the sensibilities to understand more tender emotions, is loaded with testosterone and is gorgeous to look at. Yeah. Bring him on. Men want to be him and women just plain want him.As reads go this is a great story. Edgar Rice Burroughs entire series is exciting life risking adventure at its best. You want rampaging beasts? Got it. You want half human foes? Got it. You want love with a capital \`L'? Got it. You want shipwrecks? Got it. You want hair raising and impossible escapes? Got it. All the great events that you could want with a hero who overcomes incredible odds and survives in a hostile jungle or pitted against civilized villains are included. All the things that make us love great pulp fiction. Yeah. Even the archaic language gives it interesting flavor. Tasty books.But laced through this great story are little things that keep tripping me out of the story plot into reality by offending my intelligence or my personal \\"righteousness ruler.\\" Even taking into account the date the books were written and the fact that knowledge and attitudes have changed, some of it just pushes the envelope of my acceptance.I find it easy to accept that a higher than average intelligence and physical prowess is possible in such a man, if fact I drool and fantasize about such a man regularly. I find that I can accept the fact that a child could be raised by animals and make the adaption to both worlds... but it might be stretching it a bit. But OK, I want it therefore I can go there. I can even accept that he learned to read without help...a little difficult but OK, maybe. What I can't figure out is how he managed to translate his ape name into English letters without knowing how the letters sounded. But OK, we'll overlook that for the sake of the story which is exciting and stimulating. So, I am with the story this far.What keeps tripping me up, even trying to make allowances for the period it was written, are the very dated attitudes. The many references that indicate the author is of the opinion that the pinnacle of evolution is the male British peer. There are repeated references of black African natives as a sub species or \\"lower order\\" of human, to men as the \\"Lord and Master\\" of women (honestly - his very words), to women as frail and fragile creatures (let's all just faint...) and the totally pathetic helplessness of Jane. I can't imagine recommending this book to certain friends because I know they would not be able to look beyond the attitudes of the time. There is too much painful history or personal experience with these attitudes even now. Too many idiots still out there who still think like this. Although as a woman I find myself rolling my eyes at the sexist bits saying to myself, \\"Aren't we lucky we have progressed beyond this? Now if we could just get equal pay.\\" Because real is me wanting to be part of the story - come on Jane pick up that dead limb and whack that villain with it, instead of cowering in against the bole of a tree in fascinated fear while you watch the man save your hind end one more time. I think the evolution of the race will benefit as much from strong women as men. In fact Tarzan is kind of lucky that Lady Alice died. She would have turned him into a whimp. Go Kala - now that's what motherhood is about.So if you can overlook these things, I say, \\"Great read.\\" That applies to E.R. Burroughs entire body of work. Just watch out for the pitfalls of Victorian BS."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is a classic book. The author Burroughs paints a vivid picture of a savage, half-man, half-animal. This Tarzan is nothing like the movies or the TV show characters that I grew up with.It's no wonder that I never read this in school, the other reviewer was right - this book certainly pre-dates political correctness. It's similar to another classic book set in Africa: The Heart of Darkness. The descriptions of the natives in both of these books at times get in the way of the story.I gave it five stars because the story is very well written. I don't recommend it for children, unless they're mature and the content is discussed afterward.I read Return of Tarzan also, and it really puts closure to this book."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I first encountered Edgar Rice Burroughs back in the mid-1970s, during the last period of his widespread popularity in the USA; at that time nearly all of the books in his most popular series - Tarzan, John Carter, Carson of Venus, Pellucidar - were readily available at most chain bookstores in mass-market paperbacks. I collected a good many of them, and though John Carter was, and is always my favorite, I'd have to say that after 30+ years and many reads this first Tarzan book has now ascended to the peak of my favorites list for this now almost forgotten writer.It's strange that for a writer so talked about, and a character so psychoanalyzed over nearly a century both Tarzan and his creator have so faded from the public consciousness now. I suspect that there are many causes: political correctness has rendered the casual (rarely mean-spirited) racism in many of Burroughs' books anathema to many; the Tarzan character is best known from the films and TV, which nearly always have portrayed him inaccurately and too-simply; and the naivete and romance of the works probably seem old-hat now to those raised on STAR WARS, RAMBO and their progeny.Oh well. To those willing to make the effort and approach the books for what they are rather than what they've become with a century of added meaning and iconography, a treasure might be found. Tarzan bears more in common with heroes such as Conan (probably his most direct and famous descendant) than with the kiddie fare that most people probably think he belongs to. This is a ferocious, always half-wild man caught between the worlds of the jungle and civilization, always in conflict, always a hare's breadth from danger - and often, particularly in later books, the perils from the world of man are clearly far more dangerous to our honorable \\"Forest God.\\"TARZAN OF THE APES recounts the upbringing by a fantastic, carnivorous ape species of the future John Clayton, Lord Greystoke - born to the status of \\"gentleman\\", of exquisite \\"breeding\\" as Burroughs reminds us over and over. The writer seems in many respects a social Darwinist, a believer in the inherent superiority of certain civilizations and ways of life - in this case the British Empire and France - and yet time and again both the omniscient narrator and Tarzan himself remind us that the black \\"savages\\" are no more brutal than many Europeans who may speak in cultured tones and read and write; and that the beasts of the jungle are more noble than all of us. So it's a mixed set of ideas on human nature that we have here, and I'm not sure Burroughs ever really came down in favor of any one of them. In this first novel, Tarzan's upbringing and his violent life as a member of the ape tribe - in particular his actions concerning the native African village that he regularly steals arrows from - are carefully presented as to be completely amoral - Tarzan knows no better - and yet when confronted with a white woman, Jane Porter, who he immediately falls in love with, he somehow finds the \\"instincts\\" of the chivalrous upper-class Englishman taking over. The books are replete with such contradictions - but you have to take them as they are, pulp novels written with just a bit more wit and grace than expected - and you'll find them more fascinating than infuriating.TARZAN OF THE APES moves along at dizzying speed, but is really surprisingly well written and careful in its attempts to describe how this superhuman of high birth and animal upbringing grows up in physical might and in intellect, essentially on his own as almost a new Adam, juxtaposing the worlds of the primitive and the civilized with nearly equal alacrity, but almost always keeping the jungle in his heart. If ultimately the author comes down on the side of the apes, the jungle, the half-naked savage, he's made his case quite well in his simple evocation of a romantic world that was already being lost when he was writing it - and which, of course, was mostly a product of his imagination anyway.And this first book has one of the best - and most infuriating - endings in pulp fiction; Burroughs had already learned from his first success, A PRINCESS OF MARS, to keep 'em hanging. And so he did."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan is not politically correct, is anthropologically naive, is just short of racist, sexist and a certain fantasy. In the end, none of that matters. Tarzan is the hereo upon which all attention centers, and that is how it should be. Edgar Rice Burrough's classic pulp fiction work reads nearly as strongly today as it did almost a hundred years ago. So what if his \\"apes\\" never really existed (although, one is tempted to think of them as some lost tribe of giant Australopithcines, improperly classified and then rendered extinct before they could be correctly classified. Borroughs was writing at the start of the sixth great age of extinctions, after all). Sparing in his prose, as many victorian writers were, Borroughs manages to stir the imagination to treetop heights and we really care what happens to the orphan Tarzan as he becomes a man. Tarzan's initiation into the world of Western man is perhaps more unbelievable than his more gradual and much earlier settling into the ape world, and less satisfying. We lose Tarzan when we lose the \\"ape-man\\" but his devotion to the comely Jane is genuine and compelling. In short, go Tarzan!A note on the booksurge volume: it had a mistake in paragraphing almost certainly not in the original, inconsistent page breaks between chapters, and a back cover blurb which was literally a non-sensical half-sentence. There was no bio of the author or even previous publishing credits. This classic author deserves much better."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I cut my teeth in the 60's and 70's reading Tarzan comics, which then segued to the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. And I am glad that I did!After watching numerous old Tarzan movies and comic books, (which were way better than any movie or cartoon ever made!), the novels breathed more life into the much mishandled Tarzan legend. Burroughs wrote so well, that the jungle came alive, and you can actually believe that a human babay can be raised by wild apes.And now, after all of these long, long, years, since the original novel was written, (1914), finally perhaps a modern-day filmaker will bring the REAL Tarzan to living, breathing life, as it should have been a long time ago. With the hopeful usage of modern CGI, Tarzan can be like Spiderman, truly seen for the first time on film as it is in the books.If you have watched the old and new movies, including the Disney cartoon - then you don't have a clue as to the REAL Tarzan! If this big filmaker director sticks with the original books, or somehow makes it better, like Peter Jackson did for King Kong - then Tarzan will be the biggest blockbuster hit ever!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"A very good story. None of the film adaptations come even close. All the films deviate from the story and none of them come with anything more moving or interesting than the original story. If you've been duped into believing that the Disney version or Greystoke the Legend of Tarzan are true to the book then you need to read this book and see what Tarzan is really all about. The characters are interesting and the action scenes are well written. The story is not deep, but it is compelling and the ending is perfectly bitter sweet. And if you must have a happy ending read The Return of Tarzan; it picks up exactly where Tarzan ends and concludes with a more Hollywood ending."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I thought this book was excelent.

Heaven only knows how long it was sat on my shelf, unread, but when I finally did read it, it rapidly became one of those rare delights - a book I simply could not put down. It really is a truly engrossing story. Exciting, unusual, magnificently written, and I always seem to discover something new each time I read it. And I've read it at least 10 times now.I always find myself imagining the dense African jungle through which the &quot;huge bull-apes&quot; swing effortlessly, and the fights Tarzan has with other apes, and, of course with Sabor, the lioness, are worth reading just as they stand, without the rest of the book.Ever since I first finished the story I've wanted to get hold of the subsequent books - some further adventures of Tarzan. I'm sure they can only be just as good as this one."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I first read this book when I was 10 years old, and it hasn't left me ever since. Never mind the cultural mistakes that E.R.

This book was never assigned or if it was I never completed the assignment. (Sorry Mr. Basillo.)I'm 33-years old and just recently picked up Mr. Burroughs' masterpiece at the urging of a close friend. I suppose I always associated Tarzan with the assembly-line movie creations I was used to watching on Saturdays as boy. This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movies (I especially liked it when Tarzan dove off the George Washington Bridge to escape would-be-captors). They were entertaining -- good for what they were, just a mindless summer distraction between trips to the public pool or romps after the ice cream man. I'm not sure I ever realized that the Tarzan Legend began with a literary masterpiece, or if I did (once), I'd long since forgotten. (After all, it was never on my assignment list.)When I picked up the book, I expected that I was just going through the motions to accommodate my friend's urging. And the first 50 pages left me wondering. . . . But at that point, the tale &quot;took off&quot; offering me some of the most terrific entertainment I've come across in books.Tarzan has come a long way from where he began in 1914. And after reading the book, I'm fairly certain that Johnny Weismuller isn't precisely the image Mr. Burrough's had in mind for his protagonist when he created him. But my reaction as a reader, my amazement at his eloquent depiction of this jungle hero and the sheer joy reading this book brought me, well, that I am sure is more in line with what he had in mind when he penned this masterpiece 90 years ago."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912.

But an extraordinary Africa populated with apes more intelligent than any known ones and in later adventures with a plethora \\"lost cities\\", \\"ant-men\\" or whatever suit ERB in order to deliver a fast paced adventure.As many other reviewers point out do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.Another assumption that closely follows this is: \\"superior traits\\" are inherited directly and a Lord will always be a Lord no matter what the circumstances.The reader may assume all this adventures occurs in an \\"alternate reality\\" that have some common traits with our world such as the ones depicted by Guy Gavriel Kay for example.Now you'll be ready to enjoy the original story of Tarzan as it was delivered by ERB, free from Hollywood changes or comic stereotypes.A couple of English nobles are abandoned by a mutinous crew in the coast of Africa where they barely survive.Adversity proves to be more than what they may endure and both die leaving an infant that is miraculously adopted by Kala an anthropoid that has lost her baby-ape.Protected by her Tarzan starts a life struggle to conquer a space among the over towering brutes.His natural intelligence combined with a strengthening body allows him to survive and in due time lead the ape tribe.ERB ability renders all this astounding fates credible: Tarzan learns to read and write all by himself; Tarzan defeats a Gorilla with his father's knife; Tarzan helps a group of marooned white people and fell in love with Jane; Tarzan...continue delivering one prowess after other... and you'll believe it.I read \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" at my teens and continue reading many of his 23 following adventures, borrowing volume after volume from a nearby library.When I grow up and gain economic independence I bought and kept this book and some more Tarzans.I warmly recommend this series to any reader who is fond to read unending adventures in a magic world.If after reading Tarzan's stories you still want more from ERB try the Martian series, they are almost as good as this one.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"It's difficult to measure the impact of this relatively simple story; one which generated half a billion dollars a few years ago as an animated film.Tarzan of the Apes explores that which is within all of us; those primal drives and abilities which permitted us to survive as a species. Burroughs creates a hero who because of immense potentials and a truly unique maturation becomes a relatively believable &quot;superman&quot;, in some respects; and he does it with engaging prose which sweeps you along and permits you to make that leap of faith necessary to believe in Tarzan.The current criticizms we sometimes see that these books contain &quot;racist&quot; writing are wholly absurd. To say that Burroughs had honest beliefs that Cacausions were superior to other races or sub-groups is simply to say that he grew up more than a century ago. Virtually all whites held such views, and Burroughs would have learned nothing else; nor would have any of our ancestors, including the ancestors of these current critics.However, to allege that Burroughs believed in discrimination based upon the color of one's skin; or that any of his positive characters, including Tarzan, ever engaged in any such discrimination, is utter nonsense. Burroughs examined the absurdity of superiority based upon skin color in his Barsoom (Mars) novels, where he portrays each race as utterly certain of his the inherent superiority of his own race, when in fact they are all clearly the same, except for color. Tarzan's adopted tribe, the Waziri, are portrayed as fierce, intelligent warriors, the equal of any white men. The ape-man himself was discriminated against by the apes, and throughout the entire saga he treats each person as an individual, irrespective of race or creed.In The War Chief Burroughs portrays the Apache as magnificent, intelligent warriors who are every bit the equal of any white man. His books are so far ahead of his time when it comes to dealing with matters of race, prejudice, and equality that it's truly amazing, considering how long ago he wrote them.&quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; is the creation of this mesmerizing character, from his infancy to his adulthood; and encounter with man, and ultimately Jane Porter. The theme enables Burroughs to explore mankind from the perspective of a man who was reared outside civilization; and his insights are often not flattering. Tarzan has all the ingredients we enjoy in a hero. He is handsome, brave, and has physical assets which are far beyond any other man. He also has some unusual, but realistic, attributes. He is arrogant, a loner, and prone to violence. Burroughs didn't ignore those characteristics which one might expect such an individual to be; and that's perhaps why the book and story have remained so timeless and enchanting for nearly a century, and for people all over the world.This is a fascinating, action-filled story which is also thoughtful and interesting. Truly unique, it' a story of adversity and growth; a self-made man; and true love. Anyone who might have gained their impressions of Tarzan of the Apes from film, television, or comic books should take a look at the &quot;true&quot; Tarzan. Burroughs had no idea, of course, what he was creating when he wrote this story. It's just one of those ideas which resulted in a story which somehow achieved almost magical appeal and has continued to do so. It's not a complex story. Pulps didn't lend themselves to complex stories. It's a wonderful story, however; and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan has probably been done and redone as much as any other story and for good reason- the original is a really incredible story. I find Burroughs an amazing author (be sure to check out his science fiction if you enjoy Tarzan and vice-versa). In Tarzan there is some gore that the reader needs to be able to handle, but for those who can handle it, the story is hard to top. One other warning- if you get this book, be sure to pick up the next Tarzan novel (Return of Tarzan) at the same time as the first book ends in a bit of a cliffhanger."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"A ship's mutiny forces a young noble English couple to live on the African coast. They have a child and then die a short time later. Their infant son is adopted by an ape mother and raised as her own. The boy, Tarzan, rises to jungle dominance and subsequently discovers another group of marooned Europeans.I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. This is mindless jungle entertainment at it's best. Of course it's ludicrous that a human baby could survive living with a family of apes. Of course it's silly that the human could not only survive but thrive to become the supreme jungle power. Of course it's ridiculous that he could teach himself to read and write English from books alone. Does all that really matter though? Of course not. Don't expect deep characters, life-changing philosophies, or even intricate plotting. Burroughs wrote this book as entertainment, pure and simple.Burroughs style may be a bit dated but he certainly does know how to write an engrossing adventure tale. He uses tried and true writing techniques like ending chapters on cliffhangers and presenting his protagonist as the underdog in a struggle against all odds. Early on in the book I found myself rooting completely for Tarzan.For the sensitive reader, I'll offer a couple of warnings. First, Burroughs presents native Africans as superstitious, cannibalistic \\"savages\\". Second, the book is surprisingly violent. I'm sure that in the screen adaptations Tarzan never stabbed or throttled to death so many humans and animals.One final caution -- the book ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger. Make sure to have \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" ready."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes is my favorite fictional character of all time, and this book is truly a masterpiece of imagination and adventure.Burroughs first book was &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, wherein his imagination soared to nearly unimaginable heights in creating the world of &quot;Barsoom&quot; (Mars), with heroes and princesses, fliers and sworfighting; honor and love.That story, like &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, was first published in the pulp magazine, &quot;All-Story&quot;. The October, 1912 issue contained the entire story of Tarzan of the Apes, and created an immediate sensation with readers of that magazine.As Burroughs imagination had turned outward (to another world)in his Barsoom saga, he now turned it inwards, to explore the soul of man. Tarzan of the Apes is our distant ancestor. He is primal man, possessed of marvelous potentials and in this instance thrust into an environment which brings those potentials to levels the rest of us can only imagine.He was an &quot;anti-hero&quot; long before such terms existed. A man whose values and behaviors are based in rational survival and self-interest in a savage jungle, and who has little use for many of the conformist (and often corrupt) values and behaviors of civilization. With a bit of faith you can accept him, and once accepted he will thrill you. Savage, intelligent, loyal, ruthless, brave, and possessed of wondrous physical skills, Tarzan of the Apes has thrilled millions upon millions.He is the ultimate individualist, and Burroughs examines and compares his hero (and the jungle itself) to our own values and behaviors throughout the books.He was not the first feral child in fiction, nor the last; but it is obvious that Edgar Rice Burroughs had created something almost magical when he put down his pen on May 14, 1912, after writing &quot;The End&quot; to this handwritten manuscript. Tarzan of the Apes became a true phenomenon. He speaks to feelings and drives which exist deep within all of us. His world is gone, but it will always reside within these books; and this first story is a unique blend of love and the creation of one of the most famous fictional characters of all time. If you have never met the &quot;real&quot; Tarzan of the Apes, you should do so."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is a great book for youngsters. It is a classic adventure story. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a great tale of adventure. I read this book in junior high school and then again in high school. I recently reread it again now in my thirties. It is still a compelling read. One grows to care for Tarzan of the Apes. The movies do not do it justice. The original is the best. A lot of the subsequent Tarzan novels do not measure up to this one. It is a bona fide classic of adventure fiction. It deserves a place next to works by Rider Haggard and Zane Grey. I find myself waxing nostalgic for youth gone by and Tarzan of the Apes is right there. A fun read at any age."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I have had this book for years and never thought I would like it because of the Tarzan portrayals in the movies. But I was pleasantly surprised by the well written adventures of the jungle lord. Rice Burroughs has fully captured the essence of a man who comes to see civilization with the eyes of a child but the heart of a warrior. His great love for Kala the apemother and Jane his future mate were written beautifully. I recently saw Disneys Tarzan and the Chris Lambert film Greystoke the Legend of Tarzan and they both capture the story of Tarzan as Burroughs envisioned it. I truly enjoyed the book and recommend it highly. I cant wait to read more of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs created in Tarzan of the Apes, the single most recognized character around the world. The story of an orphaned human baby raised by apes and coming into his own in the savage jungle of turn of the century Africa is both gripping and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This first in the series of the Tarzan books is a enjoyable read. Imagine growing up without any human contact. I can imagine that and how it might change the very essence of our makeup and what we value. I found myself able to delve deeper into that sensory deprivation and the effects lack of human contact would have on developing children as I read the book. This book makes you think and consider the effect our environment and caretakers have on who we are.It's astounding that a person raised among wild beasts could develop unaided a sense of morality, or right and wrong, yet Tarzan does and judges his first humans he meets to be cruel. I do not find it hard to believe or contemplate because I have often seen evidence that animals do have their own sense of right, wrong, humane, inhumane and indeed charity. If you have missed animals interacting with each other in pack settings you have missed one of life's great trills and learning experiences. Common is the care a mother animal gives to her own young, but less common is the care pack members will often show to a sick or aged member of their group. One cannot doubt that animals are endowed with feelings; ethics and morality after watching a young pack member carry food to an aged or ill member of the pack. I have many times witnessed this solicitous caring behavior in the animal kingdom therefore it is not hard for me to imagine Kayla the ape, taking up the care of baby Tarzan.And as for the orphaned infant Tarzan, It was easy for me to imagine how Kayla might become as dear to the orphaned boy as any human mother would to her son. It was heartening to watch Tarzan's sense of humane treatment and charity evolve even in a environment where he had no human contact.This book is an interesting read. Full of action, and an underlying love story, complete with historical period specific content that makes it a fun read. I was disappointed in the end, only because it's apparent the author had a sequel in mind and left his readers wanting more. Still all and all I give this book thumbs up. And the author will have his way, I will read the next and perhaps the entire Tarzan series.Kudo's to Amazon for offering it among their free books.Note: This would be a great book to read with 6-11 year olds and have them illustrate the characters as the book is read and developed."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Despite having recently celebrated his hundredth birthday, the unforgettable wild man from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes is still going strong. But just what is it that makes Tarzan and his adventures so memorable? The truth of the matter, it is the high quality of work with which Burroughs spun this tale that makes its protagonist's feral scream resonate through society's subconscious.Before recommending this book, I must establish that it is not the same as the Walt Disney Pictures Tarzan of 1999. Just because you liked the movie does not inherently mean that you will like the book. There are quite a few major events which the Disney Corporation altered to make a suitable family movie. Personally, I enjoyed both the movie and the book, but the would-be reader should be aware of the discrepancies.The premiere reason the book was a success was the complexity with which Burroughs gave birth to the book's namesake. Tarzan began life as any other British boy might: with a mum and dad. However, do to a tragic series of unforeseen events, the young lad comes to live among apes. The book follows his youth as he grows and encounters new things, such as the lovely, young Jane Porter. Because of his uncanny rearing Tarzan becomes a robust, albeit contradicting, young man. His intricacy is shown in his handling of things. When he wrestles with a bull gorilla, Tarzan uses all his strength and ferocity to bring him down. Conversely, when confronted with maiden Jane, he is sure to swing gently through the jungle so as not to hurt her. Furthermore, Tarzan is intellectually inharmonious. Though he never had a formal education, the jungle dweller is quite smart. Upon discovering a book, he taught himself to read without having ever heard a single word of any language save those of the animals.Finally Tarzan is emotionally paradoxical. Though he did not grow up in the \\"civilized\\" word, Tarzan often behaves better than those who did. For instance, he only kills when necessary, say in self-defense, or out of revenge, like when his ape mother Kala was killed. Killing for pride or wealth holds no appeal for him. Furthermore, Tarzan never lies or behaves deceptively. Because he thinks others behave the same way, he is even portrayed as somewhat gullible.In conclusion, Tarzan of the Apes is a well-rounded book. It contains not only swashbuckling adventure but also romance and an interesting in-depth look into the human psyche. If you remotely like any of these things, this is the book for you, so be sure to swing into Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan the king of the apes is a story written 100 years ago and it has sparked many movies and continuous spinoffs in stories. John Clayton is an abandoned infant and he was adopted by apes. Tarzan is his ape name. He and his parents are abandoned on the coast of Africa and his parents quickly die and John is adopted by a female ape mother who has lost her child.Fighting and growing up among the apes has made Tarzan strong, quick and wise in the way of the animals. He proves himself in multiple confrontations with the larger and more powerful apes and ultimately becomes their king. His semi-educates himself in the ways of mankind by learning how to read.This is an excellent story and the good thing about it is that it is not been tampered with by Hollywood screen writers or reinterpreted into a cartoon story. It is the original, a good story that is entertaining and one that you should read and enjoy. That is one of the benefits of having a Kindle is that the classics are available to you for free or at very good prices. I enjoyed this story and I believe that you will also. I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I have watched the old movies for years and felt it was time to read the book to see how accurate the movies are compared to the book. Totally enjoyed the book, minor differences but that's what made it interesting. Plan on reading more of them soon."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"As I write these words, the character of Tarzan is rapidly approaching the century mark. Making his initial appearance in the October 1912 issue of \\"All-Story Magazine,\\" in the original Tarzan novel \\"Tarzan of the Apes,\\" Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation proved to be so popular that the author went on to create 25 more novels featuring the jungle swinger. Released in book form two years later, the novel is a perfect introduction to the character who has been called the best-known fictional creation of the 20th century. Like many others, my only previous familiarity with Tarzan was via the Johnny Weissmuller films of the '30s and '40s--all dozen of them--and, to a lesser degree, those featuring Bruce Bennett, Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker and Gordon Scott (I have never gotten a chance to see the 1918 silent film \\"Tarzan of the Apes,\\" starring Elmo Lincoln). Thus, my first encounter with the character in his original form, in the year of his centennial, has proved something of a revelation for this reader.In the book, as most of the world has known for a century now, we encounter a \\"young English nobleman\\" whom Burroughs, in an effort to disguise his identity, dubs John Clayton, aka Lord Greystoke. Clayton and his very pregnant wife, Alice, are marooned on the western shore of equatorial Africa in 1888 by a band of shipboard mutineers. A son is born, Alice goes mad and later dies, and Clayton himself is killed when a group of great apes attacks him in the cabin he has built. His 1-year-old son is taken by Kala, a female ape who has just lost her baby, and raised as her own in the tribe. Dubbed Tarzan (ape talk for \\"White-Skin\\"), the baby grows to become healthy and self-reliant. Strong enough to fight off gorillas, lions, leopards and the other apes, his fighting skills only improve when he discovers a knife in his dead father's cabin and when he teaches himself to use a rope, not to mention the poisonous arrows that he constantly steals from the local tribe of cannibals. But Tarzan is much more than just a hunky specimen. Mentally inquisitive, he teaches himself to read and write using some books in his father's small collection (one of the novel's more touching sequences), and is thus able to communicate, somewhat, when, 21 years later, another group is marooned by mutineers on this same spot...a group that includes the 18-year-old woman, Jane Porter, with whom Tarzan falls in love....Tarzan (need it even be mentioned at this late date?) is a marvelous creation, practically a demigod of the jungle, who functions almost as a superhero in the African scenes and as a deus ex machina in the book's final segment, set in northern Wisconsin, of all places. The remarkably prolific Burroughs was still a tyro writer at this point, and though no one would ever claim that his prose is sparkling or lyrical, it is still highly readable, and his story has great drive and sweep. It is a book nearly impossible to put down, with its chapters arranged in cliffhanger fashion, often with parallel story lines developing at once. Burroughs throws in any number of terrific fights and action scenes to please the reader, a nice romantic subplot (the romance between Tarzan and Jane concludes most realistically and touchingly, paving the way for the first sequel, 1915's \\"The Return of Tarzan\\") and some incidental humor (such as the hapless exploits of Jane's father, the impossibly absentminded Prof. Archimedes Q. Porter, and his assistant, Samuel T. Philander). The book is pure fantasy, of course (it was deservedly chosen for inclusion in Cawthorn & Moorcock's excellent overview volume \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books\\"), and a far cry from the much more \\"realistic\\" African romances of H. Rider Haggard, especially as seen in his 14 Allan Quatermain novels. But then again, Haggard had actually lived in Africa (from 1875-1881), and had soaked up the land's lore and customs (as well as worked as an ostrich farmer), before he ever wrote his first book; Burroughs, on the other hand, had never been to Africa before, and for him, the continent is a land of pure fantasy. Fortunately, he proved to be such an adept writer that his lack of actual experience there became a nonissue. Oh...it has been mentioned that Burroughs was inspired by Kipling's \\"Jungle Books,\\" as well as by the myth of Romulus and Remus, in his creation of Tarzan. But Burroughs was a fan of Haggard, and it seems very possible to me that it was the Haggard character Hendrika the Baboon Woman, who appears in the 1889 Quatermain novel \\"Allan's Wife,\\" who may have been the most obvious antecedent. Just a personal hunch....\\"Tarzan of the Apes,\\" great and classic as it is, is hardly a perfect novel. The author is way too dependent on coincidence to move his plot along, and is guilty of some casual racism as regards his cannibal characters and Jane's maid, Esmeralda, who functions, in essence, as a 300-lb. female Stepin Fetchit. He makes a few flubs during the course of his story, such as when Jane says that the treasure that is the object of her father's quest was buried in the early 1500s, \\"nearly two hundred years ago,\\" and when Jane tells her French rescuers that Tarzan had returned her to the cabin clearing \\"two days ago\\" (it had actually been three). But these are minor matters. The bottom line is that the book is so exciting and touching that minor matters of prose and boo-boos fall by the wayside. It should prove a genuine eye-opener for those unfamiliar with the original Tarzan character. Just as it is startling to see Mary Shelley's Monster speak perfect English in her 1818 \\"Frankenstein\\" novel, how odd it is to see Tarzan speak in perfect French, use words such as \\"progenitor\\" and drive a motor car! I cannot imagine any reader NOT wanting to learn more; for this reader, \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" will surely come next."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Although I have read others of Burrough's stories, I shied away from Tarzan.

If you enjoy adventure, action, and even a little brutaltiy (I won't judge because I enjoyed it in this book.) then this is the book for you. Disney has once againg lied to us!Yes, blacks were sterotyped as savages and just plain dumb while white were the top of human progression. Honestly though, Burroughs died in the 1950's and he was refering to the wild African tribes. In his next book, Tarzan becomes good friends with another tribe. Those who think this is a racist book are sadly mistaken. Enjoy the book, and enjoy the adventure."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Burroughs was very much a product of his era, there are elements here that are not politically correct. Having said that, this is a fantastic yarn. ERB had not gone to Africa. He had spent time with the 7th Cav, in Arizona, and the Tarzan he describes is an English lord who learns first French, then English, rapidly, to communicate with Jane. The traits ERB has for Tarzan are a Victorian filtering of the Apache Scout, as described in Tom Brown Jr's. books, such asGrandfather, andThe Vision: The Dramatic True Story of One Man's Search for Enlightenment. This is an entertaining tale. Tarzan is a skilled tracker-Tracking and the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks and Signgoes into more detail. Of course there is a treasure. ERB had quite an imagination, and this is still a good read today.

The story was the tale of \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\"In \\"Tarzan\\" Burroughs displayed his total ignorance of Africa and his inability to recognize ridiculous plot twists. His first draft populated Africa with tigers (changed to panthers in later editions), and it abounded with impossible situations. Tarzan taught himself to read by staring at the pages of some books he found. Later, when he had occasion to write a note to some European interlopers into his domain, he signed his name to the note and gave it a correct phonetic spelling. Now how could he possibly know how to spell in a language he had never before heard spoken? Even as a child of 12, I could see the inconsistencies, improbabilities, and impossibilities of the story. Nevertheless, I read the book straight through at one sitting. Revisiting it as an adult, I could still enjoy the action-packed story.Fortunately, Burroughs got better as he added to the corpus of Tarzan books, but he was never able to write a story completely free of improbable plot twists. Despite its shortcomings, \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" is must reading for any Tarzan fan. Remember, Burroughs did get better as he wrote more stories."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" is the first in a long series of Tarzan books.

Intertwined is love for his ape mother, curiosity about his own people, and an eventual love story as Tarzan sets out to win Jane's affection.The story predictably saw Tarzan overcome great adversities, but I was surprised at the ending!

Tarzan is presented a bit wilder than in the movies. Once again, Burroughs' imagination isamazing."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs is the famous novel of the boy who was raised by simians in the jungles of Africa. The book was first serialized in All-Story Magazine 1812 and published in 1814.John and Alice Clayton (Lord and Lady Greystoke) are abandoned on the coast of Africa after a mutiny on their ship. They barely survive but manage to create a shelter and have a baby; however they are no match to the jungle animals who despise the strangers. Their infant though has been adopted by Kala, a female ape who recently lost her own son. Protected by Kala, Tarzan (white skin) grows in a society filled with towering brutes who wonder why the small white ape takes so long to grow up.Tarzan's natural intelligence, strong body and Kala's protection allows him to survive and even thrive in the unforgiving jungle. One day another group of whites is marooned in the same place the Claytons died, with them is an American female from Baltimore, Maryland named Jane Porter. When Tarzan sees Jane his world changes and he helps the defenseless and nave whites survive the harsh reality which they've been thrown into.A few weeks ago I put in a request to reviewJane: The Woman Who Loved Tarzanby Robin Maxwell, the Tarzan story from the perspective of Jane (post coming next week). I then decided to re-read the original Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs to refresh my memory has it has been decades since I read it first.I did not regret that decision for a moment and can certainly understand why Tarzan achieved a cult icon status. Burroughs wrote an exciting novel, making the unbelievable seem somewhat plausible in a story which tags on the readers' imagination almost every page.The characters, especially that of Tarzan, are masterfully written, combining intelligence and wisdom. We have grown up on a character of Tarzan who barely speaks, but in the book he is a complex character with intelligence and brawn to match. The character is written with childlike innocence and alarming violence which in turn makes Tarzan an interesting and complex character.The beginning of the book deals mostly with Tarzan's parents, John and Alice Clayton, who have found themselves in the midst of a tragedy despite their best efforts. We are all used to stories of hope, Burroughs played that angle wonderfully, I still felt saddened by their untimely end which was sad and violent despite knowing of their demise ahead of time.Each chapter it seems is a new adventure in which Tarzan learns a new skill, whether it is to read or to use a weapon. Tarzan feels conflicted between his identity as a member of the ape society and his self taught skills which put him above a physically superior specimen.Tarzan, being a product of his upbringing, sees everyone as sub-human, including whites - until he meets Jane (and later D'Arnot). Tarzan feels the apes are intellectually inferior, the natives are physically inferior and the whites are morally substandard.We could learn a lot from Tarzan, who helps the innocent and helpless without sacrificing himself or his goals. The protagonist does not need, nor does he understand, social approval or society prestige, he has enough self esteem to ignore the opinions of others. Tarzan accepts what cannot be changed while trying to change while he can. The character represents, in my eyes, man's nobility untouched by societal norms.The writing, as it is the product of its times, is sophisticated and formal despite the story's unbelievable premise. The style works well especially when depicting acts of violence, it lends the horror prestige, almost noble, quality; animals kill for food or defense - they don't torture unlike mankind.I enjoyed Tarzan of the Apes more now than I did as a kid, a true testament to the enduring entertainment value of this book. The prevailing image of Tarzan, as a grunting brute, does no justice to the three dimensional hero portrayed in the books."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"It was such a joy to read this book again. I have read it at least twice before. This has to be the 1st romantic thriller ever written and guess what folks--no sex scenes.

Now that I've finally read it, I did enjoy it but not as much as I'd hoped. It's fairly short and a lot happens within the few hundred pages. As a result, the plot advances quickly which made it a real page turner for me (I read it in 2 days). That said, I've never before wished a book to be longer so badly. I enjoyed the first half of the book immensely. If Burroughs had expanded that portion and essentially made this storyline into two books, I'd likely be giving it 4 or 5 stars.Also, I found many of the secondary characters to be unnecessarily helpless. It was entertaining to read of Tarzan saving them time and time again, though I found it to be too much after a while. Lastly, the conclusion is terribly unsatisfying. It seemed that Burroughs knew he was going to make this a series from the start. Now I feel compelled to read the \\"Return of Tarzan\\" in hopes that it will end on a more conclusive note."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The shipment was very fast.

It holds its greatness until right around the time Jane Porter and her father show up. All of the sudden humor and romance are added to this story and while it's ok, it does change what could have been an amazingly great adventure story. Still a great book, but the whole indecisiveness of Jane and her suitors became extremely annoying towards the end of the novel. You kind of realize that Jane's only in it for the money, social standing and not what her heart is telling her. It's almost like Twilight with apes and lions, not really what I was after. However the parts that dont deal with Jane's adolescent puppy love make for great reading.By the way, to the reviewer that cried \\"racism\\", you're way off the mark."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Son of Man, look to the sky Lift your spirit, set it free Some day you'll walk tall with pride Son of Man, a man in time you'll be - Phil Collins, Son of ManJohn and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton, Lord and Lady Greystoke, are left to fend for themselves in the jungles of Africa where their son, John Clayton, is later born. after his parents died, John is adopted by the she-ape Kala and he grows up among the apes as Tarzan.the \\"King of the Apes\\" made its first appearance in a pulp magazine in October, 1912. in 1914, the first book edition was published.Tarzan was one of the more popular characters of my childhood and i was able to watch and/or read many of its numerous film, TV and comics adaptations. it was only recently that i had the chance to read the novel and i was in for a surprise.Edgar Rice Burroughs' original vision was a far cry from what i though i knew about Tarzan. i never imagined the novel to be that informative, entertaining and shocking at times. i had a few niggles, though, concerning how Tarzan survived in the jungle or how he managed to teach himself to read and write so easily but i was so amused by the whole narrative that i was willing to suspend my disbelief here and there.as a whole, i like the book for its entertainment value. it is no wonder, therefore, that Tarzan's popularity has never dwindled. there is something about this ape-man or man-ape if you will that continues to appeal to readers, writers and film and TV producers. i, myself, am looking forward to reading all twenty-four books in the series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"If you have any interest in Tarzan and have never read the original, then you owe it to yourself to read \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\".

Then why has TOTA survived, and produced one of the most recognized and admired characters in all of literature? I believe the main reason for this success is that Tarzan is one of the few characters who has reconciled the \\"savage\\" and \\"civilized\\" aspects of his personality into a glorious archetype. He certainly does not suffer the tortures of a Henry Jekyll, or a Bruce Banner, or any other multiple personality sufferer. In fact, Burroughs in TOTA seems to suggest that to survive and thrive anywhere, you must combine the best of nature AND nurture, and the best of instinct and intelligence.Under the fierce protection of Kala the she-ape (herself the literary epitome of indomitable motherhood), the orphaned Tarzan harrowingly and gradually experiences the literal law of the jungle. He is at a primitive disadvantage, since he will always be smaller than the hostile anthropoids he lives with. Although he eventually masters animalistic skills, strength, and cunning, TOTA demonstrates that pure instinct and the feral will to live, by themselves, will not be enough to prove Tarzan's worth. Tarzan discovers that his superior brain gives him the knowledge, learning, memory, and invention (that instinct cannot) to become the anthropoids' equal and eventually their master. Tarzan is an exceptional evolutionary success.Then \\"civilization\\" stumbles into Tarzan's jungle in the form of the dotty Dr. Archimedes Q Porter and his aristocratic but steely daughter Jane. They, and especially the winsome Jane, threaten Tarzan's balance of his animal and human nature. Tarzan has (if incredulously) become literate by deciphering the books left by his late parents in the treehouse, and even found fingerprints -his own as an infant- that hold the key to his true identity. However, despite his successful preservation of Jane and company from the jungle's horrors, they tellingly believe that they are dealing with two people - the naked savage that keeps saving them and the articulate gentleman who keeps leaving them notes and provisions. Jane and company leave before resolving the mystery, and leave Tarzan at a psychological crossroads: remain in the jungle or become more civilized in order to pursue Jane to the modern world, which in its way can be every bit as forbidding as the wild?Fortunately a French officer named D'Arnot has arrived in the jungle searching for the Porters, but is ambushed, stripped, and imprisoned by cannibals. Tarzan locates and saves him and brings him to the treehouse. A grateful D'Arnot teaches Tarzan's some of the finer practices of civilization. Tarzan reluctantly but swiftly learns these strange manners because, as D'Arnot eventually reveals to him by forensis fingerprint analysis, Tarzan is actually aristocratic John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and therefore \\"fit\\" to woo and wed Jane. So, from the moment Jane and company enter the scene, TOTA does show somewhat of a struggle between Tarzan's \\"baser\\" and \\"nobler\\" traits, but it also shows that he can master both and be savage when he has to be (e.g. killing a lion on a bet with D'Arnot's friends in an African port and disarming a crazed madman there), and chivalrous when he has to be (tracking Jane to northern Wisconsin and sacrificing his own happiness by permitting a cousin, Robert(?) Clayton to wed Jane, at least for the moment).Perhaps Burroughs was a better raconteur (storyteller) of fantastic tales than pragmatic social scientist. But in TOTA, he managed to convey the eternal interaction of human dichotomy (man v. beast, thought vs. instinct), show that it sometimes overlapped (e.g. the mutineers), and convincingly demonstrate in Tarzan that that duality can work together to create an exceptional being indeed."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Me love Tarzan.

I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.Tarzan's world is Africa. But an extraordinary Africa populated with apes more intelligent than any known ones and in later adventures with a plethora \\"lost cities\\", \\"ant-men\\" or whatever suit ERB in order to deliver a fast paced adventure.As other reviewers, of this same book in other editions, point out do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.Another assumption that closely follows this is: \\"superior traits\\" are inherited directly and a Lord will always be a Lord no matter what the circumstances.The reader may assume all this adventures occurs in an \\"alternate reality\\" that have some common traits with our world such as the ones depicted by Guy Gavriel Kay for example.Now you'll be ready to enjoy the original story of Tarzan as it was delivered by ERB, free from Hollywood changes or comic's stereotypes.A couple of English nobles are abandoned by a mutinous crew in the coast of Africa where they barely survive.Adversity proves to be more than what they may endure and both die leaving an infant that is miraculously adopted by Kala an anthropoid that has lost her baby-ape.Protected by her, Tarzan starts a life struggle to conquer a space among the over towering brutes.His natural intelligence combined with a strengthening body allows him to survive and in due time lead the ape tribe.ERB ability renders all this astounding fates credible: Tarzan learns to read and write all by himself; Tarzan defeats a Gorilla with his father's knife; Tarzan helps a group of marooned white people and fell in love with Jane; Tarzan...continue delivering one prowess after other... and you'll believe it.I read \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" at my teens and continue reading many of his 23 following adventures, borrowing volume after volume from a nearby library.When I grow up and gain economic independence I bought and kept this book and some more Tarzans volumes.I warmly recommend this series to any anyone who is fond to read unending adventures in a magic world.If after reading Tarzan's stories you still want more from ERB try the Martian series, they are almost as good as this one.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing adventure novels nearly 90 years ago. The most famous of his characters is, or course, Tarzan. And this book is the one that got the Tarzan legacy started.In this book you meet Tarzan, learn who he really is, where he came from, how he became lord of the apes and protector of the jungle, and the English Earl of Greystoke. You also learn the story behind the story about Tarzan and Jane.I've been a Tarzan fan for nearly 20 years. I've been collecting Tarzan books (older ones) for the past 15 years. I've read nearly all the books in the series, and this one is probably the best. I'll be the first to admit that if you read a lot of Tarzan books back to back you will see a somewhat formulaic approach to some of the installments. This first book, however, is original, interesting, and immensely entertaining.I encourage you to read the book that got it all started in 1914 -- the premis, the character, and the mystique that spawned numerous films, and other spin-off media, and a series of books that spanned publication dates from 1914 well into the 1940s.Move over Indiana Jones and James Bond -- Tarzan is the real McCoy. He's strong, brave, modest, wise, and good. He's got the attributes that we could sure use in a hero today!Give this book a look. You'll be glad you did. It's a book that you could enjoy reading to your children.5 stars for story, character development, readability, and content. Is it a literary classic? Yes, in that it holds its own respected place among fictional literature. Will it ever will literary acclaim? I don't think that Joyce or Faulkner need to worry.But, hey, it's a fun read! Give it a try.Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"It would be pointless to write a review of the actual story itself. After being in existence for 100 years, the story is well known and debates about the content would probably serve no purpose. However, do not base your knowledge and potential appreciation of this iconic novel upon any of the Tarzan movies: none of them come close to doing justice to Burroughs' work.What I do want to comment upon is this edition. Republished by the Library of America, this hard bound book is a charming edition, reflecting the size and style of the original from the early 1900s. The layout and the typeset, I am assuming, are also from the original publishing time period and add to the enjoyment of reading this book again after 40 years. Coupled with a reasonable price, this book is a wonderful investment for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"If you are expecting Tarzan to be an inarticulate meat-head who never gets past a three-year-old's grasp of English (and never wears more than a loin cloth), you will be pleasantly surprised by the real McCoy, as originally conceived by ERB. Having grown up on Hollywood's version of the legend, I was amazed to meet the original character: a very intelligent, three-dimensional person who defies efforts to pigeon-hole him. From the very start, when he teaches himself how to read English, and then learns fluent French before even leaving the jungle, I was continually wondering why no one ever took advantage of this complexity in the movies. Tarzan of Greystoke came the closest, but even that pales next to the portrayal in the book. I also loved that Jane is a southern belle: another surprise (and ironic, with the Greystoke movie's dubbing-over of Andie MacDowell's [southern-accented] voice). At the climax of the book, you find Tarzan driving a car and other 'civilized' activities, but he still ends up swinging on vines through the forest... in a three-piece suit! Images like that had me cracking up, and makes this book such a fun read. If you would like a quick and entertaining adventure story that turns your pre-conceived notions upside-down, then definitely give this a try!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I felt it would be a good idea to review the original TARZAN OF THE APES by Edgar Rice Burroughs as many are only familiar with how the character has been mishandled for the past seventy or so years. In his original form Tarzan was far from the monosyllabic simpleton as he was so often later portrayed. Instead, Tarzan was a man of aristocratic bearing who wielded great strength of both body and will, spoke several languages fluently, and easily mixed with British society.Although Tarzan first appeared in TARZAN OF THE APES, the plot and some of Tarzan's characteristics were showcased in an earlier Burroughs work called THE MONSTER MEN. But it was the infant heir to a British title that rocketed Burroughs's fame. Tarzan begins as an infant shipwrecked on the coast of Africa. The rest of his family quickly dies but a local anthropoid ape (not a gorilla) who just lost a baby, claims pale, hairless baby and raises it as her own. Tarzan grows but is always weaker than the apes. But when Tarzan finds the hut left by his family he begins learning about his human side. With knowledge Tarzan is able to stand up to the more bullysome apes and life is good.Years later thing change drastically when pirates maroon other humans near Tarzan's home. It is then that Tarzan learns to love Jane and she him although she first knows him as two different people. To her there is the forest god who rescues her and there is Tarzan who leaves her notes. But while Tarzan can read and write English and speak the language of the apes, French is the first human tongue he learns. A tongue that Jane does not understand. But eventually Jane becomes the force that drives Tarzan towards civilization and his birthright among British nobility.In this first Tarzan novel, Edgar Rice Burroughs explores the idea of class as inherent. A British lord will always be a British lord and will always rise to the top no matter how far he has been pushed down. Tarzan, being raised by an unknown species of intelligent apes, has further to rise than any lord in history. But the rise he does because class will always prove itself. This is a popular theme and one that, in detective fiction, shows the difference between the British view and the American view. The British view used to hold that an aristocrat acting as an amateur, with easily best the professional laborer as in the Sherlock Holmes stories. The American view in detective fiction is that the closer to the grit you are the better you are at solving mysteries as in the Colombo or Sam Spade mysteries. But in TARZAN OF THE APES Burroughs takes the British view to its extreme.TARZAN OF THE APES and the other early Tarzan novels are classics of adventure fiction. Lost cities, ancient civilizations, true love, heroism and other qualities of great adventures are all present in these novels. My wife really enjoys the original Zorro stories packed with romance and heroism. But when I lent her some of my Tarzan books she quickly became a fan of his stories as well. If you have never treated yourself to the original and only know what television and Hollywood have done to him, I recommend that you give Tarzan a try. I think you will be surprised."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"It is unfortunate that the prevailing image of Tarzan of the Apes is the one that belongs to Johnny Weismuller, who played Tarzan in a series of forgettable films during the 1930's and 1940's. Tarzan, as Weismuller played him, was a grunting, monosyllabic elephant yodeler who is often caricatured as the one who says, \\"Me Tarzan, you Jane.\\" The Tarzan as Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote of was truly a jungle man, but one who was erudite, fluent in many languages, and possessed of a strong code of jungle justice. I was more fortunate than most since my first exposure to Tarzan was in the series' opener, \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" It was then that I was transported to a mythical jungle forest that I know now can not ever have existed in one place at one time. Burroughs' Africa in 1914 is seen more as a dinosaur-less Jurassic Park megafauna than as the western Africa as pictured in National Geographic. In Tarzan's stomping grounds, the reader sees a mixture of lions, tigers, elephants, and various anthropoid hominid ape-gorillas. But as a child, I did not notice such geographical anachronisms. What I saw was the most thrilling excitement of my first twelve years. I met Tarzan's biological parents, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and the Lady Alice, both of whom were cast ashore by the mutinous villanies of Black Michael. I cried as both his parents died, the Lady Alice of disease, John Clayton at the hands of the killer leader of the apes, the ferocious Kerchak. Kala, a female ape soon adopts the waif, whom she calls Tarzan (White Skin). As Tarzan grew to maturity, so did I. As he learned to read the strange bugs of his father's library, I learned to read equally new and puzzling vocabulary. The death of Kala caused me to sob again. By the novel's end, I was hooked to read all sequels.Recently, I reread the novel, with a mature perspective. What I found was there was nothing stale or juvenile about the book. True, I sensed some racist touches that other critics have so mercilessly hammered. Further, I saw other flaws in Burroughs' style, an overly florid dependence on sensory details, that occasionally intruded. But as an adult, I saw what I could only dimly perceive as a child. Tarzan's foster mother Kala protected the baby Tarzan with a maternal ferocity unmatched in literature. She was both the literal and figurative shield that permitted Tarzan to survive long enough to later meet and mate with Jane. Though Kala is killed off fairly early, she is mentioned often enough to set her off as one of the bedrocks of Tarzan's psyche. To me, Kala was my shield too. I needed her as a bulwark against my own Kerchaks. As long as readers need to visit a foreign and terror fraught land, they will need to do so in psychological safety. Tarzan may get them in, but it will be Kala who will get them out."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I only discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs by accident a couple of years ago when I picked up a copy of this book \\"just because\\". It turned out to be far better and far cooler than any expectations I might've had.If you think you know Tarzan and haven't read this, I've got news for you. YOU DON'T KNOW TARZAN. He's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character. He's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path. I'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago. It's so graphic and unapologetic for Tarzan's bestial nature.That said, there are a few small flaws. Elements of the plot can be a bit contrived, but since it usually serves to get to more action, I can forgive that. Burroughs's writing, while still engaging, is a little stilted by today's standards. And it doesn't end with Tarzan getting Jane. That's the story of \\"The Return of Tarzan\\".Not ending in a book ALWAYS bugs me. I hate cliffhangers. I don't need to be blackmailed to read the next one. You can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others. Still, even the great Edgar Rice Burroughs loses a star for this flaw because I REALLY HATE CLIFFHANGERS. Sorry, Eddie.Do yourself a favor and pick this up. It might ruin you for other so-called adventure stories, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Little did ERB realize when he launched his second novel in 1914, that he had created a pop icon hero who would delight youthful readers around the world. The author, who had failed in a variety of enterprises, combined his late-blooming literary talent with a fecund imagination, to create a typically American protagonist--one who reflected the 19th century's fascination with the Nature vs Nurture debate of human development. Can a &quot;wild man&quot; be truly half ape/half human; can such a creature be reprogrammed to reject two decades of savage training in favor of civilized manners? Is the love of a beautiful woman sufficient to lead a primitive person to rise above his barbaric conditioning, in order to compete with cultivated upperclassswains?Hollywood's numerous version of Tarzan's various adventures have distorted the author's original plot and careful details, such that an accurate rendering of the novel would be rejected by a falsely-educated public, who expect Tarzan to bea grunting caveman with a superb physique. How false this is to his true heritage as the scion of British noblity. Let's get some basic facts straight: Tarzan taught himself to read and write (but not speak) English; French was the first language he learned to communciate vocally with his fellow men. He truly loved Kala, his ape foster mother, with the same tender devotion he would have lavished upon the mother he never knew. Blonde Jane did not speak with a British accent, since she was a Baltimore girl--the daughter of an absent-minded professor. Her father cared for three things in his life: Jane, academic research and the Porter family honor.Since the general storyline is so well known, I will focus commentary on ERB's literary style. Like most of his future heroines, Jane is aged 19, with a perfect body, and is called a girl (never a woman). Naturally she endures abduction by a brute, but is ultimately rescued by her hero--saving her from &quot;the fate worse than a thousand deaths.&quot; Other ERB elements include the famous pairing of words (rage and hate, pain and fear, etc), and his famous cliff-hanger chapter endings; this latter is necessary so that readers can keep abreast of what has been happening to other characters in the story, requiring some mental gymnastics.On the down side, ERB has rightfully been criticized for his treatment of other races and nationalities. His jungle Blacks are little better than superstitious children, while faithful Esmeralda (Jane's nanny) speaks in dialect like some Mark Twain characters--another challenge for readers. The author clearly admires Frenchmen, but hates Germans as international bullies (who become the object of Tarzan's pro-English mischief in subsequent novels.) If Hollywood can whip up patriotic fervorthrough the medium of movies, so may popular novels. The end of Tarzan of the Apes will prove a great surprise to first-time readers. Will he return to his beloved jungle, renouncing the veneer of civilization forever? Or perhaps accept life in the Western world? Are you sure you know the Real Tarzan, who wooed the mate destined for his heart in the jungles of two continents? What a man will sacrifice for Love..."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The greatest adventure series of all time -- with the greatest hero. Needless to say, the books are nothing like any of the movies. Tarzan is an intelligent, independent individual, always striving to learn, with a strong sense of justice. He never gives up, no matter how hopeless the situation. He never kneels to any authority, no matter the threat.I don't believe that there is an ounce of altruism anywhere in the stories. (He helps the innocent and helpless on occasion, but does not sacrifice himself or his goals. His goals include securing wealth, but not social approval or prestige. His self-esteem requires nothing from the opinions of others.) When in one scene he decides to give up his birth right in England for the security of the woman he loves, it is clear that her security is more important to him than the wealth and position. Indeed, it is only losing her that hurts him, for he cares little for European society.The stories are not \\"politically correct.\\" As a teenager Tarzan first encounters a native tribe and realizes he is more like these \\"apes\\" than his life-long \\"family.\\" He is drawn toward them, but when one kills his ape \\"mother,\\" he kills the native. In one story, where Tarzan risks his life to save a man from a lion, it is only because he becomes curious as to what the white man is doing alone deep in the jungle. He does not kill the lion, by the way.Tarzan embodies the principles of accepting what he cannot change, changing what he can, and knowing the difference. There is a negative attitude toward religion (witchdoctors and religious figures are presented as frauds). While I don't know that I realized it at the time I was reading, thinking on it now I think Tarzan represented man's noble nature, when untouched by social corruption -- either that of native tribes or Western civilization. He is not alone in this nobility, simply the most pure. There are also noble Europeans and noble natives, as well as the evil doers.Again, while I did not notice it at the time, I read a comment somewhere that the writing conveys a more sophisticated, or more formal, use of language than most modern stories.Written in the first part of this century, the stories are dated by their depiction of ferocious gorillas, large apes, and unexplored Africa. In this, they remind us that much of Africa was indeed unknown to Europe as late as the first half of this century. Still, these are fantasy-adventure stories, and I had no trouble slipping into the Burroughs' world of suspenseful and weaving plots.Tarzan is a superhero of unmatched courage, who has fully developed his physical strength and agility, and fully honed his senses. The theme is that others could do so as well (given the advantages of his childhood). In fact, his son achieves much the same capabilities -- through harrowing adventures! Even Jane significantly develops her human potential, even though she begins late in life."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic - \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" - is the first in the series of Tarzan books, and is a quite entertaining novel. This first book relates some classic events in the Tarzan saga - how Tarzan's parents were killed and he came to be raised by the apes, how he learned to communicate with animals of the jungle as well as educate himself in the ways of man, his meeting Jane, and his eventual journey to the world of civilization and man. The story was originally published in 'pulp-style' magazines, (as was most fantasy and sci-fi of Burroughs' day); however, this represents some of the great stories that were produced from that style of fiction.Virtually all of the events related in the novel are interesting and handled intelligently. Readers who have certain expectations of the story based on the cartoons and movies ' such as \\"Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan\\" - may be somewhat surprised by the content of the story. I personally liked how the author didn't spend too much time on any one aspect of the story, but rather, moved somewhat swiftly through the various events of story (those who like a quicker paced novel should enjoy it). Some readers may find Burroughs' depictions of the animals and natives who lived in the jungle to be a bit clich&eacute;d; however, while they certainly seem to be a product of his time (this book was originally published in 1914), I found his portrait of the jungle, and the \\"civilized\\" humans represented, to be somewhat quaint, but quite enjoyable.Overall, 'Tarzan' is a well written story and one which can be enjoyed by today's standards. Those expecting a somewhat one-dimensional story or \\"super-hero\\" type Tarzan from the cartoons (and some of the book covers for that matter) should be pleasantly surprised. While this book may be most appropriate to read for adolescents through young adults, I'd recommend it for kids of all ages ' I'm 29 and enjoyed it, and plan to read others in the series!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the best I've ever read. Disney screwed up the book so bad its not even funny. They should not be able to do that. I think every one should read this book. I would think that they would like it. After reading the book it's almost as if you have been in the jungle. I would recommend this book to any one."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I read the book one week ago, the book is a wonderfully written book, the Disney got the book so wrong so if that is what you are expecting don't. The book is descriptive and if you think about it explains a lot about humanity and that is wonderful. You never want to put it down and when you get to the end you should read the Return of Tarzan by of course none other than Edgar Rice Burroughs. Those are the only two of the 24 or 25 book series that I have read I want to go on to book three!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes is a great story and a very quick read. It's pretty different than all the movie versions. Tarzan is extremely intelligent(he teaches himself to read without knowing any English!) and a chivalrous gentleman. The book has a few things that may offend some people: treatment towards blacks, Jane's somewhat weak character, and the portrayal of the apes as brutal savages. But these things are a product of the period, and can be easily overlooked because they don't detract from the excellent story-telling. You will not be able to put this book down!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"It's incredible that eighty-eight years after it first appeared in &quot;All-Story&quot;, Tarzan of the Apes is still an absolute thrill to read. Burrough's original Tarzan is a fascinating creation, more intelligent and brutal than the many sanitized versions that have appeared in Hollywood since the silent days (and somehow the Lord of the Apes had his biggest financial success in a Disney(? ) film). Tarzan is here a vehicle for the author to explore the binary nature of humanity and the thin line between civilzation and savagery that exists within everyone. Oh, and it's filled with action! action! action! and pathos! and action! and pathos! It isn't remotely relistic for a second, but its a grand fantasy that wins over new fans with each generation. Your life is a little less exciting if you haven't read it."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This summer, Disney's version inspired me to read Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes. I took it with me every day to the beach and enjoyed every minuted of it. It is exciting, fun, thrilling, and even romantic at times. It is writen beautifuly and I would recamend it to any one who wants a fast and fun summer read!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I first read this over 30 years ago as a teenager. Even then, it was sort of a guilty pleasure. I recently decided my children needed to read the real thing before they got Disneyfied, and reread it myself. Burroughs had a way of telling a compelling tale, even if it seems a little over the top by today's standards. I now find it to be full of unlikely plot elements and overly stereotypical characters. It is also pretty obvious to today's reader that Mr. Burroughs knew nothing about African animals (what are these apes, anyway?). These things don't detract much for the young reader, but another striking characteristic is the casual, unabashed racism of literature from that era. I don't believe in censoring kids' reading, but a little preliminary lecture about prejudice is in order-after that, I think reading such material can be instructive as well as entertaining. I found the Barsoom series more fun than Tarzan, though."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Listed in Cawthorn's and Moorcock's &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books&quot;.The Weissmuller movies didn't get him right. The TV series haven't got him right. And the Disney movie CERTAINLY won't get him right. Burrough's original narration of the story of Tarzan is a mix of bloodthirsty savagery and unrestrained suspension of disbelief that few would attempt to capture these days.The Tarzan series is unique among his author's body of work. Where the Barsoom, Pellucidar and Caspak series concern modern men travelling to exotic lands and falling in love with native women, this time around it is a modern woman who comes to the wilderness and steals the heart of the savage protagonist, who must now step up to her civilized ways.The tale is laced with bloody scenes of man-against-man and man-against-beast rampage. The great apes among which Tarzan grows are a cannibal species, who eat the prisioners of raids against other simian clans. The king ape kills Tarzan's father in a moment where he is caught off guard, mourning the recent death of his wife. When Tarzan first encounters men (an African tribe), he hunts and kills one of them to steal his arrows (killing being the way of the jungle, since Tarzan knows nothing of human behavior). Also, these men turn out to be cannibals too. And when the white men finally arrive, they raid their village and kill almost every one in an attempt to rescue a captured comrade.After growing wild among beasts, Tarzan (whose name menas White Skin) realizes that he is different from his ape family. And through a series of inventions of his own (like making a rope) and fortunate coincides (like the use of a found hunting knife), he steps up the evolutionary ladder by himself. The moment he learns to read and write from illustrated primers and a dictionary is among the most improbable in the whole book. But if we have kept up with it until now, allowing ourselves to accept that a human child can be raised by apes, then his ascension to superiority isn't that hard to embrace.Tarzan turns out to be the primeveal lovesick nerd. After the first time he sees Jane Porter (the first white woman he ever casts his eyes on), his heart is all for her. He writes her a love letter, which smacks of the most pityful puppy love (&quot;I want you. I am yours. You are mine... When you see this you will know that it is for you and that Tarzan of the Apes loves you&quot;). Yet our hero is true and noble, and he holds the upper hand in his homeland. The girl can't do anything but be carried away by her primeveal pretender.I recommend you get this edition I'm reviewing, the one by Penguin. Besides the introduction which gives a valuable background to the place of Tarzan among popular literature and some details on the life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, it contains a series of notes that signal where he took some liberties with his story's setting (like placing American plants in the African jungle).The English is a little bit archaic, the characterization tends to cartoon and stereotype, but the story is powerful and nothing captures the beauty of the original like the original itself. Read Tarzan of the Apes, and meet again for the first time an archetypical hero of timeless charm."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Two weekends ago, AMC ran a number of the old Tarzen movies. So I pulled out my copy and read for the 20+ time of the adventures of one of the best known and well-loved characters in history. At one sitting I re-read and totally emersed myself in a place and person who are more real to me than any non-fiction account. This is the greatest story, adventure, action, love, etc. ever written and worth re-reading over and over and over again"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I have to believe that with the pervasiveness of Tarzan in our culture, everyone knows the basic story of \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" What many people may not know is how Edgar Rice Burroughs originally wrote the story, versus the versions seen on television and in graphic adaptations.John Clayton, Tarzan's real name, was the child of an English lord, also named John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice. The English lord and his wife were aboard a ship taken over by mutineers. Because of a fortunate incident prior to the mutiny, John and his wife were saved from being murdered by the mutineers, or worse, and were instead set ashore on the supposedly hostile shores of western Africa.Lord Greystoke did well providing for his family. He built a sturdy cabin in the jungle and prevented the numerous wild creatures from harming his family, until the day when a great ape attacked. Lady Alice was able to shoot the great ape, but the attack left her mentally disturbed and a year after giving birth to baby John, she passed away.Lord Greystoke was distraught and, in a second mistake since being marooned in the jungle, left the door of the cabin open. The apes enter the cabin and kill Lord Greystoke, leaving baby John vulnerable to a potentially horrible fate, except for a stroke of luck that caused one of the female apes, Kala, to take baby John for her own, naming him...Tarzan!Young Lord Greystoke grew slowly by ape standards, but grow he did. He eventually found the cabin and the tools within, quickly recognizing the value of the knife he found. Young Tarzan taught himself to read and write English, and watching African natives, taught himself archery. Tarzan's intelligence also soon enabled him to rule over apes and to conquer the African cannibals living a relatively short distance from the Clayton cabin.Tarzan might well have lived out his life in the jungles of Africa but for a remarkable coincidence. Yet another ship had yet another group of mutineers, and this ship abandoned passengers on the dark and forbidding shores of Africa. This group of passengers included William Clayton, Lord Greystoke, a relative of Tarzan's, unbeknownst to either of them, Jane Porter, her father, and a couple of others.This story could have ended simply with Tarzan meeting Jane and falling in love with her, but rarely is life that simple. Jane appears destined to marry William Clayton. Then there is yet another man back in the United States also interested in Jane. As you might have guessed, Jane is quite popular. Of course, for a while everyone is in the jungle at the mercy of the wild animals and cannibals, which generate all sorts of adventures.Eventually, Tarzan learns about civilization and about his heritage, though only D'Arnot, who becomes his best friend, is aware of his heritage. By the end of the novel, it appears that things are somewhat open ended. Jane has yet to figure out whom she is going to marry, and Tarzan is left hanging in the United States. Indeed, if you are going to get this book, you may as well get \\"The Return of Tarzan,\\" because that book truly finishes the initial story of Tarzan.This book does contain some features that modern audiences may find troublesome unless they consider the era in which the story was written. A number of reviewers have found the description of African cannibals and Jane's maid to be particularly bothersome. One thing I noticed is that Tarzan is superior to virtually everyone in the book, black and white, and generally has a low opinion of most people.As readers learn in \\"The Return of Tarzan,\\" Tarzan prefers to live with a certain African tribe, which he describes in glowing terms, than with supposedly civilized people. While African cannibals were among the horrors of the jungle in this book, in \\"The Return of Tarzan,\\" the horrors include white men that have mated with apes, devolving to a lowly level indeed. My caution is, therefore, that Burroughs' attitude toward Africans, women and everyone else should be judged by later books versus just this book. Tarzan holds everyone who is brave, intelligent and moral in high esteem, regardless of race, religion, or sex.I first read the story of Tarzan more than four decades ago. I wondered how I would find the story now. I find the story interesting and fun. Sure, there are aspects of the story that are wrong from a biological perspective, and Tarzan adds some confusion regarding whether the apes that raise him are apes or some sort of missing link, but ignoring the errors here and there, the story is, to me, as interesting as \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" and other similar stories of adventure. If you are looking for great literature, try Faulkner or Shakespeare. If you are looking for fast-paced action and entertainment, try Tarzan.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"...but not by its ending; instead, it will surprise you through its language and gripping nature. A wonderfully entertaining and well-written piece, filled with adventure, action, drama, and romance, Edgar Rice Burroughs succeeds at a popular masterpiece with this book. He creates a perfect microcosm of the African jungle (around the Congo River) where we see Tarzan grow to be a god-like human, overpowering all who stand in his way. The romance that eventually begins between Tarzan and Jane Porter is heartwarming (and, eventually, heart-breaking) yet offers a fascinating view into the early 20th-Century heart of an upper-Middle Class American woman (one that Burroughs seems to dismiss and insult in many mild ways).Let me end with a strong suggestion: READ.THIS.BOOK! It is too fun to not read, and I can't believe I have not read it before now."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I bought this book in order to discover the original story. The only portrayal I had seen was the Disney movie from when I was younger. In many ways I understand why the story of Tarzan is so ageless. It's a perfect mix of action and romance. It is, however, terribly clear that the book was written in an age of racism. Jane has an assistant who displays an incredible amount of stereotypical behavior. Apart from that, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action-packed stories! This edition also features very helpful notes and an information introduction."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"If you like writing in times of old language, then this book is for you. I found it very refreshing as far as the real story, not like the one Disney has. If you like a different read, this book is a good one!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I will keep this review short, but want to inform you of the magnificence of this novel. I am an avid reader and am almost always immersed in the middle of a story, but Burroughs is one of the few authors that had my heart racing and gave a feeling of intensity of actually being in the jungles of Africa. Tarzan of the Apes is intelligently written, packed with non-stop excitement, and keeps the reader's attention throughout every emotion and sentence of each page. A truly adventurous read and definitely worthy of the title of \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I can forgive some of the unrealistic things as well as the multiple coincidences, but I cannot reconcile how Tarzan, who knew how to read and write, but not yet how to speak, could sign his own name on a love note to Jane.He had never learned pronunciation of letters and words, so it would be IMPOSSIBLE for him to have signed his name."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"What more can we say of Tarzan of the Apes - he truly is an American original, and has influenced characters in film, television and comic books from the Beastmaster to Sheena to Ka-Zar and beyond, as well as standing as a popular culture phenomenon in his own right. We always think we know the whole story - a man raise din the jungle, befriended by animals, fighting whatever danger comes at him with his Girl Friday, Jane, at his side. However, if we return to the original novel, we find a more complex and, perhaps, less satisfying story.Tarzan of the Apes tells, of course, the story of Tarzan of the Apes - the scion of a noble family marooned by pirates on the African coast - he comes to be raised by apes when his parents are brutally murdered by Kerchak, the leader of their pride. Under their tutelage, young Tarzan becomes a formidible warrior, while also utterly self-conscious of the fact that he is, somehow, not like the other apes. Eventually, Tarzan acceeds to the leadership of his pride, and battles cannibals, lions, and other dangers in the jungle - as well as encountering the also-marooned Jane Porter, her suitor, John Clayton, and her father, Professor Porter. Together they must brave the jungle and the nearby cannibals, and also attempt to find a way home. Romance, intrigue, and action are skillfully interwoven.One must, however, read Tarzan with more than just a grain of salt. Certainly, I'm not talking about the book's major conceit - that a man could be raised to successful adulthood by apes in the jungle primeval - but about some of the details - Tarzan teaching himself to read and write perfect English from a book he's found in an abandoned cabin, for instance. There is a lot of suspension of disbelief that must be performed to enjoy this book. However, enjoy it you will. Burroughs has an uncanny knack for laying his characters psychologically bare - even the animals - to the reader, so whether we love them or hate them, we sympathize with them.Perhaps the major complaint I have with this book is its pacing. It truly doesn't become interesting until we are about 100+ pages in - much of the first part is taken up with Tarzan's parents' experiences, and Tarzan's childhood. This is, unfortunately, frightfully dull, and not up to the usually rousing Edgar Rice Burroughs standard to which I am used (readers of A Princess of Mars and succeeding John Carter of Mars novels will no doubt agree). Once the book gets going, however, it is worth every moment of your time. A fun read."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Pissed Off! That's how I felt during the ending. I couldn't believe the book ended the way it did. I know the story goes on to a part 2, but man! All of Tarzan's wasted efforts at the end, all his hopes and dreams... I couldn't help but feel strong disappointment and think that Jane is the most stupid woman on planet Earth."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"When I ws little my father and I would read this book together, which makes this book special for me. This year I read the book again. I couldn't stop reading it. I had to force myself to go to bed. The way Burroughs puts things is beatiful. He has captivated the true essence of the words he put on the paper. So many times you would think Tarzan would be dead of his comrads but he always seems to escape with grace and mystery. This book is perfect in every way and if you are looking for a good book t his is where to turn. There is no better way to put things than how he has and cannot be reproduced in any way.

Burrough's use of verbal imagery causes the reader to feel sticky jungle air. Readers of all ages can't help but empathize with young Tarzan as he begins to explore his own identity and discovers inner strengths in the face of adversity.

Unfortunately I can't stand Mary Sues, so I don't recommend this book to anyone who also finds them revolting. Tarzan has the most beautiful face that anyone's ever seen--a face that inspires trust in white people and strikes terror into the hearts of black people. He's the mightiest hunter in the world, as he tells us over and over and over and over again. He keeps the jungle safe from lions, pirates, and rampaging, psychopathic apes. He mindphux cannibals. He taught himself how to read and write from books he found in his parents' abandoned cabin, and learns to speak French fluently a matter of days after saving a French soldier. Somehow he learns to drive a car, and in the context of the story that must have happened in the span of one afternoon.Oh, and as an English gentleman, he instinctively knows how to kiss women even though he's never seen anyone or anything kiss in his whole life...and his kisses drive women wild with desire and passion, despite the fact that he eats raw meat and hasn't brushed his teeth in twenty years.I'm not even going to remark on the over-the-top racism in this book--unusual even for his own time--or the rabid sexism. Did I mention Jane Porter is the most pathetic damsel in distress in all of literature? She seriously can't go five minutes without needing rescue from something or someone?

This is absolutely the most racist book I've ever read. It was hard to get through. In every single instance, blacks are stupid, savage, and child like while whites are noble, intelligent, and fearless. Whites in general, and English aristocrats in particular, are the nature's supreme achievement and greatest glory. You think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not.Africans are described everywhere as \\"ferocious brutes\\", cannibals, savages, superstitious, and barely human. example:\\"The bestial faces, daubed with color--the huge mouths and flabby hanging lips--the yellow teeth, sharp filed--the rolling, demon eyes--the shining naked bodies--the cruel spears. Surely no such creatures really existed upon earth\\" That's only one instance. There is no single example in this story in which the Africans are depicted in any other way.The one black servant, Esmeralda, is described only as a \\"negress\\" and gets the most appalling comic relief treatment ever. She cries and hoots and yells out \\"Oh Gaberelle!\\" every time she gets a fright.Here's a couple of examples:\\"Esmeralda, cowering still closer to her mistress, took one frightened glance toward the little square of moonlight, just as the lioness emitted a low, savage snarl...\\"Oh, Gaberelle!\\" she shrieked, and slid to the floor, an inert and senseless mass\\"...Jane stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder. Roughly she shook her...Esmeralda opened her eyes. The first object they encountered was the dripping fangs of the hungry lioness. With a horrified scream the poor woman rose to her hands and knees, and in this position, scurried across the room shrieking \\"O Gaberelle!\\" At the top of her lungs...For a moment the lioness remained quiet with intense gaze upon the flitting Esmeralda, whose goal appeared to be the cupboard, into which she attempted to propel her huge bulk...she only succeeded in getting her head in; whereupon, with a final screech, which paled the jungle noises into insignificance, she fainted once again.\\"When asked if she saw a gorilla, she says: \\"I thought it was the devil, but I guess it must have been one of them gorilephants\\"And when she's woken up suddenly she screams \\"What is it now, a hipponocerous?\\"The blacks, and all of nature itself, must be conquered and civilized by the noble white man.But we don't want to sanitize history, and anyone wanting to know why our racial history is so awful, this book and others like it will help you understand. This was 1912."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.Tarzan's world is Africa. But an extraordinary Africa populated with apes more intelligent than any known ones and in later adventures with a plethora \\"lost cities\\", \\"ant-men\\" or whatever suit ERB in order to deliver a fast paced adventure.As many other reviewers point out do not expect \\"politically correct\\" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.Another assumption that closely follows this is: \\"superior traits\\" are inherited directly and a Lord will always be a Lord no matter what the circumstances.The reader may assume all this adventures occurs in an \\"alternate reality\\" that have some common traits with our world such as the ones depicted by Guy Gavriel Kay for example.Now you'll be ready to enjoy the original story of Tarzan as it was delivered by ERB, free from Hollywood changes or comic stereotypes.A couple of English nobles are abandoned by a mutinous crew in the coast of Africa where they barely survive.Adversity proves to be more than what they may endure and both die leaving an infant that is miraculously adopted by Kala an anthropoid that has lost her baby-ape.Protected by her, Tarzan starts a life struggle to conquer a space among the over towering brutes.His natural intelligence combined with a strengthening body allows him to survive and in due time lead the ape tribe.ERB ability renders all this astounding fates credible: Tarzan learns to read and write all by himself; Tarzan defeats a Gorilla with his father's knife; Tarzan helps a group of marooned white people and fell in love with Jane; Tarzan...continue delivering one prowess after other... and you'll believe it.I read \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" at my teens and continue reading many of his 23 following adventures, borrowing volume after volume from a nearby library.When I grow up and gain economic independence I bought and kept this book and some more Tarzans.I warmly recommend this series to any reader who is fond to read unending adventures in a magic world.If after reading Tarzan's stories you still want more from ERB try the Martian series, they are almost as good as this one.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"A sterling tale of tragedy and heroism.

Certainly, some of the concepts prevalent in the book are quite dated and Tarzan of the Apes provides an interesting look into the biases of the early twentieth century. I especially liked the love note that Tarzan wrote to Jane that exemplifies his seemingly Darwinian approach to everything, including providing for a mate. You never saw this stuff in any of the shows or movies. The book ending is somewhat of a surprise and like modern movie franchises you know that more is coming in the next book.

I was thinking something along the lines of Disney's rendition, but was left with something a little more realistic (if you put aside a few \\"no way!\\" moments during the read, basically Tarzan was very lucky where I feel I wouldn't be as lucky). Without giving any spoilers, I think I most enjoyed Tarzan's intellectual development throughout the book which made his character more believable.

By the time you reach the end you feel like there should be more but this tells of ERB's storywriteing. He wrote a lot of pulp fiction and he knew how to get folks hooked into his books and wanting more. Thank goodness he did. To me it ends just about right. Many times tarzan and jungle-men stories tend to faulter once these characters get out of the jungle yet ERB creates an ending that by itself wraps everything up nice and tight. He gives you hints as what to expect yet doesnt reveal too much for his following books set in the same storyverse."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"i had never read any of the tarzan books until just recently when i got my kindle and i fell in love with them instantly. they are now one of my top favorite series. i love to read and i read a lot every day of the classics but this series and 'Lord of the Rings' (an amazing trilogy by J.R.R.Tolkien) are the best by far!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I love \\"Tarzan\\" books.

Such 'tension builders' may be considered essential fiction-writing components by others, but I love \\"Tarzan\\" despite these elements -- not because of them.What makes a book great, for me, is an author's genius at world-building ... the taking of fantastical or impossible scenarios and making them seem not only possible, but reasonable and logical ... combined with a gift for pulling a reader completely and totally 'into' that world.

This book has all the best things in a book."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I had several of the Tarzan books as a kid, and was a big fan of the series then. It had been almost thirty years, though, since I read any of them. I recently decided to check them out from the library to read with my daughter. We got the first three books in the series: Tarzan of the Apes, The Return of Tarzan, and The Beasts of Tarzan. In this review I will focus primarily on the first.Most people are familiar with the story of Tarzan, even if they haven't read the book: He is the scion of an aristocratic family, born to marooned parents on the West Coast of Africa. When his parents die, he is taken in by a tribe of anthropoid apes. (These creatures are not gorillas, nor chimpanzees. I'm unsure whether they were simply made up, or are evidence that Burroughs knew nothing of primates.) As a consequence of his upbringing in the wild, Tarzan develops superhuman strength and agility. He later meets and falls in love with Jane Porter, also marooned in that spot. He rescues her from danger, and she falls in love with him. I will say no more, except that those not familiar with the books may want to buy The Return of Tarzan at the same time.Reading Tarzan again after so much time I found it less easy to suspend my disbelief regarding certain improbable events. That's an absolute requirement, though, for enjoying the books. Anyone who tries to analyze the plots, who holds the stories up to standards of internal consistency, or scientific reality, will be disappointed in them.For example, Tarzan teaches himself to read and write in English using picture book primers. He is unable to speak the language, though, since there is no one to teach him the sounds of the letters. He speaks only the language of the anthropoid apes who raised him. That he is able to deduce that certain combinations of letters stand for the things in nearby pictures I could accept. That he is able to move from that to writing fluently and grammatically stretched my credulity to the breaking point. But when he later is able to write his ape-name, and the ape-names of other creatures that he has never seen written, I knew I had sailed into the waters of complete fantasy.That is really where the tale belongs, which becomes more and more obvious as the series goes along and we are introduced to lost civilizations, dinosaurs, missing links, etc. It is pulp fiction, which means exciting, fantastical adventures written hurriedly and without much in the way of quality control. They are enjoyable as light reading, but shouldn't be approached as serious literature.Burroughs certainly had something to say about mankind, but even there he is not consistent. One consistent message is that civilization softens men, but whether it also corrupts them is less clear. African natives and Europeans are alternately presented as corrupt or upright, depending on their values. He is also consistent about presenting white men as the intellectual superiors of blacks, even when they are not morally superior, a bit of racism that will (hopefully) wrankle modern readers. Tarzan of the Apes contains no black men who are not degenerate cannibals, and Tarzan takes delight in tormenting and killing them because one of their members killed his ape-mother, Kala. In later books we get to meet noble blacks who Tarzan admires, but his relationship with them is always paternalistic.One of the things I remember from when I read the books as a kid was that if I read several of them in a row, I would become depressed. I concluded then that it was because there is so much death in the books. That may have been the reason. I recall that in later books the killing becomes much more perfunctory, whereas in the early books he does develop scruples about the cold-blooded murder of his fellow men. (In fact, there are a few times in the second and third books where I wished he would go ahead and kill the recurring villain, and put him out of my misery.) I mention this for the benefit of parents who may want to control the reading material of their children. These books have a PG-13 rating, and there may be a cumulative effect from reading several at a time.I found that there was also a cumulative effect for adults, but slightly different. By the third book, the constant move from danger to danger, and the length of time it takes to resolve situations, had become extremely wearying. I think it should be a rule of literature that a recurring villain should never be allowed to escape from the hero more than twice.I have given the book a rating of four, which is on the high side if it were judged on literary merit alone, but I am taking into consideration its influence on the culture and its iconic status. Those who love pulp fiction should read the four as a five. Those who prefer a bit of Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy, might want to read it as a two or three. Those who prefer only modern literature may want to skip it altogether."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"very good book it tookme there days to read it.the writing is very goodbut it leaves you askingqueszions about Jane and Tarzan,are they going to leave togetheror Jane going to marry the otherguy Claton?but it is a good boook"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This book has action, excitement, drama, suspense, and unfortunately racism. Edgar Rice Burroughs clearly wrote to a white, male audience with this book, which in 1914 when it was first published was likely the case. Tarzan is that primordial man with no obligations but to himself who somehow teaches himself to write while also teaching himself to be the most cunning entity in the jungle. He can read and write and then go kill an ape or lion on his way home. What a guy.The fact that he is white and somehow has more survival skills and jungle knowledge than the native blacks is a bit puzzling, but again, remember the time frame it was written in. Whites had come to dominate Africa, as its rightful owners in their opinions, so why not have a hero who can do it all better than any of the natives.But let's not forget the entertainment value. I rate the entertainment value high as it is a good story and moves at a fast pace. Again, white readers will feel easier about the book than others, but all in all it is not a bad book. It is a bit peculiar that the two examples of ship crews are both prone to mutiny, but maybe Burroughs was trying to make some kind of unwritten point."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I never read Tarzan as a kid but I did watch the TV show and thought it was ok.

Often Tarzan finds that human logic did not suffice. He did not understand greed, or conceit, or a seeking to dominate when you already were well taken care of. With tons of action, this classic brings one to question what are human values, and have we really advanced from that of the animal kingdom."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I'm old enough to remember seeing the old B&W; movie \\"Tarzan the Ape Man,\\" a 1930s flick, when I was a kid in the '50s. Johnny Weismuller was the Great White Ape, swinging from vine to vine across the screen (bellowing his famous cry) and, occasionally dropping on a ferocious lion, knife between his perfect white teeth, killing the dangerous beast. More times than not he was saving Jane, played by the beautiful actress Maureen O'Sullivan, from being eaten alive or a fate worse than death. It was a terrific adventure movie, but not half as exciting as the original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs.In the book, Tarzan lives his early life, literally from the cradle, among the great apes, growing to manhood thinking of himself as one of them without all the body hair. He communicates by making ape-ish grunts and sounds like the members of his family, having been brought up after the deaths of his real parents, Lord and Lady Greystoke of England, by mama ape Kala, and having had no contact with other humans. He survives, and grows stronger day by day, adapting to the ways of the ape tribe and using his superior brain to figure out how to overcome obstacles that lesser animals couldn't. He's one heck of a primal guy!Through many adventures and encounters with beasts of all kinds, the more deadly being human, Tarzan learns of the ways and language of white men. He teaches himself to read and write English, to speak French after rescuing...well, I won't spoil it any more than I already have. You'll just have to enjoy reading about the stirring adventures of this fearless, selfless, caring, honorable and totally noble savage. And he does meet the stunningly beautiful Jane, who is from, of all places, Baltimore, Maryland.A few reviewers here were put off by the unPC language used by Burroughs when he described black Africans. They seem to be able to view things only through a narrow, multi-cultural microscope and forget that TARZAN OF THE APES was written 100 years ago. Because of this they are missing out on all the fun of being in a West African jungle and experiencing the many exciting adventures of Tarzan. If those reviewers had only read the whole book, and not just the parts that they found offensive, they'd have learned that Tarzan is more sensitive and open-minded than they think themselves to be.4 Stars. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"really great book for kindle, you mind as well give it a read sense it is free what do you got to lose"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I first read Tarzan and other works by Edgar Rice Burroughs while still very small. Part of me still wants to go swinging through the jungle, fighting lions and gorillas with just a knife.This, the original, and the Jungle Tales of Tarzan (devoted to stories from his childhood) are my favorites. ERB of course found it profitable to crank out a new novel every two months or so. When he wasn't helping England fight World Wars 1 and 2, he kept busy finding \\"lost\\" cities in the depths of Africa.This work is a tribute to what can be done using a scant knowledge of the facts and lots of imagination. Tarzan's Africa is an alternate reality to the actual continent even as it was a hundred years ago, but certainly a lot of fun. There are no \\"great apes\\" who behave like gorillas. And where the gorillas are solitary."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"One of my classics, something that made me love to read. I downloaded it onto my Kindle to read again. I was happy to see that it was free but the kindle version won't give me the great cover artwork. I think Boris Vallejo's covers are the best and show the ruthless, loyal, powerful Tarzan as he was meant to be. I never heard that it was a ripoff of Kipling...I hope not...I think it stands by itself. This isn't a Disney Tarzan dancing in the jungle with the animals to some show tune for 12 year olds...like another reviewer was looking for. What??? 3 Generations know the Disney version? I must be old... give me the Tarzan that carries the knife of his long dead father and tears the flesh of Bara the deer with his strong white teeth while it is still warm..."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"After having \\"A Princess of Mars\\" published in \\"All-Story\\" as \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\" from February through July of 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs was unable to get his \\"Outlaw of Torn\\" published, but he did manage to get \\"All-Story\\" to devote an entire edition of their magazine to \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\". Burrough's had written the story between December of 1911 and May of 1912, and it appeared by itself in the October 1912 edition of the magazine. It was published in book form on June 17, 1914, Burrough's first book to be published, and it was published by A. C. McClurg & Company, who had rejected it previously but after its enormous popularity they changed their minds.Tarzan has become an iconic character, to say the least. Burroughs went on to write over twenty sequels, and of course there are numerous movies, comic books, etc. based on the character. While one cannot ignore the impact the creation of the character has had, the original story is not particularly good. Burroughs had free reign to define Mars as he wished, but his depiction of Africa is well off the mark. Burrough's imagination is somewhat lacking in the tale as well, going again and again to the presence of Lions to create a threat for Tarzan to deal with. One has to wonder how so many Lions in so small an area would be able to get enough food to survive, and they are in rather a dense jungle instead of the savannah.There are logical errors as well, such as Tarzan learning to read but not speak English, and yet somehow figuring out how to spell his name in English. There is the strange journey of the Professor Porter and Samuel T. Philander where they manage to get lost and walk unmolested through the same jungle as is shortly to contain numerous Lions. There is also the oddity of Tarzan struggling with Jane Porter writing that she doesn't love him (Tarzan) even though he deduces that she hasn't realized that he is Tarzan and is thus writing to someone she believes she has not yet met.Despite the problems, this is still a fun book to read, and it is nice to go back and see what started the phenomenon so long ago. I also don't want to give the impression that there is nothing but Lions, as there are cannibals and other wild creatures to contend with along the way. As with Burrough's other books, the story often relies on amazing coincidences, such as the Porter's, Philander, and the next Lord Greystoke being stranded in the very same spot as Tarzan's parents were. The best part about the book for me was the ending, as Burrough's handles Tarzan's sacrifice at the end quite well."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Kindle Review/Comments: I bought this exact kindle product and can say I remember very few if any errors. This is one of the first of my Kindle readings, so my memory is not fresh concerning spelling errors. But I don't remember any errors that caused me to pause mid-sentence, trying to understand where the transcriber went wrong, which does happen in some kindle books!Content Review/Comments: I almost read this book as a kid, and of course, now I wish I had. I loved reading the comics of Tarzan back then and now I know, I would have loved the original. This is not a kids book as some reviewers have noted. That is to say, ERB wrote his books with the everyday person in mind, not thinking his readers would be children necessarily. I would recommend this adventure to anyone 12-100 years.For parents, if you are concerned, I would read it or re-read it first, since there may be some questions from your child. It was written in a different time, about a very different place, with some violence.But the bottom line is: This is a fun read! It goes fast and kept my interest through-out. I liked it well enough to read several more in the Tarzan series before reading another author. So, if you love adventure stories, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"One of things that has to recommend the Tarzan books to us is the fact that they inspired a young Jane Goodall who, in turn, revolutionized our understanding not only of apes but humanity."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"&lt;spoiler> I loved the first part of this book, and was wrapped up in every detail the little ants presented me along the way. However, I wish that the story had continued on into eventual ending of The return of Tarzan. I was hugely disappointed in the ending--in that Tarzan was rejected by the fluctuating allegiance of Jane Porter and the book just dropped off, and not a cliff-hanger, but rather a soprano-esque ending."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I read this book before assighning it to my children. It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written. In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.). As an adult, I would believe that people are smart enough to weed out the literary license taken by this piece of fiction; and discuss the book with their children as to it's story, characters, and intent.I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I chose Tarzan of the Apes for my first experience with my new Kindle. For all the Tarzan movies, original TV show, and comics I have enjoyed since childhood, I never read the book until now. I really enjoyed the story, and even more so on the Kindle. I especially like the ability to quickly look up a handful of words, to which I was unfamiliar, and the ability to quickly pick up the Kindle and resume the story where I last left it. I have just started to read the second in the original series, Return of Tarzan."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is probably a kids book, but I really enjoyed it. The ending leads to a sequel that I am now reading--fun page turners."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"After reading this book you will realize there has never been a good movie portrayal of Tarzan. If you don't know the story of Tarzan, this is it. Tarzan is found by the Great Ape (no not a gorilla like in the Disney movie) and raised to be one of the tribe. Most of the story is about his growth as an ape (with a slight stretch in his teaching himself to read - though an article I read stated that is cryptographic techniques are used, it is possible - but I digress). The latter part of the book is his meeting Jane and others like him. If there is any weakness to the story it is the ending. It leaves you feeling like you need to read the next book to get the full story (The Return of Tarzan).As for the Kindle version, there is an active table of contents, but you can not get to it from the Go to... menu. You have to go to the beginning of the book and page to the TOC. Then you have to click in it and then it is active. I saw nothing missing and I did not see any formatting or spelling issues. Overall, being free, I see no reason to go with a different version unless you want books past the first 8. From what I have seen, you have to pay for those."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"More violent than any Tarzan version I've seen on the movies, this original one is quite a ride. It's quite impressive that Burroughs is able to write such a story without having visited Africa. Although he doesn't include descriptions of any specific known place in Africa, he is very detailed and poetic. Burroughs demonstrates his skill in using figurative language to describe the setting of this story and in establishing the mood or the atmosphere of it. It is precisely the poetic elements of the story, the use of figurative language which keeps this story's dynamic tempo.I mentioned before that this story is pretty violent. There are moments when the writer demands from its audience great leaps of faith when we read about the great amount of damage Tarzan suffers in his struggle with other apes. In one of his fights he loses a piece of his scalp. One interesting aspect is that Tarzan has no misgivings in his killings. He does this as a normal condition of his existence. The author has no misgivings in telling readers the many instances in which Tarzan uses a rope to kill natives to instill fear in them and obtain food and weapons from them. Violence in a chaotic world is also a motif the author uses in this story to establish a proper atmosphere. There is disorder and chaos from the beginning when a crew rebels against its captain for unfair treatment, and likewise, we see also the chaos produced by Kerchak among his own apes.In the first seventeen chapters, Tarzan learns to read and write without anyone's help. This requires a great leap of faith. In a message he leaves on the cabin's door for Europeans to see, Tarzan shows great command of the use of the apostrophe for the possessive, a very difficult skill. He also learns how to use the knife. He can also learn through modeling: he learns how to hunt by watching a native how to use the bow and arrow. Eventually, he develops fighting skills that help him defeat Kerchak, Tublat, and Terkoz. By the time Clayton and Jane Porter arrive he has become an undisputable leader of the apes.After chapter eighteen, the story begins to lose some rhythm. The characters of Mr. Porter and his friend are quite ridiculous. I know that Burroughs intended humor here, but it seemly feels annoying to hear the character saying \\"Tut, tut!\\" or repeat \\"remarkable\\" all the time. The story loses its poetic strength that had made the first part of the book an extraordinary piece of action. In the later chapters it seems to us that author was rushing through this story and he couldn't exploit the conflict of Jane's love for Tarzan and her duty toward Clayton. This, which promised to be the most exciting part, was handled superficially.Anyhow, it was a good read overall, and one gets to know the true and violent story of Tarzan."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I have been hunting feverishly for a while for an original text for Tarzan. This isn't it. It does clearly state on the cover that it is adapted. Just be aware that if you are looking for an unaltered version, skip on by this edition. It is geared toward young adult readers, not the avid Tarzan fan."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes was recommended to me by my teacher and I thought that it would be just a regular Tarzan story. but as I read this book, it was different from anything else I read about Tarzan. It was really fun and intresting.This book is a rerally fast paced book full of action, adventure, mystery, and a bit of romance. It is very intresting and although the start was tiring and boring for me, the book moves along fast later on in the book and it becomes a page turner.A person name Lord Greystroke and his wife land on a strange island and give birth to a child. But when apes come and discover them, they kill the man and women and leave behind their dead ape child and take Tarzan thinking that he is a ape. So Tarzan lives his live raised by apes and thinking that he is a ape. Until men of his own kind come he doesn't know what man is. When they come, Tarzan has to choose to which realm of the world he will go to. The civilization of mankind or the vast and dark jungle of the island. This presents a intresting story and if you read it I am sure you will be satisfied by this book too."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Many reviewers have pointed out the racism in this novel, and some of its other flaws. I will add that Tarzan is not really \\"the one that started it all\\" as there are many other books and stories that precede Tarzan of the Apes about children raised by animals who gain special strengths as a result of that upbringing. However, ERB brought it all together in Tarzan and created an iconic character. The book is very good, although it does show its age, or rather, the age in which it was written. Do yourself a favor and read it if you haven't, but make it a point to sample ERB's other works, notably the Martian series and perhaps the Pellucidar books. He has many other worlds and many other characters, and if you find Tarzan of the Apes not to your liking, I think you will like others from the universe of this talented author."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote this novel in 1914. It is the story of a baby raised by apes in Africa and coming back after many adventures to civilization. It is a very well written novel on heredity and training and how human intelligence can be impaired by nothing, even twenty years spent in the deepest jungle with apes. Human intelligence, even in the most adverse circumstances, will enable the subject to capture abilities and capabilities from the smallest elements available, and devise typically human procedures that will enhance his heredity and put him on the road to civilization. The turning point of this adventure is language and language can be captured provided some incentives are present, and they are in this story in the shape of books. From there human superiority based on intelligence can develop. The central element in the plot will be the confrontation of Tarzan with the famous Jane and his discovery of love and his desire to learn how humans may love. He will go through this long and thrilling experience with strength and an extreme sense of his humanity. The end of the novel is contained in the very last page and is very sad : the last lesson about humans, their gallantry. Tarzan yields the woman he loves and who loves him, his estate and his noble title for the sake of this very woman. But the book is not very nice with Jane who appears in the end as a fool dominated by fear, the fear of the unknown. But the book is still perfectly readable and enjoyable, even if the second woman character, Esmeralda, Jane's black servant, is characterized as even more frightened and void of courage as Jane herself. This is probably a sign of the time before the first world war, with a tinge of racism, especially when dealing with Africans.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I was given a copy of Tarzan of the Apes by an English professor who knew I enjoyed reading in my spare time.

Also, Tarzan of the Apes on Compact Disc (CD) provides a clear digital performance (static free) that makes listening to the story all the more pleasurable."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Tarzan of the Apes was beautifully written. All the movies and shows do not justify the real Tarzan. I would recommend every one to read it at least once. It draws you into the deep savage heart of the African jungle and you feel like you are right next to Tarzan himself. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it ended, to me, unfinished like there was more to be said. But I thought that was brillant of Burroughs because it kept you guessing and made you want to buy the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The story of Tarzan, first told more than 75 years ago, is so familiar that is has become part of the fabric of modern American mythology and literary folklore. A story so unique and successfully received by the public that it spawned an additional twenty-three more Tarzan books, as well as countless comics, radio serials, movies and television programs. What makes this Books On Tape addition of Tarzan Of The Apes stand out for a new generation of listeners is the narration by Walter Costello who does perfect justice to Edgar Rice Burroughs imaginative tale of a young infant being adopted and raised by a tribe of great apes, his boyhood adventures, his transition to manhood, his encounters with other humans, and his discovery of love in the person of Jane. This nine hour, six cassette edition is flawlessly recorded and will prove to be a wonderfully successful and popular addition to any school or library audiobook collection -- and a &quot;must&quot; for all Tarzan fans!"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"So, the publisher's name is 1st edition and the date of publication is 2009. Hmmm"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"I think most people have at least a vague concept of the Tarzan story and its characters. There have been many official Tarzan movies over the years and many stories and other movies that refer to or borrow from the Tarzan mythos. To a large extent, I went into this first Tarzan book (there were over 20 books written) with a pretty good feel for what to expect from the storyline. Despite that, I found some unique elements that I didn't expect.The adventure story within the book is pretty much what I had expected from the movies and TV shows I'd seen. There were a few elements where movie-makers had taken some liberties (possibly with concepts from other books and sometimes to make things more \\"screen worthy\\" - such as \\"me tarzan, you jane\\" which never happens in the book). I actually found that the adventures of the book were pretty fun to read and kept the pace of the book moving rather well.The book dealt a lot with exploring the character of the characters and the concept of what makes a man. At some times, these sections of narrative were interesting and insightful. At other times, these segments felt poorly informed, assumptive and racist/misogynistic . Generally speaking, the negative aspects of character development distracted me from the positive workmanship to the point that I had a hard time placing any validity on any of the characters.Scientifically speaking, Tarzan's development in the wild is completely unbelievable and his later development of \\"human\\" traits is likewise unbelievable. Setting those concepts under the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" clause used in fiction, I then got hung up on the behavior of the animals and especially of the other humans.The Women are as helpless lumps of life with their main purpose in life being to provide something that man can provide for and save from hardship and peril. The Men are inconsistent and can either be heartless self-centered ingrates willing to hurt (or kill) anyone for their own advancement, well-intentioned heroes who are physically incompetent and unable to follow through, or complete idiots unfit to do anything productive at all. Tarzan is the only \\"true man\\" and as such he finds himself ostracized and unable to find a happy existence either in civilization or the jungle (though he definitely prefers the jungle).Despite not being a fan of the way the characters were portrayed or the way everyone interacted with each other, I still enjoyed the story and there's a part of me that wants to read some of the other books simply for the fun, fluffy enjoyment of wild adventures. Burroughs writing style was fluid and rich and provided for a quick and enjoyable read. This is a book worth reading for the fun of it and to look at its influence on the media and culture of the 100 years since it was written.***3 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is a classic adventure story that can be enjoyed by all ages. One warning though-the treatment of blacks, although standard for the time, is jarringly alarming in our time. The story of the boy raised by an unknown species of ape (surviving prehistoric primates?) is well known but slightly tainted by numerous movies and tv shows that changed the image of Burroughs' creation. His discovery (and subsequent denial) of his true origins make a poignant story coupled with the standard romance with Jane. Other than the treatment of the native Africans, my only problem with this book is his self taught education. If Tarzan learned to read and write English from children's primers and his father's books, how did he learn to spell 'Kerchak'?"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Im not sure why this book was so captivating but it was! I suppose I just liked the way it was written. It wasn't pretentious or overly descriptive. It simply told the story.Since Tarzan was written many decades ago, I was surprised to find myself so into the book. There are no lags and its a quick, fun read. I think the author did a good job of writing about how a savage might observe civilization after growing up in the jungle. There are some things you should know about this book before you dive in though:First, its pretty violent. Not in a gruesome, grotesque way, but it seems that someone dies in almost every chapter.Second, animals are not glamoured or made to be like people. The author very clearly states that animals are 'beasts': brutal and savage. Tarzan eventually evolves beyond the intelligence of the apes that raised him.Third, it is racist. I dont think it intends to be. It clearly states that 'not all african americans are brutal', however that is how they are depicted through much of the book.The ending was also a bit disappointing, but thats because Tarzan was always meant to be a series."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Judging by some of the reviews here, I may get lynched for this...Despite his longevity and universal appeal, Tarzan got off to a crachingly poor start. His story is interesting-I'll give Burroughs that much-but the writing is unimpressive. Burroughs was not first and foremost a writer, and perhaps he was uncomfortable with the attempt, but this book is verbose and quite honestly inept. It seems to me as if while Burroughs was clunkily setting down his prose, he would leaf through a thesaurus every time an idea was in the least bit sophisticated.Is Tarzan worth reading? Yes, as a sort of early compendium of the serial hero's requred traits, an insight into adventure and science fiction. You may get an insight into later works, like Star Wars and especially Indiana Jones. But don't expect to be captivated."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"Haven't read this story since I was a kid. Took a while to get used to the diction used and you can tell the times that it was written with the attitudes of the characters towards each other. Wonder how he would write the story in modern times."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The first thing that must be said about this book is that it is appallingly racist (the unabridged work, at least, not the one bowdlerized for children).The style is penny-dreadful; the secondary characters are largely two-dimensional; and the plot itself is, bluntly, schlock.Yet it is page-turning schlock.In Tarzan of the Apes, Edgar Rice Burroughs delivers a story that is more than the sum of its pedestrian parts. Once the title character has grown up and becomes the central part of the story (after the passing of his deucedly British parents, who somehow never manage to be as interesting or fleshed out as the apes of Tarzan's adopted tribe), I found I couldn't put this book down, even as I scoffed at the pasteboard characters and winced at the demeaning portrayal of Jane Porter's black &quot;mammy.&quot;Jane herself is a silly girl, who never rises to the spunky level of Minnie Driver's voice performance in the Disney film, and Professor Porter is a character so utterly unbelievable it defies description. Other characters, such as the likeable Cecil Clayton and the brave French Lieutenant D'Arnot, fare better.But there is no denying the fascinating power of the &quot;clean limbed young giant&quot; at the center of the tale. When Tarzan is on stage, the flaws of the rest of the book fade into the background. As Clayton himself admits, &quot;For a naked man to drag a shrieking, clawing man-eater forth from a window by the tail to save a strange white girl, was indeed the last word in heroism.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"This is a classic story everyone should read but find another version."},{"Title":"Tarzan of the Apes","review":"The plot was excellent.

We used this book in a couples' group over 7 weeks. We found the content and fill-in-the-blank style somewhat helpful, as it guided you into thinking and discussion while allowing you to think, not telling you what to think. We allowed the book to start discussion around the table with other couples, but there were times when the discussion was private, between spouses. Especially helpful was the weekly homework, where spouses were required to meet together and work through some topic for 45 minutes. Our entire group agreed the forced time together, talking, was one of the best aspects of the experience. I recommend getting a few friends togehter and working through the book as a group--the exposure to other's ideas, finding out others have similar issues in their marriages, and the accountability of the group will help this book have it's best effect in your marriage."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"I have lived with a rare chronic illness scince age 5. I was given a used copy of the first edition of this book at age 19, my body was failing &amp; the doctors didn't know what to do. I started reading and within the first few pages I felt a connection to people I will never know, the &quot;characters&quot; were real people, of all ages and diseases. It spoke of the frustration they feel when their bodies hurt, it explained that chronic illness does not only affect the afflicted but everyone around them; their families, friends, and the doctors. I read the words that I had always felt but couldn't find a adequate way to express them, it made me realize that I was not alone. This book is like a instant support group, letting you get to know these people in such a intimate way and at the same time allowing yourself to find the confidence to take control of your illness. There is no psyco-analyzing or &quot;shrink&quot; talk, these are real people speaking from their heart. The author compiles the chapters in such a way that the subjects never get monotonous, you never read the same topic twice. Anyone who lives with a chronic illness or has a loved one who does should read this book, it will open your eyes to this unspoken and misunderstood world of chronic illness. This book is honest, simply spoken and a easy read, get it..I am so glad I did."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"This book can make you both smile and weep, as did its predessor, &quot;Living With Chronic Illness.&quot; &quot;The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life&quot; is probably one of the most important books in my collection as I deal with chronic illness myself. I met the author in 1990 and heard her speak about the unique nature of rare and chronic diseases, and found myself nodding and smiling throughout her talk. If you are dealing with a chronic illness, you will re-read this book (or sections of it) for years as you experience different problems. I've marked mine up with yellow highlighter and underlining and have shared it with family members and friends to increase their knowledge and understanding of what it's REALLY like to live with a chronic illness."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"As someone who deals with a couple of chronic illnesses I found this book refreshing practial and inspiring.

I highly recomend this book for not only chronically ill individuals but family, friends, interested parties and medical professionals."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"This book is not so much about self-care -- exercise, diet, medications, relaxation and such -- but it is very strong on getting the support you need to live successfully with a chronic condition. I used her material extensively in writing The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.Most of us don't like to ask for help. It makes us feel weak, guilty, needy or even &quot;un-American.&quot; But mutual assistance is the way the world works. Register gives powerful reasons to ask for and accept help, likely places to find it, and ways of paying people back. She points out that most people like to help, and that we can help others in our turn.Her book is also very strong on dealing with the medical profession and financial issues, how to keep your illness from impoversihing you. She continues to thrive with her condition, teaches at a university and has written several more books. She is an inspiring and practical teacher."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"This book was recommended by the Arthritis Association, so I picked it up at the library first. I kept it well past the due date, and finally purchased a copy of my own because I know I need to read it again and again. It is first hand experiences from real people, confirming that what I am feeling is not unusual. I'm coping better since reading The Chronic Illness Experience.

I started with the CDC web site for reliable medical info and also found a disease-specific local support group. But what really gave me the aha! that I'm connected to all people with chronic illness was reading The Chronic Illness Experience by Cheri Register. Reading the words of so many people in that book - they were so much like me, even though our illnesses were different. It really helped me develop my identity as a person with a disability and I've made fabulous connections with other people with disabilities who understand disability as a way of being more than just medical deficit. Many of my symptoms have been lifelong, but I no longer identify (most of the time!) as a weak runt, which was how I saw myself before. Hooray for disability culture and for being able to recognize and appreciate the experiences of other people with invisible chronic illness. -- it becomes less invisible when you see yourself (and your fatigue, pain, etc.) in others."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"This is a book written by someone that has lived with a horrific chronic illness and really knows what she is talking about whne it comes to offering advice to others in similar situations.This book is great if you have a somewhat relapsing and remitting disease. But I must say I found very very little here for coping with very severely disabling disease with no breaks! The type that is only rarely fatal, but is very disabling for years on end.No one disease type is any worse than another, but the way one lives with a disease that is scarily life-threatening now and then but sometimes leaves you pretty much well for years at a time (as was the case for the author) is very different to some extent to how ones copes with a disease that is very severe and disabling to the point of making a person bedbound, housebound and almost unable to speak or read or write at all and so on.I don't even remotely envy the author this type of disease, not at all, her experiences were really horrifying to read about. One cannot compare differnet types of diseases, horrific is just horrific.I don't mean all this even as a criticism of the book really, as I am sure this book is suitable for many poeple and it is very engaging. Perhaps I am too picky but I just want to add this comment about it not fitting some disease types as well as others for the benefit of readers such as myself who will not get as much out of this book as some others might and may be somewhat disappointed with it. Horses for courses!This book seems pretty great overall though. It contains much more than the usual superfical and commonly given advice. The author clearly knows this topic well and is passionate about the topic, and writes well.(A note to my fellow M.E. patients: This book described a very different illness experience to severe M.E. so much of what was said wasn't relevent. For example, the author faced life and death medical emergencies now and then, but then was almost perfectly well for years. This is so different to what M.E. is like. This is a high quality book just perhaps not suited to M.E. patients and severe M.E. patients.)Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"I read this book under the original title, and went right back to the bookstore and bought all the other five copies they had in stock. One went to my lupus support group's library, and I wanted to have extras to give to others struggling with new and lifelong diagnoses (while holding fast to a copy for me to re-read over and over over the years--I knew I was going to want to, and I have.) A dozen or so years later, it is still the best-written book on the subject."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"Cheri Register's book \\"Living With Chronic Illness\\" was both validating and helpful to me.Eight years of living with chronic migraines has effected my faith, self-image, independence, relationships, work aspirations and what I consider my purpose in life.At first I tried to minimize the migraines disabling effect but over time and with more acceptance I have, for the most part, found ways to accommodate and live with them.Register describes many of the challenges of living with chronic illness. Sickness in our culture is seen as an enemy to be fought and defeated. These war images cast chronically ill people as victims, and it's sometimes seen as a character defect if we experience suffering, grief or fear. Instead of #battling# the illness we can accept it as something we live with that is our normal state of being. The realization that we can be happy and sick is a major lesson.Our culture expects a person's disability to be a test of character or an opportunity for heroism. People effected with illness should not have to prove their value to others. We are not better or worse, no more heroic or cowardly, strong or weak than healthy people. We are people first not a disease.Other hurdles for the chronically ill include: loss of autonomy, (self-reliance and being financially self-supporting carries the imprint of virtue). For the chronically ill not pulling your weight is compounded by the fear of becoming indigent and feeling different. Unemployment not only involves economic loss but the loss of identity, productivity, self worth and a sense of meaning. Register says it is important to separate our economic and identity issues from the quest of human worth. When we accept our illness we can stop looking for a cause to blame or a miracle cure.Chronic Illness challenges our relationships. Adversity can bring couples closer but with chronic illness the adversity comes and goes on a regular basis. The crisis may even become the core of the relationship. Illness highlights and compounds the gender differences. Females are trained to show emotion and males to hide them. It is easier for women to \\"be there\\" for intimacy and shared vulnerability. Women often want simple consolation from their husbands, what they get instead is a rational solution. Seeing their mate sick leaves many men feeling powerless. When a relationship requires sustained expression of thoughts and feelings it may become burdensome for the mate.Register illuminates patience as a way of life for the chronically ill. Acceptance means taking realistic control over how we live and being ready for chaos. The \\"one day at a time approach\\" helps. When pain grows intense it demands complete attention. It also helps to focus on the recovery instead of the traumas.Most doctors are more comfortable caring for acute illness. When medications do not work the patient rather than the medication is often blamed. Few doctors are honest about the limits of medical knowledge and trust patients enough to be partners in care.Register acknowledges that anger, fear and grief are healthy responses to physical suffering. The value of catharsis allows us to face the emotions head-on rather than avoid or dismiss them. It is reassuring to hear that having suicidal fantasies are a normal consequence of chronic illness and not evidence of losing hold. Since most people do not act on their suicidal thoughts, considering death as a way out of the pain often diffuses the suffering. Also, when we confront the suicidal fantasy head-on it looses its power. Register even came to regard her own suicidal fantasies as a treasured choice. Knowing that suicidal thoughts are a feature of the illness is empowering.Instead of asking \\"why me?\\" the chronically ill are better served by the question \\"what now?\\" And for people of faith we might ask, \\"what do you want from me God?\\" which implies not penance but fulfillment of a mission. Instead of seeing chronic illness as a punishment for sin, an endurance test, a divine plan geared to your natural capacity or a random event Register recommends we see chronic illness and suffering as central to the human condition. It is our own share of life's condition - a way of life not an aberration. Register says, to live with passion allows us to live with the dynamics of contradiction in joy and sorrow, caring and indifference, in courage and fear, in friendship and alienation. Passion is a fully human and divine spark that burns with life.To answer the question \\"what should I do?\\" Register says, \\"Just live your life, pain and all with attention and purpose.\\" Lived fully, the experience of illness can free us from the curse of perfection. For people of faith learning to feel God's pain makes us more attuned to God's pleasure. Life is a beautiful tapestry being woven with our lives, it's pattern visible only to God.Register redefines the disabled hero as one who demonstrates a capacity to come through multiple ordeals with their will intact. Instead of winners and losers, survivors have moments of courage, moments of cowardice, moments of determination and moments of despair, moments of glory and moments of humiliation. That many of us survive these ups and downs is a miracle that happens many times a day.Register describes the ingredients of survival for the chronically ill: a sense of humor, tenacity, a will to live, discipline, inner strength, trusting ourselves, inner peace, acceptance, a support system, faith, skepticism, and a belief in a Higher Power and Purpose. Instead of saying, \\"There but for the grace of God go I\\" we might say, \\"Here, with the grace of God, I am.\\" Our bodies are, after all, our medium for experiencing creation."},{"Title":"The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life","review":"I'd heard about this book when it was first published back in the 1980's, but it's taken all these years and developing chronic illness before I first got it out of the library, then bought it to have so I can refer back to it in the future. Cheri Register shares her experience and those of other patients she interviewed, and their accumulated wisdom. I love this book for it's straightforward tone and warmth, easing my fears and allowing me to relate to the stories of all the people Register interviewed. I know of only one other book on the market that focuses on living with a chronic illness, and I'd recommend Register's book as the first one anyone reads. Buy it! Read it!

Half of all prison inmates are African American. It is impossible to summarize the author's subtle and well documented analyses in a few sentences. He convincingly shows that these numbers are not, or are not merely, due to high rates of criminal activity, but rather to factors such as social inequality, inordinate media attention given to crime, political demagoguery (&quot;get tough on crime&quot;), and a long legacy of racial discrimination. Mauer makes many suggestions for a more humane and effective response to crime than the current &quot;race to incarcerate.&quot; He concludes his book with the moving appeal to stop &quot;caging the least fortunate among us to solve our problems.&quot; Read it!!"},{"Title":"Race to Incarcerate","review":"This book came to me a bit by accident, and after reading it I have taken what opportunities I have to tell people about it.The author analyzes many, many studies relating to the criminal justice system to shed light on why we have so many people in jail, why a disproportionate number of them are minorities, and why this massive rate of incarceration hasn't been as effective as one would think in reducing crime. Reading it, I had many moments where I had to stop and truly digest what was being said. One such moment was Mauer's discussion of how the degree of punitiveness in a community has drastic consequences for how many members of that community end up in jail. For example, if the result of a minor drug offense in Urban City X results in jail time, while the laws of Suburb Y punish that same offense with mandatory drug rehabilitation and/or community service, the Inner City ends up with a seemingly higher crime rate because more people are incarcerated. And that's just one example of the insights in this book.I will say that the constant reference to statistics can make the book a bit of a slower read. However, Mauer wouldn't be able to make his case without these facts. I think it is important for all citizens to become more aware of what's happening with this, even if the topic of jail seems to have nothing to do with your life. I don't have a background in Criminal Justice, so I don't know if maybe there's a better book for people to read to get informed about the topic. But having read this one, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Race to Incarcerate","review":"Small, slim book. Easy reading. The author provides numerous endnotes so you can track down the sources. I wanted more sound bites, more pithy quotes, more compelling arguments -- not because the book lacks for substance, but because the author does not present his powerful facts in the persuasive language of a lawyer or pundit.Example: on pp. 156-57, he says, &quot;The folly of using expensive prison space for drug offenders, even traffickers, has been documented in research conducted on the federal prison population.&quot; My objections: (1) The author uses the passive voice constantly, and it sounds weak. Why not phrase it like this: &quot;Researchers have documented the folly ....&quot; (2) I would break out the argument about traffickers separately. Win the point about small-time users first, and then piggyback on that to explain the presumably more controversial view that we should not even incarcerate the traffickers. (3) After reading the sentence just quoted, I immediately thought to myself that the other dumb thing about locking up a small-time user is that you basically send him/her to graduate school for criminals. S/he might learn better ways of avoiding detection or conviction for crimes, drug-related or otherwise, and might come to sympathize with the anti-law enforcement attitudes of convicted criminals who become his/her friends in prison. I wanted to know whether these sorts of outcomes do occur, and I wanted the author to make a strong anecdotal and/or statistical case for the rather obvious point that iffy characters, who are not hardened criminals, should have good role models. The author did not say any of these things, nor indicate the extent of existing or needed research on such questions. Moreover, he said nothing at all on this matter until his very last sentence in that section of the book, where he said only this: &quot;Further, by reducing ties to legitimate institutions, incarceration may make these offenders 'more prone to subsequent criminal involvement.'&quot; I make this point because it happened repeatedly throughout the book: to me, a stated fact or finding immediately implied certain follow-up questions or conclusions, but the author did not seem to share my sense of what was most interesting or important about it.Admittedly, more persuasive language would have lengthened the book, and possibly the author and/or publisher decided the actual writing style would be better for their own particular purposes. For instance, I did in fact check this book out of the library, and I did read it, whereas I, or at least some readers, might not have checked out a thicker volume. Even so, I did not come away from the reading with a sense of having been moved, persuaded, or given the sort of substance that would stay with me. I submit that, ultimately, the reader will prefer a longer book over a shorter one if the longer book is more gripping."},{"Title":"The Story of Electricity (2 Volumes)","review":"I purchased volume one because I knew a piece I wanted was in it.

Kate Kimball, the daughter of Natasha and Spencer (from Taming Natasha), is a ballet dancer, who has come home to open a dance school. Brody O'Connell is the contractor who fixes up the building for Kate's school. Kate and Brody automatically hit it off, but Brody is leary of a relationship because he is a widow with a 6 year old son, Jack, to take care of. Kate is flirtatious and pushes Brody to take her out, Brody on the other hand is trying to resist her, although he wants her. In Considering Kate all the characters are winners. You will fall head over heels for little Jack, not too mention the rest of the family. Considering Kate is a great read, and a great follow up. I really got into the whole family and at times found myself laughing and tearing up, which I think a good book should make a person do!"},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"Professional ballet dancer Kate Stanislaski returns home to open the dance studio of which she's always dreamed. Tired of the harsh pace of dancing in New York, she's ready for the quite life. She didn't expect, however, to meet sexy Brody O'Connell in her mother's toy store almost as soon as she set foot in town. Nor did she expect to find their mutual attraction so powerful. Most men have taken a look at her delicate form and assumed romanticism and fragility. Seldom could they cope with what they really find--steel. Brody, however, is up to the challenge.A widower, Brody's one priority for the last six years has been his son Jack. Fatherhood had &quot;kicked the stuffing out of the arrogant, careless and often reckless boy. And it had made a man out of him.&quot; Soon he finds himself contracted to do the renovation on Kate's studio, and when he goes to the building, he sees Kate dancing inside. She absolutely dazzles him. Kate ignores Brody's protests that he's not interested in getting involved, intuiting where his real concerns lie. Brody might protest all he wants, but Kate gets what she wants. And she wants Brody has her husband and Jack as her son.Rather than being put off by Brody's moods, Kate finds herself invigorated by the way he gets scowly and turned on at the same time--she believes it is both challenging and sexy. Kate gives as good as she takes, never hesitating to tell the director that he look like a pig, in the Ukrainian language, or Brody where to stuff it. She's accustomed to hard work, and doesn't shy away from darkened basements or the bottom line of a very expensive renovation, always keeping her eye on the goal. Indeed, Kate's fierce determination makes her character extraordinary and appealing. No self doubt for this powerful woman.I'm blushing to admit this, but CONSIDERING KATE is the first novel I've read by Nora Roberts. Yes, I know she's one of the queens of romance, but this reviewer seldom reads by choice, instead I read what lands on my desk by request. After reading CONSIDERING KATE, however, I hereby consider myself an ardent fan and intend to spend more time on books by Nora Roberts! Roberts' independent and spirited characters, the wonderful Stanislaski family, and her sparkling narrative voice make this book a keeper. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"Lovely and gifted Kate Kimball lived out her dream of being a prima ballerina. Now all she wants is to return home to West Virginia and set up her new school of dance in the town where she grew up. She has everything planned out and has factored in all the risks. She knows she can make a success of her new dream but she needs Brody O'Connell's skills to make her dream a reality. As the head of his own construction company, Brody's life revolves around his work and his six-year old son Jack. But he is drawn to the aggressive and persistent dancer who has entranced his son and who is captivating him in spite of his own reservations.With \\"Considering Kate\\", author Nora Roberts takes her audience back to the heart-warming Stanislaski family. The plot of Kate's story draws heavily upon its predecessor, \\"Taming Natasha\\". Fans of this particular family will recognize the inversion and the nostalgia it invokes. For new readers, \\"Considering Kate\\" stands alone as a solidly written story with a determined and winsome heroine and an admirable and endearing hero. Though there is nothing creative or new about Roberts' plot, her characterizations are as strong as ever and Kate, Brody, Jack and a number of other secondary characters really help this story to stand on its own. Again, the author has a fantastic knack for skillfully drawing upon the Stanislaski family, which is rich with love and rife with emotional support. And though Roberts draws upon them extensively throughout the story, she never allows it to eclipse Brody and Kate's relationship. These two develop their affection for each other at a comfortable and credible pace without any unnecessary angst but with a great deal of charm."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"I love Nora Roberts. I have read everything the woman has ever written, and will continue to do so. She has a formula that works for me. The thing about Nora is, when you have read about 15 or so of her books, it is very easy to pick out characters/stories that have similarities.\\"Considering Kate\\" is no exception. As I was reading this I was reminded of \\"The McGregor Brides\\". I think it was Julia's story where she is working as a real estate agent and has to gut her house and then falls in love with the contractor. This story has several of the same situations even down to the kitchen remodeling ideas.Kate is a direct woman who knows what she wants. She is the one of those Stanislaski's that we are all so fond of, and we get to check in on most of the clan. She has decided that it is time to retire from her career as a professional ballerina and start her own studio. Kate has purchased an old building in her parent's hometown, and the renovations begin.Brody...what can I say except this man I want to meet! He is beautiful, sensitive, and in love with his son. He is a widower and has the sole responsibility of raising his little boy, Jack. Brody is the contractor hired to renovate Kate's dance studio. He is resistant to Kate's overtures at first, but of course he comes around.If you like Nora's stuff you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"Brody O'Connell is a widower with a 6 year old son.

You start to feel as if these people actually exist and you are somehow apart of it. Kate is a primadonna ballerina. She gave it up to be a dance teacher in her hometown. She is going to open the only dance school in town and Brody is her sexy contractor. The minute she sees Brody at her mother's toy store, she knew that she wanted him and she would do anything to get him. Brody on the other hand doesn't want anything to do with her....at first.... he can not fight the attraction and they fall in love...of course..the story of their ups and downs in love is the interesting part and Ms Roberts delivers a lot of ups and very little downs. Thanks again Nora for a great read....."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"&quot;Considering Kate&quot; is an excellent addition to the Stanislaski series. It is a quick read, and yet still manages to contain well-developed characters. I have no qualms about recommending this novel, it is well-written and lots of fun.The story revolves around Kate Kimball, daughter of Natasha and Spence from &quot;Taming Natasha.&quot; Kate has given up her career in the spotlight as a prima ballerina and has returned to her hometown to pursue her new dream of opening a dance school. She buys a wonderful but run-down old building and needs to find someone to renovate it. Sexy Brody O'Connell seems to be just the man for the job, so Kate hires his company to do the restoration. The chemistry between these two all but sparks from the pages, and Brody soon finds himself unable to resist his attraction to Kate. However, with Brody comes his six year old son, Jack, and Brody, being a responsible and loving parent, is concerned about the effect his relationship with Kate will have on his son. Because of this Brody is determined to take things slowly. Kate quickly finds herself falling in love with both father and son, and she decides that she will not stop until both of them belong to her.The romance between Kate in Brody is exciting and absorbing, and keeps the reader turning pages. The relationship that is portrayed between Brody and Jack is incredibly touching, and shows the reader how sensitive and caring this man really is. Kate's relationship with Jack, and Jack's proposal to Kate near the end of the book will warm your heart.This is a relatively short story, but it never fails to amaze me how much emotion and romance NR can pack into her shorter novels. This book will touch your heart, make you laugh and give you several hours of pure enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"Considering Kate is a tale of the Natasha Stanislaski and Spencer Kimball's youngest child and her story reminds me of the way her parents met -- in her mum's toy store, with the hero buying a gift for his child. Brody is a sensitive guy with a young son to raise. Jack is precocious and is Brody's weak spot whom he's extremely protective of (don't you just love that in a man). Anyway, to cut a long story short, Kate hired Brody to renovate the building she bought to start her ballet school, and falls for him in the process. Kate makes most of the moves as Brody is afraid of being in another relationship after his wife died. The scene about her confronting him on whether they are in fact &quot;dating&quot; or not is hilarious. I've always enjoyed reading about a yelling session and this is a particularly good one with an even better ending.It's good to revisit the characters from Nora Roberts' previous novels on the Stanislaski family although Considering Kate works perfectly well as a stand-alone. I hope there will be a story on Brandon, Kate's older brother who is a ball player next!"},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"A NEW DREAMShe's turned her back on glamour and fame and Kate Stanislaski Kimball had come home to begin a new life.

The hero was the single parent, struggling financially and emotionally unwilling to risk. The heroine was the famous professional, financially secure and the one who made all the romantic advances.

This book is not up to the standard of the first books or her J. D. Robb series. Maybe she's trying to write too many books at once."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"This is the 6th and last of the Stanislaski series. Which is a shame, because there are family members who have yet to be paired off.Dancer Kate Kimball, the daughter of Natasha and Spence from Taming Natasha, has come back home to West Virginia to open a dance school. She buys the building for it, and hires contractor Brody O'Connell to renovate it along with an apartment above the school for her.Brody is a single father to Jack, and he's determined to be a better father than his own dad, who's full of criticism.Their beginning isn't exactly auspicious: Kate offers a strong and direct sexual come-on, which Brody backs away from, then Kate sees him with his son and assumes he's married and is angry with him for that.Which is my biggest, and really only complaint about the book. I had a hard time warming up to Kate in the beginning. I know she was supposed to be up-front, honest and open, but she just seemed crude. I wouldn't have liked a male character talking like that, either, so I don't think I'm being sexist. And while the parallels with Natasha's story were cute, they were annoying. At least Natasha had a good reason to think Spence was married (a man and a woman in a toy store with a little boy--it's a natural assumption they're a couple), but Brody was by himself. It's not like single parents are a rarity.So it was really an uphill battle for me. If I were capable of not finishing a book, this one would have gone to the UBS mostly unread.One thing I always enjoy about Nora's Silhouettes is that it's so much fun when characters from one series pop up in another series. Loved the cameo of Ruth & Davidov from Dance of Dreams in this one.I generally dislike children in romances, but Jack was really the star of the show here. He stole all the scenes he was in, and his proposal to Kate was priceless.My complaints aside, for a thin category romance, it's nicely written. The conflict between Brody and his dad, and his relationship with his son, is dramatic and realistic, and convincingly resolved. Even Kate's seeming crudeness becomes more understandable once I saw her in the context of the dance world. And the obstacles to the romance grow naturally from character--Brody's father's criticism making Brody believe that someone from a privileged background couldn't be serious about him, for example.It's really unfortunate that Nora severed ties with Silhouette, because it seems that the foundation was laid for the next book in the Stanislaski series--featuring Kate's baseball player brother Brandon. I'm picturing the knee injury in this book sidelining him for more than just a few months, & he'll come home to recuperate---it'll drive him crazy to live with his parents, wonderful though Natasha & Spence may be, and he'll move into the apartment over the dance school. Or maybe a single woman rents the apartment from Kate and falls for Brandon. And Parks Jones from Rules of the Game could show up... Hmmm. Maybe Nora doesn't have to write the story after all.One little thing I did appreciate is the realism in the descriptions. One example: Brody's looking at Kate, and notices that her hair's pulled up in a complicated knot on the back of her head, instead of looking at her French twist or something. Brody doesn't know the name of the hairstyle, so it doesn't show up in his thinking. And there are other examples of that when Kate's looking at the building. It's one of my pet peeves, so I notice when it doesn't happen, and it gives me nice little warm fuzzies."},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"WOW. I have read a lot of Nora Roberts's work. This is her best story. Brody is an amazing father, and Kate...you can just tell she'd be an amazing mother. Roberts weaves everything together so beautifully- the tension between Brody and his father, all the Stanislaki family members and their own stories, bringing back Davidov and Ruth (who I absolutely love). And I laughed and I cried and I was so happy at the end!!! Not at all an abrupt or stupid ending that makes you feel like you wished you hadn't read the book in the first place. (Of course, Roberts doesn't ever give you that feeling with any of her books.) Absolutely amazing. The only reason I gave it a 5 was because you can't give it anything higher. I personally wouldn't just give it a 5- I'd give it a 50!!!"},{"Title":"Considering Kate: The Stanislaskis (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1379)","review":"Previous to this book, I had just finished Nora Roberts' \\"Public Secrets\\" and it was an amazing book but leaves you a bit depressed so I needed a delightful, light hearted book to conteract all the horrors of \\"Public Secrets\\".

The relationship between this father and son was just so touching. The book made me laugh and cry. I will admit a tear when Jack asks Kate to marry \\"us\\".

In fact, and in the interest of clarity, both books should have their title swapped.And there are advantages to choosing things topically. We get to the point, without having to hunt-and-peck. And the sections are organized according to theme. So if you are in a pinch, you can find the quote quicker.(The disadvantage being the lost of context-sermon context, and the progressive context of speeches. We get atomized ideas, and free-floating quotes.)There are other advantages. This book has other people's descriptions of Joseph, and it includes a copy of the Nauvoo Charter, Joseph Smith's \\"Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States\\" (Minus his reply letters), and the complete Wentworth Letter--which should have been included in \\"Teachings.\\"I would recommend this book for someone who has the Church Manual, \\"Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith,\\" and wants to go to the next level before tackling \\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\\"Now a word aboutEncyclopedia of Joseph Smith's Teachings. Both of these books are topical, and, in a pinch, I would go with \\"The Encyclopedia of Joseph Smith's Teachings.\\" It has the version of the First Vision, the poetic version of Section 76, and includes the Lectures on Faith and entries from They Knew The Prophet.But that information can be overwhelming, as can the encyclopedia's size.

I am reading it again now and once more greatly appreciate the spiritual and prophetic powers of Joseph Smith. Truely he was a genuine prophet of God. I have no shadow of doubt. Not since Jesus Christ has there come such a flood of truth to the earth through Joseph Smith's divine revelations. If you do not believe me, obtain a copy of this book, but before opening it, humbly ask God for a clear discernment of truth, then read the book carefully. Following that, read the 'Book of Mormon' and 'Doctrine and Covenants' (both revealed from God through Joseph Smith) and you will see what I mean. Religous error is simply blown away.

But it is not without flaws. Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education argues in favor of the current trends in eliminating the traditional \\"western canon\\" as it has been understood. Critics have come at Nussbuam from nearly every conceivable front, claiming that she argues that education is ultimately political, that she provides ineffectual anecdotal evidence from America's top-tier and well-funded universities, that she aims to destroy the western perspective and finally, that she is idealistic and unpractical.Each of these points is well founded but lack viable impetus unless one other element of Nussbaum's argument is noticed. Namely, that Nussbaum's book is a book about critical thinking skills and how they are taught in our nation's universities. The peripheral issues of gender, class and ethnicity, (where most of Nussbaum's critics attack), must been seen under the overall issue of education's primary purpose, namely, to produce rational thinkers. Thus, her thesis is much more about cultivating rationality and less about carrying a torch against the Western Canon.To explain how rationality is to be cultivated, Nussbaum devotes much of her efforts to getting clear on what it means to be a \\"world citizen\\". This discussion is thoughtful and informative, even if you ultimately disagree with her. Yet, embedded in this detailed examination are serious assumptions about morality, which many other critics have noticed as well. She breezes through claims about avoiding \\"retributive anger\\", being \\"empathetic\\" and being \\"non-violent\\"; which prima facie sound reasonable. However, it may make some nervous that she grounds her entire argument on a morality that is far from generally accepted among philosophers. Nussbaum is harkening back to her roots as an expert in ancient philosophy, and this Aristotelian bias must be remembered as one reads through her argument. If you are an Aristotelian, a Hippy, or if you accept the ideas of Natural Law, Nussbaum's argument will be more successful for you.Finally, as Nussbaum sets out her definition of what a Liberal Education is, she ignores the certain impact that her argument, if correct, will have on college instruction and pedagogy. While it may be possible to accept her implicit moral claims for the sake of an enticing discussion, I, like many others, was disappointed that she failed to seriously acknowledge the practical implications her argument begets."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"I did not read this book as amounting to a bashing of the Enlightenment canon at all. Rather, it struck me as an all-too-uncommon commonsensical, middle-ground position, well articulated, on controversy over multiculturalism. Reading some of these negative reviews leaves me scratching my head wondering whether these reviewers and I read the same book. I understood Nussbaum to be offering a \\"both/and\\" approach that would retain teaching of the \\"dead white men\\" Western canon but add to it the best of voices from other traditions.The practical difficulties of doing this seem obvious enough: what to leave out, then? Unless she is advocating more time spent in college curricula on humanities studies and/or more required courses than is the case in many colleges and universities for undergrads these days. I did not see arguments for either of those points of view so one question would be how to implement her suggestions even if one agrees with them? There is only so much time in a day and so much space in a curriculum. Passionate subject-matter advocates ultimately weaken their case when they don't say what should be taught less.Still, Nussbaum is asking powerful questions and contributing what I see as all-too-infrequent well-stated middle-ground fodder to inform these discussions. So even if you find her case unpersuasive this book should help you clarify your own views on this subject."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"Inasmuch as this book is an account of Nussbaum's research on the success of muticultural education at a few dozen American universities, it will be read as a challenge to the doom-saying conservatives who argue that education has gone to Hell since we abandoned the Great Books tradition of the Fifties. And it works rather well as such: as well as she can while writing for a lay audience, she confronts the likes of Alan Bloom on their own terms, demonstrating that there's a lot to be said for seeing muticultural education as an extension, rather than a betrayal, of the Western Philosophical Tradition. But what's interesting is her intolerance of hypocrisy on the Left as well as the Right: she denounces the excesses of Afrocentrism and the self-validating fantasies of academic feminism as well as any conservative editorialist. She's very much her own woman, and a public moralist in the best sense."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"I'm not enough of a scholar to evaluate Nussbaums's treatment of \\"The Clouds\\" or Rousseau (are you?) but her treatment of the major topics is thought provoking -- and thus the book is well worth reading.The only significant flaws I stumbled upon were her dismissal of the paradox of democratic change, and of the objections of ideology.The former: when is a minority (perhaps 'elite') position a legimate corrective/adjustment to a democracy, and when is it an extemist and illegitimate distraction? The astonishing fact is that the problem in distinguishing one from the other interferes greatly with Nussbaum's laudatory depictions of \\"diversity\\" education, without providing even a hint of the underlying dilemma. For instance, arguments against racial bigotry are implicity conflated, in Nussbaum's book, with arguments against homosexuality. Personally, I agree with this... but how is a *democracy* to arrive at such a conculsion? Any controversy must, inevitably, be advocated at first by a minority. When is such a minority to be granted the academic privilege (as Gender Studies have, in todays University) and when not (as the 'pro-life' or 'creationist' perspectives)? Nussbaum completely ignores the problem, treating the liberal perspective as the only rational one.This is related to the latter problematique: sometime a \\"received\\" doctrine [...] discerns a threat in the argument for \\"diversity\\". To a liberal, this perspective seems absurd. But where is the line to be drawn? If an alien culture (or domestic minority) were to advocate something extreme -- perhaps human sacrifice or infant euthanasia? How are 'believers' to discern which moral positions are too extreme to be defenced (bias against miscegenation; homosexual behavior) and which are defensible? (suttee? abortion?) Nussbaum provides no guidance; nor -- more importantly -- does she elaborate on how the academy is to respond to questions regarding such a delineation."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"This is a must read to those who oppose and fancy a &quot;liberal&quot; education. Nussbaum has done a remarkable job explaining how learning about other cultures and lifestyles can truly enrich a person's life. A book like this opens people's minds to new and critical ways of looking at the world and at yourself. The only way to make this world a better place to live is through education and understanding. Nussbaum's book provides valuable information on why to to question we what have learned as &quot;normal&quot; history. The history of African Americans, Native Americans, Women, Asians, and homosexuals have been suppressed for centuries by those in power. If we are to understand each other as individuals and human beings, we must learn of about one another. Nussbaum's book is one right step in that direction."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"I have had the privelige of studying and discussing Matha Nussbaum's work for the past several years at the Thomas More Institute in Montreal, a wonderful little think-tank dedicated to education and learning by the Socratic Questioning method; after learning a lifetime's worth from this one small volume, I wish that the title of my review could be the sub-title of this book. Questioning this book has answered many a question on many levels allowing colleagues and I to piece together answers to life's most important questions on education, world citizenship and what it really means to be cosmopolitan.This book has been especially important as reading and discussing it has answered any question or doubt that I might have had about the liberal arts education - experience. Through discussion this text has been brought to life and my choice of education thus makes more sense to me today than it did when the experience was begun several years ago.I wish that there could be a way for every educator, legislator, parent and student to be exposed to this book and the philosophy behind it; anyone who picks it up, regardless of background, will find it enriching if not enlightening. One cannot read this work without wanting to strive towards becoming a true citizen of the world."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"&quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot; is one of the most thoughtful examinations of the concept of a liberal education that I've read in a long time. Nussbaum tell us that Socratic questioning is still on trial, that becoming a citizen of the world is a lonely business, and that a visceral and intellectual understanding of compassion is a key requisite. This book amounts to classical thought applied to the dilemmas of postmodernism. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"Nussbaum makes several good points in her critique of the liberal education in her book Cultivating Humanity. She brings under the microscope such ideals as examing our own beliefs and how we must be world citizens in order to fully understand humanity. An overall excellent book, Nussbaum makes many good points and supports her idea well. Occasionally, we are lost in the wordiness of it. I feel that some of what she had to say could have been condensed, but it detracts nothing from the book."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"This book shows the problems associated with elitism and a person cutting themselves off from the broader world. Its reactionary in spirit and a rejection of any challenge to the status quo in higher education. The arrogance of the book is seen in its absurd title. How is it possible that an author could think that a reactionary defense of the status quo is a \\"classical defense of reform\\".The book offers, in the name of \\"rational\\" argument, that students themselves are demanding her favored forms of teaching. The idea is that her ideas are popular and in demand while alternatives are unpopular, the product of second-rate minds/schools and generally associated with decline. Its an incredibly arrogant argument made all the worse by the fact that its so irrational and subjective. Its also the typical defense of the reactionary. We control the institutions therefore the popularity of the institutions is taken as the measure of our own popularity. We control the standards therefore anyone who disagrees with us is stupid or second-rate. We are successful therefore our rivals by definition in decline on the way to extinction.The arguments in many places are contradictory. She talks in favor of diversity but \\"diversity\\" does not mean the definition of the word. A true argument for diversity would accept a place in academia for her opponents and their methods of teaching. But rather than meaning that, \\"diversity\\" becomes a fixed method and system which is exclusive rather than inclusive. Diversity ends up opposite to its meaning.And what is diversity? Its a political education whose canon is drawn from multiple countries but whose authors are rigidly aligned politically. The absurdity at its core is that diversity is to found in a demographically (race, religion, gender and so on) correct pool of authors who all think the same. The author never quite grasps this problem let alone the implications. It is simply the way things are done and those who dare to challenge it are simply inferiors.To the author, the western canon is inferior because it was written by \\"white men\\". It doesn't matter that in their era these \\"white men\\" represented an incredible diversity (even in greece) of national groups, religions and ideas. In the end, all \\"white men\\" think alike and need to be rebalanced. The fudemental wrong idea is that race or gender is an indicator of diversity in thought. And that works must be judged based on who the author was rather than the content of the work.While the author would have the purpose of education as being the production of rational thinkers, her methods are about the production of the opposite. Politics are not rational and an education based on politics cannot produce a rational thinker. What political education produces are people who are closed minded, reactionary and doctrinaire. This intellectual rot that this leads to can be seen in the arguments of the book.A movement that can only defend itself in the language of the reactionary and through its control of institutions is a movement in terminal decline. This book does the author credit in that she was willing to step to defend what she believes in. But her ultimate failure to put forward a compelling argument and her fall into reactionary thinking should have ultimately revealed the real problems in the world of higher education to her."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"The dominant impression that I have of Martha Nussbaum's CULTIVATING HUMANITY is one of a continuing sense of irony, probably unintended that begins with the title and continues with a near comical misreading of some prominent Greek and Roman philosophers like Socrates, Seneca, and Cicero. It is her thesis that multiculturalism has unfairly endured some cheap shots from conservative writers and sees in the above mentioned Greek thinkers some support for the multicultural ethic. It is easy to point out the many flaws of her book but the most striking belongs to her linking of twentieth century multiculturalism with Socrates, a thinker who was not satisfied with mere thinking. True, Socratic pedagogy involved the engaging of his listeners in abstract concepts that often infuriated the ruling Powers That Be, but the point that Nussbaum continually misses (surprising given her job as a college professor of classical literature) is that once Socrates made his point, he did not stop and go on to the next listener; rather, he exhorted that listener to do something concrete with that revealed wisdom. Behind her misreading of Socrates lie the various flubs inherent in MC in general. Nussbaum sees no discrepency in the irony of a philosophy that brags of open diversity while practicing a ruthless denial of same to its opposition. Supporters of Nussbaum complain of the jargon in the comments of the anti-multiculuralists while at the same time writing books and articles praising it using an even more dense version of prose. What emerges from CULTIVATING HUMANITY is that the humanity cultivated by the corrosively anti-Enlightenment miasma of multiculturalism is not humane at all even by the relative standards of its professors."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"No one can doubt the good intentions and noble sentiments of Nussbaum. But I have gone through this book very carefully, looking up her references (and noting the lack of references in critical places), and I have found its arguments to be on very shaky ground. Just take the example of her use of Plato. She says he was an elitist but that Socrates was a democrat. But she gives no quotes or citations to show that Socrates was a democrat. She admires him in the Republic for being open to other &quot;cultures,&quot; but that she doesn't note that the philosopher-king alone philosophizes in the city of that dialogue. (She says there's a difference between Plato and Socrates and that the Republic presents the views of Socrates--though she never explains how she can tell the difference or how she knows the Republic presents Socrates' views.) She distorts Plato by claiming he shows Socrates saying philosophy is for everyone. She misunderstands Socrates' assertion in the Apology that no one in the jury will believe him if he says the best way to live is to philosophize. (N. insists Socrates thinks philosophy is for everyone, while he plainly says no ordinary Athenian values philosophy or--even after his long life--can be convinced by him of its value.) Many such flaws in her discussion of other philosophers can be found. But even more striking is that she herself is very closed-minded she deals with her opponents. She tends to be very unfair in characterizing their positions. I think it's critical that someone who insists the world needs more openness should demonstrate openness. Nussbaum doesn't."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"I have seen the disagreements among reviewers of Nussbaum's books, and I think that those who are wary of her are better readers both of her work and of the works she discusses. She simply is not reliable in her accounts of what anyone says, ancient, modern, or anything else. On the very first page of this book she makes mistakes as she summarizes the plot of Aristophanes' &quot;Clouds.&quot; And she's a classicist? But for real laughs in &quot;Cultivating Humanity&quot; read her way over-simplified explanation of compassion in Rousseau and others. Honestly, she doesn't have a clue about what makes that such a complex passion or what Rousseau thought its purpose should be. In recent years she has embarrassed herself repeatedly on the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; page of The New Republic by angrily attacking people for things they never said. That is in keeping with what she does in this book. No, she is not even open-minded enough to fairly represent what other people say and think, never mind to learn from them. And from her we're to learn to live together in harmony with everyone as world citizens? OK."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"Perhaps the worst thought out book aimed at attacking American school systems. Not only does Nussbaum contradict herself on several occasions, but her plans for all forms of educations are not only unrealistic, but absolutely absurd. Perhaps if she hadn't tried to pad her own views with the curriculum of schools and thoughts of every ancient philosopher, her views could have been presented more clearly. An overall failure...I'm not sure how it got published..."},{"Title":"CULTIVATING HUMANITY - a Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education","review":"As an author trying to get us to open our minds to other cultures of the world, Nussbaum falls well short. She is horribly closed-minded in the fact that she force feeds her beliefs, denying other views without showing why they are wrong. Her overly documented lessons on Socrates are redundant and verbose. The whole book is the mindless drivel of an author trying to tell us how to live our lives.

First of all, it's just the sheer quality of writing. Kennedy dances into, out of and all around the mind of Jack Legs Diamond, the prohibition era gangster. He'll take you close to him, then appal you with his ruthlessness. Kennedy is essentially trying to deal with a knot of myth and cliche. Legs' story has been played over again and again in literature and film. He really was the good-time gangster with the faithful wife and show girl mistress, the quick one-liners and aggressive ambition. This may have appealed to a writer, but how then to humanize him? Kennedy succeeds mainly because of the voice(s) through which he approaches the story. Marcus, Legs' lawyer, is the perfect guide - people tell lawyers their stories and here, he has passed them on. But the narrative is never that simple, flipping from waiter's anecdotes to mistress's yearnings, and all without losing or confusing a reader. Kennedy presents an incredible portrait. It simply doesn't matter whether or not he has figured out who Jack Diamond really was, for he has imagined an incredible three dimensional replacement of his own."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"_Legs_ opens with a number of former friends and associates of the late Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond reminiscing about the nature of the legendary gangster's death. Despite the subject matter of this rambling discussion I was struck by its high content of \\"gallows humor.\\"What I liked about this novel was although William Kennedy attempted to humanize Jack Diamond to a certain extent, Kennedy did not sentimentalize or apologize for him. I had no doubt that Jack Diamond was exactly what he was: a booklegger, a thief, and a murderer. Despite numerous arrests, Jack Diamond was \\"The Teflon\\" gangster--none of the state charges against him would stick. Jack was a true media celebrity, in the same sense that the popular, but corrupt New York Mayor, Jimmy Walker, was at the time, although Jack was often unkind to reporters and photographers. Jack had loads of fans, who were mostly \\"the common man\\" who probably identified with Jack's humble beginnings. He also had many detractors, some of whom wanted to kill him. Jack also had a loving wife, Alice, and an adoring mistress, Marion \\"Kiki\\" Roberts, a dance hall girl. Jack loved them both in his own fashion. In a particularly trying time towards the end of his short life, Jack sought comfort from both women by keeping them near him, in separate rooms, on the same floor in a hotel in which he was staying at the time. His body guards were in another room. It seems that the only person Jack ever truly loved was his brother, Eddie, who died many years before of tuberculosis. Just mentioning Eddie would cause Jack's eyes to well-up with tears. But any doubts of Jack Diamond being a vicious and sadistic criminal were completely dispelled in his kidnapping, torture, and near-hanging of an old man (accompanied by his young companion) who Jack erroneously believed was a rival bootlegger. It was this event (brutally described in the book and not for the squeamish) that caused Jack to be brought to trial, which included federal charges and unwanted media attention.William Kennedy wrote _Legs_ in a light, informal style that also never let up on the intensity. I found reading the book fun, but with a constant, lingering sense of dread and doom that never left me. The fact remains that Legs Diamonds lived the last months of his life in constant fear of assasination and in spite of his greed for money, he died impoverished."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"My brother mentioned that he liked this book and I started reading his copy to kill time, not intending to finish it. I found myself simultaneously repelled by the violence and seduced by William Kennedy's wonderful knack for storytelling and beautifully simple style. Needless to say, I kept reading. Kennedy's characterizations are as fascinating as his story. Legs Diamond is a murderous hedonist whose infectious personality makes his amorality palatable, if not forgivable. The narrator is appropriately colorless in contrast, making him the ideal non-intrusive storyteller. In other words, Legs is like sour candy--it makes you wince, but it's addictive!"},{"Title":"Legs","review":"Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, a larger than life thief/bootlegger/murderer, captured the imagination of the public during Prohibition, the Roaring Twenties, and the beginning of the Great Depression. Living the high life, surrounded by beautiful women, bodyguards, and associates, Diamond, in his early thirties, moved smoothly between speakeasies and sordid backrooms, between murder scenes and rural retreats, always exuding a sense of confidence and glamour. Setting this novel primarily in Albany, New York, in 1930-1931, Kennedy recreates the mystique of Diamond, a much handsomer contemporary of Chicago gangster Al Capone, and New York beer king Dutch Schultz, as he exercises his power, fights off intrusions into \\"his\\" territory, corners the market in illegal beverages, buys off politicians and judges, and tries to avoid conviction for his crimes.Telling Diamond's story is Marcus Gorman, a lawyer who gets swept up in the excitement which surrounds Diamond and ends up as his attorney. Marcus, however, always insists that he be paid for his work, up front, and he refuses to be drawn into obviously illegal behavior. This makes him the perfect narrator-someone who admires much about Diamond but also someone whose judgment the reader can trust. Terse dialogue reminiscent of the novels of Raymond Chandler or Dashiel Hammett, fills the novel, but Marcus's musings about what motivates Diamond offer a more thoughtful approach to this shady character and his life than what one usually finds in noir novels.A man with no conscience, Diamond double-crosses and cheats his way to success, often killing his own associates, events described in gory detail. But Diamond's legend grows. Kennedy humanizes him by emphasizing the loyalty of his wife Alice and the crazy love of his girlfriend, showgirl Kiki Roberts. After his two major trials, even the jury celebrates the inevitable acquittals. Other mobsters fear him, however, and know that if they don't get him first that he will get them. Surviving three murder attempts in two years, Diamond absorbs eleven bullets, before his final gun battle.An uncomplicated but well-written novel, _Legs_ illustrates the attraction many feel to celebrity, even a sadistic celebrity such as Diamond. The author's insights into his life and motivations help to explain the roots of this attraction, and his follow-up on the lives of both Alice Diamond and Kiki Roberts brings the themes full circle. Fun to read, this is the first of the novels in the \\"Albany Cycle,\\" followed by _Billy Phelan's Greatest Game_ and the Pulitzer Prize-winning _Ironweed_. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Legs","review":"Money, crime, sex, and murder are the key elements to becoming a big time gang leader and Jack \\"Diamond\\" Legs has all of these qualities. Read through this epic novel of the final years of a big time 1920's prohibition gangster and how he both put fear and joy into the people's lives around him.I felt this book was an easy one to read, but was still extremely enjoyable with its elements of crime and seduction. The story is told through the eyes of his lawyer, Marcus, which is great because of the unbiased perception he has towards other people. He will take you into the life of a big time gangster and how he narrowly escapes death time and time. Marcus' view towards others allows the reader to look deeper into the personalities of characters around Jack and how their personalities and views towards Jack change over time. The reader will read about all of Jack's horrible deeds and schemes to make money and destroy competition, but will also see how people interpret those deeds and Jack. Jack's faithful wife (Alice) and his showgirl mistress (Kicki) tell us about their lives and how it has changed because of Jack. This book will take you deep into the mind of its characters so you can see what they are thinking and then pull you back out again and do this over and over again. Legs is greatly written to show you how crime affects everyone.This book is a great thriller to read in some free time. It's portrayal of the big time prohibition gangster is excellent and it will leave you in awe that some people lived their lives in such a manner during the Prohibition. This was a great summer reading book for me to read and I highly recommend picking it up and giving Jack a chance to take you inside the \\"family\\" of a gang leader and show you how things are supposed to be done."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"Legs is the first part in William Kennedy's Albany Cycle, other novels in the trilogy are Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and Ironweed.The plot:He's crude, blunt, violent, and a severe sociopath, but when you are talking about one of America's most infamous gangsters, those aren't necessarily bad characteristics. Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond is a quick-witted, prohibition-era mobster who makes himself a household name by being thrust into the public eye in the 1920's and 30's. Marcus Gorman, his attorney and confidant, narrates \\"Legs'\\" escapades finally culminating with Diamond's murder. Gorman the reliable narrator never seems to try to spin the truth, or miss one gory detail.My take:Kennedy writes in an easy to understand, flowing style which makes this book difficult to put down. He is very descriptive with his characters, which enables you to really explore their various psyches. Although, much of the mob life style in the book, which we have seen in countless movies and novels, may seem clich&eacute;, overall Legs is simply a very entertaining book that I would recommend for anyone looking for a causal read."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"William Kennedy did his research before writing this book. Kennedy used a factual basis for Legs, but just enough to make you wonder what is fact or fiction. His historical accuracy draws you into a fast paced fictional world full of deception, hatred, revenge, murder, love, and booze. Because of this book, the gangster Jack &quot;legs&quot; Diamond will live on as a legend. Read it at least three times."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"\\"Legs\\" was the public's nickname for Jack Diamond, an Irish-American bootlegger and gangster of the Twenties who operated in and around New York City and the Catskills. Today he is not as well-known as some of his contemporaries such as Dutch Schultz (who was at different times his associate and his mortal enemy), but when alive and operating Diamond captured the public imagination with his flamboyant lifestyle and his survival of numerous gunfights and gangland assassination attempts. The year 1931 saw his career come to an end, first as law enforcement -- spurred in part by a New York governor (FDR) interested in burnishing his image for the national political scene -- began to hound him and curtail his operations, and then when one of his numerous enemies finally succeeded in dispatching him with three bullets to the head in the early morning hours in the bedroom of a rooming house in Albany.LEGS, the novel, is a fictionalized account of Diamond's criminal career, as narrated by Marcus Gorman, an Albany lawyer who sacrificed his opportunities for a career in politics in order to become the personal lawyer of Jack Diamond and thereby witness first-hand his charisma, crazed courage, and crass criminality. LEGS is also the first installment of Kennedy's Albany cycle of novels - which, depending on how one counts, numbers either three or eight.In LEGS, Albany takes a back seat to the world of the gangster. It is a cruel and violent world, but it also is mesmerizing. If we can overcome the blood and gore - something that many readers cannot, though in truth Kennedy in LEGS is much less violent than Cormac McCarthy is in most of his novels -- we are intrigued, even transfixed, by the cynical and fearless outsider with his own code of loyalty and responsibility. (It is the same sort of fascination that underlies Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather\\" and its film version.)There is an anomalous integrity to the life of Jack Diamond, to which the narrator Marcus Gorman refers in explaining why he abandoned a career in politics in order to hitch his wagon to Jack. \\"When I think back now to whether [Congress or Jack] would have given me more insight into American life, I always lean to Jack. In the Congress I would have learned how rudimentary hypocrisy is turned into patriotism, into national policy, and into the law, and how hypocrites become heroes of the people. What I learned from Jack was that politicians imitated his style without comprehending it, without understanding that their venality was only hypocritical. Jack failed thoroughly as a hypocrite. He was a liar, of course, a perjurer, all of that, but he was also a venal man of integrity, for he never ceased to renew his vulnerability to punishment, death, and damnation.\\"Marcus Gorman/William Kennedy returns to this notion of hypocrisy and integrity when he compares Jack to Richard Nixon (the novel was published the year after Nixon resigned). He writes that Jack \\"was unquestionably an ancestral paradigm for modern urban political gangsters\\", such as Richard Nixon, \\"who left significant history in his wake, but no legend; whose corruption, overwhelmingly venal and invariably hypocritical, lacked the admirably white core fantasy that can give evil a mythical dimension.\\"In the early pages of LEGS, I was mildly repulsed by it. (Several early scenes of raw, gratuitous sex reminded me of adolescent boys bragging of their imaginary sexual conquests.) As the novel progressed, the story got better and better; memorable vignettes were stacked atop one another with increasing frequency. Finally, I was overcome by fascination for Jack Diamond and the skewed tragedy that was unfolding. I then began to wonder whether that fascination was a symptom of moral deficiency. (It is akin to a feeling engendered in me by Patricia Highsmith's Ripley novels.) What it may signify, I suppose, is that William Kennedy had tapped into an utterly amoral, perhaps even evil, part of my subconscious. It also signifies that LEGS is more than just a gangster story; it is a subtle and sophisticated -- and literate -- exploration of the human psyche."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"It fairly sings. What's not to love about Legs? He's selfish, he's beautiful, he has style to burn, he's amoral, he's a one-off, and he dies in the end. Break my heart, why don't you."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"According to Wikipedia, Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond was the \\"biggest celebrity in Upstate New York\\" in the Prohibition era. In LEGS, William Kennedy, to a degree, is interested in the ramifications of that celebrity--namely... \\"He was a bootlegger and, as such, had celebrity status, plus permission from the social order to kill, maim, and befoul the legal system, for wasn't he performing a social mission for the masses?\\"But primarily, Kennedy wants to show how people in Jack's inner circle lived bigger or deeper lives through this celebrity. These include his wife Alice, who finds prominence but tenuous respectability as a gangster's spouse; his mistress Kiki, who finds Jack's mix of money and danger a turn-on; and Jack's lawyer Marcus Gorman, who ultimately perceives that Jack is a shrewd manipulator of his public image, since this allows him to sustain his business empire.Marcus is the narrator of LEGS. At one point, he connects Jack Diamond to F. Scott Fitzgerald and even refers to THE GREAT GATSBY. This is certainly a comment on Kennedy's authorial intentions, since both LEGS and GATSBY are narrated by men, subtly obsessed, who are trying to look behind images of wealth and glamour.With Gatsby, this pursuit comes with moments of great lyricism, as well as the insight that true power lies not with new wealth, which can be nave, but with the establishment. With LEGS, the reader gets something different. Instead of lyricism, there is the high-low voice of Marcus. \\"I can now recall the quality of the light at that moment when I went to work for Jack. The sun was dappling his shoulders as he peered into the shadows of the empty stable with its random bird droppings.\\" (Quote adjusted for this family forum.) Meanwhile, Kennedy's profound insight might be that image, like fire, ultimately consumes its source. But today, when skillful PR makes ignoble and sordid politicians and business people seem glamorous, does this insight hold true?There are some excellent chapters in LEGS. These include \\"Jack-in-the-Box\\", which shows Jack's big life starting to shrink; and \\"John Thomson's Man\\", where Kennedy explores Alice's and Kiki's fascination with Jack, as well as shows Jack in a fit of crazy and utilitarian violence. Because of such chapters, I will, in the fullness of time, read BILLY PHELAN'S GREATEST GAME, the next book in Kennedy's Albany trilogy. But I gotta admit--I found parts of LEGS to be a slog.Rounded up to four stars."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"I find it somewhat ironic that this \\"fictionalized\\" portrait of Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond is far superior to many of the factual biographies of this celebrated mobster which have been published to date. Told in the words of the imaginary Marcus Gorman, an attorney who is seduced by the charismatic gangster and swept into his orbit, \\"Legs\\" is probably as close to the truth as we can get. Kennedy's use of dialogue is, in a word, brilliant. I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did, but I found it to be a great read."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"What struck me while I read this book is how similiar the stories of the gangsters of the 1920's and 1930's are. No matter what their chosen field, extortion, liquor running, theivery, murder, whichever one or all, the stories are similiar. Enter Legs, one interesting factor about Legs in this book is his energy. He could light up a room. It sounds like he had real charisma and charm if he turned it on, and perhaps that's what a lot of the prohibition era gangsters had, energy. This book debates the moral idea of gangsters. If people didn't idolize the wealthy, perhaps the gangsters wouldn't have had the glamour and glory they achieved through history and in their own lives. Nonetheless, the gangsters were often times treated like heroes and Legs is no different but there was always a division, those who idolized gangsters and those who wanted them all dead as the scouge to society they were. The book states 1,000 people went to Leg's funeral and that is a lot of fans bidding farewell to their idol.This book was interesting. It gave lots to ponder with the author's ability to swirl and dance about the myth, legend, and life of Legs Diamond. If you are interested at all in prohibition era gangsters then this book is definately worth a read. It's about a crazy life during a crazy time. It's about the rise and fall of a hoodlum that didn't at all seem like a ruthless killer but was one. There is a lot in this book about his wife and mistress and how Leg's couldn't seem to give up either one and how each woman was devoted to him. He must have been quite the man for those two to scratch and claw each other and stay on his sweet side, it's really quite amazing.This book is also a testament to the laws of prohibition and how gangsters if they were tough enough and smart enough could rise through the rankings to become their own man and run their own gambits as they saw fit. It also shows how once at the top it was a pretty long fall to the bottom. I didn't know who Leg's Diamond was but saw somewhere that this book was Benito Del Toro's favorite book so I thought I'd give it a read. I enjoy gangster stories and I love the old James Cagney gangster movies, so this book appealed to me. I wasn't disapointed and \\"Legs\\" paints an interesting picture of the intimate inside life of a gangster.I wanted to note that I noticed that other people thought the book had too much sex or was too violent, but wouldn't it be a lot to expect that a book about the life of a gangster to contain no sex or violence? The gangsters of the prohibition era and later lived on the fringe of society, they were violent and women loved them for whatever reason, money perhaps, but yes, the life and times of Leg's Diamond with his mistress, wife and booze running ways has a bit of sex and a peck of violence. I wouldn't expect it any other way."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"I had never heard of Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond. I guess growing up in Chicago, we had a surplus of local 1920s Gangsters. And, embarrassingly, I did not realize Legs was an actual person until after starting the book. But, really, it didn't matter. The story is great -- fact or fiction. Like a lot of gangsters, Legs has his streaks of sadism and generosity that flip at schizopathic regularity. And I found myself torn alongside of our narrator, Legs' lawyer, who also finds Jack both appealing and appalling. A great piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"The story is fairly predictable, and the characters appear, on the surface, likewise. However, Kennedy's ability to relate the reflective moments of each charcater is fantastic. Contrition comes tough to Jack Diamond, and in the end all he is left with is his own legend to uphold and portray. To imagine Jack Diamond, picture that one friend who was only able to minipulate you after all others, allowing you to bear witness to all his ministrations of others, and leaving you to believe him all the more when your turn arrives."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"I really did want to hate this book.William Kennedy, in the first of a series of books set in Albany, tells the story of John/Jack/Legs/whatever-you-want-to-call-him Diamond, a man who made lots of money and was very rarely successfully prosecuted because he had friends in high places during Prohibition.The reason I wanted to hate this book: I don't like violence, and there is a significant amount of violence - shooting, punching, killing animals, and some light torture.The reason I couldn't hate it: The book was written pretty well. It was easy to read. It was interesting. The dialogue felt realistic, not how some stilted first-novel gangsters would talk.I wouldn't read this again, but if Kennedy wrote something with a little less violence, I'd probably give it a chance."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"I had read favorable comments about William Kennedy's Albany cycle of novels, so I decided to read this one. As the first book in the series, it seemed to be the logical place to start. Having finished \\"Legs,\\" all I can say is that it will be a very long time before I read another novel by William Kennedy. Perhaps the books get better as the cycle goes on. I can't say. This one certainly did not whet my appetite to find out.The novel follows the career of a psychotic gangster named Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond. This thug fascinates the novel's narrator, Jack's lawyer. All the other characters in the book are equally intrigued by Jack and so, we are told, is the entire American public. (\\"[B]ut heroes and poets followed Jack's tribulations with curiosity, ambivalent benevolence, and a sense of mystery at the meaning of their own response,\\" writes Kennedy.) There was no mystery in my response to this character. Sociopaths just don't fascinate me. Sorry.I don't understand the attraction that so many writers and filmmakers seem to feel for comic-book gangsters. I suppose we are to take these works seriously because they claim to portray evil in society. They purport to develop themes of moral ambiguity and pose ethical dilemmas. To search out the wellsprings and permutations of evil in the world is certainly a valid literary goal. With all the evils that flared up throughout the last century - fascism, communism, environmental degradation, and racial and ethnic bigotry, there has certainly been a lot to write about. If writers want to plumb these deep themes, that's great. But why resort to these cartoonish sketches of American gangsters to develop the themes?The writing style in this book reminded me of the \\"Guy Noir\\" sketches from the Prairie Home Companion radio show. It's hard to say which one achieves a higher level of realism. At least Garrison Keillor is funny when he does his sketches. You can't say that much for the cliche-ridden drivel that fills page after page of this miserable novel."},{"Title":"Legs","review":"In the first 55 pages, multiple people and animals are brutally and graphically killed.

It does a good job of pointing out where it is essential not to forget this, particularly telling the photographer, ushers, and director/coordinator(assuming you opt for one of those). It also gives examples of good etiquette about invitation wording, alternative seating arrangements and ceremony procession order.My main criticism about this book is that it limits discussion to semi-formal to formal events, with a particular sense that adult children are still dependent upon their parents for much of the wedding planning and financing (e.g. parents splitting traditional bills, or parents inviting their friends). I've been to very few weddings lately (the couple is usually over the age of 28 or 29) where parents' friends/coworkers were in attendance and parents financed everything -- or anything, for that matter. While that may be useful to some interested in this topic, I found the recommendations limiting, and common-sense extrapolations from those in any non-divorce wedding guide or bridal magazine.I would imagine many children of divorced parents who do not get along well opt for a more informal, less-structured event in order to circumvent the more obvious financial and communication issues (I know I am, and my brother certainly did). The way to deal with not hurting parents' and stepparents' feelings, while still having YOUR wedding is missing here. It also pushes the idea of a wedding director to handle these situations, which is out of the purview of any informal wedding.For example, advice on the appropriate way to accept and use offers of small financial support from each parent/stepparent without potentially offending the other parent (or the stepparent that contributed but will not play a role in the ceremony) would be helpful, in my opinion. Ways of broaching the involvement expectations of all parents and stepparents without committing oneself, or perhaps how to deal with little traditions that are specific to a parent (e.g. roses to the mothers -- should the long-time stepmother get one too, potentially upsetting the &quot;real&quot; mother that raised you?) would be something appropriate for a book like this which is not discussed anywhere else.If these sort of deeper issues don't apply to your wedding, this book will probably serve you well. If you have the &quot;other&quot; type of situation, then this book offers you nothing new."},{"Title":"Hirschfeld's New York","review":"When my son was seven, he used to eagerly check the arts and leisure section of the Sunday New York Times each weekend to see if there was a new drawing by the \\"Nina Man\\".

Not only has Walsh traveled this path before, but he's enlisted the advice of a number of other successful micro-ISVs in the way of stories and interviews. The overall result is that you get an extremely realistic view of what you will encounter if you choose this path. He deals with everything from the motivation behind the decision to launch your own business, to best practices in setting up your development environment to lay the groundwork for future growth (and less headaches), to how coexist with the 800-pound gorilla in the room known as Microsoft. Even if you're not thinking of going independent, there are a number of websites he covers that are nearly worth the price of the book. For instance, there are sites where you can get stock photography to use to create nice websites (without paying a bundle in royalties). There are sites that cover the competitive landscape of your customers and competitors, which is just good business practice to follow regardless of who's writing your paycheck. He even talks about how you can set up automated feeds to scan for mentions of your site/company/product in news and blogs. Again, an excellent practice to follow for more than just small development companies.This is one of those books that goes on a short \\"homework\\" pile for me.

And if I were ever to contemplate striking out on my own, my first task would be to re-read this book and start taking serious notes. It's money well spent to swing the odds in your favor. A recommended read..."},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"This book is a great kick in the pants for all those who have dreamed of making millions by building software. I read it from cover to cover within days and have started reading it again and taking some serious notes. Before venturing into ISV-land, Walsh was a journalist so the book is very easy to read.The book contains numerous interviews with people who have started their own ISVs which is this books strength and its weakness. It's great to hear from people who have been there and done it. And it is great to compare there stories and views. But by the end of the book you get the feeling that some were included merely to add a few more pages. Also, I wish these interviews weren't on a grey background - it makes them a little hard to read in low light.Non-US customers should note the book does contain information on starting up outside the US but it is a little thin."},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"I highly recommend this book for any one who is either contemplating or already embarked on the Micro-ISV journey. This is a very readable, inspirational and practical book. The chapters are well structured and define clear stages of the uISV process. I discovered many items of priceless information that I would have never known about if it were not for this book. In addition to all the information contained within the text there are many useful links to external resources relating to the material. The final chapter contains interviews with many uISVs at various stages of growth. This really helps to emphasise many of the key messages and themes discussed earlier in the book.Since first reading the book I have already found myself returning to it again and again for reference. Congratulations to Bob Walsh for producing such an excellent book.Samuel Warwickwww.odin.co.uk"},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"I only read half the book. Then why still rate it four stars?Having my own ISV for over six years now I have arrived at the point of having 10 people in my staff and having experienced most things any startup will bump upon. Sometimes that makes you think you've seen it all by now, but this is an illusion.No matter how many staff you have working for you, there will always be a Micro ISV within the company... you! Exept for any partners, no one will do your job of creating the company or product vision and has the same kind of commitment. Some would say that's sad to hear, but I think this is reality. You hire most people to complement you on your own skills, so most of the time don't expect the vision to come from them.Going through this book I sometimes skipped some of the pages. Some things I knew just to well to read about again, some applied on starting your own business and some parts applied to US / UK law only. Still, I managed to gain a lot of knowledge, ideas and feedback from this book.Thinking of starting your own ISV business? Then get this book first! Already a business owner with some experience under the belt? The pick your paragraphs and read what you have to. Great book, especially for ISV startups!"},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"I read this book after about ten years of running my own ISV, and while there weren't any huge surprises, it still had a number of helpful items in it.I like the fact that Bob goes into a number of useful tools (both software and otherwise), and that the book has lots of screenshots and graphics. The sidebars include lots of interviews, and while many of the people interviewed are obviously pushing their own products, it's always nice to be able to read many different perspectives in a single book.It's a good overview of running a small software company - I recommend it."},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"I am co-owner in a small software company and I found this book to be invaluable. It has nuts-and-bolts information that you just can't find anywhere else. I'm just upset that the author didn't write the book 2 years ago when we were starting out.

One thing I didn't like too much was that while he covers starting up a business in the US, UK and Australia, he missed Canada! I know that some of our systems are very similar to the US and UK both, but not exactly the same. This isn't a major drawback, as there are plenty of other books out there that can guide someone in this. In fact, were it up to me I'd suggest that he kill that section entirely, as it doesn't really add to the book in any way, (in fact it might detract from it, as he could have used the space to go into greater detail elsewhere, such as the chapter on development in a micro-isv.) One thing I did like however was his writing style. He writes in a very engaging manner; at times, it felt as though we were sitting down in a quite coffee shop discussing this stuff in person. I look forward to further titles on this topic from the author!"},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"A micro-ISV is a one-person company which develops softwarewhich is sold mainly over the internet.This book is targeted at software developers who know how towrite software and now would like to know how to start a businesson this skill.If you are a programmer and would like to start your own businessbased on a software product, you need to change your mind-set.Now you need to think about your customers.

You can learn a lot from these existing ISVs."},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"Many \\"how-to\\" business books pretend they are going to show you how to take your business from nothing to hundreds of millions in sales overnight.\\"Micro-ISV\\" is refreshingly different.First, it is written specifically for those who want to bring personal computer software to the market through their own small, independent company. Second, it is about small companies. There is little here for the person who believes they are going to become a software billionaire. Rather, this is for the person with a good idea who wants to launch a software development and publishing enterprise that will remain small, except in the most exceptional circumstances.There are, in fact, thousands of small software publishers throughout the world who earn respectable incomes from their efforts. Some are truly small and the earnings of their publishing enterprise supplement the income from their day job. Others make quite significant sums from their products.Third, Bob Walsh does not peddle dreams or impossible schemes. He lays out a practical program for every step of creating your own \\"Micro-ISV\\" from having a vision, as he puts it, through developing and marketing your product. He even covers forms of business organization, which would be helpful for the complete neophyte.Walsh's orientation is toward Microsoft and the Universe it has created, which is about 90% of all the computers in the world. He offers a lot of extremely useful information about Microsoft and how even the smallest developer can benefit from their many support and assistance programs. Speaking from personal experience, Microsoft's support for developers is truly outstanding and Walsh presents the most detailed exposition of their developer support programs I've ever seen. (Note that some of Microsoft's programs have changed since \\"Micro-ISV\\" was published.)There are many sidebars featuring interviews with successful small developers or short case studies. Some of the interviews are fascinating such as those with David Allen, the author of \\"Getting Things Done\\", an approach to time management that has attracted an almost cult-like following (and that is a compliment) and Joel Spoelsky, founder of Fog Creek software, who is something of a legend in his own time.Overall, this is a remarkable how-to business book for anyone who believes they have an idea for a marketable software product.Jerry"},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"This book has a lot of good information on starting your own Micro-ISV. It does focus a lot on PC based software instead of Corporate Enterprise Software, but to be fair it's harder to build and sell Enterprise Level software with a few people.There are lots of good interviews with people that have succeeded in starting their own company and as expected it's not an easy route, but most seemed to be enjoying what they do."},{"Title":"Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality","review":"This excellent book deserves to become the definitive manual of the mechanics of software development for small (\`micro') Independent Software Vendors. Not only for the in-depth content (some of which will quickly become obsolete given the speed of technical progress), but perhaps more importantly the description and outline of an approach to the business. Each of the seven chapters have right-now, to-the-point tips and tricks, along with the reasons for them, as well as an outstanding index and rich external references. This covers all the bases, and a few other things as well, and although well written by a seasoned and successful master, it has all the depth necessary to become a well-used reference manual.

I've been a corporate developer for about ten years and have always dreamt of starting my own software company (even done a little consulting on the side). I just found out a month ago that my company is being purchased, and that I soon will be out of the job.Before I'd ever heard of this book, I started drawing up plans for my first product, reserved a domain name and started the design process. Then one day I heard about this book in an email/newsletter from Joel (on Software) Spolsky. He was touting this great book from an acquaintance detailing all the specifics about what it takes to start your own software company. Couldn't have been more perfect timing.I devoured the book in less than a week, and now my \\"new\\" book is all dog-eared from being carried everywhere. It's full of highlights and notes in the margins. This book shows you in great detail, the exact things someone in my situation needs to consider when starting their own software company (or Micro-ISV). From developing your idea (or vision) all the way to providing customer support for your finished product.The book is full of real-world examples encountered either by the author or one of the dozens of other software entrepeneurs interviewed throughout the book. It'll make you think of things you might not have considered otherwise (like how to market your product or design your product's web site), and sets your expectations realisitically (e.g. don't expect to make revenue right away; it takes a lot of work, maybe even up to a year, before you can expect to see your first dollar).After having read this book, I have a detailed roadmap of what it is I will need to do to start my own Micro-ISV, and am much better prepared for the troubles I might encounter.I can't recommend this book highly enough.

In the case of solo freelos like many of the ISVs are, the personal an professional boundaries are often blurred.

When thinking about doing software on the side or as a fulltime ISV - you'd like to have serious discussions with people who have done it successfully. This book is a great resource for what the issues are when being a Micro-ISV. But don't think it's only Micro-ISV information. It's just plain information on knowing what many of your software development \\"options\\" are.

Some comments from a student's point of view: the book is well organized, with relevant examples (including orchestral scores) and informative introductions to each of the five sections as well as to each musical example; the examples are easy to read and to mark up; it is spiral bound and, while easy to page through, is loose and rather heavy, making it a bit cumbersome to carry to class; my biggest complaint is about its exorbitant price-I don't know why these no-frills music books have to be so costly. But if you are looking for a good anthology and are willing to pay, Burkhart's is a terrific choice. Extra benefits include: two appendices, one with Jazz harmony and one with chorale harmonizations; translations of foreign terms; and two good indexes, one general and one of chords, sequences, and modulations."},{"Title":"Anthology for Musical Analysis","review":"Of course, every piece of music can be analyzed and discussed. The problem for the teacher is to find pieces that will yield useful principles for students to learn through their early studies in form, harmony, and voice leading. Ideally, the pieces will be representative of the music of their period and of the principles under discussion. It really does the student no good to study a piece that is unique in the way it handles the principle being studied. On the other hand, the student must be able to discover the form, or harmonic example, or voice leading with the skills they are developing. So, the selection cannot be too sophisticated for its audience nor should the piece yield its treasure too easily. The student should have to work a bit in order to develop their analytic abilities.This collection of pieces for study has been around for quite awhile with some alterations in its various editions. This is the sixth edition and remains a great collection. The pieces are from all periods from ancient to modern, there are pieces in all genres and ensemble types. Certainly, any teacher will likely supplement what is provided here with their own preferred pieces to illustrate certain points, but there is so much valuable stuff here that it will likely provide source material for several classes over a the years of undergraduate study. Burkhart also provides helpful notes and insightful questions at the head of pieces to help the student in thinking about that piece.While I want to complement the publisher on the clarity of printing, and the vast majority of it is very good, I do wish that the few places where the bars for the sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth notes run together that they were more careful to make them clear as well. Yes, this is not a performing edition and it is still clear what the music is, it is still disconcerting for musicians to try to read such blurry music. Can you imagine an anthology of, say, American poetry, being acceptable if the text were smeared just because it was kind of legible? But this is a smallish (but serious) point.This anthology would be perfectly useable for someone studying form, harmony, and voice leading on their own, as well.Fine anthology that has earned its place in the curriculum."},{"Title":"Anthology for Musical Analysis","review":"This text is packed with scores varying in length, form, style, & complexity. Everything is clearly displayed in the scores & the notes for each piece are incredibly helpful. This book is an easy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Anthology for Musical Analysis","review":"this book is very helpful. it is for my form and analysis class in college. i don't necessarily like the book but it is good for class."},{"Title":"Anthology for Musical Analysis","review":"This analysis provides extensive excerpts, which is good for preparing theory analysis class, however, if the analysis would be provided by the composer, or have the pieces grouped according to their nature / harmonic structure, then the book would be even more beneficial and convenient to many amateurs as well."},{"Title":"Anthology for Musical Analysis","review":"The examples and pieces selected are wonderful and cover a vast cross-section of music and I was very excited to see that there are several full orchestral scores included. It is well-organized and neat and overall is clear and concise. However, I was very disappointed that there is really no actual analysis or even much prompting of the music in the book itself. You are expected to do all of the analysis yourself, which is a good exersize, but I was hoping for more professional and technical insight. It is basically just a book with a lot of sheet music. The footnotes for each piece are helpful in that they provide other resources that provide full analysis, but for the price, I was expecting this book to do just that! It is also spiral bound, so again, I don't understand the price."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Chris Well has given us another fast paced, intriguing book that keeps us guessing until the end. Evelyn is not someone I ever want to meet in person !As with *Soloman Long*, Chris' books appear to be reality based but the way he gets inside his characters' heads is amazing. Be it a good guy or a bad guy he *thinks* like that person. I believe he has what it takes to become one our most successful crime fiction writers.Can't wait for the next book to come out ! Would be nice if it has some *Nashville connection* ! Thanks, Chris, keep those books rolling off the press!"},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Deliver Us From Evelyn is one engrossing book. I carried it with me everywhere until I finished it. Yep, even to the bathroom. I know, TMI. The author is a genius when it comes to slick street thug characterizations and multiple points of view. Normally stories with many points of view are hard to follow, but this was so well done that I got lost in the story. I felt like I knew the criminals pretty well. He had me in their heads and thinking their thoughts. Sometimes there was no dialogue for an entire scene, but it was barely noticeable. In fact, the action was so intense that in some ways dialogue wasn't even needed. How often can you say that about a book? The story is insane--just like the title, but in an \\"organized\\" manner. It's totally action packed, and I absolutely loved it. Considering I'm not usually a suspense reader, that is unusual for me to say. I did sort of figure out who the true bad \\"person\\" was before he/she was revealed (don't want to spoil it for you), but that didn't bug me like it sometimes does. I dunno. Maybe I'm just smart. *wink* The author certainly took me through the mazes with unheard of perfection. The plot is well thought out and the loose ends all tie together in a very satisfying conclusion. Oh, and there are like 6 epilogues. Ha! Like I said, the author is nuts, but a genious. There were some real cliff-hanger moments, and people died along the way, but that's inevitable when you have that much crime going on. Anything less would not seem realistic. Oh, and one of the scam artists had a profound spiritual journey. THAT was different, but very believable, too. Deliver Us from Evelyn, my friends, is one masterfully written story. As far as suspense goes, this one held my attention like no other. Go ahead and check it out. Snappy title, ingenious story...you decide. I think you'll agree with me. This is the first book I've read by Chris Well, but I also own Forgiving Solomon Long. Now that I can see the two are linked, I'll have to pick the other one up and devour it at some point, too."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"This was a great book. It was a follow up to Forgiving Solomon Long but even better. Deliver us from Evelyn is very well written. Wells' quirky sense of humor really brings this book to life. I loved the character of the Right Fair Reverend Missionary Bob Mullins almost every scene that involved him were hilarious. The Professional Thug Nelson Pistek was another character that had me looking forward to reading more about his journey. It again combines the mob, police, and FBI. Add to them a missing millionaire, a comic bookstore, a con-man missionary, an insider leaking information through a web blog, and you've got a complex mess of leads and loose ends that amazingly all some how come together.

The style is a wee bit different from \\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\", but every bit as fun and entertaining to read. Once I picked it up I was eager to see how it would play out.

(The whole \\"creamer thing\\" had me waiting to find out how it was going to figure into the end. LOVED IT! Two thumbs up for a unique twist!) To me that's the sign of a good writer, they keep you interested and thinking the whole way through.I especially liked the snapshots into the psyche of certain characters like Judge Gideon, Good Right Fair Reverend Damasacus, whatever his name-of-the-moment was...and the snippits of the wrath of the uber-boss-from-hell, Evelyn Blake. I wanted so much more of her and wanted to see her get her come-uppance. Haven't we all had one of those bosses? What was really driving her? I was hoping to see more into her mind and understand what made her this way.Overall, I would recommend this title.

And that was pretty much the case, BUT...a few of the spokes kind of glanced off the side of the hub. Or maybe never quite made it to the center. And those that did come to the center got there a little too abrubtly.

At the same time an anonyomous employee of Blake Media is posting tell all blogs regarding the erratic and dictatorial Evelyn and a religious con artist is cooking up a scheme to line his pockets with contributions from the faithful.The merging of these storylines is a crime reader's delight - surprising, satisfying and humourous! Chris Well's Griggs and Pasch are earthy, appealing and deserving of more criminal hijinks in the future!"},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"When I picked this up, I was expected to be once again blown away. \\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" was unforgettable for me. And while this was entertaining, with some great redeeming qualities, it was too easy for me to put down. I loved the blogs, and the mind games were great, but I think I got distracted one too many times in this. And when I get distracted, it doesn't mean that I didn't like what I read, rather it gets on my nerves. Next thing I know, and I'm thinking, \\"Oh crap! C'mon!\\" The story is worth telling though.So who is Evelyn Blake? Read this and you'll find out soon enough. What's with all the blogs, corporate secrets are being given away! By the way, it didn't take me long to figure out who the secret blogger was. It is possible that it was intended to be obvious. Other things in this are not so obvious. You get to hang out with Charlie and Griggs, as they try and get to the bottom of this crazy mess! By the way, is non-dairy creamer really flammable? What's up with the traveling missionary? He's all screwed up! This is all screwed up, with all the twists and turns, and THEN it finally makes sense in the end. You might even hear from the Russians in this. Take a trip to the batting cages, and look for your pitch!Hey, there are some great qualities in this. Chris Well put this together with some thought, and I appreciate that. But something like this should've taken me only a few days to get through. Instead, with the distractions, I slogged through it. Unfortunately, I was just happy when the trip was over. Maybe next time. Maybe."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Chris Well has created a cast of quirky characters. My favorite was The Right Fair Reverend Missionary Bob, or is that the Right Fair Doctor Reverend Damascus Rhodes, or could it be Judge Gideon Judge. The Right Reverend has more aliases than a dog has fleas. He's a slick jerk trying to run a con, but the poor guy is also so inept you have to feel for him.Detective Charlie Pasch, the walking database with a love for comic books, is back from Forgiving Solomon Long. So is his partner Tom Griggs, and they're in the middle of a mob takeover.Eddie Drake Jr. is trying to run the Drake organization, since his father Big Ed Drake is now in prison. But Eddie's no Big Ed, and he's got his hands full, plus he owes money to Evil Duke Cumbee. You don't stiff the Duke. And then there's Evelyn Blake, or Queen Evel as her employees call her. She's been running the business since her husband went missing. Now, Charlie and Tom have a top assignment. Find Warren Blake.It's worth the price of the book just to read the names.

But as soon as they bring down one organized crime king-pin, three new ones emerge.The snooty media mogul, Evelyn Blake's, husband is missing, but she doesn't seem to care. A mysterious employee is spilling the goods on their blog and she's livid. Add to the mix a con-artist with all the luck of Wylee Coyote and you have a recipe for a whole lot of fun."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"I enjoyed Deliver Us from Evelyn -- it's a pretty snappy story, with some good plot twists. I really enjoy seeing how some of the characters from Forgiving Solomon Long are developing. Well does a good job of making Charlie Pasch and and Tom Griggs distinctive characters that engage the reader's interest. What's more, most of the secondary characters come to life, especially \\"failed thug Nelson Pistek,\\" and the religious con man with the ever-evolving set of aliases. And the end of the book gives a promise of more to come. I think I would have enjoyed one less subplot to keep track of, but that's a small criticism. I have to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crime fiction. There's a lot of truth here, but it's never preachy."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"While FORGIVING SOLOMON LONG was a fine read, and I recommend it, this follow-up goes a few steps beyond. It's smoother, I think, in structure. It's got a big funny bone around its criminally dark heart.I like Chris' style. He uses fragments well and plays around with conventional POV for good effect. His chapters are brisk and short and move things along nicely. He must have taken note of complaints about loose ends in FSL--I wasn't complaining, btw, and I was satisfied with the conclusion-- cause this baby has multiple epilogues, from the touching to the outright hilarious. I suspect the whole tv cables things is some kind of wry metaphor . . .Chekov would be proud of Well's use of a particular \\"prop\\". Comic and film fans will enjoy references to some faves, including philosophical dialoging on the subject of comics and their readership. The spiritual content is pertinent; forgiveness and repentance are key issues, as they were in FSL.While one doesn't need to read FSL to follow the plot and characters of and enjoy DELIVER US FROM EVELYN, it sure is nice to catch-up with the detectives and see things change for them in certain ways.Others have provided a synopsis of the plot, but just so you know:Billionaire Warren Blake is missing. An anonymous blogger is writing about it--and her special relationshihp to the man--and she's also dropping hints that it's foul play. Mobsters of various factions are involved, making things a bit complicated. And Blake's egocentric, volatile, flighty, power-mad whackjob of a wife is looking mighty suspicious, even as she goads the political powers to put pressure on the police force to find her husband or solve the mystery of his disappearance. So, here come the good guys of the KCPD--the emotionally troubled Griggs, the pop-culture enthusiast Pasch, etc. Add in some weird goings on at a comics book store, and an inept and cowardly wiseguy who bungles every plan he makes, and you've cooked up a pretty cool bit of crime fiction.The pace is fast, the tension is delicious, and the humor gives it that extra pizzazz that makes this a keep-me-up-til-the-wee-hours read.I suggest you just buy it, enjoy it!Mir"},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"\\"Nobody complains when a whodunit doesn't have cursing,\\" Chris Well wrote in a recent WOG (now doesn't WOG sound better than BLOG?). I think you're onto something, Chris. Everyone is surprised you have that detective finesse in your down- and- dirty crime thriller-- I mean up- and- clean, given the genre and audience. But that genre is confused. Booklist said Tarentino's Pulp Fiction comes to mind. I don't think so. I think we're reading Chris Well because we don't want to read (or watch) Tarentino. I know I don't.I don't think that's what you mean to write either, Chris. You've named some of your sources: Dashiel Hammett, Raymond Chandler, but here in your second novel, you're already leaning more toward Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie, and G.K. Chesterton. Subtle, boy, subtle. As Sayers, the second president of the Detection Club (Chesterton was the first) remarked, it's all about detection and not about the crime. Those gory guys just don't get it. You've got your work cut out for you though, pal. Look at your first influences: those hard-boiled dicks and hard-bitten gumshoes that TV loves.And arguably, your readers may not want all that fancy stuff. Writing to a deadline, to a contract, lots of books, keep 'em coming. That's the tradition of the pot-boilers. A steady stream of action heroes-- action and intrigue. But here you are, sly dog, slipping in any number of nuanced observations, with as many pop cult cameos as The Simpsons. I only see a few I know, but other readers likely see more. Just about anyone can see more influences than Tarantino.Then there's-- should I even bring this up?-- the floating narrator. Changing faces with every chapter. Or are they sub-chapters? How to keep up in this swirling montage of mixing streams? Not only various lives, but diverse visions colliding, shrapnel everywhere. The camera changing angles, fading in and out, ala Woody Allen. The writing as a pick, as Annie Dillard said, chipping away along with the detectives, each blow inching closer to discovery.Then there's the humor, not forced or tacked on, but arising naturally from the affairs of men, the vicissitudes of life, delivered, of all things, in the whimsical tone of the narrator, which is never done; it's too hard to do, yet somehow it works. Then, I'd think you've been reading Flannery O' Connor for that Gothic element. Do I see any inspiration in Missionary Bob from Hazel Motes in Wise Blood? But then there's the distinctive Chris Well humor, when the old couple giving hitchhiker Bob a lift call him Padre, and he continually piles up a fevered litany of such interchangeable church titles as Bishop Right Reverend Good Fair Damascus Rhodes.I notice that your third novel moves towards a single narrator and longer chapters. Far be it from me to suggest it, but were you to move imperceptibly, as Sayers suggested, from crime to detection, I'd keep reading. Seen a certain way, beneath the red herrings and shimmering sheets of illusion, Deliver Us From Evelyn is really a detective yarn. For all the conflux of inspirations there is a distinctive voice, and your novels wouldn't be mistaken for those of anyone else. Which is to say that while we may wonder whodunit, we would never wonder whowroteit. There are too many clues for the careful reader to follow: the stealthy pacing, the shift in voice, the unexpected flash of humor. The author is in this room. In this library: Chris Well."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"If Deliver us From Evelyn were a movie, its TV Guide blurb might read: \\"After heartless media mogul Evelyn Blake's husband disappears, a young police detective determines to unravel the mystery.\\" And while that is the essence of this novel, the description hardly does it justice. Evelyn is more than just another crime story. Yes, it's about a missing Warren Blake. Yes, it's about a police investigation. Yes, Evelyn Blake is ruthless ala the character Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada. But it's also about redemption, searching for meaning in life... and comics.Detective Charlie Pasch returns from Well's first novel Forgiving Solomon Long as the central viewpoint character, but his is hardly the only perspective. From the anonymous blogger spilling Blake Media secrets, to the con-man determined to pull off another elaborate heist, Deliver Us From Evelyn jumps all over Kansas City.But it's the bad guys who steal the show. Especially the con-man who's posing as a minister. This guy has attitude, and it makes for some interesting exchanges, because Chris Well has a way of making even the hardest criminal likable. You might even have to squelch a chuckle in a few scenes. (After all, cough cough, this is a crime novel.) Not so likable is freezer cold Evelyn Blake, who deserves her employees' agnomens of \\"Queen Evel\\" and \\"Cruella D'Evelyn\\". And we've got a few mob henchmen as well, who are perfectly happy bumping people off.Perhaps the most intriguing character is the anonymous blogger. The conversational blog entries are peppered throughout the story and make for a nice change of pace amidst the police investigation and con games. An insider at Blake Media, there's no corking this person's opinions, and suspicions, of Evelyn. Only when Blogger and Detective Pasch join forces does the truth about Warren Blake's whereabouts finally surfaces.Occasionally the ensemble cast made it challenging to know exactly who to root for, and I would've liked to have seen a little more description of what exactly Evelyn Blake looks like, but most readers probably won't even notice this amidst the zipping plot. Loaded with pop culture references, including mentions of Switchfoot and The Wizard of Oz, perhaps most central to the plot of Deliver Us From Evelyn are comic books. It's no secret Charlie Pasch can talk for hours on the subject, and comics ultimately play a part in piecing together the puzzle. But if you're not a comic fan, don't worry. The comic references don't overload the novel. They simply embellish it. I came away from the story with a new appreciation of their value.Compelling, quirky, and engaging, Deliver Us From Evelyn will be a welcome addition to your bookshelf.--Reviewed by C.J. Darlington for Infuze Magazine"},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Here's my review, which was included in the July 2006 issue of CCM Magazine (with a few extras added in that were cut from the original column due to space constraints):CCM's very own Chris Well returns with a striking sophomore effort, Deliver Us from Evelyn (Harvest House). This thriller packs all the punches, capers and obscure allusions you've come to expect from Well, a novelist and long-time Christian music industry writer and editor. In this offering, the heartless Evelyn Blake lords over the family media empire even as her reclusive billionaire husband has vanished. You know how they say art imitates life? Well, we're not saying that's completely accurate because our publisher isn't hitched to a reclusive billionaire husband. Oh, and, no, she's not really heartless. So, I guess life doesn't actually imitate art. Chris even offers the disclaimer in his dedication that the title character is in no way, shape or form based upon our very own, beloved publisher. Does that smack of a cover up?! Nah. But it's fun for us, nonetheless. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book! It's definitely great summertime fare!"},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"In Deliver Us From Evelyn we see the return of Detective Tom Riggs and Charlie Pasch. Detective Riggs doesn't play as a big a part as Charlie does in the scheme of things. Many of his fellow detectives think he is strange and a \\"little off\\" because he knows a lot about many subjects. He is dedicated and a \\"real\\" character. Charlie knows the Bible too and tries to stay true to its teachings.Warren Blake is missing. No one knows where he is or what happened to him. It's as if he disappeared off the face of the earth. His wife, Evelyn Blake, is running his multimillion-dollar media corporation. Evelyn cares about no one but herself. She has her staff changing things at the last minute and enjoys the power of seeing them miserable and their lives interrupted. She is called Queen Evel (draw your own conclusions) and for good reason.Missionary Bob, a.k.a. Rev. Damascus, really doesn't want to find himself anywhere near Kansas City. He ripped off a mob boss in St. Louis and rumor has it that individual is in KC now. He needs to make money though. Things have not been going well and he lost his last 'take' in the little town he was in.It is so easy to become involved in Chris Well's books. The characters are real and the action is fast. Several story lines are going on at the same time and they all unite toward the end of the book. The action builds as the detectives fight the mob, try to find out what happened to Warren Blake, and Rev. Damascus moves toward his destiny.Armchair Interview says: Forgiving Solomon Long was good and Deliver Us From Evelyn is even better."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Well mixes a touch of cops n' robbers lingo with wry media references and witty dialogue. Though somewhat hampered by a lack of gritty language (no expletives from this suspense novelist), Well nonetheless tells a story with enough genuine drama and plots twists to keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"Chris Well's follow-up to Forgiving Solomon Long doesn't disappoint. Seamlessly blending pop culture and crime fiction, Deliver Us from Evelyn does for comic books and blogs what FSL did for classic TV.Despite some pretty \\"out-there\\" scenes, the novel is at heart character-driven (or at least Well has found the perfect characters to inhabit his wacky plotlines). And while Evelyn Blake gets all the attention in the title and synopses (not that she'd let anyone share her limelight), there are plenty of other primary and secondary characters to love (or hate): the fortune-seeking, chocolate-popping mobster wannabe, the much-put-upon staffer(s) at Evelyn's magazine, the Evil Duke Cumbee (just the name and you're hooked), plus the feds/cops from the Organized Crime Task Force introduced in FSL.There's a Bible story woven through the plot much the same as there was in FSL, but things turn on the elements of human nature revealed in the Bible, not in \\"deus ex\\" machinations. Ultimately the bad guys are brought to justice because of their crimes, not because they aren't Christians; this hasn't been--and still isn't always--the case with books coming from Christian publishing houses. If you're looking for a preachy book, this isn't it.But if you're looking for a book that blends comedy, tragedy, action, a little romance, and whole lot of mayhem, Deliver Us from Evelyn delivers all that and more."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evelyn","review":"When media billionaire Warren Blake disappears, the poor minions at his publishing company are forced to follow every whim of his not-very-heartbroken wife, Evelyn -- otherwise known as Queen Evel. Someone at the office has started a blog speculating on the mystery of Blake's disappearance, and little dreams of the havoc her anonymous posts will cause.Now that crime boss \\"Fat Cat\\" is out of the picture, other crooks are looking for a piece of the Kansas City crime pie. The Russian mafia meets with Evil Duke Cumbee's men only to find out it's a trap. A thug from the bottom of the pile gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and soon is on the run for his life.When Evelyn Blake finally decides to make a fuss about her missing husband, members of the Kansas City Police Department, including detectives Tom Griggs and Charlie Pasch, are forced to drop everything and find him. The politically-charged case guarantees conflict between local cops and the Feds, which include Griggs' friend O'Malley.After \\"killing\\" his previous alias, the Right Fair Doctor Reverend Damascus Rhodes is ready to con someone new for a living, and the grieving rich Mrs. Blake seems the perfect target.With multiple subplots stacked up like a parfait dessert, Chris Well once again delivers a delectable novel. He places the scenes like a movie director, using a few phrases at the beginning to paint a visual picture of what's happening, letting the action play to the right moment, then cutting to the next scene. Several familiar characters from Forgiving Solomon Long are back and continue to deepen, but Deliver Us from Evelyn can be read on its own. Whether you read it for the rapid-fire plot, witty humor, or zany allusions, you're sure to enjoy this treat. -- Katie Hart, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Race & Reconciliation: Healing the Wounds, Winning the Harvest (Spirit-Filled Life Kingdom Dynamics Study Guides)","review":"&quot;God's Daughters and God's Women&quot; is an extensive study of the main stories in the Bible that involve women. The heavy hitters such as Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Ruth, Esther and Mary are covered in their own chapters, some even filling two. The chapters are the perfect length for week to week study, with questions and reflections to fill in. Background scripture and related stories are used extensively, a real plus to the teacher or facilitator. Important words are translated from original Hebrew and Greek to show differences in written meaning as opposed to the meaning we understand today. Each chapter also has a topic (faith, hospitality, purpose, etc.) which can spur furthur group discussion. An excellent study for women, even those with a lot of Bible study background. Beginners may find it frustrating looking up all background scriptures."},{"Title":"Race & Reconciliation: Healing the Wounds, Winning the Harvest (Spirit-Filled Life Kingdom Dynamics Study Guides)","review":"This book is a good resource, but Jack Hayford is in fact the executive editor of the series and not the author, a fact many seem to misunderstand.

Lots of information about the settlement and development of the town. The book does contain a detailed table of contents as well as an index. There is some information from old Exeter records such as family registers, birth, marriage and death records which is contained in the final chapter of the book."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I had the tremendous honor of being taught genetics by two brilliant scientists at the University of Missouri Kansas City, one of whom was Dr. R. Scott Hawley (the other was Dr. Saul Honigberg). Dr. Hawley's name is regnant in the world of meiotic genetics, and a significant percentage of modern biological knowledge can be found within the many pages he has authored. Not only is Dr. Hawley a brilliant scientist, he is also a gifted story-teller. He has an excellent sense of humor, and he has repeatedly proven he can make a grown man cry with his heart-tugging stories of real people affected by very real disease. He infuses his literature on science and medicine with a dose of compassion, much-needed by students of science, like myself, who spend hours trying to see disease in terms of molecules rather than human faces.I am not very familar with any other work done by Julie Richards, but if this text is representative of her fare I would say she too is quite gifted.This is an excellent book.That said, I would caution anyone who wants a very deep and detailed study of the science of genetics to look elsewhere because this book merely contains the essential molecular information for understanding the rest of the text (it is, after all, \\"a user's guide,\\" not a PhD-student's guide). Still, it is an excellent, extremely informative read, with some paradigm-shifting perspectives to offer."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read regarding the Human Genome. The author clearly has very little understanding of basic scientific principles. This book is intended for undergraduate education, but should be packaged for the local junior high school. For those of us with a science background, a duck-billed platypus is NOT a marsupial. If I could give this book ZERO stars, I would."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I found this book to be very tedious and hard to read. I got lost in its narrative. I also thought that it didn't cover all sides about ethics and the vision for the future of genetics was shortsighted and borring."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I was full of anticipation and excitement when I first wanted to learn about Human Genetics. However, this book left me feeling like I had only watched a show on the Discovery Channel. I did not feel like I had gotten a very in depth look at Human Genetics. Rather, I felt like I had just skimmed the surface. P.S. The duckbilled platypus is NOT a marsupial. It doesn't pouch its kids it lays them in eggs, for crying out loud."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"This book left me feeling empty inside. I would of loved to delve into the subject matter, but ended up feeling lost and alone. Yah, sure I can tell you that there is a gene called TDF that is important in determining male sexual development, but the book doesn't go very far into the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that I was so desperately desiring from this book. Monotreme, Monotreme, where for art thou, Monotreme?"},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"Once in a while there is a flood of books on a vogue subject. And like a river flood, you can find some golden nuggets but most of them are worthless pyrite. This book tries to buy into the new and exciting field of Human Genomics, but unfortunately it fails miserably. I didnt get excited reading this book. The effort put forth by many people to advance the field is not well presented and is lost in personal anecdotes of the author. The vision of the future is no better than one can get from a cheap B-movie. It is written like a textbook and is read as a textbook. Keep looking prospector, this book will not enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I had this text for a MCB 10 (genetics) course at UC Davis in California. I found the science part of it interesting and for the most part helpful. I think the authors really tried to keep the reader's interest, and make a subject that is not always thought of as fascinating a little more light and relevant. People may disagree about including anecdotes in a textbook, but I think the anecdotes, while they may have been out of place, made the book more readable for me. Also, I really admired the way the authors focused on the individual aspects of the disorders they mentioned. As a young woman with Turners Syndrome, I can say that it was very refreshing that for once we were not portrayed as genetic mutants, and that individual differences that occur in any disorder was pointed out. I think it's sad, looking down the reviews, that only the bad reviews were seen as helpful. I would hope that people will give this book a chance."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"Science touches the lives of more people today than ever before, and The Human Genome: A User's Guide serves as a simplified but complete compendium of human genetics to be used by scientists and nonscientists alike.

This book is definitely &quot;user friendly&quot; -- it takes an irresistibly creative, personable and often humorous approach to its subject. The passion of the authors for their subject is obvious. Many cutting-edge and often controversial topics are covered, including the fledgling genetics of various aspects of human behavior. At the same time, the authors strongly encourage scientific responsibility and serious contemplation of the ethical issues involved in such research. This is a book about genetics that really matters, and it is sure to hold students' interest. I highly recommend this text to anyone teaching human genetics at the college level. It renders even the most challenging concepts accessible to all, and thus is suitable for both bio majors and non-majors (psych, etc.) alike. Students who use this text will never look at genetics -- or humanity -- in the same way again!"},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I am a Genetics student at the University of Kansas with the intent of beginning medical school in August. I strongly feel this text has helped me to be better prepared on this topic.

I especially admire and appreciate the authors' human sides come across in the examples that are given. Too bad my other science textbooks aren't as interesting!"},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"I personally think that the first edition was unfairly reviewed-A couple of the ridiculously negative reviewers who bashed the book (without providing much explanation or insight) were probably written by former students whom the authors flunked, since the attacks appear personal. Of course, the first edition wasn't perfect, although it was pretty darn good! I recently had a chance to peek at the new, 2nd edition, and was thrilled to see so many improvements. The language is much clearer and easier to follow since the authors use a nice conversational tone and less-technical language. The color art is really impressive and ADDS to the new edition. The book is at least twice as long and packed with current, up-to-date information such as human cloning, the human genome project and genetic diseases. I definitely recommend buying this book!"},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"Sometimes the fates deal us strange genetic hands. Sometimes precious children are born who may, or may not, have the politically correct number of sex chromosomes. Sometimes the chromosome number is right but the genitalia isn't.What has so impressed me about section II, &quot;How Genes Determine Our Sex&quot;, of this book is how Dr. Hawley and Catherine Mori have taken a sensitive, taboo subject and discussed it frankly, openly and with refreshing lightness. Most authors are afraid to tackle the subject of sex chromosome variations without cloaking the work in a suffocatingly dark and depressing seriousness.I loved the &quot;get real&quot; feel to this entire book. The frequent, chatty comments between the authors are a delightful window into their individual ways of thinking.The use of &quot;real people&quot; stories always work. Being able to eavesdrop on the been-there-done-that personal experiences makes this a textbook worth keeping long after the lights are off, the door is closed and the professor has left on sabbatical!Well done."},{"Title":"The Human Genome: A User's Guide","review":"This SECOND EDITION is a major improvement on the first (which was already pretty good).

Let Connors first show that he can make millions trading before he calls his strategies \\"advanced\\". Obviously, they are just not advanced enough to make him rich --though he will be soon, if you pay him ...for this mostly charts collection of silly trading advice.

But, if you incorporate high probability trades into a method for trading small and frequently you can make money. This book will help you develop a trading methodology. All we can say is that one of the keys to trading is to take enough small trades to allow a high probability method to get you onto the trading probability tables. If you are going to try and hit home runs once in a while you will be either more skilled than all but one &quot;market wizard&quot; or very lucky."},{"Title":"Connors On Advanced Trading Strategies","review":"This is definitely Connors best book. I have most, but this one puts a lot of Connors best strategies into one book.Connors has made his money from these trading strategies.

If you're not familiar with Woodring, I suggest going to sleep immediately after viewing the contents, before they have time to take root in the febrile soil of your high pink garden.

Horace McFarland: A Thorn for Beauty","review":"J. HORACE McFARLAND A Thorn for Beautyby Ernest J. MorrisonCommonwealth of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 1995 ISBN 0-89271-063-2This fine work by Ernest J. Morrison might be a little dry for some readers, but not for those who are; &quot;one of us&quot;; passionate lovers of nature, and the whole of life.Morrison is a great writer, who has done us all a lasting service by bringing people like J. Horace McFarland to his readers. He has a concise and clear, and yet deeply sensitive way of revealing the true and subtle nature of a personality's inner character. I hope, like John F. Kennedy's &quot;Profiles in Courage,&quot; that he will continue to find and hold up to recognition, the lives and dreams of great men and quiet heroes of history who have been lost or forgotten by posterity.Morrison has shown us in this perceptive biographical sketch of the life of J. Horace McFarland, that not only was McFarland a practical idealist in his work to enrich us all with the enrichment of beauty, but he was also a visionary and an early wholistic thinker who saw, long before many men, some of the truth concerning God's will, and man's needs as reflected in the needs of nature, in what we are only now beginning to see as the bio-one-world.Mr. McFarland didn't just think of beauty, preservation and reconstitution of nature as being a nice cutesy adjunct or afterthought to the activities and relationship man has with nature. He considered it an absolute necessity to counter-balance the disastrous negative effects that man has had on the environment, and spiritually; a saving grace for the disastrous effect man has had on himself.Few could argue with this prophetic view from the past, as we begin to realize the universal wisdom and truth in living in healthful harmony with ourselves and with nature; with respect and love instead of the self abuse of exploitation. Horace would say it's time to start giving something back to mother earth, instead of just taking. There are ways to do this, by proper city planning that helps make people proud of their neighborhoods, and by constant beautification, and by protection and replacement of natural resources.He felt that if mankind is to evolve successfully, he must displace the love of money with the more adaptive love of nature and beauty.After being involved with the cross pollination and hybridization of plants, he began to see evolution as a process that God uses to change things in His on-going creation of life.He believed in &quot;equality&quot; and helped get out the vote for women, and was involved with them in the many projects related to nature and beauty, and city planning during his lifetime. He had a view towards equality of value of other life forms- What we might today call an appreciation of, and sensitivity to, bio-diversity. He thought we should all be stewards of nature, and like the emerging global unity paradigm, that we have an obligation and responsibility to nurture and protect it. And that these were democratically based concepts, activities, and relationships. Ie: Of, by, and for the people.J. Horace was, like a truly religious and spiritual man should be, a person who practiced his religion, his ideals, and his world view, like a daily prayer, each and every day of his life- like a church without walls. He wanted to be remembered as &quot;a man who loved a garden.&quot; Indeed, he, materially, nurtured and loved, and helped renew the Garden of Life on this Earth; and will continue to do so spiritually through his life as example, and with his words, and with his works. We could all use a little of the spirit of McFarland in our hearts and in our souls.McFarland was not only a great defender and protecter of nature and his beloved roses; he himself was like a &quot;Rose of the World,&quot; a &quot;lover of all good things, surmounted (and surrounded) by his love of beauty.&quot; His life was made up of tentacles of successes that reached far into many diverse areas of endeavor, each supporting and giving sustenance to the main body of his beautiful and high ideals. J. Horace McFarland, indeed a thorn for beauty... and a giant Oak of a man.Curtis Bard, Editor - Bard Books on CD-ROM and The Computer Classifieds:"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens 50 Ways to Cook Fast","review":"This book is not diverse enough to make it worth your while."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"William Paden presents, in Interpreting the Sacred, an enlightening overview of the ways in which scholarly disciplines have made sense of religious belief and practice. After elaborating in the initial chapters the notion of perspective as a way of creating and ordering experience, the author focuses particularly on the perspectives offered by sociology, psychology, theology, and the religions themselves. Paden's &quot;meta-cognitive&quot; approach thus succinctly traces the genesis of particular scholarly traditions and exemplifies the manner in which cognitive hierarchies and valuations can produce their subject matter while also explicating it. Written as it is in a lucid, non-jargonic style, I would recommend requiring this book for undergraduate introductions to religious studies, and I believe that more advanced scholars could benefit from the book's postmodern but pragmatic approach to the study of religion."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"This introduction to the study of religion (and to thinking about what the very term &quot;religion&quot; itself can mean as a tool for thought) is a superbly written and organized little book, a model of summary without loss of richness. I am especially impressed with his chapters on the social/anthropological frame of interpretation (Durkheim, et al.) and his chapter on the psychological frame of interpretation (Jung,et al.). The bibliography is a treasure trove of key works for preparatory and advanced study. Prof. Paden gives a lucid account of interpretative frames imposed on the phenomena of religion from the &quot;outside&quot; (etic frames) as well as those emerging from within religion itself (emic frames). His aim is neither to debunk nor to syncretize in any facile way but rather to achieve an overall and systemic understanding. This compact volume will no doubt be difficult for even a passionately interested undergraduate to work through, demanding from him serious note-taking, thinking, and discussion, but the intellectual &quot;pay-off&quot; down the road will be worth it. The book is the perfect platform from which to jump into further study."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"I'm sorry to give such a negative review, but I cannot emphasize strongly enough that this is a terrible book for a student, especially a beginning one.You are probably looking for an introduction to the academic study of religion, and you are looking in the wrong place.First of all the writing is atrocious: it's so bad, I think the author worked hard to make it this bad. He makes extremely controversial statements flippantly, as though his authority would overwhelm the reader, rendering explanation superfluous; but in other places he argues tirelessly and pedantically for points no one would disagree with, just as though he were at work on a project of staggering profundity.The book begins with a controversial philosophy of science, stated as if it were a straightforward fact; then a controversial philosophy of language, with the same nonchalance. As if all students will immediately agree that scientific interpretations of the world are a priori on equal footing with every other interpretation! As if philosophers or linguists, not to mention the rest of us, all agree that, \\"Language names what the world is, and the world complies\\" (7). You might expect some explanation at least, if not an argument for these somewhat startling, counter-intuitive claims. But you won't find any.In the second chapter, he introduces rationalism. Hume gets a paragraph; in another (7 sentences) he covers Darwin, Tylor and Frazer. Feuerbach gets a paragraph, Marx three, and Freud gets two whole pages. That wouldn't be so bad if he introduced their thoughts. The sentence on Tylor says nothing about survivals; in the two pages on Freud, nothing about \\"Moses and Monotheism.\\"He goes on to \\"cover\\" basic approaches to the study of religion. Chapter 3 is sociology. The sociology chapter deals with Durkheim, managing not to mention \\"the sacred\\" or \\"the profane.\\" I actually will not complain about the way he dealt with Weber's thought, though.Chapter 4 covers Jungian psychology, evidently as if that were the whole of the psychology of religion after Freud. Don't imagine that other folks following Jung are introduced or even mentioned.Chapter 5 deals with comparative religion, which means (to Paden) Eliade--although he covers this subject without mentioning the central elements of Eliade's thought: sacred space and sacred time.Chapter 6 is about \\"Religious interpretations of Religion.\\" This basically means a few glances at some Christian thought, a glance or two at some Jewish thought, and a couple at some Buddhist thought.The last two chapters introduce (without naming it) elementary post-modern thought on plurality. Of course it goes without saying that the rest of the book was merely a long and, unfortunately for Paden, necessary preface to these two chapters, in which he reveals that what you see when you look at religion depends on the lense you use.So use multiple lenses, he urges, and accept the diversity of interpretations.Read that last sentence several times, and then you can skip this book without missing anything.So if you are looking for an introduction to the study of religion, this book is, in one word, useless. Nothing is covered adequately, not even the most basic issues in the study of religion. Magic and shamanism are mentioned once. Functionalism? Structuralism? Taboo? Initiation? Witchcraft? Nope, not even a mention in passing.Instead, I recommend Daniel Pals' \\"Seven Theories of Religion,\\" by far the best book I've read on basic academic study of religion. Then you'll be ready for books by Wiebe, McCutcheon, Asad, Masuzawa and similar heavy-hitters in contemporary religious studies, not to mention classics by Durkheim, Eliade, Evans-Pritchard, Mary Douglas and so on."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"I'll begin with what this book is NOT. It does not present a survey of the religions of the world, nor it does it describe a historical sequence of academic theories of religion. Personally, I feel those kinds of books have their uses, even if one is suspicious of the simplistic categories and linear models they typically contain.What Prof. Paden does is, to my mind, much more impressive. He seeks not to describe past theories, but to illustrate the variety of perspectives that informed these theories in the first place -- perspectives that are still very much with us. Most importantly, he emphasizes that perspectives are not mutually exclusive. In a world that seems to assume that religion contradicts science, and that Christians are fundamentally different from Muslims, this is an important point. I can sympathize with those who feel they would get more out of this book if they already knew a bit of theory and a little 'comparative religion.' But even on the first day of class students are already 'interpreting the sacred' -- this is an excellent compliment to more traditional survey courses, encouraging critical thought from day one.But the audience for this book shouldn't be limited to students. Anyone -- including both the devout and the atheistic -- interested in what religion means to individuals (and its role in societies) will find this a stimulating, rewarding, and fundamentally optimistic book."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"I'm a sophomore in college, an intern at my church and excited to engage further in the study of religion. (For the record, I love reading, and my poor review isn't rated on the sense that I just am biased against all required reading.)With all honesty, I haven't been able to read more than 5 pages at a time. On average, 2 out of 5 times I almost always fall asleep. Paden tries to sound like a remarkable author in his language, but only confuses the reader more. He lacks elaborating more on subjects of religions, and focuses simply (at least in my opinion) on bashing specific religions. Instead Paden ends by proposing more of a \\"co-exist\\" theory.Walking away having read it, I didn't learn anything helpful. I refuse to say that I've gotten anything out of this book, and unfortunately it's only one of the required readings from my professor. I can only hope the others aren't nearly as terrible."},{"Title":"Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion","review":"I was assigned this book for a Religious Studies Class, and while I found the subject matter insightful and well presented, the author got caught up in trying too hard to appear smart in his writing. I found myself trying to interpret too much of the writing (big words and rhetoric), instead of enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Driving by Moonlight: A Journey Through Love, War, and Infertility","review":"I live three miles from the Pentagon, less than an hour's walk on a sunny fall afternoon. Sixties liberal that I am though, I saw it only as a destination for peace marches. But when I woke up the morning of Sept. 12, 2001, with smoke still seeping through my open windows from the terrorist attack the day before, my perceptions had undergone a sea change. &quot;The military is there to protect us,&quot; it dawned on me, &quot;and someone's just blown a hole in that protection.&quot;With my former convictions in disarray, it's no wonder I was drawn to this memoir in which the author suffered a similar shock to her pacifist beliefs. &quot;Does being a pacifist mean...it's wrong even to defend yourself?&quot; she asks. &quot;On TV, I saw that huge plane magically pushing its way into and through a New York skyscraper, metamorphosing along the way into a blooming poppy of fire. I watched tiny, fragile human figures standing at those broken windows a hundred floors up, someone's daughter, someone's son, all peering down and hoping against hope, not knowing there was no hope. Every time I see them, recall them, I want to seize something, anything, on the other side of the world and smash the hell out of it. I know I won't be satisfied until I see whole towns on the other side of the world destroyed. I horrify myself. I want to run away from myself.&quot;Henderson does &quot;run away.&quot; Once she has hugged her Marine chaplain husband goodby, as he ships out for Afghanistan days after September 11, she sets off to drive across the country in a '78 Corvette with only her German shepherd to keep her company. But though she leaves the scenes of carnage behind, she can't escape from her churning emotions, her fear for her husband, or the contradictions that beset her mind. The conflict between her normal pacifism and her instinctual desire for vengeance is not the only discord in Henderson's life: She's a Quaker pacifist married to a Lutheran pastor and Marine chaplain. She parts ways with her husband as well on the subject of religious beliefs -- her growing rejection of the belief that Jesus was God incarnate. Most poignantly, her desire to have a baby increases with every tick of her biological clock, while her husband -- afraid he would follow in his father's footsteps and be an inadequate parent -- doesn't want children at all.While Driving by Moonlight is a &quot;road&quot; book, it is much more than that. The story of Henderson's trip is vivid, funny and at times harrowing (as she nearly becomes trapped in a sudden blizzard). The family, friends and strangers she encounters along her way are memorable characters, well portrayed in her hands. But her story is not just that of her journey from one coast to another, but of her journey through life. Fortunately for the reader, the author not only weaves her trip and her life complications together adroitly, but she seems utterly lacking in pretensions and leavens her serious themes with delicious humor. I couldn't stop laughing when she told how she and her dubious husband decided to renovate their only bathroom -- without the help of a plumber. (A perfect start to Sunday during the time the bathroom was ripped out was to pick up the paper from the doorstep, drive to the nearest museum and settle down in the still empty rest room.) Though I read mostly fiction, I found this memoir as engrossing as any novel.While I originally picked up the book because the author mirrored the reactions I'd had after September 11, I found myself becoming more engrossed in Henderson's life, in particular her struggle (sadly unsuccessful) to become pregnant, which meant fighting to convince her reluctant husband to agree to each round of infertility treatment, and finally to in vitro fertilization, or as Henderson describes it, &quot;a final Hail Mary roll of the dice.&quot;Henderson ends with as many contradictions as she started. Planning the trip &quot;gave me the illusion that I controlled my life,&quot; she writes, an illusion of which she was quickly disabused as weather closes the road in front of her. But the act of driving itself, immersed in the white noise of the Corvette's engine has become a form of &quot;centering prayer&quot; and she is learning to live -- as all of us must -- with uncertainty. Meanwhile she drives on. Darkness falls and her headlights show nothing but the side of the road. But tomorrow, &quot;the moon will slowly begin opening like an eye, widening to reflect the Light and illuminate the darkness before slowly closing again. Way opens, way closes, and then way opens again, circling around and around as I drive on, the moon and the starry patchwork of constellations all turning and tinkling in the solar wind.&quot;I felt enlightened and enriched for having read this beautifully written and honest account of another woman's struggle to come to terms with the contradictions in her life."},{"Title":"Driving by Moonlight: A Journey Through Love, War, and Infertility","review":"This beautifully written, funny, wrenching and ultimately heartening memoir of a road trip in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 is a rare find. Author Kristin Henderson certainly succeeds in bringing back that time of fear and confusion but what got me was her exploration of connections between the human urges to war and procreation. At the time her husband shipped out to Afghanistan, Henderson was struggling to come to terms with infertility--losing her dream of being a mother and the physical presence of her husband at the same time. Her road trip allowed her the time and solitude to sort through the pain and emotional confusion of all this while, as she says, giving her the illusion of forward motion. We are the lucky beneficiaries of this 'escape plan' as Henderson alternates her experiences on the road--often hooty, always interesting--with recollections of divisions in her self and her marriage over religion, and of the medical and emotional trials of fertility treatment. Reading this wonderful book, I sensed that Henderson, with her trusty dog Rosie at her side, would find the peace she was looking for and I was happy to be along for the vicarious ride."},{"Title":"Driving by Moonlight: A Journey Through Love, War, and Infertility","review":"The first time I read something written by Kristin was in the Washington Post Sunday Magazine almost a year ago. I was drawn in by the subject matter and stayed because I really liked how and what she wrote. Since then I've become a huge fan, even going so far as to send my father-in-law to one of her readings for an autographed copy of this book.I knew a bit about Kristen's personal history from her article in the Washington Post Sunday Magazine about her chaplain husband (available on her website at www.kristinhenderson.com) and this book tells us even more.I loved this book! Kristin takes (what I think are) enormous risks - opening up and telling the world about her relationships with her family, her struggles with infertility, Rosie and the Vette.Do yourself a favor and get then read this book! And get a copy for someone you love."},{"Title":"Driving by Moonlight: A Journey Through Love, War, and Infertility","review":"After September 11, 2001, Kristin Henderson's husband, a Lutheran minister and Marine chaplain, shipped out to Afghanistan. And Kristin, a pacifist Quaker, climbed into her Corvette with her German shepherd and embarked on a 10,000-mile journey through a country that seemed forever changed. This memoir details that cross-country journey; more importantly, it explores the author's simultaneous journey of self-discovery.Henderson deftly weaves together the strands of her road trip with those of her internal one. As she drives the highways and backroads of America and Canada, she sees signs everywhere of people's grief, shock, and anger over the terrorist attacks, and she reflects on her Quaker beliefs, questioning whether those beliefs can be reconciled with her thirst for vengeance. As she fears for her husband's safety and breathlessly awaits his too-infrequent e-mails, she recalls the strain placed on her marriage by the conflicts between her own religious questing and his rock-solid faith.Most memorably, she traces the couple's years-long struggle with infertility and the painful, heart-wrenching process of trying to get pregnant.This is Henderson's first published book, but you'd never know it from the eloquence of her writing and the complexity of emotion it conveys. She's often hilariously funny -- as when she compares religions to cars; or when she describes the renovation of her Washington, D.C., rowhouse's only bathroom; or when she tells of the eccentric characters encountered at a mountaintop lodge in Montana. But she can also bring a reader to tears with her discussion of a foreign-born teen who is assaulted for looking different; and, of course, her descriptions of infertility treatments and the psychological trauma that accompanies them.The author envies her dog Rosie's ability to live in the moment and accept whatever turns up next along the road. As a reader, I found myself envying Rosie as well, but for a different reason: I wished I could have been along on that journey, with so likeable and interesting a tour guide as Henderson at the wheel. Reading her book is the next best thing."},{"Title":"Driving by Moonlight: A Journey Through Love, War, and Infertility","review":"I sat down and read this book cover to cover. Though I have not had to go through a battle with infertility, this book was deeply meaningful to me. So many questions that I deal with daily as a wife, mother, and human being. Where does God fit into my life? What is this uncontrolable urge to have (or not to have!) children? Did I want them for the right reasons--and now that I have them, do I really want them? How does it make sense on a cosmic level for someone who wants a child more than anything and cannot have one while there are so many people who frankly should not have them have kids with ease? I really appreciated the author's honesty---she said so many things that few people would have the guts too, especially about marriage. Very thought provoking, comforting and unsettling at the same time. Well worth a read for anyone!"},{"Title":"KNOW YOUR BIBLE SERIES, set: Study Number 1 to Number 12; How Your Bible Grew Up; The Bible and the First World State; Writing Scripture Under Dictators; Refugees Who Wrote Scripture; The First Jewish Bible; Jewish Thinkers and Propagandists...","review":"Before the Methodists came up with \\"Disciple\\" bible study there was Roy L.

It spends very little explanation and no examples on difficult concepts and terminology, but elaborates liberally on simple concepts such as &quot;switch&quot;.

But this one, it just isn't the case. It's got everything you need to know about Perl in here, right down from the basics of variables and syntax up to things like debugging and the Perl compiler. A lot of this stuff I've never seen before - even in the Perl documentation, and there are some great tips on using Perl for different jobs. My favorite has to be how you can use the Perl compiler to help optimize and clean your code - not by compiling, but just by looking at some of the output it gives.

It opens in the winter of 1945/46 as Britain settles back into peacetime, though not without annoying rationing and shortages. Jenkins has come to his old university for research towards a biography on Robert Burton, but soon first himself involved in the launch of a new literary magazine with distinct leftist tones. Indeed, we return to a world of shady politics left behind in the early 1930s in THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD, the third novel of the sequence, and many of the characters from those days return. Widmerpool, his political career now taking off, also comes into the picture, and his continual defence of the Soviet Union makes him a more repulsive antagonist than ever.But beyond revisiting old friends, BOOKS DO FURNISH A ROOM introduces two new characters with very distinctive personalities. One is the novelist X. Trapnel, whose bohemianism mystifies his fellow characters and ultimately leads to his grisly ruin. The other character is Pamela Widmerpool. Though she appeared first in the previous novel, she was mostly a force of nature destroying the lives of numerous male characters offscreen. Here Jenkins talks with her on several occasions, revealing something of her as a person. As this volume was written at the end of the 1960s in a more frank era, Powell felt that his language could be a bit more coarse, and it is Pamela who utters all the profanity.The relationship between Widmerpool and his wife sometimes descends into mere soap opera, and the literary allusions, especially to Burton, get rather tiresome. So, this isn't among the best novels in the Dance. Still, I enjoyed this novel, especially the diary-like chronicles of life in a postwar literary magazine, and I look forward to continuing with the Dance."},{"Title":"Complete Concerti Grossi in Full Score","review":"I thought I was ordering the Handel Concerti Grossi but when it came it was Corelli!

Despite being convicted, the conviction being overturned, and retried with new charges added, Camm is currently seeking a third trial.Glatt does an excellent job of laying all out all facets of the case; from a flaw-filled investigation, to alleged unethical behavior on behalf of the prosecution, to the shameless shananigans pulled by the defense, Glatt details them all.While this is one more spouse who kills (an all too often story in today's society), this particular case is most interesting because of the many twists and the minscule evidence used to convict Camm.In closing, I'll take this opportunity to provide my opinion on Camm's guilt or innocence as other reviewers have...The evidence alone was not enough to convict, there was reasonable doubt. I believe the first jury convicted Camm on his adulterious lifestyle alone. It was a verdict that never should have been. But is Camm innocent? No, he is not. David Camm played a role in his wife and children's deaths; plain and simple. Whether he was the gunman or solictor, we may never really know; but of one he is guilty. He is not a wrongfully convicted man in the sense of being innocent, just possibly convicted of the wrong crime."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This is the first John Glatt book I read. I could get into the book and it was hard to put down at times, however, his style isn't what I am used too. Since I have always read Ann Rule I was just slightly disappointed with John's writing technique. The book was so straight forward that I think he missed the important crime investigation and court room information. It seemed to me that he doesn't get a whole lot of feedback from family, friends and investigators, as most crime authors do.The book is good and I've read one other John Glatt book, I just think he misses crucial information towards the stories when he writes these books.

Hope he will have more info of the current twist to update the later publishings of this book."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I think the author should have waited for the outcome of the second trial to finish and publish the book. For the most part, it is a good book. There were inconsistencies that were annoying. The author would refer to David Camm as a father of two, when he was actually a father of three. The author also wrote that when he and Kim were married, he was anxious to start a family and become a father. He did have a family started and he was already a father. His daughter, Whitney, seems to be brushed aside in the book.Personally, I don't believe David Camm killed his family. I can buy that he MAY have had his wife killed, but not his kids. Unfortunately, the judge in the first trial was one-sided and totally for the prosecution. I wasn't surprised that it was overturned. He didn't even follow the laws of the state with allowing some of the things he did.Camm was an adulterer and there is absolutely NO excuse for adultery. He was a lousy husband. I don't believe that he molested his daughter nor do I believe that he murdered his wife and children.Hire it done? Perhaps. It could have been better orchestrated."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, and once again the American Criminal Justice system even with all it's advances continues to frighten me. While I can not find one shred of goodness in the heart of David Camm, and while I abhore child molesters and think they should be put away for life, i find it horrifying that a simple accusation, adultery, and a life insurance policy which we all have can land me in jail for the rest of my life simply because I am the most obvious suspect. Even with advances in scientific evidence we still allow our opinion of people shape how the case in investigated, how the DA build his case, and how the jury reaches it's virdict, and even in the face of glaring evidence to the contrary how we will stand by that belief even if it makes us look completely stupid. From the magic bullet, Sam Shephards ruined life, and OJ's six minute clean up, prosecutors and the family of victums, and the american public refuse to admit that they could be wrong or that there senario doesn't fit. Yes Camm was a sucky father, who left the care of his children of his children to his wife and day care, but as i sit here typing this today, I am looking at the picture in the local paper of a day care worker who is charged with killing three children. Is it not possible that with all the activities these children were involved with that someone at one of these institution he was so willing to let his wife leave them with had someone was molesting his daughter? They saw her alot more than he did so who would have the most opportunity. Also why will police believe the testimony of a man who has a history of attacking women and taking their personal items, and has recently served jail time for armed robbery, and looks like serial killer in the making with his supposid peeking tom shoe stea ling foot fettish,when they probably wouldn't believe him in any other circumstance so they just rebuild their theory that it was conspirecy between this man and Camm which had more holes in it than swiss cheese and the idiotic public stupidly nods their heads and agree. When you hear hoof beats you think horses not Zebras. Unless I misread in government class you must be able to prove that a person comitted a crime beyond a reasonable doubt to convict them, not prove that they didn't do it beyond a resonable doubt to find them not guilty. and when the number of reasonable doubts number atleast 11 and counting you have to let a person go. 11 people can tell you this man was anywhere else but home and somehow he's in jail? And if for the sake aurgument if he did slip home unnoticed, the question then becomes why would he go home, how would he know that his wife suspected him of doing something to his daughter, where is the phone call, the email, the letter, that says \\"I know what you did and I\\"m telling\\". If you can't even provide that piece of evidence, then any one with half a brain would have some type of doubt that this man didn't do it.I don't like adulterous people, and i hate child molesters, and no one would call me a bleeding heart liberal, but what i do hate more is what has become of our criminal justice system, and it is not until most of us are on the other side of will we understand how we have let innuendo, and public opinion and not fact decide who goes to jail and who remain free. In the past decade with DNA evidence it has been proven that plenty of AFrican American men were convicted of rape often time with eye witnesses saying they were somewhere else by a biased system but even with all this scientific evidence that has been used to free people, we still refuse to use it and strength of character to say not guilty when the media tells us to say guilty. when you have juries, police, and prosecutors who are worried about pride, writing a tell all book, appearing on tv shows for money, rather than the fact, the defendent doesn't just suffer the victums do too. This has got to stop! And quick! But if all the prosecution needs is a bumb theory and proof that you have roving eye and other body parts you could end up in jail as well whether you did it or lots of us and people we love could end up in jail when we don't deserve to be."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"My book arrived ahead of the time stated and was in excellent condition.

No offense to the author who wrote this book, but this is sick. All the hell this family has been through and there is a book about the murders???? I am so appalled by this. I stumbled across this book by accident just now. I was looking up an article to send to a friend when I found the amazon.com search that came up. Another thing that disgusts me is that there is a picture of the family on the cover. Is this really needed? I went to school with his oldest daughter, and to see what she is going through is horrendous. I just hope that Camm and Boney both rot in hell for what they have done to their families, and the whole community. For those of you who believe Camm didn't have anything to do with it....how do you get high velocity blood spatter on you clothing if you weren't standing there witnessing it?

I wish all authors had email addresses so we readers could reach them with our comments and questions. In any case, this is another well-written true crime book by Glatt and it is terribly sad in this day of easy divorces that we have so many men resorting to this type of crime.

Glatt did an excellent job of research and story-telling in this non-fiction about an Indiana State trooper accused of killing his family. After reading the book, Glatt portrays David Camm as the sort of person you just love to hate. The man is an arrogant and adulterous, ladies man that is so self-centered you simply can't stand him. And for all I know, maybe that's the way he really is. It's just hard to imagine a father looking into the eyes of his small children, and then blowing them away with a gun. Glatt really did do a great job on this story, but the saga continues because Camm's first trial was over-turned and a new trial is expected to begin early in January of 2006 along with his suspected accomplice. So the reader really doesn't know the final outcome of what happened and who done it.

What could possibly have compelled this man, a former state trooper, to have committed these heinous murders?This book attempts to answer these questions in a methodical fashion, exploring the many facets of this killer's personality and sifting through the evidence presented at the trial. The book also follows the case through the unanimous reversal by the Indiana State Court of Appeals of Camm's trial convictions of the three murders. Even though the book contains some very interesting late breaking news regarding this sensational case, the final outcome of the retrial is not known by reading this book alone.As a prosecutor, I was not surprised at the reversal of Camm's trial convictions, as I had expected such a decision based upon how the trial had been conducted. The presiding judge had issued poor evidentiary rulings that were quite surprising, and the prosecutors did not distinguish themselves either with their handling of the case. What was surprising was the late breaking news, which initially seemed to throw into question the defendant's guilt in the matter. All I can say is thank goodness for Google, which allowed me to discover the final outcome of this sensational case."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"8086 Indiana State Trooper David Camm obviously planned to murder Ex Con Charles Boney and blame the murder on Boney!Much has happened since the book was published. Former Indiana State Police Officer David Cam won a reversal of the jury verdict finding him guilty of murdering his wife and two young children. Then at his second trial the jury convicted him again. The blockbuster turn of events is that a third jury convicted Charles Boney of the murder. This does not trouble me. Dual culpability is certainly believable.Notes about this murder:1. I read that convict Charles Boney ( now convicted for the murder of David Camm's wife and two children) said that Former Indiana State Police Officer David Camm (convicted twice for these same murders) invited Boney to his house under the pretext of buying another gun. Boney says that (unbeknownst to Boney) Camm had planned to do the murders while Boney was there. Boney said that Camm tried to shoot Boney also but the gun misfired. The gun misfiring seems very unlikely. Had Camm been successful he would likely have succeeded. Boney would have been at the scene - dead. Camm would not have needed his basketball alibi.

It could definitely be written."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"If you are a True Crime fan, you should enjoy this book. It is well researched and well written. The story is interesting. While the crime itself is rather ordinary, the stories behind the crime are what I found gripping. I also recommend \\"And Never Leave Me,\\" by this same author.I finished reading \\"One Deadly Night\\" several months ago and have since seen a prime-time news documentary about this case. It is rather disturbing that the \\"Bones\\" sweatshirt that was found at the crime scene was not fully pursued as a viable piece of evidence by the prosecuting attorney at the time of the initial trial. Do I believe David Camm murdered his wife and two children? I am not certain to this day what I think. It seems most unlikely that Charles Boney, who had no association to any of the victims, would have chosen the Camm house (at random) and then killed 3 innocent people for no discernable reason. These murders did not personally benefit Charles Boney in any way. I think it is likely that Boney had some sort of relationship with David Camm and was either asked by Camm to commit the murders or was there with Camm when he committed the murders. Although Charles Boney did not present as insecere or untruthful during the interview I watched, I am equally certain he can be charming when he needs to be and has the capacity to appear sincere even when he is not. He is a two-bit career criminal with a long history of conning others.What I am certain of is this... I have not one shred of sympathy for David Camm. This may be an evil thought, but I really do not care if Camm was wrongfully convicted or spends the remainder of his life in prison. He was not a good husband, a good father, or a good man! He was supremely selfish and did whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. His wife did EVERYTHING for those two children and did EVERYTHING for David Camm to assure that he had a restful, stable home environment waiting for him. His wife took the children to school, worked full time, picked the children up from school, and escorted the children to all extracirricular activities. What did David Camm do? He chose to play basketball and pursue other women, as if he had no responsibilities at home! Perhaps he got what he deserved... at least morally. As I said, I really don't care what happens to David Camm."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Before I get into the specifics of the book, allow me to say that John Glatt is a phenomenal author (I have read nearly all his works now) and a class act (a fellow New Yorker who I know personally). All of his publications have been well written, straight forward and a presentation of all the facts. I not only recommend this book, but his other books as well (Internet Slavemaster is my personal favorite).The David Camm story is truly a winding tale of deception, accusation, and murder. Although Mr. Camm is no angel, as the book first introduces his escapades with numerous women while married and his abuse of power as a State Trooper, he is convicted of triple murder with little to no evidence. Although the sentence has been overturned, Mr. Camm faces retrial on the charges with a co-defendant.At the time of the murders, Mr. Camm claims he was playing basketball with 14 other people, none of whom saw him leave the courts during the entire time. Moreover, one must remember that Mr. Camm is a police officer and knows how an investigation of a crime scene is handled. Thus, it is hard for me to believe that he would shoot his family at much a close range to splatter blood on his clothing. Finally, Camm was willing on numerous occasions to take a polygraph test, although his was never given one.Although I am not convinced that Mr. Camm did not have any involvement in the crime or even conspire to have his wife killed, I do not feel that he committed the crime or intended to have his children executed in such a vicious style. This case seems to be a personal attack by the State Troopers of Indiana and the District Attorney of Indiana on an ex cop who was constantly harrassing a female officer, bragging about his increase in salary since quitting the force, and pointing fingers at certain hierarchy for their own abuse of the system.Regardless of my opinion, this book sparks great debate and interest in the case. I have even read numerous internet articles, some in support of Mr. Camm and others calling him a cold blooder killer who deserves the death sentence.

(There are no crimes attached to those personal shortcomings!). One evening in September 2000, Camm's wife and two children were murdered in the garage of their New Albany, Indiana home. The setting is a Louisville suburb, not a remote town in the cornfields. ODN is told mostly from a prosecutorial viewpoint. The investigating State Police fingered DC as the perp from the very outset. Virtually no effort was made, at least within the pages of ODN, to identify another suspect or accomplice. This reader had the suspicion that Camm made enemies among his fellow troopers while still in uniform and was receiving some serious payback. It is almost meaningless that that DC is found guilty of murder only to have that conviction overturned. What happened next? My amazon friends have 2 choices in securing an answer: 1) Do a web search on David Camm to be bought up to date as of March 7, 2006. 2) Wait until the case has COMPLETELY wound its' way through the legal system. Perhaps then author Glatt will produce a comprehensive-and FINAL! - story on the events of that \\"deadly Indiana night\\" of September 2000. In that forthcoming final version, one hopes the author will shed light on the urgency to rush a garden variety, uncompelling murder case into print. Judging by the reprint history ODN is selling well but promoting an unresolved case is plainly and simply misleading. For the moment, ODN is not recommended to my amazon friends."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book a lot because this event actually took place in the area that I am from. It details the events that happened. I wanted to attend the trial but could not because I had to work, so it gives a lot of insight into what happened before, during and after."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Interesting and very readable. John's books are a good mixture of forensic investigation and human nature study. I always enjoy his books."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Sad story with so many still unanswered questions. Hopefully justice will prevail and the horrible person who done this will be prosecuted."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't so outdated. This book was written after David Camm's first trial, and he is now getting ready for his third trial. This man has been extremely lucky in my opinion to have two convictions over-turned due to so called prejudicial evidence admitted at his first two trials. First his numerous affairs, and then the allegation that he molested his young daughter. Unfortunately for the tax payers, the real evidence for his guilt, the high velocity blood spatter on his shirt has never changed, and I expect another guilty verdict for Camm."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"i'm sure he killed his family and i can't understand why he keeps grtting more trails he should b dead but bk did arrive on r before time"},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Oddly enough I first read the David Brame story which in so many ways is sadly similar to the Dave Camm story. However, as Kim Camm's father wondered aloud how come David Camm didn't just turn the gun on himself before he shot his two young children? If only that would have been the case. I bought the book having been peripherally aware of the story from TV Docs...I cannot help but see a similarity between the Fred and Sara Tokars story from years back. Why is it so unfathomable that David Camm hired Charles Boney either to do the killing himself as a hitman or he asked him to get a \\"clean gun\\" as was alluded to by police? I guess I could gun my husband and son down in our driveway and place a sweatshirt I found at my local YMCA with Sally Doe's DNA on it and get exonerated? Or at least get three trials? How is David Camm's womanizing while married with no less than 16 women not admissible in a trial? Are you saying that sex has never been a driving force behind a murder? What about his wealthy wife's over $600,000 in life insurance? This case has touched a nerve to say the least. I will be tuned in to his trial news in the upcoming year for sure. And yes, this book was pretty good but definitely needs to be updated several times over. Get it at your library or used book store unless an addendum is added."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This book seems to want you make a decision on either guilty or not guilty. It is a story of what happens when a person gets power and uses it to their own advantage. The court room part is a bit monotonous and i found to much focus on the lawyers and not enough on the victims family. In the end it is a true tragedy and a loss of two beautiful children , and a loving mother. They deserved better."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I could not put this down. It is unnerving the twists and turns of this real case in Indiana and on some level, it looks like the suspect/husband (of course) has an almost perfect alibis. But who else could have done it? Who else would have wanted to do it?What this case really shows is how much depends on the justice system. I mean, how much depends on who the prosecutors were, how well they handled the case which was tricky to begin with. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but the case is still (2008) in appeal mode primarily on procedural issues.To me, a very interesting question is to what degree should the husband be considered the suspect when there just are not any reasons for anyone else to have committed the crime. Obviously, that's not the whole issue in this very complex case which seems so unlikely that you think it's a script for a movie.A great page turner and you will probably find yourself taking sides as the story progresses. One of the things that we've seen in Chicago, which I think casts a lot of light on this Indiana case, is how much evidence or things that would cause problems for the husband/defendant can get completely swept under the rug when the suspect is himself a longtime cop. Things are not what they seem...especially when a man in blue is accused of murdering his wife. Very troubling as well as intriguing."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This is a great true crime book. John Glatt is an excellent author. He did a lot of research to make such a great read!"},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"The update on the Camm murder Trial, David Camm was found guilty on 3 counts of murder, in the deaths of his wife and 2 children, the jury recommended life in prison, without a possibility of parole.Charles Boney was tried and convicted for the 3 murders also, and sentenced to 225 years in prison.I know the parents of Kim Camm. This is a great justice for their family. The book, as I was told by one of Kim's aunt's, is more toward the Camm family than toward the Renn family."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"While the story line in this book is compelling, the syntax and excessive overuse of the word \\"as\\" is annoying and breaks the continuity of the story.In many places, Glatt repeats the same statements, often within only one or two pages. Additionally, the author has a poor grasp of punctuation rules. His inability to use commas appropriately negatively affects the flow of the story. The book could have used the assistance of a good editor.The story, about a man accused of murdering his wife and children, is gripping. The author does a fairly decent job of writing objectively and keeping the reader interested in the outcome--in spite of the poor writing style.For those who are able to ignore the grammar (incorrect use of plurals and possessives) and the constant use of \\"as,\\" the book will probably be a satisfying read.For those who are aware of the rules of grammar: buy a different author's account. Being an editor, this book virtually drove me insane."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. I AM STILL LEFT WITH A ?

I'm not sure who killed the Camm family, but I'm inclined to say the prosecution got the right man in jail, although the Epilogue gave some surprising news. It's hard to say if Davis Camm killed his family or not? To be fair, I have to say I'm torn. There are times I really believed he did it, and then there are times I'm not 100% sure. This is definitely a good read! If you love true crime stories, this novel will definitely keep you engaged. You be the Judge?"},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"John Glatt tells the story very well and it is a book hard to put down. How can 2 people who are considered \\"blood splatter experts\\" have such opposite opinions on a blood splatter. One of them is wrong. And why are state troopers not fired or arrested for having sex with women they pull over for traffic violations. If you enjoy true crime stories, you will like this one."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"John Glatt is already writing about the McGuire Case in New Jersey. I read a previous book of his entitled Cries in the Desert. This book portrays David Camm, who was a policeman or state trooper in Indiana in a negative light. Camm had affairs with women that he pulled off the road, he stalked a few, and had blatant affairs unknown to his faithful, devoted wife, Kim, and the mother of his two children, Bradley and Jill. One Deadly Night, Camm is alleged to have killed his wife and two kids in the garage with a shotgun. The portrait painted here of Camm and his family life was not all roses. He is a self-centered, egotistical, self-obsessed human being. I would not be surprised that he is guilty of the crimes so that he would avoid a disastrous divorce with Kim and the kids and the allegations of child sexual abuse against Jill. It's a family tragedy only duplicated by the fact that it was not a stranger but a father and husband who made matters worse. I would find it hard to believe he didn't do it."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Well, did he or didn't he? What was the killer's motive? This has to be one of the strangest books I have ever read. While David was a big loser, does it make him a killer? Would a man who went after anything in a skirt sexually molest his own daughter? Was his wife so naieve that she didn't see any signs? We know she wasn't eager to see that he was still cheating. I believe, he hired the other guy to kill his family because he wanted to be free of them without the guilt of leaving and having to deal with his parents."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This was such a well written story I just could not put it down. David Camm was a selfish sick moron who could not appreciate the goodness of his life and what a wonderful wife he had who was there for him and did everthing. She was a great woman who praised him and took such great care of the family and he goes and kills her. The verdict came in and he is guilty as charged!"},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I also bought this book after seeing a dateline special on this case. David Camm was a lucky narcissist who wanted more. Unfortunately, much more happened with this case after the book was written. After looking up more information on the internet, my personal theory is that Mr. Boney was there for a very simple reason; not only was David Camm going to free himself from a marriage and child support obligations, he was going to emerge a hero by killing the man (Boney) that he discovered in his garage. I believe I saw an interview with Boney in which he states \\"he pointed the gun at me\\". I hope the terror in his children's eyes haunt him until his last breath."},{"Title":"One Deadly Night (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I enjoyed reading Glatt's account of this homicide. Very well written and researched, it is another written rendition of someone's hormones and conscience going out of whack."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"The Neverending Story has always been one of my favorite books since I was young, and was really excited to read something else by Michael Ende. However, I found the book indredibly disappointing in comparison to the richness of Ende's imagination and character development in the Neverending Story. The plot falls flat, the conversation's boring and there's an overwhelming myopic sense of Christian self-righteousness that I found terribly disturbing. Maybe it's just the translation, but it doesn't feel like the same writer could've possibly done this at all."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],z={key:0},M={key:1};function x(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",P,[(e(!0),t(m,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),y(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",z,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(D,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-adf08e74"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/30.md","filePath":"people/30.md"}'),q={name:"people/30.md"},C=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(N)]))}});export{B as __pageData,C as default};
